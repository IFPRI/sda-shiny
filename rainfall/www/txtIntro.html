<h4>About CRU-TS 3.22</h4>
<p>Showing long-term gridded monthly
precipitation and drought index time series for sub-Saharan Africa summarized across
districts (level-2 administrative boundaries based on <a
href='http://www.fao.org/geonetwork/srv/en/metadata.show?id=12691'>FAO GAUL
2008</a>. The 1901-2013 series are available through the University of East Anglia <a
href='http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/cru_ts_3.22'>Climate Research Unit</a>
(version CRU-TS 3.22). The 0.5Â° latitude/longitude gridded dataset is interpolated
from monthly observations at meteorological stations across the world.</p>

<h4>Palmer Drought Severity Index</h4>
<p>The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), devised in
1965, is the first drought indicator to assess moisture status comprehensively. It
uses temperature and precipitation data to calculate water supply and demand,
incorporates soil moisture, and is considered most effective for unirrigated
cropland. It primarily reflects long-term drought and has been used extensively to
initiate drought relief.</p> <p>The PDSI series used here (1850-2012 self-calibrated
PDSI with Penman-Monteith PE) is available through the <a
href='http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/catalog/climind/pdsi.html'>Climate Analysis
Section</a> of the National Center for Atmospheric Research.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>To start, select a series and a country from the left and click
<strong>Show Series</strong>. Wait a few seconds for the interactive graph and map to
render. You can mouse over and click districts on the map to view additional
details.</p> <p>District means, seasonality-adjusted means (trend), and standard
deviations may be downloaded in CSV or STATA formats. The 1960-2013 rasters for each
country may also be downloaded in GeoTiff, ASCII Raster, and netCDF formats for use in
a desktop GIS.</p>
