### Getting Started

To start, select a series and a country from the left and click **Show Series**. Wait a few seconds for the interactive graph and map to render. You can mouse over and click districts on the map to view additional details.

District means, annual means, seasonality-adjusted means (trend), and standard deviations may be downloaded in CSV or STATA formats. The 1960-2013 rasters for each country may also be downloadedin GeoTiff, ASCII Raster, and netCDF formats for use in a desktop GIS.

### About CRU-TS 3.22

Showing long-term gridded monthly precipitation and near-surface temperature time series for sub-Saharan Africa summarized across districts (level-2 administrative boundaries based on a [FAO GAUL 2014](http://www.fao.org/geonetwork/srv/en/metadata.show?id=12691). The 1901-2013 series are available through the University of East Anglia [Climate Research Unit](http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/cru_ts_3.22) (version CRU-TS 3.22). The 0.5Â° latitude/longitude gridded dataset is interpolated from monthly observations at meteorological stations across the world.

### Palmer Drought Severity Index

The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), devised in 1965, is the first drought indicator to assess moisture status comprehensively. It uses temperature and precipitation data to calculate water supply and demand, incorporates soil moisture, and is considered most effective for unirrigated cropland. It primarily reflects long-term drought and has been used extensively to initiate drought relief.

The PDSI series used here (1850-2012 self-calibrated PDSI with Penman-Monteith PE) is available through the [Climate Analysis Section](http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/catalog/climind/pdsi.html) of the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
