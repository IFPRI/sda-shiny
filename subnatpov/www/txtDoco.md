## Definitions

#### Poverty headcount ratio

It is the most commonly used measure of poverty. It measures the share of the population falling below a defined poverty line, usually corresponding to 1.25, 2 or 2.5 USD of income per day.

#### Poverty gap and severity

The poverty gap index captures the depth of poverty (how far are the individuals from the poverty line), providing a more complete perspective with respect to the headcount ratio. The headcount ratio ignores the depth of poverty since someone living below the poverty line and becoming even poorer would leave the headcount value unchanged. The poverty severity index aims at refining the measure even more by taking into account the inequality among the poor. The poverty gap index is computed as following:

$$ PG=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^{q}(\frac{pl-y_i}{pl}) $$

Where $N$ is the total population, $q$ is the number of poor, $pl$ is the poverty line and $y_i$ is the income of each person living below the poverty line. The poverty severity index takes the square of the poverty gap index:

$$ PS=PG^2 $$

#### Gini coefficient

The Gini coefficient measures inequality within a society by looking at the income distribution across its members. It can take values from 0 (perfect equality, everyone owns the same) to 100 (perfect inequality, one person possesses everything and all the others nothing). Most of the countries fall in the range between 25 and 55.
