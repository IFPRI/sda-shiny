In spite of rapid economic growth the number of impoverished people has doubled in sub-Saharan Africa since the early 1980's. In Liberia nearly 60% of the population lives on less than US$ 2/day. In the Central African Republic the figure is 75%. By contrast, in North Africa, only 23% of people live on less than US$ 2/day. The Poor account for almost 61% of Africa's population and hold 36.5% of Africa's total income. In addition to being one of the poorest regions in the world, Africa is also the worldâ€™s second most inequitable after Latin America. Inequalities have not diminished over time. In 2010, six out of the ten most unequal countries worldwide were in Sub-Saharan.

HarvestChoice's sub-national poverty maps for sub-Saharan Africa are part of a larger effort to better quantify and locate vulnerable communities around the world, and to better guide pro-poor policies and investments. Complementary estimates are available from NASA/Columbia University [SEDAC](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/povmap) and from the [WorldPop](http://www.worldpop.org.uk/) project at the University of Southampton.
