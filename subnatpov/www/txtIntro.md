### About


This application presents key income and poverty indicators at the highest geographic resolution currently available from official sources (data points for **495 sub-national administrative units** across sub-Saharan Africa are available). These estimates are derived from nationally representative household surveys for 26 countries, and from the World Bank [Povcalnet](http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/) for an additional 21 countries where only national estimates are available.

All indicators have been standardized to 2005 [purchasing power parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity) (PPP) monetary terms to ensure results are comparable across countries and regions, but from **varying time periods**.

Trends and disparities may be further explored here across countries, provinces, and districts (for a few countries where estimates are statistically significant across districts). To explore another **800 spatially referenced indicators for sub-Saharan Africa**, visit [HarvestChoice Mappr](http://apps.harvestchoice.org/mappr).
