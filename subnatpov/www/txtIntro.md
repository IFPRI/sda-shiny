### About

This application presents key income and poverty indicators at the highest geographic resolution currently available from official sources (data points for **495 sub-national administrative units** across sub-Saharan Africa are available). These estimates are derived from nationally representative household surveys for 26 countries, and from the World Bank [Povcalnet](http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/) for an additional 21 countries where only national estimates are available.

All indicators have been standardized to 2005 [purchasing power parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity) (PPP) monetary terms to ensure results are comparable across countries and regions, but from **varying time periods**.

In spite of rapid economic growth the number of impoverished people has doubled in sub-Saharan Africa since the early 1980's. In Liberia nearly 60% of the population lives on less than US$ 2/day. In the Central African Republic the figure is 75%. By contrast, in North Africa, only 23% of people live on less than US$ 2/day. The Poor account for almost 61% of Africa's population and hold 36.5% of Africa's total income. In addition to being one of the poorest regions in the world, Africa is also the worldâ€™s second most inequitable after Latin America. Inequalities have not diminished over time. In 2010, six out of the ten most unequal countries worldwide were in Sub-Saharan.

Trends and disparities may be further explored here across countries, provinces, and districts (for a few countries where estimates are statistically significant at this resolution). 

HarvestChoice's sub-national poverty maps for sub-Saharan Africa are part of a larger effort to better quantify and locate vulnerable communities around the world, and to better guide pro-poor policies and investments. Complementary estimates are available from NASA/Columbia University [SEDAC](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/povmap) and from the [WorldPop](http://www.worldpop.org.uk/) project at the University of Southampton.
