We present key income and poverty indicators at the highest geographic resolution currently available from official sources. All indicators have been standardized to 2005 [purchasing power parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity) (PPP) monetary terms to ensure results are comparable across countries and regions, albeit from different time periods. 

In spite of rapid economic growth the number of impoverished people has doubled in sub-Saharan Africa since the early 1980's. In Liberia nearly 60% of the population lives on less than US$ 2/day. In the Central African Republic the figure is 50%. By contrast, in North Africa, only 23% of people live on less than US$ 2/day. The Poor account for almost 61% of Africa's population and hold 36.5% of Africa's total income. In addition to being one of the poorest regions in the world, Africa is also the worldâ€™s second most inequitable after Latin America. Inequalities have not diminished over time. In 2010, six out of the ten most unequal countries worldwide were in Sub-Saharan. 

There are significant geographic disparities between urban and rural areas where the poor are concentrated. In Mozambique, the mean share of the lowest 20% of the population is 5.2% of total income while the top 20% has a share of 51.5%. A larger percentage of the population is poor in rural areas (56.9%), compared to urban areas (49.6%). 

Trends and disparities may be further explored here across countries, provinces, and districts (for a few countries where estimates are statistically significant at this resolution). 

HarvestChoice's sub-national poverty maps for sub-Saharan Africa are part of a larger effort to better quantify and locate vulnerable communities around the world, and to better guide pro-poor policies and investments. Complementary estimates are available from NASA/Columbia University [SEDAC](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/povmap) and from the [WorldPop](http://www.worldpop.org.uk/) project at the University of Southampton.
