A total of 46 irrigation events were evaluated during the year 2009, whereas only a total of 8 irrigation events (at 3 sites) were evaluated during the year 2010. Most of the selected fields have slopes greater than 0.005; hence, the average runoff volume from these fields was 39% of the total volume of water applied to the fields, indicating problems with selection of appropriate furrow flow rates under the given set of field conditions. For several fields, the seasonal volume of water applied was significantly different than the irrigation norms specified for the site. Though some of the farmers followed the irrigation advisory service on when to irrigate, there was a large mismatch between the volume of water applied and the volume of water deficit within the crop root zone. Reliability, in terms of magnitude and duration of flow rate received at the fields, was a major issue at all the sites. Considerable fluctuations were observed in the flow rates received at all the field sites during each irrigation event. In addition, the average flow rate received at the field sites varied considerably between irrigation events making it difficult for farmers to manage irrigation water. Farmers that had high watertable (less than 100 cm from the ground surface) still applied large volumes of water, resulting in low application efficiency. Several recommendations for improving the performance of furrow irrigation systems in Uzbekistan are provided. "

This paper examines the varied actors and agendas within irrigation bureaucracies, highlighting the dichotomy between “hydraulic missions” on the one hand and direct service provision to farmers on the other. To increase the significance of future reform, bureaucracies must be considered as explicit actors, and reform efforts should derive from better understanding of the farmer–agency interface. "

Field research has identified that gendered vulnerability to climate change is intricately connected to local and macro level political economic processes. Rather than being a single driver of change, climate is one among several stresses on agriculture, alongside a broader set of non-climatic processes. While these pressures are linked to large scale political–economic processes, the response on the ground is mediated by the local level relations of class and caste, creating stratified patterns of vulnerability. The primary form of gendered vulnerability in the context of agrarian stress emerges from male out-migration, which has affected the distribution of labour and resources. While migration occurs amongst all socio-economic groups, women from marginal farmer and tenant households are most vulnerable. While the causes of migration are only indirectly associated with climate change, migration itself is rendering women who are left behind from marginal households, more vulnerable to ecological shocks such as droughts due to the sporadic flow of income and their reduced capacity for investment in off-farm activities. It is clear that policies and initiatives to address climate change in stratified social formations such as the Eastern Gangetic Plains, will be ineffective without addressing the deeper structural intersections between class, caste and gender.

Since the winter of 1992–93, the operational regime of the upstream Toktogul reservoir on the Naryn river – the main tributary of the Syrdarya – has shifted from irrigation to hydropower generation mode. This significantly increased winter flow and reduced summer flow downstream of the reservoir. Consequently, excessive winter flow is diverted to the saline depression called Arnasai, while water for summer irrigation is lacking. This study suggests to store the excessive winter flows temporarily in the upstream aquifers of the Fergana valley and to use it subsequently for irrigation in summer. It is estimated that groundwater development for irrigation could be practiced on one-third of the irrigated land of the valley, and conjunctive use of groundwater and canal water on another third; the rest will remain under canal irrigation. This strategy will lower the groundwater table and create aquifer capacity for temporal storage of excessive water—“water banking”. This use of the term is only one of many concepts to which “water banking” or “groundwater banking” is applied. In this paper, the term is applied for temporary storing of river flow in subsurface aquifers. Pilot modeling studies for the Sokh aquifer – one of the 18 aquifers of the Fergana valley – supported that this strategy is a feasible solution for the upstream–downstream issues in the Syrdarya river basin. Field studies of water banking are required to determine the scale of adoption of the proposed strategy for each aquifer of the Fergana valley. "

Wastewater irrigated agriculture provides direct benefits for the livelihoods and food security of many smallholder farmers. A rapidly urbanizing peri-urban micro-watershed (270 ha) in Hyderabad was assessed over a 10-year period from 2000 to 2010 for changes in land use and associated farming practices, farmer perceptions, socio-economic evaluation, land-use suitability for agriculture and challenges in potential irrigated area development towards wastewater use. This integrated approach showed that the change in the total irrigated area was marginal over the decade, whereas the built-up area within the watershed boundaries doubled and there was a distinct shift in cropping patterns from paddy rice to paragrass and leafy vegetables. Local irrigation supplies were sourced mainly from canal supplies, which accounted for three-quarters of the water used and was largely derived from wastewater. The remainder was groundwater from shallow hard-rock aquifers. Farmer perception was that the high nutrient content of the wastewater was of value, although they were also interested to pay modest amounts for additional pre-treatment. The shift in land use towards paragrass and leafy vegetables was attributed to increased profitability due to the high urban demand. The unutilised scrubland within the watershed has the potential for irrigation development, but the major constraints appear to be unavailability of labour and high land values rather than water availability. The study provides evidence to support the view that the opportunistic use of wastewater and irrigation practices, in general, will continue even under highly evolving peri-urban conditions, to meet the livelihood needs of the poor driven by market demands, as urban sprawl expands into cultivable rural hinterlands. Policy support is needed for enhanced recognition of wastewater for agriculture, with flow-on benefits including improved public health and protection of ecosystem services. "

Monteith’s model is used for the calculation of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), the Carnegie Institution Stanford model is used for determining the light use efficiency, and the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) is used to describe the spatio-temporal variability in land wetness conditions. The new model requires a crop identification map and some standard meteorological measurements as inputs. The conversion of above ground dry biomass into crop yield has been calibrated through harvest indices and the values obtained are compared with the international literature. The computations were executed in a \{GIS\} environment using 20 satellite measurements of the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) to cover an annual crop rotation cycle. The validation with district data revealed a root mean square error of 525, 616, 551 and 13,484 kg ha−1 for wheat, rice, cotton and sugarcane yield, respectively. The model performs satisfactorily for wheat, rice and sugarcane, and poorly for cotton. It is expected that the accuracy of the model applied to 1.1 km pixels decreases with the increasing number of crops occurring within a given pixel. Although \{AVHRR\} is basically too coarse a resolution for field scale crop yield estimations, the results provides yield predictions to policy makers in Pakistan with a spatial detail that is better than the traditional district level data. The gaps between the average and the maximum yield are 1075 and 1246 kg ha−1 for wheat and rice, respectively. Future work should rely on the integration of high and low resolution images to estimate field scale crop yields. "

abstract = "Abstract Historically, flooding is the most common environmental hazard worldwide, and also one of the most threatening to communities. Hydrological modeling of large river catchments has become a challenging task for water resources engineers due to the complexity of collecting and handling both spatial and nonspatial data, such as rainfall, gauge-discharge data, and topographic and hydraulic parameters. The Gash is a transboundary river which originates from the Eritrean Highlands and Ethiopian Plateau, and ends up in Sudan. It is unique in its discharge flows with torrential rain between Jul. and Oct., while being dry for the rest of the year. Despite this characteristic, the river is the main source of water for domestic and agricultural use in Kassala City, Sudan. In this chapter, we briefly present the potential application of satellite-based rainfall estimates, and develop a flood forecasting model for the Gash River Basin, Sudan, through a distributed modeling approach using remote sensing data. The approach includes rainfall-runoff modeling, hydrodynamic flow routing, and calibration and validation of the model with field discharge data. The study area is divided into 25 subbasins to improve model accuracy. To generate relevant parameters for modeling, GlobCover land cover data (1000 m), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) at 90 m, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) soil grid data using freely available datasets were used for the Gash River in Eastern Sudan. Based on several studies in Eastern Africa on the choice of satellite-based rainfall estimates, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) was used to represent the actual rainfall pattern and intensity of the basin. Model simulations were carried out using the HEC-HMS model. From 6 years (2007–12) of available discharge data for five stations, the period 2008–11 was considered for calibration with 2008 as the warming-up period, and data from 2007 and 2012 were used for validation. The model was tested during the 2013 floods at real-time, 3-h intervals. The accuracy of the estimated peak flood discharge and lag time was found to be good with reference to field observation data. Flood forecasting lead time is increased by 12 h compared to conventional methods of forecasting. "

Ponds, the small reservoirs ubiquitous in the area, are hypothesized to have been instrumental in this. Ponds are recharged by a combination of return flows from irrigation and runoff from catchment areas within the irrigated perimeter. They provide a flexible, local source of irrigation water to farmers. This paper assesses the storage capacity and some key hydrological properties of ponds in a major canal command within ZIS. Using remote sensing data (Landsat and IKONOS) and an area–volume relationship based on a field survey, we obtained an overall pond storage capacity of 96 mm (per unit irrigated area). A comparative analysis between 1978 and 2001 reveals that part of this capacity results from a very significant development of ponds (particularly in the smaller range of sizes) in the time interval, probably as a response to rapidly declining canal supplies. We developed a high-resolution digital elevation model from 1:10,000 topographic maps to support a GIS-based hydrological analysis. Pond catchments were delineated and found to extensively overlap, forming hydrological cascades of up to 15 units. In a 76-km2 area within the irrigation system, we found an average of close to five ‘connected’ ponds downstream of each irrigated pixel. This high level of connectivity provides opportunities for multiple reuses of water as it flows along toposequences. A fundamental implication is that field ‘losses’ such as seepage and percolation do not necessarily represent losses at a larger scale. Such scale effects need to be adequately taken into account to avoid making wrong assumptions about water-saving interventions in irrigation. "

As dam supplies have been diverted to higher-valued uses (hydropower, cities and industry), farmers have responded by constructing small storages within their fields. These farm ponds have given them sufficient flexibility in water supply to practice varying forms of alternate wetting and drying irrigation for rice without compromising yields and incomes. Ponds are recharged by a combination of return flows from irrigation and runoff from catchment areas within the irrigated perimeter. Various scenarios of water supply incorporating the main reservoir, in-system reservoirs, farm ponds and irrigation practices were simulated using the \{OASIS\} model. \{OASIS\} integrates surface and groundwater flows, and contains a crop growth module to aggregate the impacts of different water management regimes. The modelling and sensitivity analysis show that further reductions in main reservoir supplies will have a negative effect on rice production in dry and average years, and that ponds have played a crucial role in adapting agriculture to reduced canal supplies. The flexibility allowed by the ponds has resulted in increased water productivity, except in high rainfall years, but net depletion has not decreased, as local supplies have substituted for water from the main reservoir. The study demonstrates the importance of properly accounting for return flows and the necessity to understand crop production in relation to the actual depletion of water (as evapotranspiration) within an irrigation system.

Informal pump irrigation services markets have played an important role in providing access to irrigation to millions of small and marginal farmers and had positive equity, efficiency and sustainable impacts in water-abundant regions such as West Bengal. Quite predictably, in such pump lift-based economy, fortunes of energy and irrigation sectors are closely entwined. This has often been called the ‘energy-irrigation’ nexus. There are two major sources of energy for pumping groundwater, viz. electricity and diesel. Most of the current discourse in the field has looked only at the ‘electricity-irrigation’ nexus to the exclusion of the ‘diesel-irrigation nexus’. This paper looks at both these aspects. In doing so, it makes two propositions. First, high flat-rate electricity tariff encourages development of water markets whereby the water buyers—who are mostly small and marginal farmers—benefit through access to irrigation. Second, low rate of rural electrification has forced majority of farmers to depend on diesel for groundwater pumping and the steep increase in diesel prices over the last few years has resulted in economic scarcity of groundwater. This in turn has had serious negative impacts on crop production and farm incomes. Using primary field data from West Bengal, India, this paper makes a case for rapid rural electrification and continuation of high flat-rate tariff, which would in turn support developed groundwater markets and provide access to irrigation to the poor and marginal farmers.

A multitemporal analysis was conducted, based on a mega file of 294 wavebands, made from 42 \{MODIS\} images each of 7 bands. Complementary field data were gathered from 196 locations. The study began with the development of two cloud removal algorithms (CRAs) for \{MODIS\} 7-band reflectivity data, named: (a) blue-band minimum reflectivity threshold and (b) visible-band minimum reflectivity threshold. A series of innovative methods and approaches were introduced to analyze time-series \{MODIS\} data and consisted of: (a) brightness-greenness-wetness (BGW) RED-NIR 2-dimensional feature space (2-d FS) plots for each of the 42 dates, (b) end-member (spectral angle) analysis using RED-NIR single date (RN-SD) plots, (c) combining several RN-SDs in a single plot to develop RED-NIR multidate (RN-MDs) plots in order to help track changes in magnitude and direction of spectral classes in 2-d FS, (d) introduction of a unique concept of space-time spiral curves (ST-SCs) to continuously track class dynamics over time and space and to determine class separability at various time periods within and across seasons, and (e) to establish unique class signatures based on \{NDVI\} (CS-NDVI) and/or multiband reflectivity (CS-MBR), for each class, and demonstrate their intra- and inter-seasonal and intra- and inter-year characteristics. The results from these techniques and methods enabled us to gather precise information on onset-peak-senescence-duration of each irrigated and rainfed classes. The resulting 29 land use/land cover (LULC) map consisted of 6 unique irrigated area classes in the total study area of 133,021,156 ha within the Ganges and Indus basins. Of this, the net irrigated area was estimated as 33.08 million hectares—26.6% by canals and 73.4z5 by groundwater. Of the 33.08 Mha, 98.4% of the area was irrigated during khariff (Southwest monsoonal rainy season during June–October), 92.5% irrigated during Rabi (Northeast monsoonal rainy season during November–February), and only 3.5% continuously through the year. Quantitative Fuzzy Classification Accuracy Assessment (QFCAA) showed that the accuracies of the 29 classes varied from 56% to 100%—with 17 classes above 80% accurate and 23 classes above 70% accurate. The \{MODIS\} band 5 centered at 1240 nm provided the best separability in mapping irrigated area classes, followed by bands 2 (centered at 859 nm), 7 (2130 nm) and 6 (1640 nm). "

Some 90% of the population of the basin was excluded from access to water when the present pattern of water allocations was developed. The recently enacted and very progressive water law aims at ensuring greater equity in access to water so that the benefits accruing from different water uses will be felt by a larger number of users. This paper examines the implications of water reallocations on water use and productivity at the basin level with a special focus on opportunities for revitalizing and expanding smallholder irrigation systems that are currently performing poorly and in many instances going out of production.

These assessments are then used to generate various scenarios on meeting national food production targets, taking into account the country’s water resources endowment and the management thereof to meet those requirements. The implications of various policy options for achieving national level food security are discussed. One important point that emerges is the need for adequate and reliable data pertaining to the main drivers of the model: demography, nutritional requirements, cereal imports and exports, performance of the agriculture sector, and climate and hydrological regimes, in order to derive simulations and scenarios that are useful and meaningful for policy formulation.

Respecting the so-called “reserve” (water flow reservation for basic human needs and the environment) imposed by the Water Law of 1998 adds a further dimension, if not difficulty, to water resources management in the basin, especially during the dry periods. Decision makers and local stakeholders (i.e. municipalities, water users’ associations, interest groups), who will soon be called upon to work together in a decentralized manner within Catchment Management Agencies (CMAs) and Catchment Management Committees (CMCs), must therefore be able to get a rapid and simple understanding of the water balances at different levels in the basin. This paper seeks to assess the pros and cons of using the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model for this purpose via its application to the Steelpoort sub-basin of the Olifants river. This model allows the simulation and analysis of various water allocation scenarios and, above all, scenarios of users’ behavior. Water demand management is one of the options discussed in more detail here. Simulations are proposed for diverse climatic situations from dry years to normal years and results are discussed. It is evident that the quality of data (in terms of availability and reliability) is very crucial and must be dealt with carefully and with good judgment. Secondly, credible hypotheses have to be made about water uses (losses, return flow) if the results are to be meaningfully used in support of decision-making. Within the limits of data availability, it appears that some water users are not able to meet all their requirements from the river, and that even the ecological reserve will not be fully met during certain years. But the adoption of water demand management procedures offers opportunities for remedying this situation during normal hydrological years. However, it appears that demand management alone will not suffice during dry years. Nevertheless, the ease of use of the model and its user-friendly interfaces make it particularly useful for discussions and dialogue on water resources management among stakeholders; it can also be used to promote greater awareness and understanding of key issues and concerns among the public.

The International Water Management Institute (IWMI) recently launched a project of GIS-based malaria risk mapping in Sri Lanka, to investigate whether this tool could be used for epidemic forecasting and for the planning of malaria control activities. This paper presents results for the Uda Walawe region in southern Sri Lanka, an irrigated agricultural area where malaria cases were mapped at the smallest administrative level for each month over a 10-year period. Malaria incidence rates were related to land- and water-use patterns, socio-economic features, and data on malaria control interventions in a multivariate analysis. Areas of high malaria risk were characterized by: (i) higher than average rainfall, (ii) greater forest coverage; (iii) slash and burn cultivation as a predominant agricultural activity; (iv) presence of many abandoned irrigation reservoirs; and (v) poor socio-economic status. Irrigated rice cultivation areas had a lower risk of malaria than non-irrigated areas. This difference could be due to socio-economic factors related to irrigation development and/or transmission dynamics related to vector density or species composition. Our findings call for malaria control strategies that are readily adapted to different ecological and epidemiological settings. Malaria risk maps are a convenient tool for discussing targeted and cost-effective interventions with disease control personnel. "

In this study, the distribution of erosion within a catchment was predicted with a semi-empirical erosion model that combined a semi-distributed hydrological model with the Morgan, Morgan and Finney (MMF) empirical erosion model. The model was tested in a small catchment of the West Usambara Mountains (Kwalei catchment, Tanzania). Soil detachability rates measured in splash cups (0.48–1.16 g J− 1) were close to model simulations (0.30–0.35 g J− 1). Net erosion rates measured in Gerlach troughs (0.01–1.05 kg m− 2 per event) were used to calibrate the sediment transport capacity of overland flow. Uncertainties of model simulations due to parameterisation of overland flow sediment transport capacity were assessed with the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology. The quality of the spatial predictions was assessed by comparing the simulated erosion pattern with the field-observed erosion pattern, measuring the agreement with the weighted Kappa coefficient of the contingency table. Behavioural parameter sets (weighted Kappa &gt; 0.50) were those with short reinfiltration length (&lt; 1.5 m) and ratio of overland flow power α to local topography power γ close to 0.5. In the dynamic Hortonian hydrologic regime and the dissected terrain of Kwalei catchment, topography controlled the distribution of erosion more than overland flow. Simulated erosion rates varied from − 4 to + 2 kg m− 2 per season. The model simulated correctly around 75% of erosion pattern. The uncertainty of model predictions due to sediment transport capacity was high; around 10% of the fields were attributed to either slight or severe erosion. The difficult characterisation of catchment-scale effective sediment transport capacity parameters poses a major limit to distributed erosion modelling predicting capabilities. "

A rainfall-flow Data Based Mechanistic model identified catchment effective rainfall and separated the discharge quick flow, interpreted as the combination of overland flow plus reinfiltration along the slopes, and the slow flow, interpreted as ground water displacement. Observations of overland flow occurrence along the slopes were used to derive probability distribution functions (pdfs) of overland flow in relation to effective rainfall for two pre-defined hydrologic response units (HRUs): perennial (HRU_1) versus other crops (HRU_2). At low effective rainfall, overland flow was more frequent in HRU_2, while at high effective rainfall overland flow in the two \{HRUs\} was similar. The pdfs were employed to disaggregate the quick flow into \{HRU\} overland flow depth. Reinfiltration was accounted for by assuming that only the overland flow generated in the lower part of the field would drain downslope. Effective reinfiltration length was about 4 m. Comparison of model simulations versus Gerlach trough measurements indicated that rainfall intensity was not accounted for sufficiently. The use of smaller time steps or, alternatively, of a rainfall intensity threshold could improve model performance. However, given the high variability of overland flow observed along the slopes and the limited dataset, model simulations were considered satisfactory. Though the model needs further testing on other datasets, the disaggregating approach represents an inductive alternative to the use of infiltration equations to model overland flow within a catchment.

This was compared with the \{ETa\} determined using the surface energy balance algorithm (SEBAL) calibrated using data for the period 2005–2009. We concluded that the \{SWAT\} \{ETa\} estimates showed good agreement with those of \{SEBAL\} (coefficient of determination = 0.85 ± 0.05, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency = 0.83 ± 0.07). The total average annual groundwater recharge to the aquifer was 537 mm (±55 mm) with the maximum occurring during July (151 mm). The results showed that groundwater recharge would increase by 40%, as compared to the reference period, by the end of 2020 under \{RCP\} 4.5 and by 37% under \{RCP\} 8.5. The \{SWAT\} can thus be a handy tool for not only estimating the recharge at high spatial and temporal resolution, but also under changing climate. "

Raw salads, which often accompany street food dishes, are typically composed of perishable vegetables that are grown in close proximity to the city using poor quality water for irrigation. This study assessed the risk of gastroenteritis illness (caused by rotavirus, norovirus and Ascaris lumbricoides) associated with the consumption of street food salads using Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA). Three different risk assessment models were constructed, based on availability of microbial concentrations: 1) Water — starting from irrigation water quality, 2) Produce — starting from the quality of produce at market, and 3) Street — using microbial quality of street food salad. In the absence of viral concentrations, published ratios between faecal coliforms and viruses were used to estimate the quality of water, produce and salad, and annual disease burdens were determined. Rotavirus dominated the estimates of annual disease burden (~ 10− 3 Disability Adjusted Life Years per person per year (DALYs pppy)), although norovirus also exceeded the 10− 4 \{DALY\} threshold for both Produce and Street models. The Water model ignored other on-farm and post-harvest sources of contamination and consistently produced lower estimates of risk; it likely underestimates disease burden and therefore is not recommended. Required log reductions of up to 5.3 (95th percentile) for rotavirus were estimated for the Street model, demonstrating that significant interventions are required to protect the health and safety of street food consumers in Kumasi. Estimates of virus concentrations were a significant source of model uncertainty and more data on pathogen concentrations is needed to refine \{QMRA\} estimates of disease burden. "

These problems are the result of a multitude of factors, including seepage from unlined earthen canals system, inadequate provision of surface and subsurface drainage, poor water management practices, insufficient water supplies and use of poor quality groundwater for irrigation. About 6.3 million ha are affected by different levels and types of salinity, out of which nearly half are under irrigated agriculture. Since the early 1960s, several efforts have been made to improve the management of salt-affected and waterlogged soils. These include lowering groundwater levels through deep tubewells, leaching of salts by excess irrigation, application of chemical amendments (e.g. gypsum, acids, organic matter), and the use of biological and physical methods. However, in spite of huge investments, the results have in general been disappointing and the problems of waterlogging and salinity persist. This paper reviews sources, causes and extent of salinity and waterlogging problems in the Indus Basin. Measures taken to overcome these problems over the last four decades are also discussed. The results reveal that the installed drainage systems were initially successful in lowering groundwater table and reducing salinity in affected areas. However, poor operation and maintenance of these systems and provision of inadequate facilities for the disposal of saline drainage effluent resulted in limited overall success. The paper suggests that to ensure the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the Indus Basin, technical and financial support is needed and enhanced institutional arrangements including coordination among different federal and provincial government agencies to resolve inter-provincial water allocation and water related issues is required.

Increasingly farmers use individually owned motorized pumps to draw water directly from the reservoir and irrigate vegetables upstream of the dam. This practice, while tolerated, is unauthorized and referred to as ‘irrigation pirate’ in French. Upstream vegetable cultivation is successful because it is more profitable than downstream rice cultivation. Often, the ‘unofficial’ irrigated area around the reservoir is much larger than the official command area below the dam. However, in the absence of an overarching authority to manage the water source, this may lead to conflicts and resource degradation. We take the example of the Korsimoro reservoir in Burkina Faso to illustrate the positive and negative impacts of spontaneous individual irrigation around communally managed water bodies. "

The model is designed to estimate tank water availability on a daily basis, for the purpose of improving productive use of water resources in the tank cascade system. It represents the physical system using a node–link system configuration, and incorporates water balance components of different types of irrigation tanks including rainfall runoff, rainfall on tank, evaporation of tank water, tank seepage and percolation, irrigation water release, spillway discharge and return flow from upstream tanks. An important feature of Cascade is that it employs a modified runoff coefficient method for estimating runoff from rainfall, which incorporates a modified Antecedent Precipitation Index as an indicator of catchment wetness. This provided a simplified method for representing the non-linear runoff generation process. The model calculates tank seepage and percolation based on functions derived from an analysis of the observed tank water reduction during time periods without rainfall. The model was calibrated using field data collected at four tanks over a period of 21 months, which represented different agrometeorologic conditions encountered under both Maha and Yala growing seasons at the Thirappane tank cascade system in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. The model results agreed well with the measured data particularly in the two tail end tanks of the cascade, and clearly manifested the relative magnitudes of the tank water balance components and their temporal variations. An independent validation of the model could not be performed with the available data and thus the predictive capability of the model is not evaluated. The results of this study suggests that, with further improvements, the simple water balance modelling approach used in the model could potentially provide a basis for the development of a useful tool in the process of optimising usage of the limited water resources in similar tank cascade systems.

It estimates rice crop \{WP\} for 21 Bangladesh districts for 37 years; explores \{WP\} variations among districts; and investigates causality involving WP, intensification and technological variables; and groundwater irrigation and depth. It breaks new grounds by probing these significant but unexplored issues. Technological diffusion was the key factor explaining inter-district \{WP\} differences. The impact of agricultural intensification on rabi (dry season) and kharif (wet season) crop \{WPs\} was positive and negative respectively. Dummy variables typifying policy transition negatively impacted on \{WPs\} for both kharif and overall crops. While rabi and kharif rice \{WPs\} grew with time, overall crop \{WP\} recorded the strongest growth. Rabi and overall \{WPs\} were lower in salinity- and drought-prone districts covering 33% of Bangladesh's net cropped area (NCA). In 90% of Bangladesh's \{NCA\} districts, technological diffusion caused WP. Causality existed between groundwater irrigation and depth in 60% NCA. Despite significant potential to increase WP, increasing dependence on groundwater appears unsustainable. Widespread diffusion of \{HYVs\} in the kharif season, and development of salinity and drought-tolerant rice varieties could go a long way in sustaining rice WP. "

This study was carried out at the Naphok and Veunkham villages, Lao PDR, to evaluate the yield response of a maize mono-cropping system to soil amendments and analyze the economic return of such interventions. The amendments were rice husk biochar, bentonite clay, compost, clay-manure compost, and rice husk biochar compost, in isolation and in various combinations. Over a period of two cropping seasons (2011–2012), the enhancement of maize yield due to soil amendments ranged from 0.77 to 3.79 t ha−1 at Naphok and from 1.21 to 5.14 t ha−1 at Veunkham, resulting in net revenues ranging from −794 to 841 and −331 to 1391 US$ ha−1, respectively. Soils amended with low-cost amendments such as compost, rice husk biochar, rice husk biochar compost, and clay-manure compost were economically viable within the first cropping season. In contrast, soils amended with higher-cost amendments such as bentonite clay requires up to five years to be economically viable. Such variations indicate that taking into account maize yield revenues only does not provide sufficient incentives to farmers to adopt higher-cost soil amendments. We conclude that there is a possibility to sustainably increase agricultural productivity and improve the income of smallholders using locally available low-cost soil amendments. Our findings provide important information for decision makers to promote the adoption of low-cost soil amendments, and, thereby, to contribute to productivity growth and food security through sustainable intensification.

Improving Livestock Water Productivity (LWP) is one of the approaches to address those problems. \{LWP\} is defined as the ratio of livestock’s beneficial outputs and services to water depleted in their production. Increasing \{LWP\} can help achieve more production per unit of water depleted. In this study we assess the spatial variability of \{LWP\} in three farming systems (rice-based, millet-based and barley-based) of the Gumera watershed in the highlands of the Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia. We collected data on land use, livestock management and climatic variables using focused group discussions, field observation and secondary data. We estimated the water depleted by evapotranspiration (ET) and beneficial animal products and services and then calculated LWP. Our results suggest that \{LWP\} is comparable with crop water productivity at watershed scales. Variability of \{LWP\} across farming systems of the Gumera watershed was apparent and this can be explained by farmers’ livelihood strategies and prevailing biophysical conditions. In view of the results there are opportunities to improve LWP: improved feed sourcing, enhancing livestock productivity and multiple livestock use strategies can help make animal production more water productive. Attempts to improve agricultural water productivity, at system scale, must recognize differences among systems and optimize resources use by system components. "

To study whether irrigation and leaching practices and/or groundwater rise have contributed to the accumulation of Mg2+ on the cation exchange complex of these soils, historical changes in soil and groundwater quality were used as source data and the Visual \{MINTEQ\} model was applied to analyze the chemical composition of water and soils in the study area. The imposed irrigation regime and the leaching of light sierosem soils led to the dissolution and subsequent leaching of inherent gypsum and organic matter from the soil profile. Further, the domination of bicarbonate in the irrigation water promoted weathering of the carbonate minerals present as calcite. The higher concentrations of Mg2+ in comparison to Ca2+ in the irrigation water resulted in the replacement of Na+ by Mg2+ on the cation exchange complex. In the lower part of the command area, shallow groundwater has contributed to the accumulation of Na+ and to a large extent of Mg2+ on the cation exchange sites. "

The spatial patterns of severely eroded areas predicted by five erosion models were compared with the pattern of erosion observed during an extensive field survey conducted in the Kwalei catchment, north-eastern Tanzania. The actual erosion pattern was also compared with the spatial distribution of some erosion factors: overland flow (whose distribution was simulated with a hydrologic model that took overland flow reinfiltration into account), slope, crust, canopy cover and ground cover. The patterns of severely eroded areas varied markedly among the models. The best predictions were those of (i) a classification tree based on farmers' indicators of erosion (Pearson's Phi correlation coefficient ρ = 0.72, n = 334, α &lt; 0.01); (ii) a semi-empirical model that accounted for overland flow reinfiltration (ρ = 0.43); and (iii) a logit regression model based on slope and ground cover (ρ = 0.34). The erosion factor that most correlated with eroded areas was crust cover (ρ = 0.52). Lacunarity analysis of the spatial patterns showed that the erosion models could not characterize the spatial scale of eroded areas correctly. Instead, the spatial scale of erosion distribution in the catchment did coincide with the overland flow distribution at short reinfiltration length (0.5–5 m), even though severely eroded areas were not spatially correlated to areas of high overland flow depth (ρ = 0.12, α &gt; 0.05). In the dynamic Hortonian regime of the Kwalei catchment, the travel distance of overland flow determined the spatial scale of severely eroded areas. Spatially distributed erosion model predictions could improve if the configuration of sources and sinks of overland flow in the landscape is taken into account. "

Four water regimes including intermittent irrigation were tested in a complete randomized block experimental design. Intermittent irrigation was carried out on a weekly schedule, with flooded conditions from Saturday through Tuesday morning. Larval sampling at each plot was conducted every Monday and prior to draining of intermittently irrigated subplots on Tuesday. All the adult anopheline mosquitoes emerging from larvae collected in the experimental plots were identified as being An. arabiensis. By far the highest numbers of An. arabiensis 1st instar larvae were found in the intermittently irrigated subplots, indicating that the water regime provided the most attractive environment for egg laying. However, the ratio between the 4th and 1st instar larvae in the subplots was only 0.08, indicating very low survival rates. In contrast, the 4th/1st instar ratio for subplots with other water management regimes ranged between 0.27 and 0.68, suggesting a correspondingly higher survival than observed with intermittent irrigation. The total number of 4th instars was almost the same in the intermittently irrigated subplots and the irrigation system normally practised by the farmers. The failure to eliminate larval development up to the 4th instar in the former method was attributed to residual pools of water. Larval abundance fluctuated throughout the 12-week sampling period. The highest larval densities were recorded in the 3 weeks after transplanting the rice seedlings. Afterwards, larval numbers dropped dramatically as the height of rice plants increased. Rice yields at harvest did not show statistically significant differences among subplots with different water regimes. The average yield per hectare ranged from 4.8–5.3 metric tonnes. The average daily water percolation/seepage rate was 3.6 mm and did not significantly differ among different water management regimes. Further research is necessary to, among other things, determine whether rice yields could be increased by having flooded and drained intervals that were different from those used in this study. It would likewise be important to assess on a wider scale the feasibility of implementing intermittent irrigation with respect to farmer acceptance and required changes in irrigation system design and management.

Sea water inundation from the tsunami caused salinization problems for soil and groundwater in coastal areas of the district, and also induced salt injuries in crops. To document the recovery of the agricultural environment from the tsunami, we conducted observations of the soil, groundwater, and vegetation. Soil electrical conductivity increased sharply after the tsunami, but returned to pre-tsunami levels the following year. Groundwater salinity returned to pre-tsunami levels by 2006. These rapid rates of recovery were due to the monsoon rainfall leaching salt from the highly permeable soils in the area. \{MODIS\} \{NDVI\} values measured before and after the tsunami showed that vegetation damaged by the tsunami recovered to its pre-tsunami state by the next rice cropping season, called samba, which starts from August to February. From these results, we conclude that the agricultural environment of the district has now fully recovered from the tsunami. Based on the results, we have also identified important management implications for soil, groundwater, and vegetation as follows: 1) due to the heavy monsoon rainfall and the high permeability of soils in this region, anthropogenic inputs like fertilizers should be applied carefully to minimize pollution, and the use of green manure is recommended; 2) areas that were contaminated by sea water extended up to 1000 m from the sea shore and over pumping of groundwater should be carefully avoided to prevent inducing sea water intrusion; and 3) data from a moderate resolution sensor of 250 m, such as MODIS, can be applied to impact assessment in widespread paddy field areas like the Nagapattinam District.

The methodological approach involves linking hydro-chemical modelling with economic costs of mitigation measures. The utility of the approach was explored for the River Dee catchment in North East Scotland, examining the cost-effectiveness of mitigation measures for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pollutants. In-stream nitrate concentration was modelled using the STREAM-N and phosphorus using INCA-P model. Both models were first run for baseline conditions and then their effectiveness for changes in land management was simulated. Costs were based on farm income foregone, capital and operational expenditures. The costs and effects data were integrated using ‘Risk Solver Platform’ optimization in excel to produce the most cost-effective combination of measures by which target nutrient reductions could be attained at a minimum economic cost. The analysis identified different combination of measures as most cost-effective for the two pollutants. An important aspect of this paper is integration of model-based effectiveness estimates with economic cost of measures for cost-effectiveness analysis of land and water management options. The methodological approach developed is not limited to the two pollutants and the selected agri-environmental measures considered in the paper; the approach can be adapted to the cost-effectiveness analysis of any catchment-scale environmental management options.

The variability of the annual water balance for Sri Lanka is estimated using observed rainfall and remotely sensed actual evaporation rates at a 1 km grid resolution. The Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) has been used to assess the actual evaporation and storage changes in the root zone on a 10-day basis. The water balance was closed with a runoff component and a remainder term. Evaporation and runoff estimates were verified against ground measurements using scintillometry and gauge readings respectively. The annual water balance for each of the 103 river basins of Sri Lanka is presented. The remainder term appeared to be less than 10% of the rainfall, which implies that the water balance is sufficiently understood for policy and decision making. Access to water balance data is necessary as input into water accounting procedures, which simply describe the water status in hydrological systems (e.g. nation wide, river basin, irrigation scheme). The results show that the irrigation sector uses not more than 7% of the net water inflow. The total agricultural water use and the environmental systems usage is 15 and 51%, respectively of the net water inflow. The consumptive use of rain-fed and irrigated agriculture are approximately equal. The evaporation rates in agriculture and mixed vegetation are similar, so that low productivity rangelands can be transformed into rain-fed agriculture without detrimental effects on water availability to downstream users. The unused water flow to the Indian Ocean is 34% of the net inflow, hence there is scope for further water developments in Sri Lanka. "

However, similar to many existing \{IBCI\} schemes in the region, the enrolment rate is still very low. One possible explanation for this is based on the fact that remote sensing data is used as the basis for the design. Although the use of remote sensing data is appealing in many respect, it has several limitations. One major limitation is that it fails to take into account sensitive phases of the crops cycle, which may be more prone to climate and other environmental stresses (Muller, 2014). In this paper, we highlights the importance of using field facts in the design of innovative \{IBCI\} schemes in rural Burkina Faso. Farmers’ awareness and perception of climate hazards in relation to crop productivity and their willingness to participate (WTP) in \{IBCI\} in South-western Burkina were captured through household surveys and focus group discussions. Empirical findings indicate that farmers are aware of the effects of climate hazard on farm productivity and consider mid-season dry spells, during sowing, flowering and ripening depending on the crop type, as the most significant climate risk affecting local crop productivity. Specifically, 98% of the sampled farmers are willing to insure maize, cotton and sorghum, but only if the most sensitive periods of these crops to dry spell are taken into account in designing the crop insurance contracts. Furthermore, Probit regression analysis indicates that the probability to participate increases with years of farming experience, past experience of climate hazards, educational attainment of household head and insecurity to climate hazard, and decreases with farmer's age and household size.

Student’s two-sample unpaired t-test was used to test for the significance of differences between the relative counts of larvae in fertiliser and control treatments.

Major findings were: (1) a good mix of formal (water fees and WUAs) and traditional (rotation-based water sharing, the Zamu) systems improved village-level water management services and reduced intra-scheme conflicts; (2) the water rights system has not brought abstractions into line with allocations and (3) so far, the \{MSC\} Apex body failed to mitigate inter-scheme conflicts.

The evaluations were made for un-restricted and restricted water supply situations considering three different watertable conditions prevailing in the fourth drainage project (FDP) of the Punjab, Pakistan. From the simulation results it is apparent that on average the effect of irrigation schedule flexibility on crop yields is not very significant. However, compared to a fixed schedule provided un-restricted canal water supplies are available, the productivity of irrigation water supply (Yact/Irr), is up to 30% higher for the on-demand schedule. The on-demand schedule capable of complying with the temporal variations in climate is also more effective in water saving, reducing drainage volumes and controlling rising watertables if farmers follow guidelines and do not over-irrigate. In the present water deficient environment of the Indus basin, the benefits of the on-demand schedule and a fixed schedule are comparable. In the absence of sufficient canal water supplies, infrastructure and a well-designed and effective monitoring and communication system, moving towards the on-demand system will be un-productive. For the long-term sustainability of the irrigation system, improvements in the performance of the present water allocations and on-farm water management practices seems to be more necessary. "

Energy balance techniques using remote sensing data have been developed by various researchers over the last 20 years, and can be used as a tool to directly estimate actual evapotranspiration, i.e., water consumption. This study demonstrates how remote sensing-based estimates of water consumption and water stress combined with secondary agricultural production data can provide better estimates of irrigation performance, including water productivity, at a variety of scales than alternative options. A principle benefit of the described approach is that it allows identification of areas where agricultural performance is less than potential, thereby providing insights into where and how irrigation systems can be managed to improve overall performance and increase water productivity in a sustainable manner. To demonstrate the advantages, the approach was applied in Rechna Doab irrigation system of Pakistan’s Punjab Province.

This is particularly essential in the Aral Sea Basin (ASB) where ineffective water management institutions are the primary reason of intersectoral and inter-state water sharing conflicts and lack of incentives for improving water use efficiency. This study examined market-based water allocation as an alternative option to the traditional administrative allocation to deal with water scarcity issues in the ASB. Potential economic gains of tradable water use rights were analyzed based on a newly constructed integrated hydro-economic river basin management model. The analysis differentiates between inter-catchment and intra-catchment water rights trading. The results show that compared to a baseline with fixed water use rights, inter-catchment water rights trading can increase basin-wide benefits by US$ 373–476 million. Under intra-catchment trading, gains are still US$ 259–339 million, depending on relative water availability. Gains from trade are larger under drier conditions. However, water rights trading carries a series of transaction costs. We find that in case transaction costs exceed US$ 0.05/m3 of water traded there is no additional economic gain from water rights trading. Enforcement of the rule of law, infrastructural improvements, participation of representatives of key water stakeholders in decision making processes, and mutual trust and cooperative relationships among the riparian countries are suggested as means for reducing transaction costs of water rights trading contracts.

The effect of the shallow water table is investigated using HYDRUS-1D. Numerical simulations show that the contribution of the groundwater to evapotranspiration increases with a rising water table and decreases with increasing irrigation applications. Under irrigation conditions, an increase in the groundwater evapotranspiration is associated mainly with an increase in evaporation loss, causing a buildup of salinity in the crop root zone. Evaporation losses from fields planted with winter wheat after the harvest amount up to 45–47% of total evaporation thus affecting soil salinity and ecosystem health. Promoting the use of groundwater for irrigation in order to lower the groundwater table is suggested to achieve water savings from the change in the cropping pattern. Unlocking the potential of groundwater for irrigation in the Fergana Valley can also contribute toward managing soil salinity and improving the health and resilience of water, land and ecosystems of water, land and ecosystems (WLE).

But this must be done with increasingly scarce water resources, bringing greater attention to Resource Conservation Technologies (RCTs) such as zero tillage, laser land leveling and furrow bed planting. While the impacts of \{RCTs\} on yields are easy to measure and explain, impacts on water savings are not well understood beyond the field scale because of the complex movement of water. This paper uses both physical measurements and farmer survey data from the rice–wheat cropping system of Punjab, Pakistan to explain the main drivers of \{RCT\} adoption and their impacts on land and water productivity and water savings across scales. The primary drivers for \{RCT\} adoption (zero tillage wheat and laser land leveling) were reduced costs of production and labor requirements, reduced field scale irrigation water application, and higher yield. While the large proportion of farmers benefitting from \{RCTs\} explains overall increases in \{RCT\} adoption, a considerable proportion (30% of zero tillage adopters for wheat cultivation) reported yield loss, highlighting the need for further technological refinement and enhancing farmers’ ability to implement RCT. The study also indicates that the field scale reduction in irrigation application did not always translate into real water savings or reductions in water use at farm, cropping system and catchment scales, especially in areas where deep percolation from the root zone could be reused as groundwater irrigation. Finally, the evidence shows that medium and large farmers tended to use the field scale irrigation savings to increase their cropped area. This finding suggests that without regulations and policies to regulate the use of “saved” water, adoption of \{RCTs\} can result in overall increased water use with implications for the long-term sustainability of irrigated agriculture.

To examine the underlying causes of this lack of irrigation development, this study evaluates the suitability of surface water irrigation for the Lake Tana Basin development corridor. Surface water availability and land potentially suitable for irrigation development were considered. Surface water potential was examined by analyzing long-term daily historical river discharges. Land suitable for irrigation was determined with a GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation, which considers the interaction of various factors such as climate, river proximity, soil type, land cover, topography/slope, and market outlets. The results indicate that nearly 20% of the Lake Tana Basin is suitable for surface irrigation. However, after analyzing 27 years of river discharge, less than 3% of the potential irrigable area (or less than 0.25% of the basin area) could be irrigated consistently with runoff from the river systems. Thus, the irrigation potential in the Lake Tana Basin can be met by increasing dry season flows, by improving upland infiltration, by supplying water from reservoirs, or by pumping water directly from Lake Tana.

Poor soil fertility and low inputs are seen as major causes of this lack of sustainability. In this context, the assessment of nutrient budgets is seen as a powerful tool for the assessment of critical components of the sustainability of this particular LUS. Biophysical, socioeconomic, and management-related data on the farming systems were collected for 30 farms in Ubon Ratchathani Province, northeast Thailand. A relational database system (RDBS) was developed to manage and analyze the data. The \{RDBS\} includes a calculation procedure for the semi-automatic generation of partial nutrient balances. Partial nutrient balances are good indicators for some critical components of sustainability, and important for decision support on soil fertility management when considered with the additional factors that are required for a full nutrient balance. For the rice-based systems of 30 farms, mean partial balances were 12 kg N ha−1, 8 kg P ha−1, and 7 kg K ha−1 per year. Large variations in partial N, P, and K balances exist among different farms and, even more so, for different land utilization types (LUTs). The \{LUTs\} are distinct cropping system–management combinations that occur down to the subfield level. Many of the partial balances assessed were negative. Farmers manage nutrients for similar parcels of land in very different ways. This results in the observed large variation in partial nutrient balances, even for the same type of land use within the same farm. These results confirm the high inter-farm and intra-farm variability for partial balances of N, P, and K of several preliminary studies. Farmer interviews and field surveys revealed that different socioeconomic factors appear to be related with inter- and intra-farm variability in nutrient budgets. In addition, the socioeconomic component of the case study revealed that diversification of income sources, particularly off-farm employment, had a larger impact on household income than rice production. Furthermore, while many less well-off households had a greater reliance on rice production, many farms with high off-farm and non-rice farm income had a higher total production of rice. The nutrient balance approach, starting with partial nutrient balances, may become an important component of a dynamic and site-specific decision support tool (DST) for nutrient management, and a relational database of the form used in this study may become a key element.

In many developing countries, water is a major factor constraining agricultural output, and income of the world's rural poor. Improved agricultural water management can contribute to poverty reduction through several pathways. First, access to reliable water improves production and productivity, enhances employment opportunities and stabilizes income and consumption. Secondly, it encourages the utilization of other yield-enhancing inputs and allows diversification into high-value products, enhances nonfarm outputs and employment, and fulfils multiple needs of households. Third, it may contribute either negatively or positively to nutritional status, health, societal equity and environment. The net impact of agricultural water management interventions on poverty may depend individually and/or synergistically on the working of these pathways. Improved access to water is essential, but not sufficient for sustained poverty reduction. Investments are needed in agricultural science and technology, policies and institutions, economic reform, addressing global agricultural trade inequities, etc. But how best to match the agricultural water management technologies, institutions and policies to the needs of the heterogeneous poor living in diverse agro-ecological settings remains unclear.

abstract = "In its broadest sense, water productivity (WP) is the net return for a unit of water used. Improvement of water productivity aims at producing more food, income, better livelihoods and ecosystem services with less water. There is considerable scope for improving water productivity of crop, livestock and fisheries at field through to basin scale. Practices used to achieve this include water harvesting, supplemental irrigation, deficit irrigation, precision irrigation techniques and soil–water conservation practices. Practices not directly related to water management impact water productivity because of interactive effects such as those derived from improvements in soil fertility, pest and disease control, crop selection or access to better markets. However, there are several reasons to be cautious about the scope and ease of achieving water productivity gains. Crop water productivity is already quite high in highly productive regions, and gains in yield (per unit of land area) do not necessarily translate into gains in water productivity. Reuse of water that takes place within an irrigated area or a basin can compensate for the perceived losses at the field-scale in terms of water quantity, though the water quality is likely to be affected. While crop breeding has played an important role in increasing water productivity in the past, especially by improving the harvest index, such large gains are not easily foreseen in the future. More importantly, enabling conditions for farmers and water managers are not in place to enhance water productivity. Improving water productivity will thus require an understanding of the biophysical as well as the socioeconomic environments crossing scales between field, farm and basin. Priority areas where substantive increases in water productivity are possible include: (i) areas where poverty is high and water productivity is low, (ii) areas of physical water scarcity where competition for water is high, (iii) areas with little water resources development where high returns from a little extra water use can make a big difference, and (iv) areas of water-driven ecosystem degradation, such as falling groundwater tables, and river desiccation. However, achieving these gains will be challenging at least, and will require strategies that consider complex biophysical and socioeconomic factors. "

Additionally, basin level water accounting was carried out for the water year 1993–94. The study shows that observed daily, monthly and annual streamflows are highly variable in space and time within the basin. The streamflows have not been changed significantly at annual scale, but few months have shown significant trends, most notably a decline during May and June and an increase during December and March. The major causes were related to changes in climate, land use and reservoir operations. The study concludes that the water allocations to different sectors were lower than the totally available resources during the study period. However, looking at the high variability of streamflows, changes in climate and land use and ongoing water resources development planning, it will be extremely difficult to meet the demands of all sectors in the future, particularly during dry years.

The strategies proposed are (a) to increase yields in the current irrigated and rainfed wheat areas and (b) to increase the area under rainfed wheat through land conversion. Crop water consumption, based on satellite remote sensing and crop yield data, was used to estimate crop water productivity (CWP) in irrigated and rainfed wheat areas in five sub-basins. \{CWP\} for wheat ranges from 0.5–1.63 kg m−3 in irrigated areas to 0.37–0.62 kg m−3 in rainfed areas. Conditions indicating water-stress in wheat areas were assessed by relative evapotranspiration (ETa/ETp) and showed that water-stress only had a minimal effect for about 154,000 ha of irrigated wheat (57%). Land suitability analysis showed that about 71,000 ha of rangelands can be converted into rainfed wheat areas without harming the current water balance in the basin. Statistical analyses showed that more than 70% of the variation in irrigated and rainfed wheat yield at plot level can be explained by water, fertilizer and seed rates. This suggests that wheat production can be increased by improving inputs other than water. Results from this study indicate that it is possible to meet approximately 85% of the wheat production targets in the year 2025 when strategies are combined. "

The attempt to reform one sector (water), under the \{IWRM\} rubric, when other key sectors are in disarray (agriculture, energy) and when social and government institutions, in general, are not functioning as they should, made it more complicated. The decentralised water reform process, with support from a number of donors, was perceived to be a technical process which would result in better water management in Zimbabwe. The research in Zimbabwe, however, shows that instead of establishing order within the water sector, the reform process has largely been disorderly since it downplays the political nature of the water reform process. In attempting to change the water legislation, the reform brought out the different and competing interests on water. The economic crisis, the contested land reform process that ensued, resulted in disorder which benefited those who are politically connected. This paper contributes to the scholarship on the need to have a better political economy approach to development interventions such as water reform as they have to play out in political, social and economic contexts which will impact on human livelihoods.

Water used for livestock feed production was obtained through simple soil water balance modelling. By protecting 40% of the rangelands, the water productivity of the feed increased by about 20%. This indicated that exclosure establishment could lead to similar improvements in livestock water productivity (LWP, defined as the ratio of livestock benefits over the water used in producing these). Water harvesting structures ensured year-round water availability in the homestead, which resulted in less energy used for walking to drinking points. A considerable amount of energy was thus saved, which could be used for livestock production and improved animal health without additional water use. Besides restoring regulating and supporting ecosystem services, both interventions led to a more efficient use of the scarce water resources for biomass and livestock production. "

abstract = "Sodicity‐induced soil degradation is a major environmental constraint with severe negative impacts on agricultural productivity and sustainability in arid and semiarid regions. As an important category of salt‐affected soils, sodic soils are characterized by excess levels of sodium ions (Na+) in the soil solution phase as well as on the cation exchange complex, exhibiting unique structural problems as a result of certain physical processes (slaking, swelling, and dispersion of clay) and specific conditions (surface crusting and hardsetting). Saline‐sodic soils, another category of salt‐affected soils, are generally grouped with sodic soils because of several common properties and management approaches. Sodic and saline‐sodic soils occur within the boundaries of at least 75 countries, and their extent has increased steadily in several major irrigation schemes throughout the world. The use of these soils for crop production is on the increase as they are a valuable resource that cannot be neglected, especially in areas where significant investments have already been made in irrigation infrastructure. It is imperative to find ways to improve sodic and saline‐sodic soils to ensure that they are able to support highly productive land‐use systems to meet the challenges of global food security. Nearly a century‐old record reveals amelioration of sodic soils through the provision of a readily available source of calcium (Ca2+) to replace excess Na+ on the cation exchange complex; the displaced Na+ subject to leaching from the root zone through the application of excess irrigation water in the presence of a drainage system. Many sodic soils do contain inherent or precipitated sources of Ca2+, that is calcite (CaCO3), at varying depths within the soil profile. However, due to its negligible solubility, natural dissolution of calcite does not provide sufficient quantities of Ca2+ to affect soil amelioration with routine management practices. Consequently, amelioration of these soils has been predominantly achieved through the application of chemical amendments. However, amendment costs have increased prohibitively over the past two decades due to competing demands from industry and reductions in government subsidies for their agricultural use in several developing countries. In parallel, scientific research and farmers’ feedback have demonstrated that sodic soils can be brought back to a highly productive state through a plant‐assisted approach generically termed “phytoremediation.” Typical plant‐based strategies for contaminated soils, such as those containing elevated levels of metals and metalloids, work through the cultivation of specific plant species capable of hyperaccumulating target ionic species in their shoots, thereby removing them from the soil. In contrast, phytoremediation of sodic soils is achieved by the ability of plant roots to increase the dissolution rate of calcite, thereby resulting in enhanced levels of Ca2+ in soil solution to effectively replace Na+ from the cation exchange complex. Phytoremediation has shown to be advantageous in several aspects: (1) no financial outlay to purchase chemical amendments, (2) accrued financial or other benefits from crops grown during amelioration, (3) promotion of soil‐aggregate stability and creation of macropores that improve soil hydraulic properties and root proliferation, (4) greater plant‐nutrient availability in soil after phytoremediation, (5) more uniform and greater zone of amelioration in terms of soil depth, and (6) environmental considerations in terms of carbon sequestration in the postamelioration soil. Phytoremediation is particularly effective when used on moderately saline‐sodic and sodic soils. It is a viable solution for resource‐poor farmers through community‐based management, which would help in strengthening the linkages among researchers, farm advisors, and farmers. These linkages will continue to be fostered as the use of sodic soils becomes more prevalent. The success of phytoremediation of sodic soils requires a greater understanding of the processes fostering phytoremediation, the potential of plant species to withstand ambient salinity and sodicity levels in soil and water, and also of the uses and markets for the agricultural products produced. Strategic research on such aspects would further elucidate the role of phytoremediation in the restoration of sodic soils for sustainable agriculture and conservation of environmental quality. "

We used monthly data from 1971 to 2010 and applied non-parametric seasonal Kendal test for trend detection in combination with seasonal Kendall slope estimator to quantify the magnitude of trends. The meteorological parameters considered were mean maximum and mean minimum air temperature, and rainfall from 12 meteorological stations located in the study region. We examined the reliability and spatial integrity of data by mass-curve analysis and spatial correlation matrices, respectively. Analysis was performed for four seasons (spring—March to May, summer—June to August, fall—September to November and winter—December to February). The results show that max. temperature has an average increasing trend of magnitude + 0.16, + 0.03, 0.0 and + 0.04 °C/decade during all the four seasons, respectively. The average trend of min. temperature during the four seasons also increases with magnitude of + 0.29, + 0.12, + 0.36 and + 0.36 °C/decade, respectively. Persistence of the increasing trend is more pronounced in the min. temperature as compared to the max. temperature on annual basis. Analysis of rainfall data has not shown any noteworthy trend during winter, fall and on annual basis. However during spring and summer season, the rainfall trends vary from − 1.15 to + 0.93 and − 3.86 to + 2.46 mm/decade, respectively. It is further revealed that rainfall trends during all seasons are statistically non-significant. Overall the study area is under a significant warming trend with no changes in rainfall. "

If converted to forest, large areas deemed suitable for CDM-AR would exhibit increases in actual evapotranspiration (AET) and/or decreases in runoff. Almost 20% (144 Mha) of all suitable land showed little or no impact on runoff and another 28% (210 Mha) showed only moderate impact. About 27% (200 Mha) was in the highest impact class, exhibiting an 80–100% decrease in runoff, and prevalent in drier areas (based on Aridity Index (AI)), the semi-arid tropics, and in conversion from grasslands and subsistence agriculture. Significant impacts on local hydrologic cycles were evident, however large impacts were not predicted at regional or global scale due primarily to the current limit on carbon offset projects under the Kyoto Protocol. Predicted decreases in runoff ranged from 54% in drier areas to less than 15% in more humid areas, based on four case studies located across a range of biophysical conditions and project scenarios in Ecuador and Bolivia. Factors other than climate, e.g. upstream/downstream position, were shown to be important in evaluating off-site impacts.

Using a cross-sectional household survey, propensity score matching (PSM) was used to assess the impact of \{PSNP\} on households' investments in soil erosion control and soil fertility management. The \{PSM\} results show that the control group of households (non-participants in PSNP) invested more in soil erosion control measures as compared to the treated group of households (participants in PSNP). On the contrary, however, the treated group of households significantly invested more in soil fertility management practices (e.g. inorganic fertilizer and compost) as compared to the control group of households. The negative impact of \{PSNP\} on households’ investments in soil erosion control in the treated group of farmers is related to their high labor investment in public works, which is not the case for the non-participants in PSNP. This implies that \{PSNP\} should pay more attention to capacity building and awareness raising, which requires a restructuring of the program that would benefit long-term and more sustainable impact on reducing food insecurity and enhancing natural resources in the \{CRV\} of Ethiopia.

Given the economic, social and environmental vulnerability due to high water scarcity and variability in the basin, improvements in agricultural water management (AWM) are needed to ensure sustainable benefits. A survey was conducted among 326 crop-livestock households in four water scarce sites of the basin in Burkina Faso and Ghana to characterize households in terms of access to water, services and information, \{AWM\} intensity and livelihoods, and to explore the linkages between these characteristics. The sources of water were more diverse for study sites in Ghana than in Burkina, allowing different types of \{AWM\} strategies. Most of the farmers perceived a strong positive impact of \{AWM\} strategies on their livelihoods. Almost 70% of the variation in livelihood assets was explained by variation in \{AWM\} intensity, affecting mainly food consumption, sources of income and housing index. With increasing access to water, services and information, \{AWM\} intensity significantly increased, as well as labour for water-related activities and food consumption. This increase in \{AWM\} was significantly related to an increase in livelihood assets (R2 = 52%). Policies should be developed to improve access to information and services as well as access to market in rural areas of the Volta Basin, to enhance positive impact of \{AWM\} strategies on livelihoods of the rural households.

Due to prevalent data scarcity related to groundwater replenishment, which is the traditional basis for estimating groundwater availability, the present article presents a novel method for determining allocatable groundwater in quaternary (fourth-order) catchments through information on streamflow. Using established methodologies for assessing baseflow, recession flow, and instream ecological flow requirement, the methodology develops a combined stepwise methodology to determine annual available groundwater storage volume using linear reservoir theory, essentially linking low flows proportionally to upstream groundwater storages. The approach was trialled for twenty-one perennial and relatively undisturbed catchments with long-term and reliable streamflow records. Using the Desktop Reserve Model, instream flow requirements necessary to meet the present ecological state of the streams were determined, and baseflows in excess of these flows were converted into a conservative estimates of allocatable groundwater storages on an annual basis. Results show that groundwater development potential exists in fourteen of the catchments, with upper limits to allocatable groundwater volumes (including present uses) ranging from 0.02 to 3.54 × 106 m3 a−1 (0.10–11.83 mm a−1) per catchment. With a secured availability of these volume 75% of the years, variability between years is assumed to be manageable. A significant (R2 = 0.88) correlation between baseflow index and the drainage time scale for the catchments underscores the physical basis of the methodology and also enables the reduction of the procedure by one step, omitting recession flow analysis. The method serves as an important complementary tool for the assessment of the groundwater part of the Reserve and the Groundwater Resource Directed Measures in South Africa and could be adapted and applied elsewhere.

However, with the introduction of \{DDT\} and other potent insecticides, chemical control became the dominating strategy. The renewed interest in environmental-management-based approaches for the control of malaria vectors follows the rapid development of resistance by mosquitoes to the widely used insecticides, the increasing cost of developing new chemicals, logistical constraints involved in the implementation of residual-spraying programs and the environmental concerns linked to the use of persistent organic pollutants. To guide future research and operational agendas focusing on environmental-control interventions, it is necessary to learn from the successes and failures from the time before the introduction of insecticides. The objective of this paper is to describe the experiences gained in Asia with early vector control interventions focusing on cases from the former Indian Punjab, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. The paper deals primarily with the agricultural engineering and land and water management vector control interventions implemented in the period 1900–1950. The selected cases are discussed in the wider context of environment-based approaches for the control of malaria vectors, including current relevance. Clearly, some of the interventions piloted and implemented early in the last century still have relevance today but generally in a very site-specific manner and in combination with other preventive and curative activities. Some of the approaches followed earlier on to support implementation would not be acceptable or feasible today, from a social or environmental point of view. "

Excess levels of Mg2+ in irrigation waters and/or in soils negatively affect soil physical properties (infiltration rate and hydraulic conductivity) and ultimately crop growth and yield. Although few studies have been undertaken on productivity enhancement of magnesium-affected soils by adding a source of calcium (Ca2+) to mitigate the effects of excess Mg2+, there is no information available on optimizing the rate and time of the Ca2+-amendments. A 2-year field study was undertaken in southern Kazakhstan by applying phosphogypsum (PG), a source of Ca2+ and a byproduct of the phosphorous fertilizer industry, to a magnesium-affected soil. There were five treatments with four replications: (1) control (without \{PG\} application); (2) \{PG\} application in January (before snowfall) equivalent to \{PG\} requirement for 0.3 m soil depth (3.3 t ha−1); (3) \{PG\} application in January equivalent to \{PG\} requirement for 0.6 m soil depth (8.0 t ha−1); (4) \{PG\} application in April (after snowmelt) at 3.3 t ha−1; and (5) \{PG\} application in April (after snowmelt) at 8.0 t ha−1. All treatment plots were grown with cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), which is the most important summer crop in the region. The \{PG\} treatments performed significantly better than the control in terms of (1) improved soil quality with a reduction in exchangeable magnesium percentage (EMP) levels; (2) enhanced water movement into and through the soil vis-à-vis increased moisture storage in the root zone for use by the plant roots; (3) increased irrigation efficiency; (4) increased cotton yield and water productivity; and (5) greater financial benefits. In terms of the best rate and time of application, \{PG\} applied before the snowfall improved the soil properties to a greater extent than its application in spring after snowmelt. The economic benefits from the amendment application at 3.3 t ha−1 were double those from the treatments where it was applied at 8.0 t ha−1, suggesting that the lower rate was economically optimal.

The present study uses fully processed and physically based numerical models, \{MODFLOW\} and SWAT, in a semi-coupled modelling framework to examine the technical feasibility of recharging the SSS. The aquifer was simulated as a two-layer system using hydrogeological and groundwater data, model was calibrated from 1999 to 2005 and validated from 2006 to 2010. It assesses the impacts of gradual increase of \{SSS\} in 10 years from the base year 2010 under two scenarios (increased rainfall or controlled pumping and recharge) to meet a potential unmet demand of 1.68 billion cubic meters (Bm3) in the Ramganga sub-basin with an area of 18,668 km2. The results show that 3–4 m of subsurface storage can be created by groundwater pumping of 0.25 Bm3/year by 2020. Under the controlled pumping and recharge scenario, groundwater recharge and river seepage could increase by 14% (4.21–4.80 Bm3) and 31% (1.10–1.44 Bm3), respectively. However, baseflow will decrease by 30% (0.18–0.12 Bm3) over the same time period. The results also show that recharge increased 44% (4.21–6.05 Bm3) under an increased rainfall scenario. Simultaneously, river seepage and baseflows would increase 36% (1.10–1.14 Bm3) and 11% (0.18–0.20 Bm3), respectively. A well-designed managed aquifer recharge program is required to eliminate the negative impact of river flows in the low flow season. "

Reducing the amount of floating matter in the ponds, eliminating emergent vegetation and repairing cracks in the cement structure reduced the number of mosquito-positive samples in the intervention ponds to almost zero, whereas the control ponds had a significant number of positive samples. This suggests that a combination of simple low-cost interventions is a feasible environmental management strategy for vector control in \{WSP\} systems that are located in areas where medically important mosquitoes may breed in the shallow ponds.

During single storm events \{LE\} may remove enormous amounts of soil material from the uplands to the bottomlands and has thus become a broad challenge for food supply, food security, and human health. Recent and rapid changes in land-use and climate patterns in the sloping lands of tropical areas may dramatically increase LE. Our main objective was to investigate to what extent one could use direct flow velocity estimations from dynamic models for predicting \{LE\} initiation and development at the event level. The second objective was to estimate the impact of expected land-use and climate changes on LE. The study was conducted in the 0.62 km2 watershed of northern Laos presented inChaplot et al. (2005). Field observations of the formation and the development of \{LE\} features throughout 2001 were compared to flow velocity estimations from an existing surface water routing algorithm developed at Utrecht University ([De Roo, A.P.J., Wesseling, C.G. and Ritsema, C.J. 1996. LISEM: a single event physically based hydrologic and soil erosion model for drainage basins. I: theory, input and output. hydrological processes 10 (8): 1107–1117.]). In 2001, two main rainfall events were responsible for the formation or development of 14 linear features with a total length of 972 m and an erosion rate of 3.5 Mg ha− 1. The water routing algorithm was calibrated using the water and the sediment hydrographs observed at the watershed outlet during the first rainfall event. Assuming realistic estimations of flow velocity in hillslopes, a threshold of 0.062 m s− 1 for linear erosion estimated over 10-m cells was defined. This threshold, validated using the remaining rainfall event, accurately predicted the length (mean error of estimate of less than 15%) and location of \{LE\} features. Using this simulation tool, an increase of the percentage of land under cultivation from 9% to 100% resulted in 600% increase in linear erosion. The tested scenarios of climate changes had less impact on linear erosion. "

It causes severe environmental, economic, and social impacts. This issue is even more crucial in those areas undergoing rapid changes in land use, as for example northern Laos, and may dramatically affect soil conservation. Despite an increasing interest in the sloping lands of tropical areas, field evaluations of \{LE\} are still infrequent. Furthermore, the controlling environmental factors of topography, land use, climate and soils at the catchment level are seldom analysed. Our main objective was to quantify the spatial and temporal variations of \{LE\} at the catchment level and at a yearly basis. The study was conducted in a 0.62 km2 watershed of Laos (Luang Prabang province) representative of the slash and burn systems of sloping lands. Linear erosion was monitored from 2001 to 2003 within 9 sub-catchments of differing surface areas, topographic characteristics and land use. The length, depth and width of the linear erosion features were recorded every 5-m from their headcuts to their outlets in order to estimate the total catchment LE. 52 linear features, mainly rills, were formed or developed within the study area with a mean erosion rate of 1.3 Mg ha− 1 y− 1. \{LE\} rates ranged between 0.1 Mg ha− 1 y− 1 in 2003 to 2.4 Mg ha− 1 y− 1 in 2001. \{LE\} features mostly occurred within croplands where erosion rates reached 18 Mg ha− 1 y− 1. In 2001 and 2002 there was a significant correlation between \{LE\} and the proportion of the catchment area under crops (r = 0.88 and r = 0.69, respectively). However this was not the case in 2003 when few rills developed. In 2002 only, \{LE\} correlated well with the catchment surface area, the mean slope gradient and the sub-catchment perimeter confirming the non-constancy of \{LE\} landscape relation under varying rainstorm conditions. A linear regression model for \{LE\} prediction at the catchment level, generated from 2001 data, was able to explain 78% of \{LE\} variance for the 9 sub-catchments. However, this model was unable to predict accurately \{LE\} for 2002 and 2003 (ME &gt; 5 Mg ha− 1 y− 1). This method for quantifying the linear erosion at the catchment level and some of its controlling factors can also be used for prediction over larger areas since topography and land use data, closely correlated with LE, are easily accessible.

This paper examines the irrigation issues that constrain sustainable coffee production in Vietnam. The period from January to April is a crucial time in the growth of the coffee crop. It requires irrigation, because rainfall only provides 25% of the potential crop evapotranspiration demand. According to crop phenology, this period also requires induced water stress, because it coincides with breaking the dormancy of flower buds and initiation of cherry development, which is crucial for achieving high yield. This paper proposes an irrigation supply of 120 or 150 mm between January and April in a year preceded by good or average rainfall respectively, in November and December. This is equivalent to 364 or 456 liters/plant/round in 3 rounds/year, which is only 70% of the locally recommended level by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. Synchronizing this irrigation supply with the management of other inputs could increase average yield up to 4000 kg/ha, from the present level of 2400 kg/ha making coffee production both sustainable and economically viable. In order to achieve this, building capacity of farmers to follow the irrigation and input application schedules is crucial. "

Although wetlands are important for local communities and biodiversity, the services and products they deliver for local livelihoods and river basins are insufficiently known, and inadequately valued and understood by authorities. Wetlands are too often perceived as standalone elements and poorly integrated into river basin management plans. In this volume, an analytical framework is developed to formulate and compare wetland management options, also in data-poor contexts and to bridge the gap between science and policy. The framework is a set of tools and processes to structure the information flows needed to identify and score management options in terms of their impact, feasibility, vulnerability to future changes and trade-offs. In practice, it was found that the framework provided a useful set of tools to promote understanding and underpin negotiations. The major barrier for a better integration of wetlands in river basin management was found to be the lack of understanding of what the important issues were and the institutional capacity to organise cooperation and consequent implementation of the agreed plans. This paper presents the following conclusions. Firstly, rapid assessment tools and simplified scoring methods were used and proved useful in explaining issues across sectors and scales, and were important in creating mutual understanding, even though they did not necessarily present new insights for local or disciplinary experts. Secondly, in order to improve the knowledge base, an integrated database is developed, especially with regard to water quantity simulation at the river basin scale and wetland scale, potential habitat availability and the quantification of adaptive and institutional capacity, including the impact of future changes. Data has been compiled from various, scattered sources, including global data sets, sectoral wetland and/or river basin-specific quantitative and qualitative data sets. Thirdly, in case of limited data availability, rather than improving the accuracy of available quantitative data, it is proposed to better use alternative qualitative sources of data, from local experts, authority representatives and wetland users.

Gains in agricultural water productivity, therefore, will only be obtained alongside improvements in land use management. Expected increases in food demands by 2050 insist that agricultural production – and agricultural water use – must increase. At the same time, competition for water between agricultural and urban sectors will also increase; and the problem is further compounded by land degradation. A global survey suggests that 40% of agricultural land is already degraded to the point that yields are greatly reduced, and a further 9% is degraded to the point that it cannot be reclaimed for productive use by farm level measures. Soil erosion, nutrient depletion and other forms of land degradation reduce water productivity and affect water availability, quality, and storage. Reversing these trends entails tackling the underlying social, economic, political and institutional drivers of unsustainable land use. This paper is based on a review of global experiences, and its recommendations for improving water management by addressing land degradation include focusing on small scale agriculture; investing in rehabilitating degraded land to increase water productivity; and enhancing the multifunctionality of agricultural landscapes. These options can improve water management and water productivity, while also improving the livelihoods of the rural poor. "

In the context of international (food) trade, this concept has been applied with a view to optimize the flow of commodities considering the water endowments of nations. The concept states that water rich countries should produce and export water intensive commodities (which indirectly carry embedded water needed for producing them) to water scarce countries, thereby enabling the water scarce countries to divert their precious water resources to alternative, higher value uses. While progress has been made on quantifying virtual water flows between countries, there exists little information on virtual water trade within large countries like India. This paper presents the results of two \{MSc\} theses which quantify and critically analyze inter-state virtual water flows in India in the context of a large inter-basin transfer plan of the Government of India. Our analysis shows that the existing pattern of inter-state virtual water trade is exacerbating scarcities in already water scarce states and that rather than being dictated by water endowments, virtual water flows are influenced by other factors such as “per capita gross cropped area” and “access to secure markets”. We therefore argue that in order to have a comprehensive understanding of virtual water trade, non-water factors of production need to be taken into consideration. "

A dynamic and spatial model is developed that incorporates a stochastic recharge process and the risk of an irreversible catastrophic event (such as saltwater intrusion) that arises when hydraulic heads fall below a given threshold. The results show that if the threshold is uncertain then controlling both the rate and depth of extraction can generate a higher economic return and a lower probability of crossing the threshold than only controlling the rate of extraction. This occurs even if the extraction rate is set optimally and is less than the extraction rate than when two forms of control are used. The model and findings provide an applied framework to understand and to quantify where there might be ‘win–win’ outcomes, and trade-offs between economic payoffs and resilience in terms of groundwater extraction.

Sustained functioning of wetlands requires proper use of land and management of water. It is commonly said that increased human activities have had negative impacts on the Usangu Plains wetlands and that these wetlands are on the verge of total collapse due to altered flows. Nevertheless, these beliefs are little supported by quantitative data. A study on the dynamics of Usangu Plains wetlands therefore investigated long-term and seasonal changes that have occurred as a result of human and developmental activities in the study area for the periods between 1973 and 1984, and between 1984 and 2000. Landsat-MSS and Landsat-TM images were used to locate and quantify the changes. The study revealed a 14% increase in area covered by vegetated swamp between 1973 and 1984, and a decline by 77% and 70% in area covered by closed and open woodlands respectively. Between 1984 and 2000, the vegetated swamp cover declined by 67%, while the closed woodland and open woodlands declined by 83% and 77% respectively. It has also been revealed that the differences in spatial resolution could impair the detection of change. The continued decline in wetland covers has the potential to cause irreversible changes in these wetlands. Remote sensing and \{GIS\} technologies have proved to be useful tools for assisting decision-makers to locate and quantify changes in land resources, and hence to identify appropriate solutions for sustainable management of wetlands.

In this article, we define the climatic conditions in its area of natural distribution by combining the locations of herbarium specimens with corresponding climatic information, and compare these conditions with those in 83 jatropha plantations worldwide. Most specimens (87%) were found in tropical savannah and monsoon climates (Am, Aw) and in temperate climates without dry season and with hot summer (Cfa), while very few were found in semi-arid (BS) and none in arid climates (BW). Ninety-five percent of the specimens grew in areas with a mean annual rainfall above 944 mm year−1 and an average minimum temperature of the coldest month (Tmin) above 10.5 °C. The mean annual temperature range was 19.3–27.2 °C. The climatic conditions at the plantations were different from those of the natural distribution specimens for all studied climatic variables, except average maximum temperature in the warmest month. Roughly 40% of the plantations were situated in regions with a drier climate than in 95% of the area of the herbarium specimens, and 28% of the plantations were situated in areas with Tmin below 10.5 °C. The observed precipitation preferences indicate that jatropha is not common in regions with arid and semi-arid climates. Plantations in arid and semi-arid areas hold the risk of low productivity or irrigation requirement. Plantations in regions with frost risk hold the risk of damage due to frost. "

It is against this background that the decentralisation framework and the Dublin Principles on Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) emphasise the need for a participatory approach to water management. The Zimbabwean government has gone a step further in decentralising the management of irrigation schemes, that is promoting farmer managed irrigation schemes so as to ensure effective management of scarce community based land and water resources. The study set to investigate the way in which the Guyu-Chelesa irrigation scheme is managed with specific emphasis on the role of the Irrigation Management Committee (IMC), the level of accountability and the powers devolved to the IMC. Merrey’s 2008 critique of \{IWRM\} also informs this study which views irrigation as going beyond infrastructure by looking at how institutions and decision making processes play out at various levels including at the irrigation scheme level. The study was positioned on the hypothesis that ‘decentralised or autonomous irrigation management enhances the sustainability and effectiveness of irrigation schemes’. To validate or falsify the stated hypothesis, data was gathered using desk research in the form of reviewing articles, documents from within the scheme and field research in the form of questionnaire surveys, key informant interviews and field observation. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences was used to analyse data quantitatively, whilst content analysis was utilised to analyse qualitative data whereby data was analysed thematically. Comparative analysis was carried out as Guyu-Chelesa irrigation scheme was compared with other smallholder irrigation scheme’s experiences within Zimbabwe and the Sub Saharan African region at large. The findings were that whilst the scheme is a model of a decentralised entity whose importance lies at improving food security and employment creation within the community, it falls short in representing a downwardly accountable decentralised irrigation scheme. The scheme is faced with various challenges which include its operation which is below capacity utilisation, absence of specialised technical human personnel to address infrastructural breakdowns, uneven distribution of water pressure, incapacitated Irrigation Management Committee (IMC), absence of a locally legitimate constitution, compromised beneficiary participation and unclear lines of communication between various institutions involved in water management. Understanding decentralization is important since one of the key tenets of \{IWRM\} is stakeholder participation which the decentralization framework interrogates. "

We argue that understanding the multiple strategies farmers use to deal with actual land loss and the risk of losing land is crucial to understanding the hidden effects of land grabbing and its potential consequences for agricultural development and the overall process of agrarian transformation. From a policy perspective, understanding the hidden effects of land grabbing is critical to assess costs and benefits of land concessions, in Laos and elsewhere, especially in relation to current approaches to turn land into capital as a policy strategy to promote economic growth and reduce poverty.

Access to land and water resources in South Africa are largely viewed as a mechanism for re-dressing the Apartheid injustices. This research was part of a broader applied research to help inform irrigation practise in the Limpopo Province. The research used literature review, key informant interviews and a questionnaire survey. The overall research question sought to understand how the Joint Venture Schemes had benefited the smallholder farmers. This paper argues that the joint venture partnership created a new injustice. Firstly, the Joint Venture Scheme design is fundamentally a bad idea which disempower farmers not only to water access but also land as well. The choice of the ‘efficient’ floppy irrigation technology was made by the state and entailed that land had to be managed as a single unit. In order to make more effective use of this highly sophisticated new technology, the smallholder farmers also needed to go into a joint venture partnership with a white commercial farmer. By virtue of signing the Joint Venture agreement the farmers were also forfeiting their land and water rights to be used for crop production. The smallholder farmers lost access to their water and land resources and were largely relegated to sharing profits – when they exist - with hardly any skills development despite what was initially envisaged in the Joint Venture partnership. Secondly, the implementation of the \{JVS\} has been skewed from the start which explains the bad results. This paper further shows how the negative outcomes affected women in particular. As the smallholder farmers argue the technological options chosen by the state have excluded both male and female farmers from accessing and utilising their land and water resources in order to improve their livelihoods; it has entrenched the role of the state and the private interests at the expense of the smallholder male and female farmers in whose name the irrigation funding was justified. The paper concludes by offering recommendations on how joint venture schemes can be genuinely participatory and meaningfully address the rural livelihoods. "

Urban sprawl into semi-desert or desert areas, initially not surveyed or settled by the British and considered as state land, has brought to the surface the problematic status of those lands. Likewise, the profitability of irrigated agriculture based on groundwater has generated a demand for land in the Mafraq, Zarqa and Amman governorates. These trends have spurred tensions between local tribes and the state. This study focuses on land tenure and conflicts in the semi-desert and desert areas of Jordan, with a focus on the expansion of irrigated agriculture within the Azraq basin. It is based on field work and interviews with different stakeholders at various levels. We first provide a summary of the main historical developments regarding land tenure in Jordan, with a focus on the status of semi-desert and desert land. We move on to examining the different ways by which state land can be privatized and then review instances of conflicts around rights to desert land in the past 30 years, further taking the Azraq water basin as a case study to shed light on the particular case of groundwater-based agricultural expansion. We then articulate our discussion through the lens of legal pluralism, look at the interplay between state and tribal power, and analyze the twin strategies of accessing land and water in desert areas. We conclude by showing the historical continuity of the land tenure relationships, while singling out Jordan's state land management regime. "

Our method is based on household survey data collected from 500 farmers in Anantapur and Kurnool Districts, in Andhra Pradesh State of India, in 2013. We carried out principal component analysis (PCA) with subsequent hierarchical clustering methods to build farm typologies. To evaluate sustainability across these farm typologies, we adopted a framework consisting of economic, social and environmental sustainability pillars and associated indicators. We normalized values of target indicators and employed normative approach to assign different weights to these indicators. Composite sustainability indices (CSI) were then estimated by means of weighted sum of indicators, aggregated and integrated into farm typologies. The results suggested that there were five distinct farm typologies representing farming systems in the study area. The majority of farms (&gt;70%) in the study area are small and extensive (typology 1); marginal and off farm based (typology 2). About 20% of the farms are irrigation based and intensive (typology 3); small and medium and off farm based (typology 4) and irrigation based semi-intensive (typology 5). There was apparent variability among farm typologies in terms of farm structure and functions and composite sustainability indices. Farm typologies 3 and 5 showed significantly higher performances for the social and economic indices, while typologies 2 and 4 had relatively stronger values for environment. These discrepancies support the relevance of integrated farm typology- and \{CSI\} approaches in assessing system sustainability and targeting technologies. Universally, for all farm typologies, composite sustainability indices for economic pillar was significantly lower than the social and environment pillars. More than 90% of farmers were in economically less-sustainable class. The correlations between sustainability indices for economic and environment were typology specific. It was strong and positive when aggregated for the whole study systems [all samples (r = 0.183; P &lt; 0.001)] and for agriculture dependent farm typologies (e.g. typologies 1 and 3). This suggests the need to elevate farms economic performance and capacitate them to invest in the environment. These results provide information for policy makers to plan farm typology–context technological interventions and also create baseline information to evaluate sustainability performance in terms of progress made over time.

The data of 11 gauged catchments (475–2522 km2), located in the mountainous semi-arid Karkheh river basin of Iran, is used to develop the procedure. The well-known \{HBV\} model is applied to simulate daily streamflow with parameters transferred from gauged catchment counterparts. Hydrological similarity is defined based on four similarity measures: drainage area, spatial proximity, catchment characteristics and flow duration curve (FDC). The study shows that transferring \{HBV\} model parameters based on the \{FDC\} similarity criterion produces better runoff simulation compared to the other three methods. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the \{FDC\} based regionalization of \{HBV\} model parameters works reasonably well for streamflow simulations in the data limited catchments in the mountainous parts of the Karkheh river basin. In addition, it could be demonstrated that the parameter uncertainty of the model has little impact on the \{FDC\} based regionalization approach. The methodology presented in this paper is easy to replicate in other river basins of the world, particularly those facing decline in streamflow monitoring networks and with a limited number of gauged catchments.

In recent decades, downstream water shortages have become increasingly common and inflows into the Aral Sea have become very limited. Meanwhile, water losses are enormous both at conveyance and field levels because of outdated infrastructure and the dominance of highly inefficient basin and furrow irrigation methods. Intensification and modernization of irrigation systems, while requiring investment of scarce capital resources, could thus substantially reduce non-beneficial water consumption and help in coping with increasing water scarcity. This study applies a hydro-economic model that solves for the investment in improved irrigation efficiency across the various irrigation sites in the \{ASB\} that delivers the highest economic gains. Improvement of the efficiency of irrigation canals and implementation of field efficiency investments and practices, such as drip irrigation, and alternate dry or short furrow irrigation (for rice), would substantially improve economic outcomes. Conveyance efficiency investments are particularly worthwhile in downstream regions where sandy soils are common and return flows largely feed saline lakes in tail-end depressions. Meanwhile, field-level efficiency should be fully upgraded in all rice-producing regions through the use of drip and alternate wet and dry irrigation, as well as with drip irrigation in the cotton-producing Ferghana Valley of the Syr Darya Basin. The value of these improvements increases with reduced water availability. Implementation of an optimal set of investments could increase basinwide benefits by 20% (from US$ 3.2 to 3.8 billion) under normal water availability and by 40% (from US$ 2.5 to 3.5 billion) under dry conditions (80% of normal supply).

The project aimed to improve wetland management by maximising benefits from wetland use while maintaining ecological health, using case studies from Europe, Africa and South America. In much of the less developed world, data on wetland functions, processes and values are scarce even while wetlands often provide a critical component of livelihoods. Management decisions on balancing competing demands for wetland use must often be made in the absence of comprehensive information. This paper introduces the approach developed and tested under \{WETwin\} to evaluate wetland management structures and solutions in data-poor contexts, summarising a conceptual framework which has evolved from seven very diverse case studies. A structured, modular approach was devised which combined multi-criteria analysis, trade-off analysis and vulnerability analysis, drawing on best available information, including quantitative modelling, qualitative “expert opinion”, and local stakeholders’ knowledge and values. The approach used in \{WETwin\} has three important strengths: it involves stakeholders at all stages of the decision process, it combines qualitative and quantitative data (and therefore allows inclusion of poorly known and potentially important system components) and finally, it provides a relatively simple and structured approach to evaluate wetland management interventions and integrate impact, feasibility and institutional assessments, vulnerability analysis and trade-off analysis. The overall conceptual framework developed for \{WETwin\} was found to be robust and transferable to different contexts. "

Recent droughts reduced dryland farming production and the volume of water allocated to irrigated agriculture, with a resulting decline in aggregate agricultural production and exports. This paper analyses the possible impact of increased water scarcity on Australian agricultural production and the magnitude of subsequent impacts on global food security. Using the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data on land and water use coupled with a hydro-economic stochastic modelling approach, the impacts of reduced agricultural production in the southern Murray–Darling Basin, and more generally for Australia, are analysed. Changes in agricultural activity, reduction in agricultural exports and altered composition of products exported attributed to the severe 2000–2009 drought are also analysed to highlight the implications for global food security. The impact of climate change on food production is examined. The analysis shows that climate change, when modelled as the extreme case, along with other factors such as land use, will impact Australian food exports. Despite its relatively small contribution to total global food supply, Australia’s contribution to international trade in wheat, meat and dairy products is substantial and could affect global food prices. Furthermore, Australia’s agricultural exports are of disproportionate importance within the South- and South–East Asian and Oceania region, both in terms of volume and for strategic reasons. Adaptation along with investment in agriculture production is needed to maintain Australian agricultural production and enhance global food security. "

abstract = "The downstream impacts of increasing water consumption in the upstream rain-fed areas of the Karkheh Basin, Iran are simulated using the semi-distributed \{SWAT\} model. Three scenarios are tested at subbasin and basin levels: converting rain-fed areas to irrigation agriculture (S1), improving soil water availability through rainwater harvesting (S2), and a combination of both (S3). The results of these scenarios were compared against the baseline period 1988–2000. The \{S1\} scenario shows a 10% reduction in mean annual flow at the basin level, varying from 8–15% across the subbasins. The reductions in mean monthly flows are in the range of 1–56% at the basin level, with June witnessing the highest flow reduction. Flow reductions are comparatively higher in the upstream parts of the basin, as a result of a relatively higher potential of developing rain-fed areas coupled with comparatively lower amount of available runoff. The impacts of \{S2\} are generally small with reductions of 2–5% and 1–9% in mean annual and mean monthly flows, respectively. The results of \{S3\} are in general similar to those of S1. Although the estimated annual flow reductions remain well within the available water resources development potential, measures needs to be taken to avoid excessive flow reductions in May, June and July. It is recommended that only a limited agricultural area should be converted from rain-fed to irrigated agriculture (about 0.1 million ha), and should practice supplementary irrigation. The supplies should also be augmented through developing additional water storage. Adopting such measures is extremely important for the upper subbasins Gamasiab and Qarasou where comparatively higher flow reductions were estimated. "

abstract = "Water scarcity and the predicted impact of climate change will necessitate the use of alternate available water resources in agriculture, such as saline water, to narrow the gap between demand and supply of freshwater. Saline water, in combination with freshwater or alone, is used to irrigate cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in Central Asia in summer when there are often severe freshwater shortages. The use of saline water without appropriate management can result in the accumulation of salts in the root zone with associated negative impacts on crop productivity. The accumulation of salts in surface soil layers can be managed by reducing evaporation from the soil surface. A 3-year field study on a saline soil (ECe = 13.9 dS m−1; \{SAR\} = 3.1) in the Syr-Darya River Basin of Uzbekistan was undertaken to evaluate the effects of wheat straw mulching on alternate irrigation furrows (1.5 t ha−1) and different levels of irrigation water salinity (4.0, 6.2, and 8.3 dS m−1) on soil salinity and sodicity dynamics, cotton yield, and crop water productivity. Compared to the pre-experiment status in 2005, the average increase in salinity in the upper 0.15 m layer of post-cotton 2007 soil under mulching treatments was significantly less than the non-mulching treatments. On average, there was a 20% increase in surface soil salinity of the non-mulching treatments compared to the mulching treatments. These treatment differences were less with increasing soil depth. Similar trends were observed with respect to changes in soil \{SAR\} in the top soil and across the soil profile. Cotton yield and water productivity under mulching treatments were significantly greater than non-mulched treatments at a given irrigation water salinity level. In addition, cotton yields were up to 800 kg ha−1 higher and crop water productivity (lint + seed) up to 0.47 kg m−3 greater in the mulching treatments than the farmers’ managed fields with conventional practices in the same region. These results suggest that by using appropriate combinations of water quality and mulching, there could be substantial increase in crop yield and water productivity resulting in water savings of up to 0.5 m3 for each kg of cotton produced. When translated on a broader scale, such water savings are significant in a region where freshwater supplies are constrained and salt-induced water quality deterioration is widespread. "

Livestock keeping, an important livelihood strategy for smallholder farmers in Africa, is a major consumer of water, and its water consumption is increasing with increasing demands for livestock products. At the same time, current low returns from livestock keeping limit its contribution to livelihoods, threaten environmental health and aggravate local conflicts. The objectives of this review are to: (1) synthesize available knowledge in the various components of the livestock and water sectors in sub-Saharan Africa, (2) analyze livestock–water interactions and (3) identify promising strategies and technological interventions for improved livestock water productivity (LWP) using a framework for mixed crop–livestock systems. The interventions are grouped in three categories related to feed, water, and animal management. Feed related strategies for improving \{LWP\} include choosing feed types carefully, improving feed quality, increasing feed water productivity, and implementing grazing management practices. Water management for higher \{LWP\} comprises water conservation, watering point management, and integration of livestock production in irrigation schemes. Animal management strategies include improving animal health and careful animal husbandry. Evidence indicates that successful uptake of interventions can be achieved if institutions, policies, and gender are considered. Critical research and development gaps are identified in terms of methodologies for quantifying water productivity at different scales and improving integration between agricultural sectors. "

Upstream water use is not adjusted to reflect rainfall fluctuations, and downstream farmers of the Nagarjuna Sagar irrigation project in the state of Andhra Pradesh are increasingly vulnerable to water supply shocks. Understanding the adaptive capacity of irrigated command areas to fluctuating water conditions is critical. This paper documents the wide range of adjustments adopted by managers and farmers in Nagarjuna Sagar during a period of fluctuating water availability (2000–2007). Primary and secondary data indicate managerial adjustments such as rotational and timely water supplies to meet critical water demands of standing crops. Farmers responded to changing conditions through: (a) crop diversification, (b) shifting calendars, (c) conjunctive use, (d) suspending cultivation, (e) sale of livestock, (f) out-migration, and (g) tampering with the irrigation system. Adaptive strategies are more diverse in the tail-end than in the head-end of the canal network and local adjustments are often uncoordinated and may degrade the resource base. A better understanding of the practices induced by changes in water availability is needed to refine current water allocation and management in large surface irrigation projects. Crop diversification, deficit irrigation in low-flow years, and conjunctive use are some of the practices to be promoted in a conducive agricultural environment. "

The productive use of wastewater has also increased, as millions of small-scale farmers in urban and peri-urban areas of developing countries depend on wastewater or wastewater polluted water sources to irrigate high-value edible crops for urban markets, often as they have no alternative sources of irrigation water. Undesirable constituents in wastewater can harm human health and the environment. Hence, wastewater irrigation is an issue of concern to public agencies responsible for maintaining public health and environmental quality. For diverse reasons, many developing countries are still unable to implement comprehensive wastewater treatment programs. Therefore in the near term, risk management and interim solutions are needed to prevent adverse impacts from wastewater irrigation. A combination of source control, and farm-level and post-harvest measures can be used to protect farm workers and consumers. The \{WHO\} guidelines revised in 2006 for wastewater use suggest measures beyond the traditional recommendations of producing only industrial or non-edible crops, as in many situations it is impossible to enforce a change in the current cash crop pattern, or provide alternative vegetable supply to urban markets. There are several opportunities for improving wastewater management via improved policies, institutional dialogues and financial mechanisms, which would reduce the risks in agriculture. Effluent standards combined with incentives or enforcement can motivate improvements in water management by household and industrial sectors discharging wastewater from point sources. Segregation of chemical pollutants from urban wastewater facilitates treatment and reduces risk. Strengthening institutional capacity and establishing links between water delivery and sanitation sectors through inter-institutional coordination leads to more efficient management of wastewater and risk reduction.

Evaluation of current instruments was based on a set of criteria (the impact of the instrument on increasing water productivity, reducing aquifer withdrawals, acceptability of the instrument and its implementation cost) assessed through interviews with policy makers and experts, in addition to discussions at farmers' focus groups. Results show that regulatory instruments are widely used but weakly enforced, which can explain their limited impact. To be more effective, economic instruments need a better vertical interplay between different stakeholders. Analysis of stakeholders’ participation shows limited awareness by farmers and a lack of collective actions for \{GW\} management at local levels. The alignment of \{GW\} policies to other cross-sectorial policies, the enhancement of the vertical interplay between water users’ associations and local and national water administrations, and the horizontal integration of different water users and managers at the local and regional levels, are among the main recommendations of this study.

Using a case study from Iran, this paper explores how enhanced farm water management can help in reducing groundwater exploitation and subsequently limiting energy consumption and the carbon footprint of the groundwater economy. Groundwater use for irrigated agriculture in Iran has increased vastly over the last three decades. We estimate that groundwater pumping consumes 20.5 billion kWh electricity and 2 billion liters of diesel and contributes to 3.6% of the total carbon emission of the country. Thus there is an opportunity to reduce energy use and carbon emissions by pumping less water. However, groundwater use remains important for food security. To identify opportunities for water conservation within agricultural fields, the \{SWAP\} model was applied to simulate crop growth and field water balance for three major irrigated crops, i.e. wheat, maize, and sugar beet in the Gamasiab River Basin, one of the highest groundwater using irrigated areas of Iran. The model simulations showed that by adopting improved irrigation schedules and improving farm application efficiencies, water productivity will increase, and irrigation water withdrawals from groundwater can be reduced significantly with no reduction in yields. While these improvements may or may not result in water saving and retarding the ground water decline, depending on the fate of excess application, they will have significant water quality, energy, and carbon implications. Such reduction in irrigation application can result in 40% decline in energy consumption and subsequently carbon emission of groundwater use. "

We propose that smallholders themselves can play a significant role in achieving national irrigation development plans, provided they have access to water lifting technologies, especially small motorized pumps. We analyze adoption patterns and constraints pertaining to water lifting technologies in Ghana and suggest interventions that would enhance wider dissemination. Currently, these technologies are largely accessible only to better-off farmers. The primary factors inhibiting wider application are poorly developed supply chains, lack of access to finance, high operational and maintenance costs, high output price risks, and lack of institutional support. To realize the potential of water lifting technologies, improvements are required in the entire value chain of lift irrigation systems. "

The model estimates projected increases in water demand in 2025 resulting from the expected population growth and changes in consumption pattern, for individual nations. The \{PODIUM\} model provides a user-friendly means to analyze alternative future scenarios and conduct sensitivity analysis. As part of the World Water Vision 2025 exercise, the \{PODIUM\} model was used to test a range of scenarios related to food and water demand. In the \{IWMI\} base scenario, 33 percent of the population of the studied countries will face absolute water scarcity. These countries will not have sufficient water resources to meet water needs. Another 45 percent of the population live in countries that will face economic scarcity. Countries in this category may not have the capacity or financial resources to develop sufficient water resources. Globally, water diversions to agriculture will grow by 17 percent. Fifteen countries, mainly in the Middle East and Africa, will rely on cereal imports for more than 25 percent of their grain consumption (Seckler et al., 2000). This paper presents the modeling strategies adopted in the \{PODIUM\} model and the results obtained during the development of the World Water Vision (Rijsberman and Cosgrove, 2000).

For a basin in western Turkey, simulation modeling was performed at three different scales (field, irrigation scheme, and basin level) to obtain all terms of the water balance. These water balances were used to calculate the Productivity of Water (PW) at the three levels. Four \{PW\} indices were considered: \{PWirrigated\} (yield / irrigation), \{PWinflow\} (yield / net inflow), \{PWdepleted\} (yield / depletion), and \{PWprocess\} (yield / process depletion), all expressed in kg yield per m3 water. Two cotton fields were considered at the field scale and it was found that the more upstream field performed better than the field at the tail-end since runoff from the upstream field was used by downstream users and was not considered as a loss. At the irrigation scheme level \{PWirrigated\} was higher than at the individual cotton field level, since non-irrigated crops were also included. Other \{PW\} values were lower as crops more sensitive to drought were also found in the irrigated areas. Basin scale \{PWs\} were lower than those at the irrigation scheme, as large areas of the basin were covered with less productive land types. This study demonstrates that the \{PW\} indices provide quantitative measures of water dynamics. Models provide a useful methodology for extending field observation for the estimation of the indicators. "

Only if we act to improve water use will we meet the acute fresh water challenge. Recent spikes in food prices, partially caused by the increasing demand for agricultural products in non-food uses, underline the urgent need to invest in agricultural production, of which water management is a crucial part. The world experienced similar pressure on per capita food supplies and food prices in the 1960s and 1970s, but the challenges now are different than those we experienced 50 years ago. The world's population is substantially larger, there are many more people living in poverty, and the costs of many agricultural inputs are much higher. The current situation and the long-term outlook require a fresh look at approaches that combine different elements such as the importance of access to water for the poor, providing multiple ecosystem services, rainwater management, adapting irrigation to new needs, enhancing water productivity, and promoting the use of low-quality water in agriculture.

More reservoir construction is planned through the proposed National River Linking Project (NRLP), which will transfer massive amounts of water from the North to the South of India. The impacts of these developments on fertile and ecologically sensitive deltaic environments are poorly understood and quantified at present. In this paper an attempt is made to identify, locate and quantify coastal erosion and deposition processes in one of the major river basins in India—the Krishna—using a time series of Landsat images for 1977, 1990 and 2001 with a spatial resolution ranging from 57.0 m to 28.5 m. The dynamics of these processes are analyzed together with the time series of river flow, sediment discharge and sediment storage in the basin. Comparisons are made with similar processes identified and quantified earlier in the delta of a neighboring similarly large river basin—the Godavari. The results suggest that coastal erosion in the Krishna Delta progressed over the last 25 years at the average rate of 77.6 ha yr− 1, dominating the entire delta coastline and exceeding the deposition rate threefold. The retreat of the Krishna Delta may be explained primarily by the reduced river inflow to the delta (which is three times less at present than 50 years ago) and the associated reduction of sediment load. Both are invariably related to upstream reservoir storage development. "

The unsteady flow approach is more powerful but rather complex. A third intermediate way is proposed here through the development of hydraulic sensitivity indicators. These indicators allow the characterization of the response of a structure, or a set of structures, to any input change. Local sensitivity indicators are first estimated for the main hydraulic structures, i.e. offtakes and cross-regulators, for delivery and conveyance. Aggregation processes are then proposed for the computation of lumped sensitivity indicators at reach and canal levels. These sensitivity indicators are designed to improve the knowledge of canal behavior and to lead to improved monitoring and operation of irrigation canals. A case study of the application of a sensitivity analysis at system level is carried out, describing the behavior of two different irrigation canals in Sri Lanka. "

The effects of alcohol misuse are especially important in understanding self-harm at the community level in terms of the impact they have on the domestic environment. Also, issues around “love affairs,” arranged marriages and domestic physical, sexual or psychological abuse in the domestic environment are referred to by many self-harmers or their relatives as a reason for ingesting poison. Clearly, easy access to lethal pesticides by impulsive individuals often living under economically or psychosocially stressful conditions, combined with insufficient treatment facilities and limited outreach programs, can be a deadly blend. A strategy aimed at reducing the availability of the most toxic pesticides and improving case management should be implemented, as it is likely to reduce death from pesticides although unlikely to impact on the number of episodes. Support to families plagued by domestic violence and male alcohol misuse is essential to improve the quality of life for the most vulnerable and to reduce the number of self-harm episodes in the long-term.

Given the extent of wetland degradation globally, largely due to agricultural activities, specific attention is directed towards the usefulness of Earth Observation in providing information that can be used to more effectively manage wetlands. As an example, a further project using satellite data and \{GIS\} to quantify the condition of wetlands along the western coastline of Sri Lanka is described and trends in land use due to changes in agriculture, sedimentation and settlement patterns are outlined. At a regional scale, a project to map and assess, using remote sensing, individual wetlands used for agriculture in eight countries in southern Africa is also described. Land cover and the extent of inundation at each site is being determined from a multi-temporal data set of images as a base for further assessment of land use change.

Yet not all \{PES\} programs are designed and implemented in ways that reflect voluntary transactions between buyers and providers of well-defined, measurable ecosystem services. When third-party interests, such as donors or governments, design \{PES\} programs to achieve goals that lie outside the conceptual scope of payments for ecosystem services, the improvements in resource management and enhancements in livelihoods can fall short of expectations. We examine this potential dissonance in \{PES\} program implementation, taking the case of \{PES\} in the forestry sector in Vietnam. We question whether \{PES\} in Vietnam has the potential to enhance forest protection and watershed management. We highlight the importance of institutions and governance (i.e., the policies, rules, and regulations) in determining program significance and we illustrate how \{PES\} programs are implemented as part of the government's subsidy scheme. We conclude that in the absence of a competitive market structure and appropriate regulations, governments can reshape \{PES\} programs to function primarily as tools for strengthening state control over natural resources.

Four composting cycles were monitored and characterised to establish appropriate \{SW\} type and mixing ratio.

Samples were taken at every turning and analysed for total solids (TS), total volatile solids (TVS), total organic carbon (TOC), electrical conductivity (EC), pH, ammonium and nitrate nitrogen (NH4–N and NO3–N) and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN). Temperature, C/N ratio, NO3–N/NH4–N ratio and cress planting trials were chosen as maturity indicators. Result showed a preference of \{MW\} over \{HW\} and mixing ratio of 2:1 over 3:1. There was no significant effect of different turning frequencies on the temperature changes and the quality of mature compost. The final product contained C/N ratio of 13 and NO3/NH4-ratio of about 7.8, while \{TVS\} was about 21% \{TS\} and the NH4–N content was reduced to 0.01%.

Microbial substrate use in soils from the field experiment was compared in incubation experiments. Higher levels of soil organic matter and microbial biomass in the maize–crotalaria rotation were connected with higher total amounts of phospholipid fatty acids and an increase in the relative abundances of indicators for fungi and gram-negative bacteria. P fertilization changed the community profile only within the continuous maize treatment. The decomposition of glucose, cellulose and three plant residues (all added at 2.5 g C kg−1 soil) proceeded faster in soil from the maize–crotalaria rotation, but differences were mostly transient. Microbial P and N uptake within one week increased with the water-soluble carbon content of added plant residues. More P and N were taken up by the greater microbial biomass in soil from the maize–crotalaria rotation than from continuous maize. Re-mineralization of nutrients during the decline of the microbial biomass increased also with the initial biological activity of the soil, but occurred only for a high quality plant residue within the half year incubation period.

The exercise is liked by farmers for improving the availability of natural pasture during the long dry season when other feed sources get depleted. However, large portions of the communal grazing lands are still managed under free grazing throughout the year. This study was undertaken in Maynet village in the upper Blue Nile basin, northwestern Ethiopia, to assess the impacts of three different types of grazing land management (GLM) and two slope gradients (&lt;10%; 15–25%) on aboveground herbaceous biomass yield, ground cover, species richness, runoff, soil loss and soil bulk density of grazing lands. The \{GLMs\} include (a) freely open communal GLM, (b) restricted communal \{GLM\} – collective management of communal grazing land locally named as ‘yebere sar’ and (c) private holding GLM. Stocking density was more than carrying capacity of grazing lands across all GLMs. However, the extent of overstocking problem was exceptionally severe in freely open communal GLM. The interaction between \{GLM\} and slope was significant (P&lt;0.05) for runoff, soil loss and runoff coefficient. The average runoff coefficient was close to 50% in freely open communal \{GLM\} on steeper slopes (15–25%). Freely open communal \{GLM\} on steeper slopes resulted in consistently highest cumulative runoff and soil loss amounting to 491 mm and 32 t/ha per year, respectively. Polynomial regression analysis showed that quadratic relationship (r2=0.87) existed between soil loss and runoff. But, soil loss was close to nil when runoff did not exceed 2 mm per rainfall event. As expected, restricted communal \{GLM\} appeared to reduce surface runoff by more than 40% and curb the rate of soil erosion by more than 50% compared to freely open communal GLM. Its vegetation cover persisted above 70% throughout the year, meeting the threshold level recommended to keep surface runoff and soil loss to minimum. Reducing the problem of overstocking and pasture resting in August–November are important components to improve ground cover and aboveground herbaceous biomass yield, which in turn reduce land degradation on grazing lands.

The goal of this study was to compare hyperspectral narrowband (HNB) versus multispectral broadband (MBB) reflectance data in studying irrigated cropland characteristics of five leading world crops (cotton, wheat, maize, rice, and alfalfa) with the objectives of: 1. Modeling crop productivity, and 2. Discriminating crop types. \{HNB\} data were obtained from Hyperion hyperspectral imager and field \{ASD\} spectroradiometer, and \{MBB\} data were obtained from five broadband sensors: Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), Advanced Land Imager (ALI), Indian Remote Sensing (IRS), IKONOS, and QuickBird. A large collection of field spectral and biophysical variables were gathered for the 5 crops in Central Asia throughout the growing seasons of 2006 and 2007. Overall, the \{HNB\} and hyperspectral vegetation index (HVI) crop biophysical models explained about 25% greater variability when compared with corresponding \{MBB\} models. Typically, 3 to 7 HNBs, in multiple linear regression models of a given crop variable, explained more than 93% of variability in crop models. The evaluation of λ1 (400–2500 nm) versus λ2 (400–2500 nm) plots of various crop biophysical variables showed that the best two-band normalized difference \{HVIs\} involved \{HNBs\} centered at: (i) 742 nm and 1175 nm (HVI742-1175), (ii) 1296 nm and 1054 nm (HVI1296-1054), (iii) 1225 nm and 697 nm (HVI1225-697), and (iv) 702 nm and 1104 nm (HVI702-1104). Among the most frequently occurring \{HNBs\} in various crop biophysical models, 74% were located in the 1051–2331 nm spectral range, followed by 10% in the moisture sensitive 970 nm, 6% in the red and red-edge (630–752 nm), and the remaining 10% distributed between blue (400–500 nm), green (501–600 nm), and \{NIR\} (760–900 nm). Discriminant models, used for discriminating 3 or 4 or 5 crop types, showed significantly higher accuracies when using \{HNBs\} (&gt; 90%) over \{MBBs\} data (varied between 45 and 84%). Finally, the study highlighted 29 \{HNBs\} of Hyperion that are optimal in the study of agricultural crops and potentially significant to the upcoming \{NASA\} HyspIRI mission.

Microbial communities in permanently flooded wetlands, such as those created by wetland restoration on Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta islands in California, function under restricted aeration conditions that result in increasing anaerobiosis with depth. It was hypothesized that the change from agricultural management to permanently flooded wetland would alter microbial community composition, increase the amount and reactivity of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) compounds in Delta waters; and have a predominant impact on microbial communities as compared with the effects of other environmental factors including soil type and agricultural management. Based on phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, active microbial communities of the restored wetlands were changed significantly from those of the agricultural fields, and wetland microbial communities varied widely with soil depth. The relative abundance of monounsaturated fatty acids decreased with increasing soil depth in both wetland and agricultural profiles, whereas branched fatty acids were relatively more abundant at all soil depths in wetlands as compared to agricultural fields. Decomposition conditions were linked to \{DOC\} quantity and quality using fatty acid functional groups to conclude that restricted aeration conditions found in the wetlands were strongly related to production of reactive carbon compounds. But current vegetation may have had an equally important role in determining \{DOC\} quality in restored wetlands. In a larger scale analysis, that included data from wetland and agricultural sites on Delta islands and data from two previous studies from the Sacramento Valley, an aeration gradient was defined as the predominant determinant of active microbial communities across soil types and land usage.

The hyperspectral data were gathered for shrubs, grasses, weeds, and agricultural crop species from the four ecoregions of African savannas using a 1-nm-wide hand-held spectroradiometer but was aggregated to 10-nm-wide bandwidths to match the first spaceborne hyperspectral sensor, Hyperion. After accounting for atmospheric widows and/or areas of significant noise, a total of 168 narrowbands in 400–2500 nm was used in the analysis. Rigorous data mining techniques consisting of principal component analysis (PCA), lambda–lambda \{R2\} models (LL R2M), stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA), and derivative greenness vegetation indices (DGVI) established 22 optimal bands (in 400–2500 nm spectral range) that best characterize and classify vegetation and agricultural crops. Overall accuracies of over 90% were attained when the 13–22 best narrowbands were used in classifying vegetation and agricultural crop species. Beyond 22 bands, accuracies only increase marginally up to 30 bands. Accuracies become asymptotic or near zero beyond 30 bands, rendering 138 of the 168 narrowbands redundant in extracting vegetation and agricultural crop information. Relative to Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) broadbands, the best hyperspectral narrowbands provided an increased accuracy of 9–43% when classifying shrubs, weeds, grasses, and agricultural crop species.

Field data, collected in near-real time to coincide with satellite sensor overpass, were used to (1) quantify and model the biomass of tree, shrub, and weed species; and (2) characterize forest land use/land cover (LULC) classes. The study established that even the most advanced broadband sensors (i.e., ETM+, IKONOS, and ALI) had serious limitations in modeling biomass and in classifying forest \{LULC\} classes. The broadband models explained only 13–60% of the variability in biomass across primary forests, secondary forests, and fallows. The overall accuracies were between 42% and 51% for classifying nine complex rainforest \{LULC\} classes using the broadband data of these sensors. Within individual vegetation types (e.g., primary or secondary forest), the overall accuracies increased slightly, but followed a similar trend. Among the broadband sensors, \{ALI\} sensor performed better than the \{IKONOS\} and ETM+ sensors. When compared to the three broadband sensors, Hyperion narrowband data produced (1) models that explained 36–83% more of the variability in rainforest biomass, and (2) \{LULC\} classifications with 45–52% higher overall accuracies. Twenty-three Hyperion narrowbands that were most sensitive in modeling forest biomass and in classifying forest \{LULC\} classes were identified and discussed. "

Numerical techniques to estimate canal water distribution require large amounts of data with respect to hydraulic parameters and operation of the hydraulic structures; such data are absent in large irrigation systems. In this study, six quantitative geomatic models, with varying complexity and physical representation, were formulated. They all use high-spatial resolution Landsat-7 images and a canal network stored in a GIS. The models require only the flow rates at the head of the distribution system to calculate downstream water distribution. Results were compared with discharge measurements for three tertiary canals (watercourses) within two selected secondary canals (distributaries), Gajiana and Ghour Dour, in Rechna Doab, Pakistan. The model that computed canal water distribution using the shape of the irrigated area was the most accurate at the watercourse scale. The overall deviation was 28% and the standard deviation of differences between modelled and measured flow was 10%. The model that relates canal water distribution directly to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has the lowest accuracy with a 32% absolute deviation and 16% standard deviation. We conclude that geo-information techniques can be used to compute water distribution in large irrigation systems with a minimum of field data if an appropriate geomatic model is selected. "

The objective of this research was to compare the simulated yields of forage corn obtained from a common set of soil and water conditions for ENVIRO-GRO, HYDRUS, SALTMED, \{SWAP\} and UNSATCHEM. The physical and hydraulic properties of Panoche clay loam were used. The amounts of water applied weekly, based on the climatic conditions in the San Joaquin Valley of California, ranged from 0.9 to 1.3 times (Kirr) the potential evapotranspiration (PET) of corn. The salinity of the applied water (ECiw) ranged from 0.5 to 6 dS/m which brackets the threshold soil–water salinity of forage corn (Zea mays L.) of 3.6 dS/m. The model simulations were run for sufficient back-to-back crop seasons to establish transient matric and osmotic conditions within the root zone that did not change from one crop season to the next, a quasi steady-state condition. \{SALTMED\} simulated lower relative yields (RY) than the other models for all combinations of Kirr and ECiw. For the other models, \{RY\} values were similar (within about 7% or less) for \{ECiw\} ≤ 3 dS/m for all Kirr values. Plots of \{RY\} versus \{ECiw\} for HYDRUS, SWAP, and \{UNSATCHEM\} approximately paralleled each other except that \{UNSATCHEM\} produced higher values. ENVIRO-GRO produced the highest \{RY\} where Kirr ≥ 1.1 and \{ECiw\} ≤ 2.0 dS/m but decreased more rapidly for greater ECiw. ENVIRO-GRO has plant-based compensation which allows water uptake to meet \{PET\} as long as any portion of the root zone is not exposed to matric or osmotic stress that exceed threshold levels. This compensation factor produced higher \{RY\} at the lower \{ECiw\} values. More rapid decrease in \{RY\} with increasing values of \{ECiw\} simulated by ENVIRO-GRO is attributed to the assumption that the osmotic and matric stresses are additive, whereas the others assume that they were multiplicative. All the models except \{UNSATCHEM\} assume a constant relationship between \{EC\} and salt concentration in solution. \{UNSATCHEM\} takes into account the effects of the ionic composition and ion concentration on osmotic potential, resulting in higher \{RY\} values obtained with this model. Since the chemical composition of irrigation waters are all unique, this aspect of \{UNSATCHEM\} poses an important capability in the assessment of osmotic effects on crop yields. We conclude the models provide a valuable resource to assess the utility of moderately saline irrigation waters, for a broad range of transient conditions which include variable crops, precipitation, irrigation water management, and irrigation water salinity. We also highly recommend their use to assess the results obtained in experiments that focus on the responses of crop growth and yield to transient changes in soil water content and salinity. "

This study was designed with the objectives of assessing the contribution of forests to annual income of rural households and identifying its determinants using the case of Jelo Afromontane forest in eastern Ethiopia. It also examined the gender dimensions of forest income, and how this income varies with the wealth status of households. Key informant interview, focus group discussion and household-based questionnaire survey were used to collect data. On average, income from crop production accounted for 40.7% of the total annual household income. Forest income was second in importance, contributing 32.6%. Income from livestock, off- and non-farm activities, and woodlots accounted for 13.6%, 11.4%, and 1.7% of the total household income respectively. Firewood was the most used forest product and constituted the largest proportion (79%) of the total forest income. The contribution of forest income to the total household income varied significantly (P &lt; 0.05) with wealth category. Forest income was more important for poor households (47.3%) than for medium (30.5%) or rich (20.2%) households. It was also more important for female headed households (58.2%) than for male headed households (29%). The gender dimension of forest income was also apparent within the household. Female members generated about four times more forest income (77% of the household forest income) than male members (23%). The sex of the household head (P &lt; 0.01) and distance to the forest (P &lt; 0.05) were the two determinant variables that significantly affected forest income out of the eight explanatory variables considered in the regression model. Policy to promote new forest management arrangement such as participatory forest management (PFM) in Jelo forest needs to take into account the major forest users and the types of products they depend on, and be accompanied with other poverty reduction measures so that improved forest conservation outcome will not have negative consequences on local livelihoods, particularly on poor and women, who depend most on the forest.

The \{CDM\} allows for a small percentage of emission reduction credits to come from afforestation and reforestation (CDM-AR) projects. We conducted a global analysis of land suitability for CDM-AR carbon ‘sink’ projects and identified large amounts of land (749 Mha) as biophysically suitable and meeting the CDM-AR eligibility criteria. Forty-six percent of all the suitable areas globally were found in South America and 27% in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia, despite the larger land mass, relatively less land was available. In South America and Sub-Saharan Africa the majority of the suitable land was shrubland/grassland or savanna. In Asia the majority of the land was low-intensity agriculture. The sociologic and ecological analyses showed that large amounts of suitable land exhibited relatively low population densities. Many of the most marginal areas were eliminated due to high aridity, which resulted in a generally Gaussian distribution of land productivity classes. If the cap on CDM-AR were raised to compensate for a substantially greater offset of carbon emission through sink projects, this study suggests that it will be increasingly important to consider implications on local to regional food security and local community livelihoods.

We compared the financial returns for two crop production options (sesame and cotton) and forest use, in a dry forest area known for its frankincense production in northern Ethiopia. Net revenue was highest for sesame and lowest for cotton agricultural use. The forest based revenue was intermediate. The revenues from the crop production options were more sensitive to a range of uncertainties than the forest land use. Our results show that forest land use that includes commercial \{NTFPs\} is financially competitive to some commercial crop options and offers returns of better reliability. The hypothesis that forest based revenues are lower than crop based ones is not supported by our results. Therefore, the continued deforestation of dry forests cannot be explained by lower returns alone, but other factors such as awareness, market access, property right and institutional issues may also play a role to drive deforestation and conversion of dry forests to croplands.

The paper mainly aims at identifying the main drivers of household behavior regarding collection of main forest products in the context of dry forest environment. A multivariate probit analysis was used to explain variation in household participation in collection of different forest products. The results show that households' participation in collection of different forest products is significantly determined by a combination of household demographic characteristics, ownership of oxen and of cows, proximity to forest, access to health and school infrastructure, resettlement history and self-reported change in standard of living. The estimation results also suggest households most likely to engage in collection of forest honey, gum, and wood for fuel and other purposes are those located farther from the forest.

abstract = "Given current demographic trends and future growth projections, as much as 60% of the global population may suffer water scarcity by the year 2025. The water-use efficiency techniques used with conventional resources have been improved. However, water-scarce countries will have to rely more on the use of non-conventional water resources to partly alleviate water scarcity. Non-conventional water resources are either generated as a product of specialized processes such as desalination or need suitable pre-use treatment and/or appropriate soil–water–crop management strategies when used for irrigation. In water-scarce environments, such water resources are accessed through the desalination of seawater and highly brackish groundwater, the harvesting of rainwater, and the use of marginal-quality water resources for irrigation. The marginal-quality waters used for irrigation consist of wastewater, agricultural drainage water, and groundwater containing different types of salts. In many developing countries, a major part of the wastewater generated by domestic, commercial, and industrial sectors is used for crop production in an untreated or partly treated form. The protection of public health and the environment are the main concerns associated with uncontrolled wastewater irrigation. The use of saline and/or sodic drainage water and groundwater for agriculture is expected to increase. This warrants modifications in the existing soil, irrigation, and crop management practices used, in order to cope with the increases in salinity and sodicity that will occur. It is evident that water-scarce countries are not able to meet their food requirements using the conventional and non-conventional water resources available within their boundaries. Another option that may help to achieve food security in these countries is the ‘physical’ transportation of water and food items across basins, countries, and regions. Long-distance movement of surface freshwater or groundwater and transporting the water inland via large pipelines or across the sea in extremely large bags are examples of ‘physical’ transportation. Most interregional water transportation projects are still in their infancy, though the trade of food items between countries has been going on since international trade began. Although food is imported in the international food trade, the water used to produce the food that is imported into water-scarce countries is equivalent to large water savings for those countries: without the imports, almost the same amount of water would be needed to produce that food domestically. The term ‘virtual water’ has been used to illustrate the important role that water plays in the trade in food between countries with a water surplus and those with a water deficit, which must rely in part on importing food to ensure food security. Because the major food-exporting countries subsidize their agricultural production systems, food-importing countries need to consider both the policies and political situations of food-exporting countries, while simultaneously using food trade as a strategic instrument to overcome water scarcity and food deficits. This paper reviews the literature and issues associated with the use of non-conventional water resources and opportunities for achieving food security in water-scarce countries. "

Here, natural and social scientist worked together in an integrated approach ‘ground-tested’ through local stakeholders' knowledge and views. The aims were to: (1) develop a set of steps for implementing this transdisciplinary approach, and (2) critically reflect on the challenges of integrating different strands of knowledge to the specific context of the economics of the WFD. This was tested at a sub-catchment in Scotland. Hydro-chemical models were used to simulate effectiveness of phosphorous pollution mitigation measures, which was then incorporated into a cost-optimization model. Costs were compared with benefits resulting from water quality improvements. This analysis was accompanied by an iterative local stakeholder consultation process. The research further analysed whether selected measures are ‘future-proof’ in view of climate and land-use changes. Results are used to help set the research agenda for more practical specification of economically sound and socially acceptable ways to deliver the WFD. "

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato revealed that all specimens processed were A. gambiae sensu stricto. The pattern observed in the night catches was consistent with household interviews because significantly more episodes of malaria and subsequent days lost due to illness were reported in peri-urban and urban agricultural locations than in non-agricultural urban locations. In Kumasi, urban agriculture is mainly practised in inland valleys, which might naturally produce more mosquitoes.

The lack of knowledge of the number of existing reservoirs, their distribution, and their storage volumes hinders efficient water management and reservoir planning. The authors have developed a simple method that allows the estimation of reservoir storage volumes as a function of their surface areas. This function is based on an extensive bathymetrical survey that was conducted in the Upper East Region of Ghana. In combination with satellite imagery, this function can be used determine and monitor the storage volumes of large numbers of small reservoirs on a regional scale. "

The effects of demographic factors, economic and social status, waste and environmental attributes on household solid waste disposal are investigated using data from household survey. Household level data are then analyzed using multinomial logit estimation to determine the factors that affect household waste disposal decision making. Results show that demographic features such as age, education and household size have an insignificant impact over the choice of alternative waste disposal means, whereas the supply of waste facilities significantly affects waste disposal choice. Inadequate supply of waste containers and longer distance to these containers increase the probability of waste dumping in open areas and roadsides relative to the use of communal containers. Higher household income decreases the probability of using open areas and roadsides as waste destinations relative to communal containers. Measures to make the process of waste disposal less costly and ensuring well functioning institutional waste management would improve proper waste disposal. "

The performance of the models was assessed with root mean squared error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE), mean percentage error (MPE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute bias error (MABE) and coefficient of determination (R2). The results show that the new proposed Gaussian \{DYB\} model estimates daily solar radiation better than other \{DYB\} models. Furthermore, a seasonal analysis shows that the model has good performance in all seasons, including in the rainy season.

Considering the importance of better wastewater management at the local and national levels, there is a need for updated national data on wastewater generation, treatment, and use, which would also assist in regional and global wastewater assessments. While searching data and literature in published or electronic forms for 181 countries, we find that only 55 countries have data available on all three aspects of wastewater – generation, treatment, and use. The number of countries with one or two aspects of wastewater generation, treatment, and use is 69, while there is no information available from 57 countries. Of the available information, only 37% of the data could be categorized as recent (reported during 2008–2012). The available data suggest that high-income countries on average treat 70% of the generated wastewater, followed by upper-middle-income countries (38%), lower-middle-income countries (28%), and low-income countries, where only 8% of the wastewater generated is treated. The availability of current information on wastewater generation, treatment, and use is crucially important for policy makers, researchers, and practitioners, as well as public institutions, to develop national and local action plans aiming at safe and productive use of wastewater in agriculture, aquaculture, and agroforestry systems. The country level information aggregated at the regional and global levels would help in identifying the gaps in pertinent data availability and assessing the potential of wastewater in food, feed, and fish production at different scales.

In this study two different injection and recovery phases were trialed. In the first phase ∼1380 m3 of potable water was injected and recovered over four cycles. In the second phase ∼3300 m3 of treated stormwater was injected and ∼2410 m3 were subsequently recovered over three cycles. Due to the success of the potable water injection cycles, its water quality was used to set pre-treatment targets for harvested urban stormwater of ≤0.6 \{NTU\} turbidity, ≤1.7 mg/L dissolved organic carbon and ≤0.2 mg/L biodegradable dissolved organic carbon. A range of potential \{ASR\} pre-treatment options were subsequently evaluated resulting in the adoption of an ultrafiltration/granular activated carbon system to remove suspended solids and nutrients which cause physical and biological clogging. \{ASR\} cycle testing with potable water and treated stormwater demonstrated that urban stormwater containing variable turbidity (mean 5.5 NTU) and organic carbon (mean 8.3 mg/L) concentrations before treatment could be injected into a low transmissivity fractured rock aquifer and recovered for irrigation supplies. A small decline in permeability of the formation in the vicinity of the injection well was apparent even with high quality water that met turbidity and \{DOC\} but could not consistently achieve the \{BDOC\} criteria.

Such data are generally difficult to obtain from the literature, field surveys and focused group discussions, or from biophysical experiments. This article describes a spreadsheet-based methodology that generates this information based on a region specific production function and ‘target yield’ approach in current and future climate scenarios. Target yields are identified for homogeneous agroecological spatial units using published crop yield datasets, crop models, expert judgement, biophysical land characterisations, assessment of yield gaps and future development strategies. Validated production/transfer functions are used to establish relationships between inputs (water, seed, fertilizer, machinery, energy, labour, costs) and outputs (crop yields, residues, water and fertiliser use efficiencies, greenhouse gas emissions, financial returns). The process is repeated for all spatial units of the region, identified through detailed mapping of critical biophysical factors, and for all suitable current and potential agronomic production technologies and practices. The application of this approach is illustrated for prioritizing agronomic interventions that can enhance productivity and incomes, help farmers adapt to current risk, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions in current and future climates for the flood- and drought-prone state of Bihar in north-eastern India. In general, climate smartness increases with advanced technologies. Yield is the least limiting while emission is the most limiting factor across the entire crop-technology portfolio for climate smartness. Finally, we present a robust climate smart land use plan at district level in Bihar under current and future climate scenarios. "

The regression model highlighted the spatial variation of the relationship between the percentage of land afforested and its proximate causes. Factors identified as having a major impact on afforestation are: the presence or proximity of a wood-processing industry, the distance to highways, and land allocation to households. Whereas the two former variables are in most areas of the province positively correlated with afforestation, an unexpected negative correlation was observed for the latter. The analysis of these results, supported by an in-depth knowledge of the area and of the political context, leads to the conclusion that, during the time period considered, afforestation was largely driven by state organisations on protected state-owned land, and forestry was not a significant component of household economic activities.

To attain 30,000 mg kg−1 (3%) N content, different amounts of urea or ammonium sulphate were applied in various forms (dry, paste and liquid) to enrich Co. The product termed comlizer was stored and its moisture, pH, total nitrogen, \{NH\} 4 + –N, \{NO\} 3 - –N, and C/N ratio were monitored under ambient conditions for two years. In the first four months of storage, total N content of 50 kg Co + 3.26 kg urea (CoUD) increased from 31,333 to 54,000 mg kg−1, and 50 kg Co + 7.14 kg (NH4)2SO4 (CoASD) from 35,333 to 52,000 mg kg−1. At the end of two years of storage, the initial N content of CoUD and CoASD decreased by 47% and 24%, respectively. Based on these results, it is recommended that dry (NH4)2SO4 should be used in N enrichment of Co, and that the comlizer should be stored in sealed bags but not more than four months. "

Most empirical studies that assess this potential have focused on a few specific aspects, but not on the multiple social, economic, and ecological functions of resource integration. This study uses the framework of multifunction agriculture to assess the performance of integrated farming systems in Thailand and compares its performance with that of ‘normal-rice’ or non-integrated farming systems. Surveys were conducted in Khon Kaen province of Northeast Thailand using a combination of quantitative and qualitative survey methods. Integrated farming systems were found to outperform the normal or commercial farming systems in all four dimensions of a multifunctional agriculture: food security, environmental functions, economic functions, and social functions. The findings support the notion that diversification and integration of resources on farms is feasible in both economic and ecological terms. The analyses shows that integrated farming does not, however, diminish the need for external inputs. High start-up cost might constrain farmers from switching to integrated farming and from exploiting the benefits of resource integration. "

To augment existing agricultural water resources, the Gujarat Government invested in many large-scale and small-scale water infrastructures (WI). In order to increase water storage and groundwater recharge and to justify further investments in WI, a better understanding on the impacts of past \{WIs\} is needed. This study uses data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), along with soil moisture data from the Global Land Data Assimilation Systems, to estimate water storage before and after the intensification in the investment in WIs. In addition, Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensor was used to show changes in seasonal cropped areas during the same period. The analysis of data showed that the water storage in the state was estimated to be 24 \{BCM\} in 2003–2004 and 30 \{BCM\} in 2010–2011, an increase of 29% pre and post \{WI\} intensification. The Pixel Crop Duration Index (PCDI) indicated an increase in cropped area (at district level) in 2010–2011 when compared with 2003–2004 period, by 30% on yearly basis and about 80% during non-monsoon period. Results also indicates a significant net increase in water storage (by 5890 M m3 after water used for crop intensification) and increase in agricultural crop area (by 63,862 km2) in Gujarat during the period of intensification in infrastructures for water storage and groundwater recharge. Results also indicate that some districts have higher net water storage (compared to 2003), however the cropped area duration - \{PCDI\} has not increased much (e.g., Valsad and Navsari). The findings of this study can increase the understanding of the potential of \{WIs\} and provide valuable guidance for increasing cropped area in high water storage regions of Gujarat. "

Accounting for the effects of the atmosphere and terrain on the satellite observations at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), particularly in the rugged Tibetan Plateau region, the surface reflectance is retrieved from the \{TOA\} reflectance after atmospheric and topographic corrections. To reduce the effect of the misclassification of snow and cloud cover, a normalized difference cloud index (NDCI) model is proposed to discriminate snow/cloud pixels, separate from the \{MODIS\} cloud mask product MOD35. The \{MODIS\} land surface temperature (LST) product MOD11_L2 is also used to ensure better accuracy of the snow cover classification. Comparisons of the resulting snow cover with those estimated from high spatial-resolution Landsat ETM+ data and obtained from \{MODIS\} snow cover product MOD10_L2 for the Mount Everest region for different seasons in 2002, show that the \{MODIS\} snow cover product MOD10_L2 overestimates the snow cover with relative error ranging from 20.1% to 55.7%, whereas the proposed algorithm estimates the snow cover more accurately with relative error varying from 0.3% to 9.8%. Comparisons of the snow cover estimated with the proposed algorithm and those obtained from MOD10_L2 product with in situ measurements over the Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) region for December 2003 and January 2004 (the snowy seasons) indicate that the proposed algorithm can map the snow cover more accurately with greater than 90% agreement.

Although it is a good source of plant nutrients, such sewage also increases the heavy metal load to soils, which may impact the food chain. Management options for sewage contaminated soils includes addition of nontoxic compounds such as lime, calcium sulfate and organic matter, which form insoluble metal complexes, thus reducing metal phytoavailability to plants. In this paper we review the variation in irrigation quality of sewage at different sites and its impact on the quality of soils and vegetables. Although quality of sewage was highly variable at source, yet the effluent from food industries was relatively safe for irrigation. In comparison effluent samples collected from textile, dyeing, calendaring, steel industry, hospitals and clinical laboratories, foundries and tanneries were hazardous with respect to soluble salts, sodium adsorption ratio and heavy metals like zinc, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, cobalt and cadmium. The sewage quality in main drains was better than that at the industry outlet, but was still not safe for irrigation. In general, higher accumulation of metals in fruits and vegetable roots was recorded compared to that in plant leaves. Edible parts of vegetables (fruits and/or leaves) accumulated metals more than the permissible limits despite the soils contained ammonium bicarbonate diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid extractable metals within a safe range. In either case further scientific investigations are needed to ensure safe management strategies. Cadmium appeared to be the most threatening metal especially in leafy vegetables. It is advisable to avoid leafy vegetables cultivation in sewage irrigated areas everywhere to restrict its entry into food chain. "

abstract = "An ecosystem approach was applied to study the links between malaria and agriculture in Mwea Division, Kenya. The study was organized into five phases. Phase I had two components including a stakeholder workshop conducted with community representatives and other key stakeholders, and the collation of data on common diseases from outpatient service records at the local hospital. Phase I aimed at an a priori needs-assessment in order to focus the research agenda. Workshop participants directly contributed to the selection of two villages with rice irrigation and two non-irrigated villages for detailed health studies. In Phase II, various Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) tools were used to gather more detailed qualitative information from the study villages. The qualitative results indicated that Mwea residents considered malaria and lack of clean drinking water to be their most important health problems, and this was corroborated by local hospital records. Phase \{III\} consisted of a comprehensive household survey developed with inputs from Phases I and II. Phase \{IV\} involved a comparative evaluation of entomological and parasitological aspects of malaria in the villages with and without rice irrigation. The malaria parasitological survey found an average Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate of 23.5% among children up to 9 years of age. Results of the entomological evaluation showed a 30–300-fold increase in the number of the local malaria vector, Anopheles arabiensis, in villages with rice irrigation compared to those without irrigation yet malaria prevalence was significantly lower in these villages (0–9% versus 17–54%). The most likely explanation of this ‘paddies paradox’ in Mwea appeared to be the tendency for A. arabiensis in irrigated villages to feed overwhelmingly on cattle. The results suggested that zooprophylaxis was potentially a practical option for long-term malaria control in the rice irrigated areas, in spite of the large number of A. arabiensis. Phase V consisted of end-of-project workshops for the dissemination of research results and participatory decision-making regarding follow-up actions. Owing to the utilization of a transdisciplinary and participatory approach to research, it was possible to identify opportunities for maintaining zooprophylaxis for malaria in Mwea, through the integration of agroecosystem practices aimed at sustaining livestock systems within a broader strategy for rural development.

Larger, wealthier districts, which receive larger amounts of general revenues from the central government, also receive larger allocations of hydropower revenues. The per capita shares of hydropower revenue are notably larger in the Central and Western Regions, which are home to most of Nepal's hydropower facilities. Thus, the revenue sharing program does not favor poorer districts and regions with little hydropower development. Further, the hydropower revenue allocations to all development regions are small portions of the general revenues they receive. Consequently, the program is unlikely to have a substantial impact on economic development in poorer districts and regions. "

However, despite their widespread application as remedies for poor irrigation system performance, the actual effectiveness of transfer programs is still the subject of much debate and contestation. Our study enters these debates on IMT/PIM through a Systematic Review of all available impact assessments of IMT/PIM in Asia, Africa and Latin America published since 1994. In total we reviewed 131 citations, which together provided 230 case studies of 181 separate IMT/PIM interventions. We found the strength of the methods used to infer impact was low or very low in almost all cases. As important, we found that the distribution of studies was unrepresentative, the data analyzed less than ideal, and the specific criteria for determining success frequently unclear. This leads us to question any overall conclusions based on existing impact evaluations. Our overall conclusion is that research to inform future IMT/PIM policy needs to design better assessments of IMT/PIM performance but that this body of literature must also be supplemented by studies that provide insights into IMT/PIM policy practice.

This calls for exploration of future technology and policy options in support of sustainable land (and water) use. Sustainable land use is a complex issue, that involves uncertainties about the dynamics of the biophysical system and the social system, as well as multiple perspectives. The capacity to identify options for sustainable and equitable development depends on the acquisition of knowledge and skills for (a) holistic analysis of the biophysical system dynamics, (b) analysis of the multiple positions, perceptions, values, beliefs and interests of the relevant stakeholders, (c) contemplation of the action needed to fill the gap between the desired socio-technical system and the perceived real-world situation. Learning is contextual and gradual: historically, agricultural scientists have moved from a reductionist to a holistic hard system perspective, while now slowly embracing the interpretive system perspective. Under the Ecoregional Initiative for the humid tropics of Asia, SysNet (1996–2000) trained scientists at four National Agricultural Research Systems (NARS) in trans-disciplinary analysis through development and application of the \{LUPAS\} (Land Use Planning and Analysis System) modelling framework. Aim was to develop a holistic land use analysis methodology for four different rice-cultivating regions. To ensure relevance for land use decision making, scientists organized meetings with planners and other stakeholders. Four \{NARS\} teams of 12–24 scientists acquired and/or increased expertise and skills outside their own disciplines, in modelling and improved data management, and learned to perform agro-ecological analyses. Regional planners were presented with region-specific data in support of formulation of area-specific technical and policy recommendations, and agricultural experts used \{LUPAS\} tools to extrapolate research results to other areas. Much learning was acquired within the technical–economic domain, but the exchange with stakeholders did not yet lead to a critical learning system approach. Nevertheless, \{NARS\} highly appreciated the new tools and knowledge, and made a significant step forward from mono-disciplinary to holistic agro-ecological analysis. Application of the \{LUPAS\} methodology has been expanded following finalization of the project, despite practical problems such as diminishing long-term funds and the high demand for \{IT\} people outside agriculture. \{NRM\} decision making demands reflexivity and skilful facilitation. In these processes, \{LUPAS\} modelling has a specific added value: it enhances long-term strategic thinking about sustainable land use and rural development issues. "

Yet, the links between agricultural activities in the uplands and downstream off-site effects remain largely unknown because of the difficulties in transferring results from plots to a larger scale. Many authors have thus pointed out the need for long-term catchment studies. The objective of this paper is to summarize the results obtained by the Management of Soil Erosion Consortium (MSEC) over the last 5 years from 27 catchments in five countries (Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam). The purpose of the study was to assess the impacts of cultivation practices on annual runoff and erosion rates. Initial surveys in each catchment included topography, soils and land use. Monitoring included climatic, hydrologic and erosion (total sediment yield including bed load and suspended sediment load) data, land use and crop yields, and farmers’ income. In addition, new land management options were introduced through consultations with farmers and evaluated in terms of runoff and erosion. These included tree plantations, fruit trees, improved fallow with legumes, maize intercropped with legumes, planted fodder, native grass strips and agro-ecological practices (direct sowing and mulch-based conservation agriculture). Regressions analyses showed that runoff during the rainy season, and normalized runoff flow coefficient based on erosive rainfall during the rainy season (rainfall with intensity exceeding 25 mm h−1) increase with the percentage of the catchment covered by maize. Both variables decrease with increasing soil depth, standard deviation of catchment slope (that reflects terrain roughness), and the percentages of the catchment covered by fallow (regular and improved), tree plantations and planted fodder. The best predictors of sediment yield were the surface percentages of maize, Job's tears, cassava and footpaths. The main conclusions generated from this study were: (i) soil erosion is predominantly influenced by land use rather than environmental characteristics not only at the plot scale but also at the catchment scale; (ii) slash-and-burn shifting cultivation with sufficiently long rotations (1 year of cultivation, 8 years of fallow) is too often unjustly blamed for degradation; (iii) in its place, continuous cropping of maize and cassava promotes high rates of soil erosion at the catchment scale; (iv) conservation technologies are efficient in reducing runoff and total sediment yield at the catchment scale; (v) the adoption of improved soil management technologies by upland farmers is not a function of the degree of intensification of their farming system and/or of their incomes. The results suggest that if expansion of maize and cassava into already degraded upland systems were to occur due to increased demand for biofuels, there is a risk of higher runoff and sediment generation. A failure to adopt appropriate land use management strategies will result in further rapid resource degradation with negative impacts to downstream communities. "

The study was undertaken in six watercourses located in different reaches of two distributary canals with command area of about 4000 ha each. Water management, as practiced at field as well as at watercourse level, was studied. The study suggested that the rigid water delivery schedules and the degree of water inadequacy provided very limited scope to the farmers for decision making in respect of canal water management. Farmers’ decisions were largely confined to operation of the tube wells to alleviate part of the canal water deficit. The highly inadequate canal water supply and poor quality of groundwater created variation in farmers’ decision in crop choices during summer season while in the winter season wheat was grown as the sole crop. The higher exploitation of groundwater, besides keeping water table under control, to some extent increased crop yields in tail reaches. But water quality being marginal, the yields in the tail watercourses were lower by 10–20% in case of wheat and 20–40% in case of rice when compared with the head watercourses. The water productivity can be increased to some extent by resorting to crop diversification and by cultivation of salt tolerant high yielding varieties of crops. Fresh and brackish water aquaculture also offers opportunity to improve both water productivity as well as income of the farming community in the region. "

The prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworm infection was 13.5%, 45.2% and 58.1%, respectively. At least one of the parasites was detected in 72.3% of the samples. We found no association between infection with A. lumbricoides or T. trichiura and engagement in agriculture, while hookworm infection was more prevalent in populations having frequent contact with soil. Agricultural use of human faeces was not correlated with any of the infections. We suggest that the consumption of vegetables that are commonly fertilized with human faeces in the community has led to the high infection rates with A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura, rather than the manipulation of faeces in farming activity. This also explains the high infection prevalence, despite high latrine coverage (98.1%) in the study population. The presence of latrines alone is not sufficient to reduce the prevalence of helminthiasis in a rural agricultural community if fresh faeces are used as fertilizer. "

In each province we find strong linkages between retail and farmgate prices with elasticities ranging between 0.6 and 1 and intensifying over time. This suggests that Chinese farmers are generally well connected to retail markets and that this connectivity has strengthened in the period considered, creating not only new opportunities but also new risks. It is also found that linkages are relatively weak in inland provinces, which is a point of concern in view of Chinese policies to create equal opportunities and equitable growth. "

Here we used hydrogeological data, supported by secondary data, to assess the effects of water scarcity over a decade-long period (1998–2007) on the groundwater resources at the regional basin scale. This reveals no evidence of systematic declines in total groundwater availability over the period; only shorter-term losses/gains in storage associated with successive dry/wet years. The clearest indicator of stress comes from the more widespread drying out of wells following lower rainfall years throughout the basin and especially in upland areas where aquifers are least developed and most easily drained. Groundwater in the basin offers an adaptive mechanism to climate variability to some degree, but the buffering capacity is constrained by low aquifer storativity and average residence times of just a few years. Around 40% of the basin is currently at a level of development that is of concern, and the number of irrigation wells is growing rapidly. However recent evidence of conversion from high to low water use crops indicates the adaptive capacity of farmers to water-related stresses. Surplus surface water flows may provide opportunities to enhance groundwater recharge but requires careful trade-off analysis of the downstream impacts. "

The results have potential application in monitoring the trophic state of Lake Malawi. Attempts to use Level 1B MODIS/Terra data proved futile because of lack of atmospheric correction in processing the reflectance data. This shows that atmospheric effects have serious impacts on radiant energy, and hence the need for atmospheric correction.

Results show that the newly developed model performs best for all stations; models based on temperature, rainfall and air humidity performed better than models that used temperature data only. If only temperature data are available for estimation of global solar radiation, the Bristow and Campbell model had the best results.

In central Luzon, Philippines, farm reservoirs are about 800 to 5000 m2 in area and have an average depth of about 1 m. The average farm size is about 3 ha. The stored water is used to supplement rainfall for wet season rice production and to irrigate a dry season rice crop on approximately one third of the farm area. Farmers without reservoirs cannot grow a dry season crop. This study quantified the major hydrological parameters of four selected farm reservoirs using a water balance approach. Direct rainfall and runoff from the catchment area contributed, respectively, about 36% and 64% to reservoir inflow. Typically, farmer's use of stored water for land preparation and irrigation of rice accounted for about 30% of the total water outflow from a reservoir. Seepage and percolation losses of water accounted for about 45% of the outflow volume, and evaporation loss of about 25%. The minimum catchment area required to support a reservoir of given capacity was calculated to be nearly 5 times higher for a grassed catchment than for a catchment under paddy rice. The hydraulic conductivity of reservoir embankments reduced with reservoir age due to continuous settlement of poorly compacted materials, affecting the rate of water loss through seepage. "

The model works on a daily basis; the principal inputs required to run it are the number of pumps operating and duration of their operation in relation to rainfall, demand for water in the field, and the irrigation distribution schedule followed in the system. The model captures the temporal and spatial changes in the water demand-and-supply relationship within the system as land-soaking, land-preparation, transplanting and crop-irrigation activities progress within a season. The principal outputs of the model are the extent of area that can be land-prepared, transplanted to rice and supported with required irrigation water until the crop reaches maturity. \{PUMPMOD\} has been adapted and evaluated for a rice irrigation system in The Philippines and uses four pumps of about 6.0 m3/s total discharge capacity, using field data collected during eight consecutive seasons and taking into account its existing major physical and socio-economic constraints which influence the operation of the system. The results are satisfactory. \{PUMPMOD\} is designed to be used as a tool for making decisions to optimize the supply of irrigation water from the source in relation to rainfall and field-water demands. It can also be used for various investigative purposes, including the evaluation of the efficacy of alternative designs to allocate and distribute water for maximizing irrigation benefits. "

We found that the size of potential crop area can be increased by over 550 ha for every additional pump operating for 18 hours each day during maximum water demand periods. The maximum rate of land preparation that can be supported by the irrigation system limits the size of the potential crop area, but when the per day rate exceeds 7.5% of the system's command area water supply becomes the limiting factor. The simulation indicates that if the pumps can be operated longer than 18 hours a day, a significantly larger area than the current average of about 1500 hectares can be satisfactorily irrigated. A regression model indicates that there is potential for major saving in \{LCPIS\} operating costs by reducing the allowable period of pump operation during the wet season without significant reduction in rice yields.

Symptoms of water scarcity are increasingly apparent, threatening ecosystem services and the sustainability of food production. Improved water productivity will reduce the additional water requirements in agriculture. However, there is a tradeoff between the quantity of water used in agriculture and the quality of return flow. Where yields are low due to limited nitrogen (N) and water supply, water productivity can be enhanced through higher fertilizer applications and improved water management. This limits the amount of additional water needed for increased food demand, thus leaving more water for environmental requirements. But it also increases the amount of nitrate (NO3–N) leaching, thus adversely affecting the water quality of return flows. This paper quantifies the tradeoff between enhanced water productivity and NO3–N leaching and shows the importance of the right management of water and N applications. Using the Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT) crop model, several scenarios combining different water and N application regimes are examined for maize (Zea mays L.) in Gainesville, FL, USA. Without adequate water, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) remains low, resulting in substantial NO3–N leaching. Too much water leads to excessive NO3–N leaching and lower water productivity. The lack of N is a cause of low water productivity but too much of it leads to lower \{NUE\} and higher losses. The paper concludes that increased NO3–N leaching is an inevitable by-product of increased water productivity, but its adverse impacts can greatly be reduced by better management of water and N application. The paper briefly shows that leaching can be reduced and water productivity increased by split application of N-fertilizer. This implies that improved water and nutrient management at field- and scheme-level is a prerequisite to limit adverse impacts of agriculture on ecosystems, now and especially in the future. "

An attractive alternative is the use of simulation models to estimate actual transpiration and evaporation. As part of a comparison of different methods to estimate the actual ET, the physically based simulation model for the saturated–unsaturated zone, swap, was used to estimate actual \{ET\} for two locations in the Gediz basin in western Turkey. The locations selected are: a field with a single crop (cotton) and a valley with a mixed cropping pattern (grapes, cotton, olive trees). Actual crop transpiration as well as actual soil evaporation were simulated taking into account crop development stage and reduction as consequences of actual soil moisture status. For the valley, with the mixed cropping pattern, a lumped approach was used to estimate actual ET. Results presented show that a distinction between actual crop transpiration and soil evaporation can be made and that the lumped method is an attractive method to estimate areal actual ET. "

A key factor in defining agricultural productivity is to be able to simulate soil evaporation and crop transpiration. In agribusiness terms, crop transpiration is a useful process while soil and open-water evaporations are wasteful processes. In this study a distributed hydrological model was used to compute daily evaporation and transpiration for a variety of crops and other land covers within the 17,200 km2 Gediz Basin in western Turkey. The model, SLURP, describes the complete hydrological cycle for each land cover within a series of sub-basins including all dams, reservoirs, regulators and irrigation schemes in the basin. The sub-basins and land covers are defined by analysing a digital elevation model and \{NOAA\} \{AVHRR\} satellite data. In this study, the model uses the \{FAO\} implementation of the Penman–Monteith equation to simulate soil evaporation and crop transpiration. The results of the model runs provide time series of data on streamflow at many points along the river system, abstractions and return flows from crops within the irrigation schemes and areally distributed soil evaporation and crop transpiration across the entire basin on each day of an 11 year period. The results show that evaporation and transpiration vary widely across the basin on any one day and over the irrigation season and can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the various irrigation strategies used in the basin. The advantages of using such a model as compared to deriving evapotranspiration from satellite data are that the model obtains results for each day of an indefinitely long period, as opposed to occasional snapshots, and can also be used to simulate alternate scenarios.

The objectives were to compare results and to assess the utility of each method for various applications. Evaporation and transpiration are important components of the hydrological cycle, which cannot be directly measured. Traditionally, actual evapotranspiration has been computed as a residual in water balance equations, from estimates of potential evapotranspiration or, indirectly, from field measurements at meteorological stations. Recently, however, researchers have begun using scintillometers, remotely sensed data and hydrological models to estimate areal actual evapotranspiration. An experiment was carried out in western Turkey over the summer of 1998 to compare the newly developed methods with more conventional methods. This paper introduces the different techniques, the experimental sites and the dataset. The results of the different methods are reviewed and compared and recommendations are made as to the suitability of the different methods for different circumstances. Particular emphasis is placed on the data requirements, the ease of use and the constraints of each method. The results show that the satellite methods and FAO-24 methods have the greatest variability. The FAO-56, the models and the field methods show more consistency.

Opponents say the reported high yields are due to measurement error and that usual information expected in support of these fantastic yields is missing.

We evaluate the impact of adoption of \{SRI\} practices on rice yields, the economics of paddy cultivation and labour inputs based on field research conducted in Purulia, West Bengal, India.

The paper reviews water scarcity indicators and global assessments based on these indicators. The most widely used indicator, the Falkenmark indicator, is popular because it is easy to apply and understand but it does not help to explain the true nature of water scarcity. The more complex indicators are not widely applied because data are lacking to apply them and the definitions are not intuitive. Water is definitely physically scarce in densely populated arid areas, Central and West Asia, and North Africa, with projected availabilities of less than 1000 m3/capita/year. This scarcity relates to water for food production, however, and not to water for domestic purposes that are minute at this scale. In most of the rest of the world water scarcity at a national scale has as much to do with the development of the demand as the availability of the supply. Accounting for water for environmental requirements shows that abstraction of water for domestic, food and industrial uses already have a major impact on ecosystems in many parts of the world, even those not considered “water scarce”. Water will be a major constraint for agriculture in coming decades and particularly in Asia and Africa this will require major institutional adjustments. A “soft path” to address water scarcity, focusing on increasing overall water productivity, is recommended. "

In the Dry Zone of Sri Lanka, 70% of the average annual rainfall of 1000 mm falls in a 3 month period. During the dry season, reference evapotranspiration has less rainfall — about 700 mm, indicating that much additional supply is meant to support crops, mainly paddy. In this climatic context, irrigation has dramatically changed the local environment, creating ecosystems quite similar to that of the wet zone to flourish. In these systems, recharge of shallow groundwater by percolation from irrigated fields, canals, and tanks, has provided a continuous supply of water for natural vegetation and homestead gardens. Much of the water used by this non-crop vegetation is beneficial. Growth of fruit and coconut trees can be quite profitable, while other trees enhance the environment. In 1998, \{IWMI\} performed a comprehensive water balance in the command area of the Kirindi Oya irrigation scheme, Sri Lanka, based on surface flow measurements, rainfall data, and estimation of crop water requirements. This water balance showed that evaporation consumed 78% of the total amount of water available for use. The amount of evaporation is split into process depletion (crops for 28%), direct evaporation from tanks (7%), inter-seasonal fallow (10%) and from non-crop vegetation for 55%. The main conclusion from this study is that perennial vegetation as the main component of non-crop vegetation, is a significant consideration in tropical humid environments in planning, management and performance assessment. Designers, managers, and researchers need to specifically incorporate the evaluation of evaporation by non-crop vegetation and perennial vegetation in their approach of water requirements. Further investigation is needed to estimate water consumption by land cover type to assess their respective beneficial use. "

Many researchers argue that pro rata electricity tariff, with built in positive marginal cost of pumping could bring about efficient use of the resource, though some argue that the levels of tariff in which demand becomes elastic to pricing are too high to be viable from political and socio-economic points of view. The paper presents a theoretical model to analyze farmers’ response to changes in power tariff and water allocation regimes vis à vis energy and groundwater use. It validates the model by analyzing water productivity in groundwater irrigation under different electricity pricing structures and water allocation regimes. Water productivity was estimated using primary data of gross crop inputs, cost of all inputs, and volumetric water inputs. The analysis shows that unit pricing of electricity influences groundwater use efficiency and productivity positively. It also shows that the levels of pricing at which demand for electricity and groundwater becomes elastic to tariff are socio-economically viable. Further, water productivity impacts of pricing would be highest when water is volumetrically allocated with rationing. Therefore, an effective power tariff policy followed by enforcement of volumetric water allocation could address the issue of efficiency, sustainability and equity in groundwater use in India. "

The other indicates a cluster of high poverty rural areas, where agriculture is the dominant economic activity, and where spatial clustering is associated with factors influencing agricultural production. Agricultural smallholdings are positively associated with spatial clustering of poor rural areas. In areas where water availability is low, better access to irrigation significantly reduces poverty.

However, in taking the second step of operationalizing generic principles into concrete actions on the ground, at least three salient differences between Sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere emerged: (a) Africa’s relative abundance of water resources but its scarcity of economic means to harness available water resources; (b) the importance of agriculture and agricultural water development for economic growth and poverty eradication; and (c) the need for systems of water rights and financial resource mobilization that are separated and suit the African reality in which large water users are relatively few, while the bulk of water users are scattered smallholders.

Increasing demands for water by industrial and urban users, and water for the environment will intensify competition. At the same time, water scarcity is increasing in several important agricultural areas. We explore several pathways for ensuring that sufficient food is produced in the future, while also protecting the environment and reducing poverty. We examine four sets of scenarios that vary in their focus on investments in rainfed agriculture and irrigation, and the role of international trade in adjusting for national disparities in water endowments. Rainfed agriculture holds considerable potential but requires adequate mechanisms to reduce inherent risks. Irrigation expansion is warranted in places where water infrastructure is underinvested such as sub-Saharan Africa. In South Asia the scope for improving irrigation performance and water productivity is high. International trade can help alleviate water problems in water-scarce areas, subject to economic and political considerations. We examine also a regionally optimized scenario that combines investments in rainfed and irrigated agriculture with strategic trade decisions. Compared to ‘business as usual’, this scenario reduces the amount of additional water required to meet food demands by 2050 by 80%. Some of that water could be made available for the environment and other sectors. We conclude that there are sufficient land and water resources available to satisfy global food demands during the next 50 years, but only if water is managed more effectively in agriculture. "

There have been numerous occasions where downstream areas have suffered as a consequence of ad hoc agricultural development activities upstream. Problems encountered in the downstream coastal areas include river desiccation, groundwater depletion, water pollution and sedimentation, salinization and salt water intrusion, soil erosion and nutrient depletion, and dynamic changes in the coastal wetland systems.

The curve is calculated for several categories of aquatic ecosystem protection —from ‘largely natural’ to ‘severely modified’. The corresponding environmental flows progressively reduce with the decreasing level of ecosystem protection. A non-linear data transformation procedure subsequently converts the calculated environmental flow duration curve into a continuous time series of environmental flows. The software has facilities to zoom on a river basin, calculate a variety of hydrological characteristics, define or select any category of ecosystem protection, calculate the associated environmental flow duration curves and time series and display both. The analyses can be carried out either using default (simulated) global flow data, with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degree, or a user-defined file.

We evaluate household preferences for \{WSSs\} using a choice experiment and latent class modeling techniques. Results indicate the presence of three classes. The majority of households (≈92%) belong to two equally-sized classes, a relatively privileged group (i.e. wealthier, better educated, etc.) with strong preferences for supplemental irrigation and a less privileged group that is mainly interested in improved domestic water services. The remaining class’ preferences are dominated by the cost attribute and are consistent with households facing severe cash constraints. Estimated welfare effects reveal that \{WSSs\} disproportionately benefit the privileged, although this disparity is mitigated with the provision of domestic water. These findings highlight the potential welfare gains from \{WSS\} investments, but stress the need for multi-purpose water resource development and the potential for elite capture. "

abstract = "The Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture (CA) seeks answers to the question of how freshwater resources can be developed and managed to feed the world's population and reduce poverty, while at the same time promoting environmental security. The \{CA\} pays particular attention to rice as this crop is the most common staple food of the largest number of people on Earth (about 3 billion people) while receiving an estimated 24–30% of the world's developed freshwater resources. Rice environments also provide unique—but as yet poorly understood—ecosystem services such as the regulation of water and the preservation of aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity. Rice production under flooded conditions is highly sustainable. In comparison with other field crops, flooded rice fields produce more of the greenhouse gas methane but less nitrous oxide, have no to very little nitrate pollution of the groundwater, and use relatively little to no herbicides. Flooded rice can locally raise groundwater tables with subsequent risk of salinization if the groundwater carries salts, but is also an effective restoration crop to leach accumulated salts from the soil in combination with drainage. The production of rice needs to increase in the coming decades to meet the food demand of growing populations. To meet the dual challenges of producing enough food and alleviating poverty, more rice needs to be produced at a low cost per kilogram grain (ensuring reasonable profits for producers) so that prices can be kept low for poor consumers. This increase in rice production needs to be accomplished under increasing scarcity of water, which threatens the sustainability and capability to provide ecosystem services of current production systems. Water scarcity is expected to shift rice production to more water‐abundant delta areas, and to lead to crop diversification and more aerobic (nonflooded) soil conditions in rice fields in water‐short areas. In these latter areas, investments should target the adoption of water‐saving technologies, the reuse of drainage and percolation water, and the improvement of irrigation supply systems. A suite of water‐saving technologies can help farmers reduce percolation, drainage, and evaporation losses from their fields by 15–20% without a yield decline. However, greater understanding of the adverse effects of increasingly aerobic field conditions on the sustainability of rice production, environment, and ecosystem services is needed. In drought‐, salinity‐, and flood‐prone environments, the combination of improved varieties with specific management packages has the potential to increase on‐farm yields by 50–100% in the coming 10 years, provided that investment in research and extension is intensified.

In order to assess the effect of these exclosures on water balances, a correct assessment of evapotranspiration is needed. A common method for calculating evapotranspiration employs the reference evapotranspiration in combination with a crop coefficient. However, for natural vegetation, these crop coefficients are not readily available. Therefore, the objective of this study was to derive crop coefficients for semiarid natural vegetation using two different approaches. The crop coefficients were assessed with the dual crop coefficient approach as outlined in the \{FAO\} Irrigation and Drainage Paper n°56 and compared with crop coefficients derived from a simple soil water balance. A good agreement between both methods was found. The mid-season crop coefficients ranged from 0.50 to 0.85 for open vegetation with small shrubs and from 0.85 to 0.95 for well developed shrubland. Vegetation with a closed tree canopy was characterized by a mid-season crop coefficient between 0.95 and 1.1. Additionally, a significant logarithmic relation between vegetative soil cover and crop coefficient was found. Using this relation, crop coefficients can be easily derived for semiarid shrub savannahs in similar environments and used for the calculation of evapotranspiration. "

Of the two soil types tested, the more permeable sand media clogged more than the loam, but still retained an order of magnitude higher absolute permeability. A 6- to 8-fold difference in hydraulic loading rates was observed between the four source water types tested (one potable water and three recycled waters), with improved water quality resulting in significantly higher infiltration. Infiltration rates for ponding depths of 30 cm and 50 cm were higher than 10 cm, although for 50 cm clogging rates were higher due to greater compaction of the clogging layer. Overall, physical clogging was more significant than other forms of clogging. Microbial clogging becomes increasingly important when the particulate concentrations in the source waters are reduced through pre-treatment and for finer textured soils due to the higher specific surface area of the media. Clogging by gas binding took place in the glasshouse but not in the lab, and mechanical clogging associated with particle rearrangement was evident in the sand media but not in the loam. These results offer insight into the soil, water quality and operating conditions needed to achieve viable \{SAT\} systems. "

However, despite international acceptance of the approach, it is not widely implemented. This paper provides one of the first case study based assessments of the Critical Path approach. The analysis of two contrasting Ramsar sites is presented in order to better understand the barriers to implementation in different development contexts. These are the Lobau wetland in Austria, where management institutions and regulatory frameworks are highly developed; and the Inner Niger Delta in Mali, where the capacity to implement \{IWRM\} is less evolved. A planning approach is proposed which involves structured and transparent methods for assessing ecosystem services and institutional capacity, and is suitable as a tool for identifying, prioritizing and negotiating trade-offs in ecosystem services and improving livelihoods. Based on the analysis, two main barriers to implementation are identified; mismatch between local and national or basin level priorities, and a lack of recognition of the ecosystem services provided by wetlands.

abstract = "This paper has its primary focus on the analysis of perceptions and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for composted municipal solid and faecal waste among urban and peri-urban farmers and other potential compost users in Ghana. Participatory rural appraisal and contingent valuation methods (CVM) were used for the demand analysis. Most respondents were clear and firm in their responses to the principal question about \{WTP\} for compost, as well as in giving their views and perceptions about issues involved in demand for compost. The probit analysis proved valuable in highlighting variables, which explain variations in the WTP. The \{WTP\} analysis allowed the quantification of the compost demand under different scenarios of subsidized and non-subsidized compost production, with due allowance for a local reference price to cover compost station operating costs. The analysis revealed that the effective demand for compost for agricultural purposes is marginal and limited by farmers’ transport costs. Only through the additional consideration of the demand of the construction sector can about 25% of the organic waste produced in Ghana’s capital, Accra, be transformed and utilized. Public subsidies appear necessary and could be generated through savings in transport and disposal. Without subsidies, the challenge for an increased agricultural use is how to produce a low-cost but nutrient-rich compost, which can compete with abundant and cheap poultry manure and still achieve the price to maintain a compost station. The experience in Ghana shows that this is hardly possible except through private–public partnerships. "

abstract = "Population growth, urban expansion and economic development are increasing competition for water use between agriculture and other users. In addition, the high rate of soil degradation and declining soil moisture in the Sub-Saharan African Region have called for several crop production management and irrigation options to improve soil fertility, reduce water use by crops and produce ‘more crops per drop of water’. Notwithstanding this, considerable variations exist in the literature on water-use efficiency, \{WUEcwu\} (economic yield per water used) for maize (Zea mays L.) across climates and soil management practices. Different views have been expressed on the effect of different rates of nitrogen (N) application on transpiration efficiency, \{TE\} (biomass produced per unit of water transpired). The objectives of the study were to assess the effect of different rates of N-enriched municipal waste co-compost and its derivatives on TE, \{WUEcwu\} and yield of maize (Z. mays L.) in comparison to inorganic fertiliser. The greenhouse pot experiment was conducted in Accra, Ghana on a sandy loam soil (Ferric Lixisol) using a split plot design. The main plot treatments were soil (S), dewatered faecal sludge (DFS), municipal solid waste compost (C), co-compost from municipal solid waste and dewatered faecal sludge (Co), compost enriched with (NH4)2SO4 (EC), co-compost enriched with (NH4)2SO4 (ECO), (NH4)2SO4 and NPK15–15–15 + (NH4)2SO4. The sub-plot treatments were different rates of application of nitrogen fertiliser applied at the rate of 91, 150 and 210 kg N ha−1 respectively. Maize cv. Abelehii was grown in a poly bag filled with 15 kg soil. Eight plants per treatment were selected randomly and used for the collection of data on growth parameters forth-nightly. At physiological maturity two plants per treatment were also selected randomly from each treatment plot for yield data. The results showed that \{TE\} of maize (Z. mays) varied for the different treatments and these are 6.9 Pa in soil (S) alone to 8.6 Pa in ECO. Increase in N application rate increased \{TE\} at the vegetative phase for fast nutrient releasing fertilisers (DFS, ECO, EC, \{NPK\} + (NH4)2SO4, (NH4)2SO4) and at the reproductive phase for slow nutrient releasing fertilisers (C and CO). Water-use efficiency increased significantly as rate of N application increased. Treatment \{ECO\} improved crop \{WUEcwu\} and was 11% and 4 times higher than that for \{NPK\} + (NH4)2SO4 or soil alone; and 18–36% higher than those for \{DFS\} and CO. Treatment \{ECO\} used less amount of water to produce dry matter yield (DMY) and grain yield (GY) that was 5.2% and 12.6%, respectively, higher than \{NPK\} + (NH4)2SO4. Similarly, the \{DMY\} and \{GY\} for \{ECO\} was 8.9–18.5% and 23.4–34.7%, respectively, higher than \{DFS\} and CO. High nutrient (N and K) uptake, TE, and low leaf senescence accounts for 83% of the variations in \{DMY\} whereas \{WUEcwu\} accounts for 99% of the variations in GY. Thus, the study concluded that different sources of fertiliser increased \{TE\} and \{WUEcwu\} of maize differently as N application rate increases. "

Textile labourers living in the same village as the wastewater farmers showed a lower risk of hookworm infection than wastewater farmers but an increased risk compared with farming households using regular irrigation water. Many urban and peri-urban farmers make a living by using untreated wastewater in the production of fresh produce for the urban market. Banning the use of untreated wastewater would deprive these farmers of their livelihood and affect food supply for the urban population. If treatment of wastewater is not a feasible option, the promotion of footwear and improved hygiene, the construction of toilets, in combination with regular anthelminthic treatment, would be suitable alternatives to safeguard the health of wastewater farmers and their children.

This is mainly attributed to the adoption of ad hoc management strategies and techniques without considering the geometry and nature of the aquifer together with area-specific parameters, such as soil cover and lithological units. Knowledge of net groundwater recharge (R) and groundwater draft, the two components responsible for changes in groundwater storage (ΔS), is important for assessing the groundwater resources and for the implementation of watershed programs. In the present study, geophysical and hydrogeological investigations were performed to decipher the aquifer geometry and its extent to estimate the groundwater resources and selection of suitable sites for rainwater harvesting.

These frameworks have been widely used in various relevant policy research-related \{CPRs\} in South and Southeast Asia as well, especially in case of irrigation, forestry, and fisheries. The empirical case studies presented in this chapter provide applicability and usefulness of those frameworks in varying contexts. Her frameworks are helpful to analyze the robustness of \{CPRs\} and the evolution of institutional rules in managing those resources in a Southeast Asian context as well; however, some suggestions are made at the end of this chapter for wider applicability.

In regions of low and erratic rainfall, they provide important opportunities for agriculture and fisheries and are often vital for food security. However, overutilization and some farming practices can result in environmental degradation and the loss of valuable ecosystem services. The Lake Chilwa wetland, a complex aquatic ecosystem comprising a shallow open water lake surrounded by marsh and floodplain grassland, is one of the most important wetlands in Malawi. Most of the 1 million people who live in the vicinity of the lake derive their livelihoods from the wetland. Increases in population in recent decades have increased the pressures on the wetland. In light of continued population growth, it is anticipated that some levels of resource use may be difficult to sustain in the long-term. Consequently, planning the use of wetland resources is a priority if the diverse benefits that local communities presently receive are to be sustained. Baseline wetland information is needed to determine appropriate sustainable management plans, as well as to identify limits to resilience. However, for many wetlands in southern and eastern Africa, these data are lacking, or not available to those who need them. This paper provides an overview of the distribution and characteristics of wetlands in Malawi. Using Lake Chilwa as an example, it illustrates how Earth Observation data, in combination with hydrometric and botanical data, can be used to provide information crucial for sustainable wetland management.

This article presents a simplified approach to map rice (Oryza sativa L.) water consumption, yield, and water productivity (WP) in the Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB) by combining remotely sensed imagery, national census and meteorological data. The statistical rice cropped area and production data were synthesized to calculate district-level land productivity, which is then further extrapolated to pixel-level values using \{MODIS\} \{NDVI\} product based on a crop dominance map. The water consumption by actual evapotranspiration is estimated with Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEB) model taking meteorological data and \{MODIS\} land surface temperature products as inputs. \{WP\} maps are then generated by dividing the rice productivity map with the seasonal actual evapotranspiration (ET) map. The average rice yields for Pakistan, India, Nepal and Bangladesh in the basin are 2.60, 2.53, 3.54 and 2.75 tons/ha, respectively. The average rice \{ET\} is 416 mm, accounting for only 68.2% of potential ET. The average \{WP\} of rice is 0.74 kg/m3. The \{WP\} generally varies with the trends of yield variation. A comparative analysis of ET, yield, rainfall and \{WP\} maps indicates greater scope for improvement of the downstream areas of the Ganges basin. The method proposed is simple, with satisfactory accuracy, and can be easily applied elsewhere. "

Much of the recent attention to the issue has however focused on transboundary aspects, while we know rather less about the nature and dynamics of local water conflict and cooperation. Drawing on the work of the collaborative Competing for Water Research Programme, this article presents selected findings from a quantitative and qualitative mapping and exploration of water conflict and cooperation events in Namwala District of Zambia. It is found that local water competition situations often involve both conflictive and cooperative events in a dynamic succession of each other, but also that the majority of events are conflictive, and that they primarily take place between different types of water uses, and less frequently among the same types of uses. There is a distinct tendency for both conflictive and cooperative events to originate in the dry season, and many events are associated with water infrastructure development, particularly boreholes. The study found that most conflictive and cooperative events took place within individual communities, and only to a lesser extent between two or more communities or between districts. While third parties are involved in some events, these are primarily local village institutions such as Headmen. The article concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for local water governance, including the need to ensure that the very localized nature of such conflict and cooperation events is taken into consideration in the institutional development of IWRM.

Study focus Improved knowledge of flow variability is therefore paramount, especially in remote catchments, rarely gauged, and inhabited by vulnerable populations. We present simple multivariate power-law relationships for estimating streamflow metrics in ungauged areas, from easily obtained catchment characteristics. The relations were derived from weighted least square regression applied to streamflow, climate, soil, geographic, geomorphologic and land-cover characteristics of 65 gauged catchments in the Lower Mekong Basin. Step-wise and best subset regressions were used concurrently to maximize the prediction R-squared computed by leave-one-out cross-validations, thus ensuring parsimonious, yet accurate relationships. New hydrological insights for the region A combination of 3–6 explanatory variables – chosen among annual rainfall, drainage area, perimeter, elevation, slope, drainage density and latitude – is sufficient to predict a range of flow metrics with a prediction R-squared ranging from 84 to 95%. The inclusion of forest or paddy percentage coverage as an additional explanatory variable led to slight improvements in the predictive power of some of the low-flow models (lowest prediction R-squared = 89%). A physical interpretation of the model structure was possible for most of the resulting relationships. Compared to regional regression models developed in other parts of the world, this new set of equations performs reasonably well. "

The present study fills this gap by analyzing \{WP\} in Bangladesh using panel data of 21 districts over 37 years (1968–2004) divided into three phases. It estimated levels of, and trends in, \{WPs\} of one irrigated rice (rabi) crop, and two mainly rain-fed (kharif) rice crops, with occasional supplementary irrigation. Also examined were \{WPs\} for rice crops in irrigated and rain-fed ecosystems. The findings indicated that \{WP\} levels in Bangladesh were significantly lower than that by global standards. Overall, \{WP\} growth rates varied significantly among districts and between phases with no consistent pattern emerging. On the whole, \{WPs\} trended upwards while differing widely among districts and between phases, seasons, ecosystems and areas differentiated by physiographic characteristics. The 1980s represented a period of stagnation. Drought-prone areas grew faster while salinity-prone areas grew slower vis-à-vis non-drought and non-saline areas. In the Ganges-dependent area, \{WP\} grew faster than that in the non-Ganges-dependent area. Rice production in Bangladesh represented a highly groundwater-dependent and fossil fuel-using process with significant environmental implications suggesting that \{WP\} growth may be unsustainable. Sustaining \{WP\} growth required a range of market and non-market-based policy options. "

Studies of pedogenesis associated with altitudinal variation, vegetation type and soil carbon content on the same type of parent rock are very limited in inter-tropical mountain areas. Therefore the altitudinal variation of soil pedogenesis through 9 selected profiles from the altitude of 1340 m to 3143 m asl, the summit of the Fan Si Pan Mountain, in the north of Vietnam was examined. Fan Si Pan Mountain is composed of a homogenous alkaline granite rock and is the highest point of the Inter-tropical Continental Asia. The Soil Organic Matter properties (C, N, δ13C and δ15N contents) of the different grain-size fractions of the topsoil of 4 selected profiles corresponding to different ecosystems were also examined. Three zones of different soil forming processes were present: Acrisols and Alisols at lower altitudes in sub montane forest, Podzols formed in montane and upper montane forest while Umbrisols formed at high altitude where the forest vegetation had given way to a shrubby vegetation or a steppe composed of dwarfed bamboo. With altitude, soils become sandier, have higher concentration of SiO2 and are lower in Al2O3. The selective Fe and Al oxalate (Feo and Alo) and pyrophosphate (Fep and Alp) extracts show a clear discrepancy between Acrisols or Umbrisols with no clear variation with soil depth and Podzols with high enrichment in their Bs horizon. The \{SOM\} status is highly dependent of the organic matter input by the vegetation. In Acrisols, the \{SOC\} is linked to the fine fraction within the soil profile with rapid turnover and low C/N values. Podzols are formed by the accumulation on soil surface of \{OM\} enriched in the coarse fraction with depleted δ15N and high C/N values. The organic matter input is exogenic and probably seasonal from leaves forming the surface litter while in Acrisols or Umbrisols the \{SOC\} is mainly linked to the fine fraction, and with constant δ15N values at depth. In Umbrisols, the \{SOC\} origin seems to be linked with endogenic inputs deep in the soil profile mostly produced by the decay of bamboo roots. In this tropical mountainous soil catena, the soil carbon mineralization depends not only on temperature and organo-metallic complexes that stabilize the non labile carbon pool but also is controlled by the pedogenetic process, which is linked with the vegetal ecosystem change with altitude.

Percolation of fresh irrigation waters has formed a relatively-fresh groundwater lens above the underlying native salty groundwater layer. The thickness of this relatively-fresh groundwater lens varies from a few meters to 150 m. The costs involved in the installation of horizontal subsurface drains to extract the water are prohibitive. Alternatively, shallow wells with small discharge rates, commonly known as the skimming wells, can be used to extract the relatively-fresh groundwater. Extraction of this water from inappropriate depths and at inappropriate rates will cause ‘upconing’ of the ‘interface’ between the relatively-fresh groundwater lens and salty groundwater layer, and draw marginal quality water to the root zone, resulting in an increase in salinity and sodicity. In this paper, two numerical models, \{MODFLOW\} (McDonald and Harbough, 1988) and \{MT3D\} (Zheng, 1990) were used to model the interface movement in an unconfined aquifer in Punjab, Pakistan. Data collected by Kemper et al. (1976) was used to calibrate and validate the models. Subsequently, the sensitivity of the depth to watertable, discharge rate, thickness of the relatively-fresh groundwater lens, well penetration ratio, and daily operating hours on the salinity of pumped groundwater was studied. The results show that skimming wells of 10–18 l/s discharge rates can be installed and operated successfully with 60–70% well penetration ratio for an operating time of 8–24 h per day from an unconfined aquifer with 15–18 m thick relatively-fresh groundwater lens.

This paper examines why salinity of soil and irrigation water is common and nearly inevitable in the irrigated lands of the semi-arid tropics and subtropics. It considers opportunities for and constraints in making management changes that would increase the productivity of water (i.e., the yield per unit of water diverted from the source or consumed in evapotranspiration) at system and basin level. Success of water management interventions in reducing the impact of abiotic stresses on rice production under saline conditions and on acid soils depends on improved control over the components of the water and ion balances at field and basin level. One of these measures is the installation of drainage systems. The benefits and costs of sub-surface drainage are illustrated by an example from Egypt's Nile Delta. An integrated approach to water resource management is an essential but not sufficient condition to prevent conflicts between different users and consumers of the scare resource. "

Groundwater in a coastal part of Arani-Koratalaiyar river basin located north of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India was assessed to determine its suitability for domestic purpose and to delineate the region affected by seawater intrusion. Fluoride concentration in groundwater samples from forty nine locations varied from 0.02 mg/l to 2.9 mg/l with an average of 0.5 mg/l. As per the Bureau of Indian Standards, the permissible range of fluoride in drinking water is 0.6–1.5 mg/l. Fluoride concentration in groundwater of this area exceeds 1.5 mg/l in 6% of the groundwater samples and is below 0.6 mg/l in 74% of the groundwater samples. There is no known geological source for fluoride in this area. Spatial variation in fluoride concentration in groundwater indicates that the coastal areas have comparatively high fluoride due to seawater intrusion which was similar in comparison with \{EC\} and bromide concentration measured in groundwater. This study indicates that fluoride can be used as an indicator of seawater intrusion in coastal areas. "

The analysis uses outputs from two recent projects to critically examine various theories of environmental change and the ‘fit’ of new river basin management strategies to the problems found, arguing that various perspectives are worryingly at odds with each other. We find that the investigators of the two projects presented a reasonable and sufficient case of the causes of water scarcity. Yet despite efforts to disseminate scientific findings, different stakeholder groups did not agree with this case. This, we believe, was due to three combined factors; firstly highly entrenched views existed that were also based on quasi-scientific reasoning; secondly, the projects’ deliberations to date, in acknowledging their own uncertainty, were not assertive enough in ascribing causation to the various processes of change; thirdly, policy-uptake was not sufficiently managed by the scientists involved. We conclude that this complexity of the science–policy interface is a feature of integrated water resources management (IWRM) and that the norms of scientific uncertainty in the face of competing theories (held by their protagonists with greater certainty) obliges scientists to take a more active role in sensitively managing the advice-to-policy process in order to improve management of water within river basins. Thus, the paper argues, the nature of integrated water resources management is one of ‘action research’ to move towards an improved understanding of change, and of ‘action policy-advising’ to draw policy-makers into a cycle of considered decision-making.

Different approaches have been established as possible directions towards green computing. Virtualization, Cloud computing, Energy minimization, reduction in use of hazardous substances in electronic items etc are a few approaches. Though major focus has shifted towards energy minimization, other approaches have churned themselves out as new subjects – cloud computing. Green computing encompasses a wide range of things. One of them is e-waste management. End of life electronic equipments known as e-waste is a threat to the whole world. Globally 41.8 million metric tonnes of e-waste was generated in 2014. These electronic items are the hardware part of the computer. The proper management of e-waste hence leaves a good potential to implement green computing. An overwhelming amount of research articles focusing on green computing are present and major focus is on energy minimization, efficient algorithms and cloud computing. Literature on green computing focusing on e-waste management is scant. The research questions aroused are as follows. Is it actually possible to implement green computing using e-waste management? What are the issues pertaining to it? How can this be achieved? How sustainable it this approach? The study tries to answer these questions. The main objective of this study is to establish e-waste management as a parameter for green computing. The study also intends to check the sustainability potential of this approach. The paper will help the stakeholders, practitioners, researchers and decision makers for choosing a benchmark approach and will pave directions for future research. "

Alternatively, spatial and temporal characteristics of surface soil moisture are estimated through satellites. Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) is one of such satellites that estimate surface soil moisture in an operational context. These estimates need validation prior to use in various hydrological and water management applications. Such validations are normally carried out using field measurements of soil moisture. This is not technically feasible in vast river basins such as the Indus Basin and for pixel sizes of 25 km × 25 km with non-homogeneous soils and land use. Therefore, AMSR-E data interpreted with Njoku model and posted by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) for the Indus Basin is evaluated by comparing it against auxiliary spatial data. The auxiliary data exists of (i) land use, (ii) rainfall from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, (iii) seasonality of vegetation from SPOT-Vegetation and (iv) saturated water content (θsat) inferred from soil maps. A strong relationship was observed between rainfall and surface soil moisture in the land use class “rainfed”. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (rs) between the soil moisture and rainfall ranged from 0.14 to 0.55 with a mean of 0.36. For irrigated land uses, rs ranged from −0.04 to 0.52 with a mean of 0.29 due to control of soil moisture by irrigation water supply. The temporal analysis of soil moisture data with vegetation time series showed resemblance with growth phenology. Higher Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) between the soil moisture and vegetation development was found for time lags of a few weeks. The daily maximum values estimated by AMSR-E ranged from 0.08 to 0.38 cm3 cm−3. The maximum values were near, but below θsat limits for different soil types. AMSR-E captured the flooding processes during July and August 2010 by showing the soil moisture values to approximate the saturated soil moisture content for areas that are reported to be flooded. This suggests that the absolute AMSR-E soil moisture data from \{NSIDC\} are accurate in the upper range of land wetness. It is concluded that AMSR-E surface soil moisture data exhibits spatio-temporal behavior, and the trends agree with auxiliary spatial data sets. "

Hyperspectral imagers, currently available on airborne platforms, provide increased spectral resolution over existing space-based sensors that can document detailed information on the distribution of vegetation community types, and sometimes species. Development of spectral libraries of wetland species is a key component needed to facilitate advanced analytical techniques to monitor wetlands. Canopy and leaf spectra at five sites in California, Texas, and Mississippi were sampled to create a common spectral library for mapping wetlands from remotely sensed data. An extensive library of spectra (n = 1336) for coastal wetland communities, across a range of bioclimatic, edaphic, and disturbance conditions were measured. The wetland spectral libraries were used to classify and delineate vegetation at a separate location, the Pacheco Creek wetland in the Sacramento Delta, California, using a PROBE-1 airborne hyperspectral data set (5 m pixel resolution, 128 bands). This study discusses sampling and collection methodologies for building libraries, and illustrates the potential of advanced sensors to map wetland composition. The importance of developing comprehensive wetland spectral libraries, across diverse ecosystems is highlighted. In tandem with improved analytical tools these libraries provide a physical basis for interpretation that is less subject to conditions of specific data sets. To facilitate a global approach to the application of hyperspectral imagers to mapping wetlands, we suggest that criteria for and compilation of wetland spectral libraries should proceed today in anticipation of the wider availability and eventual space-based deployment of advanced hyperspectral high spatial resolution sensors.

In addition, due to climate change more frequent extreme precipitation may also increase the frequency and intensity of flash floods. In this study, a hydrologic model \{H08\} has been applied over the basin at a relatively fine grid resolution (10 km). The impacts of climate change are assessed by using the super-high-resolution MRI-AGCM3.2S with \{A1B\} scenario through three time-slice experiments; the base-period (1979–2003), the near-future (2015–2039), and the far-future (2075–2099) periods. This study investigates the spatio-temporal changes and the changes in the frequency of precipitation and runoff with different magnitude ranges and finds the implications for water resources management under climate change. Results show that, (a) the projected maximum increment of mean annual precipitation (runoff) is +23% (+34%) and +31% (+39%) during the near-future and the far-future, respectively, (b) the projected increment of median value of monthly discharges at basin outlet is significantly high in wet period (May-July), ranging from 38 to 44% and 25–104% in the near-future and the far-future, respectively. Moreover, the monsoonal peaks are expected to come about 1 ∼ 1.5 month earlier, which ultimately lead to higher possibility of earlier flash flood in the future. This anticipated higher increment in peak discharge as well as future shifting of seasonal cycle of river discharge will have significant implications for agriculture and flood disaster management. Findings will also contribute to enhance water resource management in the basin and improve the design of adaptive measures. "

We explore the challenges faced in developing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research approaches and then present a simple yet innovative socio-hydrological approach using participatory three-dimensional maps. As a case study, we describe undertaking this process in Ethiopia where two three-dimensional maps (men's and women's) were separately generated to represent the same 20 km2 landscape. Mapping results indicated important distinctions in how men and women view landscapes with regard to the number and types of ecosystem services identified. For example, only women identified holy water sites along streams, while men identified twice as many sacred trees on the landscape. There was a clear focus and detailed knowledge about soils among participants in both groups. Maps developed as part of this exercise were successfully used as the principal land use input for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and results indicate that this is a valid strategy that enhances scientific knowledge and understanding of overall landscapes and ultimately adds value to research for development questions.

We compared no-till with a mulch-providing cover crop with conventional tillage without cover crop. Side effects were also investigated, weeds, surface crusting, soil macrofauna, infiltration, porosity and roots. The study site was a flat sandy clay loam. Treatments were maintained over five years; within this period, the time between the first and last soil sampling was exactly four years. Both times the same profile locations and exactly the same depths were sampled thereby greatly reducing inherent soil variability. Soil was sampled at five increments from 0 to 40 cm depth. The biomass contributions of maize, cover crop and weeds were measured. The main findings were: (1) The cover crop that was alleged to supply extra inputs to the no-till system failed to do so because the weeds in the tillage treatment became as efficient in accumulating biomass as the planted cover crop. (2) With equal organic inputs over four years (43.0 Mg dry weight ha−1 incorporated into the soil under conventional tillage, and 44.2 Mg dry weight ha−1 remaining on the soil surface as mulch under no-till), the tillage system stored (0–40 cm) significantly soil carbon (+590 g C m−2), whereas the no-till lost carbon (−133 g C m−2). The difference between the systems was significant. Carbon accumulated just below the plough layer. Nitrogen stocks remained unchanged. A very significant lowering of the C:N ratio occurred under no-till. The process of transforming the available biomass on the soil surface into organic matter is apparently too slow to avoid direct losses under no-till. Alternatively, ploughing plant residues into the soil enables to capture some of what would otherwise be lost as \{CO2\} through decay, thereby increasing soil carbon. (3) In the last three years of the experiment, maize grain yields and crop residues stabilized at a lower level but were significantly higher under no-till, 16% and 34%, respectively. Higher yields were attributed to more soil water under no-till due to improved soil structure, though bulk density was not affected. The mulch layer protecting the soil surface favoured infiltration by keeping it crust-free. Water availability was further promoted by a better connectivity of pores and more macrofauna. However, the no-till system depended heavily on fertilizers and herbicides. The lack of effectiveness of herbicides against shifting weed communities threatens the continuation of the system. "

The current study was undertaken on an Arenic Acrisol located in Northeast Thailand (i) to assess whether subsoil physical characteristics influence crop rooting depth, and (ii) to compare the benefits associated with conventional tillage with that of localised subsoil loosening on crop performance and selected soil attributes. Control plots consisted of disk ploughing; the implemented treatments were conventional deep-ripping and localised slotting below the planting line. A crop rotation consisting of a legume followed by maize was established annually to assess the impact of these treatments on crop performance. In the control treatment, root development was restricted to the topsoil (0–20 cm) due to high subsoil bulk density (&gt;1.6 Mg m−3). After deep-ripping, no improvement was observed in bulk density, rooting depth and in crop performance. The implementation of a slotting treatment systematically improved root development in the slotted subsoil, root impact frequency increasing from &lt;0.2 to 0.6–0.8 (P = 0.01) despite no change in the bulk densities of the subsoil. This systematic improvement in root development could be explained by (i) reduced slumping that enable root development prior to recompaction and/or (ii) preferential drainage in the slot and therefore decreased resistance to root penetration. In a dry year maize yield was improved by 78% (P = 0.01); the deep-rooting legume Stylosanthes was tested only a wet year and its biomass production increased by &gt;40% (P = 0.03). This study highlights the detrimental impact of subsoil compaction on root development and the potential role of slotting in coarse textured soils as a long-term management tool in addressing adverse subsoil physical characteristics that limit deep-rooting.

Less is known however, on the impacts that flow from the use of arsenic rich groundwater for irrigation or the effectiveness of arsenic remediation in agricultural systems. To partially fill this gap, we review 29 studies that examine the consequences of irrigating with arsenic contaminated groundwater and 28 studies which evaluate interventions aimed at reducing its negative impacts on human health and crops. These studies are geographically limited to West Bengal and Bangladesh (Bengal plains) as these regions constitute hubs of concerns for groundwater contamination. These studies show that there are six broad categories of interventions: deficit irrigation; soil fertilization; growing alternative field crops (other than paddy); switching to arsenic tolerant paddy cultivars; cooking methods to reduce arsenic content in rice and nutritional supplements. Importantly, these efforts target different stages of the agri-food system, some intervene in production processes and balance concerns for crop yields and human health while others focus on consumption practices and only mitigate health risks. Despite this diversity in focus, our results indicate that all treatments have positive effects, either in reducing As content in grains, its accumulation in soil and/or increase crop yields compared to control groups. However, the extent of these impacts varies as do their implications for long-term agricultural sustainability. From a policy perspective, these interventions offer promising alternatives to the extremes of restricted groundwater use on the one hand, and unregulated extraction on the other, but are yet to be integrated into mainstream extension services.

With increasing application of institutional design across various political, socio-economic and cultural settings, the importance of the context is increasingly accepted. The key question is therefore how to reconcile institutional design and contextual variability. Based on our research on the introduction of water user associations in parts of Turkey, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan, we conclude that a top-down institutional design implemented nation-wide and not involving multiple stakeholders and engaging their views, is doomed to failure. As an alternative, we offer interactive institutional design, which is based on collaborative approaches to institutional design and treats design as works of assemblage. "

The samples were analysed for elemental and isotopic composition and their reactivity using acid hydrolysis and acid dichromate oxidation. The chemical composition of the samples was studied by 13C \{CPMAS\} \{NMR\} spectroscopy and analytical pyrolysis. The lignin content of the samples was determined after CuO oxidation. The two \{BC\} fractions were higher in carbon than the plant material. On an ash-free basis the \{CF\} and \{FF\} sampled from the two different sites had remarkably similar elemental contents. Stable isotope ratios of carbon showed enrichment or depletion depending on the morphological fraction under \{C3\} vegetation. The ratios tended to be depleted in 13C with regards to the plant material in both fractions for samples taken under \{C4\} vegetation. The reactivity of \{BC\} towards dichromate oxidation and acid hydrolysis was lower for \{CF\} compared to FF. 13C \{CPMAS\} \{NMR\} spectroscopy showed that \{BC\} fractions were aromatic but could also show substantial contribution from alkyl and O-alkyl C. Analytical pyrolysis and CuO oxidation indicated that part of the lignin backbone was remaining in all \{BC\} fractions.

The development of both public irrigation in the Jordan Valley and private groundwater schemes in the highlands has diverted a large share of the country's water resources to agriculture. Many policy instruments have been used in the last 10 years to reallocate water to nonagricultural uses and encourage improvements in efficiency throughout the water sector. Demand management has been emphasized, with water pricing policies expected to instill conservation and motivate a shift toward higher-value crops. We examine the rationale for, and potential and current impact of, pricing policies in the Jordan Valley. We describe the likelihood of success of such policies in terms of operation and maintenance cost recovery, water savings and improved economic efficiency, and we explore some of the alternatives available for meeting these objectives. We show that while operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs can be recovered higher water prices have limited potential for achieving gains in irrigation efficiency. The current system of quotas, the lack of storage, and technical difficulties experienced in the pressurized networks indicate that little water can be saved. More substantial increases in water prices can be expected to raise overall economic efficiency by motivating farmers to intensify cultivation, adopt higher-value crops, improve technology, or rent out their land to investors. Yet such strategies are constrained by lack of capital and credit, and pervasive risk, notably regarding marketing. Pricing policies, thus, are best implemented together with positive incentives that reduce capital and risk constraints, and offer attractive cropping alternatives or exit options with compensation.

The temporal variability of annual \{SPM\} fluxes (ranging from 24 to 200 Mt/yr) is strongly related to the interannual hydrological conditions. However, some years of high water flow were not associated with high sediment fluxes, especially after 1989 when the HoaBinh dam came into operation. Therefore, the median discharge pre- (3389 m3/s) and post 1989 (3495 m3/s) are similar indicating there was little or no change between both periods. Sediment rating curves (power law-type; \{SPM\} = aQb) were fitted for both periods (1960–1989; 1990–2008). The analysis of the pre- and post-1989 sediment rating parameters (a, b) suggests a downshift of b-parameter values after 1989, attributed to a decrease of the sediment supply due to the commissioning of the HoaBinh dam. A single sediment rating curve derived from 1960–1989 data was used to simulate the annual variability of former sediment delivery, generating excellent cumulative flux estimates (error ~ 1%). In contrast, applying the same rating curve to the 1990–2008 data resulted in systematic and substantial (up to 109%) overestimation. This suggests that the HoaBinh dam reduces annual \{SPM\} delivery to the delta by half, implying important metal/metalloid storage behind the HoaBinh dam. "

In this context, a seven-year time series of SPOT-VEGETATION images is used for mapping snow-covered areas. The spatial and temporal variations of the snow cover are analyzed for the entire High-Atlas region as well as by altitudinal zones. The spatial distribution of snow-covered areas appears logically controlled by elevation, and its temporal fluctuations can be clearly used to identify dry and wet seasons. In addition, a possible control of snowfalls by the Northern Atlantic climate variability, and, in particular, the North Atlantic Oscillation, is highlighted.

To gain insight into how earthworms influence \{SOM\} biogeochemical composition in the aggregates, we carried out elemental and stable isotope analysis, and analytical pyrolysis (Py GC/MS). We also characterized their lignin component after oxidation with cupric oxide (CuO). The C content of smaller size fractions (&lt;500 μm) in the control soil was higher than in the larger fractions. Our study therefore suggests that the aggregate hierarchy concept, which is used to understand soil aggregates and \{SOM\} dynamics in temperate soils, may not be applicable to the tropical Acrisol studied here. Earthworms modified \{SOM\} organization in soil aggregates. Although the isotope analyses were useful for highlighting \{SOM\} enrichment in the earthworm casts, aggregate fractions could not be classified according to particle size. Molecular analyses were necessary to indicate that \{SOM\} in all size fractions of casts consisted of relatively undecomposed material. Protection of the most labile \{SOM\} structures occurred in the smallest aggregate size fraction (50–250 μm). Py GC/MS showed that earthworm casts and control aggregates &lt;2000 μm could be clearly distinguished according to the molecular properties of their SOM. Aggregates larger than 2000 μm, however, were most probably composed of all fractions and were not different.

abstract = "Systems including a long fallow period have proven to be sustainable in the tropics for they enable the transfer of the rich store of nutrients from the vegetation to the ensuing crops. These systems have been mainly studied in the forest zone with a peculiar focus on the maintenance of organic and chemical fertility. By contrast, the effects of the fallow on soil physical properties have not been widely documented especially in the drier areas. The objectives of this paper are: (i) to summarise the fragmented and not readily accessible information on the responses of soil crusting, runoff, water and wind erosion to fallowing in the sub-humid and semi-arid regions of West Africa; (ii) to infer possible scenarios of land use change from the recent past. Two main examples have been taken in northern Ivory Coast and southern Niger. In the Ivorian example, physical properties are restored after a fallow duration of 10 years on sandy clay loam whilst crusts persist over a longer period on sandy soils, partly due to the foraging activities of termites. In the sandy Sahelian soils, cultivation destroys the erosion crusts that develop as the fallow proceeds as a result of dust deposition and colonisation by blue green algae. This crust development is inherent to the Sahelian ecosystem and favours the natural concentration of water resources. The net balance of dust is negative in millet fields (−0.25 t ha−1 per year) and positive in young fallows (+0.68 t ha−1 per year) so that a slight increase in the field/fallow ratio can transform the region from an accumulation zone to a source zone with consequences on regional fertility transfer. Finally, in both regions the sandy soils have specific dynamics that should be accounted in land management planning. Despite a higher water erosion risk, the sub-humid zone offers a better potential for intensification than the semi-arid zone. "

Numerous studies have shown their positive influence on plant growth and soil quality. At the same time, organic matter inputs in compost or vermicompost, produced in the presence of earthworms, are valuable soil amendments that may increase plant growth. However, whether the combination of earthworm activity and organic matter amendments can be a successful approach for soil rehabilitation remains insufficiently studied. The aim of the present study was to determine the interactions between Dichogaster bolaui, an endogeic earthworm species, and compost or vermicompost produced by Eisenia andrei, an epigeic earthworm species, in a degraded tropical soil. We assessed nutrient availability and natural vegetation recovery. Treatments with and without D. bolaui earthworms were compared. The incorporation of both types of organic matter improved soil quality (i.e., higher pH, more C and nutrients) and led to the recovery of vegetation growth (i.e., development of seedlings and higher above- and belowground biomass). Mineral nutrients, on the other hand, had no effect on vegetation development and led to more pollution of groundwater (i.e., higher concentrations of N-NH4+, N-NO3−, K and P). Although we could not draw definite conclusions about whether vermicompost had a more positive effect on plant growth than compost, this substrate improved soil chemical properties compared with compost. Dichogaster bolaui enhanced leaching of N-NH4+, N-NO3− and K when mineral nutrients were used. However overall, D. bolaui had a neutral impact on plant growth when combined with compost, but a negative effect when in combination with vermicompost inputs. In conclusion, this experiment demonstrated that organic matter amendment is an interesting alternative for the rehabilitation of tropical soils. However, negative interactions can occur between local endogeic earthworms and vermicompost. "

In wet season, the corresponding figures were from 1.5 to 2.5 dS m−1 and from 2.0 to 3.0 dS m−1, respectively. Dry season cropping significantly reduced topsoil salinity at both the research sites. Overall peak salinity in non-plowed cropped lands was 25–38% lower than that of fallow lands, and in plowed cropped lands it was about 30–40% less than the non-plowed cropped lands. Multiple linear and non-linear regression models were developed to predict topsoil salinity of the fallow land for both moderately saline and saline soils by using daily rainfall and evaporation as independent variables. The prediction level was not significantly improved when a non-linear model was employed in place of linear model.

Yet, world poverty is largely concentrated in the agrarian societies, which have the potential for agricultural productivity growth. This is particularly true for Sub-Saharan African countries, where the gaps between potential and actual yields remain high. Minimizing this gap through the promotion of modern inputs—such as fertilizer and modern seeds—has been at the core of almost all development strategies in Ethiopia. Among other initiatives, the country has promoted microfinance institutions and member-owned financial cooperatives to alleviate credit constraints of the smallholder farmers. This paper analyzes the impacts of these institutions. Using household survey data and a propensity-score-matching technique, we examine the effects that institutional financial services have on farmers’ adoption of agricultural technology in Ethiopia. The results suggest that access to institutional finance has a significant positive impact on both the adoption and extent of technology use. However, when impacts are disaggregated by type of financial institution and farm size, heterogeneities are observed. In particular, financial cooperatives have a greater impact on technology adoption than microfinance institutions, and the results appear to vary depending on farm size and types of inputs. The paper concludes with implications for policies to promote adoption of modern agricultural inputs. "

Two methodologies are proposed: canal rating equations, and outlet discharge equations. The methodology is applied to a tertiary canal located in the Punjab, Province of Pakistan. Fairness/equity is expressed quantitatively using the Gini index. There is a difference in the estimated discharge depending on the methodology employed, however as we move along the canal the water allowance does not vary significantly with the distance along the canal. Hence for this particular canal the head-middle-tail inequity often reported and generalized in the literature is not observed. The advantage of a quantitative measure of inequity such as the Gini is exemplified by comparing the Gini with that at the secondary canal and also against itself if the tertiary canal could be operated “as designed”. We introduce two new concepts: systematic and operational inequity. Provided the costs of data acquisition can be reduced this technology has the potential to be scaled up and included in future development investments in large scale irrigation systems. Further work exploring the impact of information on stakeholders needs to be undertaken. "

This paper introduces an identification of runoff generation processes and a detection of changes in hydrological regimes supporting Mann–Kendall trend analysis for streamflows. By this, the effective available and future water resources are identified for the Zerafshan. The results for the subbasins in the upper Zerafshan and for the reference station at the upper catchment outlet indicate that glacier melt is the most significant component of river runoff. The Mann–Kendall trend analysis confirms the regime analysis with the shift in the seasonality of the discharge. Furthermore, the results of the Kendall–Theil Robust Line for predicted long-term discharge trends show a decreasing annual discharge. The experience gained during this study emphasizes the fact that the summer flood, urgently required for the large irrigation projects downstream in Uzbekistan, is reduced and more water will be available in spring. Additionally, following the estimation of future discharges in 50 and 100 years the hydrological changes are affecting the seasonal water availability for irrigation. This analysis highlighted that water availability is decreasing and the timing of availability is changing. Hence, there will be more competition between upstream Tajikistan and downstream Uzbekistan. Planned projects within the basin might have to be reconsidered and the changed scenario of water availability needs to be properly taken into account for long-term basin scale water management. "

Innovation is viewed here as being either incremental or radical changes to the products (services) and processes (ways of delivering services) which are typical to the organisation (WaSCs). Product and process innovations may involve changes to some or all of technologies, organisational structure and processes, behaviour and culture, and knowledge and skills within the organisation and its supply chain.

The paper documents the process and results from an inductive research programme of participatory action research undertaken within a large, privately owned \{UK\} WaSC to facilitate infrastructure investment process innovation. Employee narratives during the innovation process from initiation to adoption decision-making were characterised and analysed. The findings suggest that the development and adoption of asset investment process innovations tends to be skewed in favour of opportunities which align with (i) \{UK\} and European Union legislative and regulatory drivers; (ii) WaSC mission policy and goals; (iii) innovation cost advantages over a prescribed period of time; (iv) perceived risks to service provision associated with the introduction of the innovation, and; (v) the extent to which the organisational processes and cultures which act to increase the absorptive capacity of the WaSC to the proposed innovation are already functioning.

Waterlogged vertisols, which cover about 2.7 million hectares in the Ethiopian part of the Blue Nile Basin, are among the high potential soils where management interventions could result in positive impacts. This study utilized soil, climate, crop and livestock productivity data and models to demonstrate intensification strategies which can increase crop-livestock system productivity. To understand the effects of alternative land use and water management interventions on water productivity, the areas have been classified into three drainage status depending on slope classes. Accordingly, non-drainable (0–2%), drainable (2–5%) and naturally drained (&gt;5%) respectively, represented areas where artificial drainage is not feasible, where drainage using broad bed and furrows (BBF) is recommended, and areas where waterlogging is not a problem and no intervention is needed. Early planting of wheat (Triticum spp.) on \{BBF\} instead of the traditional late planting on flat beds in drainable areas and rice (Oryza sativa) cultivation instead of the traditional extensive grazing or growing grass-pea (Lathyrus sativus) on the flat areas provide viable alternative cropping options. Yield data of the crops and biomass of the native grass were obtained from research stations in the area while the effective rainfall and crop water requirement were estimated using \{CROPWAT\} Model. The value of the native grass and crop straw as livestock feed was estimated based on previous works. With respect to effective rainfall, the water productivity increase due to \{BBF\} over the control ranged from 5% to 200%, with an average increase of 57%. Despite higher water consumption of rice, feeding its residues to livestock enhanced the overall economic water productivity of the system as compared to the natural grazing or grass-pea cultivation. This can be accounted for by higher rice biomass productivity and the greater demand for its grain. The study demonstrated that draining the excess water when the slope allows, growing suitable high value crops on non-drainable areas, and integration of livestock into improved land and water management enhance overall agricultural system water productivity.

Driven by the pressure to produce more, even the saline and alkali waters are being increasingly diverted to irrigated agriculture. Development of salinity, sodicity and toxicity problems in soils not only reduces crop productivity and quality but also limit the choice of crops. There are two major approaches to improving and sustaining productivity in a saline environment: modifying the environment to suit the plant and modifying the plant to suit the environment, but the former has been tried more extensively. The available options are mediated through the management of crops/sequences, irrigation water, chemical/amendments and other cultural practices but all must be integrated as per the site specific needs and achieving higher yields on sustainable basis. Some important interventions include appropriate crop/variety selection, blending saline/alkali and fresh water to keep the resultant salinity below threshold, or their cyclic application by scheduling irrigation with salty water at less salt sensitive stages. At the farm/irrigation system level, policy measures like re-allocation of water to higher value crops and those with limited irrigation requirement, spatial re-allocation and transfer of water, adopting policies that favor development of water markets and adequate utilization of groundwater can help in improving water productivity in saline environments. The other viable options include salinity tolerant agro-forestry systems and bio-saline agriculture. Besides technological advances, peoples’ participation and favorable water use and allocation policies need to be put in place for sustainable use of saline/alkali waters. "

For an irrigated area in the Western part of Turkey, the physically based one-dimensional agro-hydrological model \{SWAP\} for water transport and crop growth was applied in a distributed manner to reveal all the terms of the water balance. A combination of point data and distributed areal data was used as input for the model. The emphasis was put on the conversion from available data to required data. Simulations were carried out for the period 1985–1996 and detailed analyses were performed for two successive years, a pre-drought year, 1988, and a dry year, 1989. Irrigation deliveries were reduced substantially in 1989, resulting in a modified water balance. Lateral fluxes to drains were reduced, bottom fluxes were changed from groundwater recharge to capillary rise, evapotranspiration was lower, and, most importantly, relative yield was reduced. All these changes were obtained for specific sites by combining existing soil data with cropping patterns. It was concluded that the use of the \{SWAP\} model in a distributed way is a useful tool to analyze all the components of the water balance for a whole irrigation system. "

Evaporative demand (Eo) in the field was determined by measuring evaporation from open water with a recording evaporation balance. Actual evaporation from the field soil was determined by daily measurement of water content in the top 10 and 20cm layers. Drying was best described by a modified version of the square root of time behaviour model of T.A. Black, W.R. Gardener and G.W.

However, more research is needed to study the combined effects of tillage type and depth and atmospheric evaporativity on the drying characteristics of different soils, and to compare the relative effect of radiation-dominated evaparativity on the evaporation parameters with that of wind-dominated evaporativity.

While safer and environmental friendly pest and disease management methods such as Integrated Pest Management (IPM) are popular around the world, only little effort has been taken to promote \{IPM\} in Sri Lankan vegetable cultivation. Furthermore, farmers have not shown much interest on practicing \{IPM\} in vegetable cultivation. However, the level of \{IPM\} adoption by vegetable farmers and the factors influencing the adoption and strategies to promote \{IPM\} in vegetable cultivation have not been identified. Accordingly, this study was conducted to identify the level of \{IPM\} adoption and factors influencing the adoption of \{IPM\} in vegetable cultivation and to understand the strategies for promoting vegetable \{IPM\} in future. Primary data was collected by interviewing 290 farmer households. ‘Level of adoption’ and ‘farmers’ knowledge’ on nine practices used in \{IPM\} technique were tested and nine socio-economic variables were analyzed to identify the factors influencing the \{IPM\} adoption. Findings indicated that the main income source of the majority (68%) of respondents was from vegetable farming from which at least half of their household income was secured. A total of 47% farmers apply chemical pesticides before pests or diseases appear in the field as a routine activity, and without considering the ‘economic threshold level’. Although the majority (60%) of farmers have used the recommended dosage in spraying, mixing several pesticides when applying was common. According to the findings, although the term \{IPM\} was familiar to 44% of respondents, only 20% s had a certain level of understanding on the \{IPM\} technique. The adoption of \{IPM\} practices among farmers was not at a satisfactory level. Practices known and followed for a long time were better adopted compared to the practices which are relatively novel. Results also showed that despite the adoption of these practices, understanding of farmers regarding the benefits and the appropriate use of such practices was not at a satisfactory level. “Farmers’ knowledge on IPM” had a positive impact while the “proportionate income from vegetable cultivation” was negative on the level of \{IPM\} adoption. In addition, the results showed that gaps in policy and institutional setup, negative attitudes of farmers and officers on \{IPM\} were conduce for the lower adoption level of \{IPM\} in the vegetable cultivation.

Results suggest that the majority of the pump owners benefit from the reforms in two ways: first by having to pay a lower electricity bill for same usage and second through increased profit margins by selling water. This is because in response to the changed incentive structure, water prices rose sharply by 30–50% immediately after metering. In contrast, water buyers have lost out by having to pay higher water charges and face adverse terms of contract. Impact of metering on operation of groundwater markets and volume of groundwater extracted is less clear; they may expand, contract or remain unchanged, though water use efficiency is likely to go up. At current tariff rates, the electricity utilities are likely to earn less revenue than before. These findings are context specific and hold good for West Bengal where high flat tariff had fostered competitive groundwater markets and hence cannot be generalised for other Indian states. "

Despite this attention, documentation of the degree to which benefits are enhanced through construction of built water storage infrastructure in such sites is somewhat scant. This paper examines evidence from eight inland valley sites with recently-built water retention infrastructure (4 in southwest Burkina Faso, 4 in southeast Mali) to determine how economic returns derived from agricultural production have changed through built infrastructure construction. Farmer interviews were undertaken at each site to identify costs and benefits of agricultural production before and after small built infrastructure construction. Overall results indicate that net present value increased substantially after built infrastructure was constructed. The results nonetheless highlight substantial variation in economic impacts across sites. A central variable explaining such variation appears to be the degree to which water retention is exploited for groundwater-based offseason cultivation. These findings will help development planners to better predict the degree and nature of change engendered by water storage projects in inland valley sites, and help to ground-truth grand statements about the development potential of this piece of natural infrastructure.

Since the 1980s, however, malaria has been at a low ebb, while in other areas of Pakistan and neighbouring India malaria is on the increase. This raises the question of whether transmission in the Pakistani Punjab may have been influenced by a change in vector species abundance or composition, possibly induced by environmental changes. To investigate this question, routinely-collected government entomological data for the period 1970 to 1999 for the district of Bahawalnagar, in the Indus Basin irrigation system in the southern Punjab, was analysed. Our findings suggest that Anopheles stephensi has increased in prevalence and became more common than A. culicifacies during the 1980s. This shift in species dominance may be due to the large-scale ecological changes that have taken place in the Punjab, where irrigation-induced waterlogging of soil with related salinization has created an environment favourable for the more salt-tolerant A. stephensi. Some biotypes of A. stephensi are suspected of being less efficient vectors and, therefore, the shift in species dominance might have played a role in the reduced transmission in the Punjab, although further research is needed to investigate the effect of other transmission-influencing factors.

Hence, improving water productivity using regulated deficit irrigation is important to reduce the water consumption while minimizing adverse effects on the crop yield. This study was conducted in the eastern zone of Tigray regional state, Atsibi Womberta district. The aim of this study was to determine the yield and water use efficiency of potato under deficit irrigation practice in the 2012 growing period. The effect of water deficit or water stress on crop yield and water use efficiencies were evaluated. Guasa variety potato was grown under eight (T1–T8) irrigation treatments. The treatments were replicated three times under completely randomized blocks experimental design. Water was applied to every furrow using watering can with fixed interval and variable depth irrigation scheduling technique was selected. Yield of potato was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) affected by water stress (deficit irrigation). The highest yield was found in \{T1\} (18770 kg/ha) which was not subjected to water stress (full water requirement) whereas minimum yield of potato was obtained under the fully stressed treatment \{T8\} (7037 kg/ha). There was no significant different between the yield of \{T1\} (18770 kg/ha) and \{T6\} (14440 kg/ha) which was 25% deficit throughout the growing season. According to the result obtained, stressed at the middle stage was affected more the yield of potato as compared to other treatments. This showed that stressing the crop at flowering/middle stage is sensitive to deficit irrigation. Giving 65% of crop water requirement throughout the growing season is better than stressing the crop only at the middle stage. The second sensitive period for water stress is the late crop stage. Crop water use efficiency was not statistically significant. Though it was not significantly different, \{T6\} (2.86 kg/m3) and \{T4\} (1.60 kg/m3) had the highest and the lowest water use efficiency respectively. This elaborated that applying 75% of crop water requirement has better water use efficiency than optimal or “no stress” irrigation. It can be conclude that using deficit irrigation is a good water management technique to save irrigation water without reducing the yield of potato. For dry land areas like The Tigray regional state of Ethiopia and other similar agro-ecology elsewhere in the world with scarce water and agricultural water management is very poor. The authors of this study would like to recommend farmers, water managers, water use associations and decision makers to use water efficiently using deficit irrigation and increase their agricultural production by expanding irrigable land with the same amount of water in a given irrigation scheme "

Increased water supply, greater delivery capacity and the introduction of downstream control potentially allow more flexible service. In the command area of Maira branch of this system, farmers are anyway abandoning night-time irrigation, as they can meet their needs from improved supply during the day. They practice night irrigation only during the times of peak crop water demand. The rotational delivery system, known as warabandi in the sub-continent and Dauran in Arabian countries, has even broken down in the day in some parts of the command area. This is believed to be typical of systems with more than adequate water supply. A simulation study was undertaken using the CanalMan software developed by Biological &amp; Irrigation Department, Utah State University, Utah Logan, USA. Primary data collected in one distributary canal and the two minors connected to it was utilized for simulations. The feasibility of night-time closure depends on the speed of filling and emptying the canal each day, and the time required to meet full irrigation demand during the day. The results show that where canal lengths are less than 5 km, in this system, there is good potential to make savings, which can be realized at system level through reduced demand on supplemental supplies from Tarbela Dam.

An overview of existing urban wastewater disposal infrastructure, wastewater agriculture practices and quality of water used, the health implications of these practices and the level of institutional awareness of wastewater related issues are presented and compared with wastewater irrigation in other regions of the world where irrigation with wastewater is practiced. Data for the analyses on agricultural practices and health implications were obtained from a sample of 109 farmers using wastewater within the two municipalities. Bhaktapur typified direct utilization of wastewater by pumping from sewers whereas Kirtipur farmers used it indirectly by gravity flow from polluted rivers. Central to the discussion is that farmers here do not always choose to use wastewater but exploit its benefits when obliged to do so. Since the wastewater also changes the hydrology of the watercourse rendering it perennial, many farmers see the benefit of utilizing the resource. The negative attitude of some farmers towards wastewater stemmed from their inability to control wastewater application leading to flooding and loss of crops. The majority of farmers are well aware of negative health impacts particularly those related to skin infections, and they attempt to protect themselves through washing. No change in water quality can be expected without infrastructure investments and wastewater management changes, which are slow in coming due to the lack of institutional awareness about the complexity of the problem. Interaction amongst the various stakeholders through a formalized mechanism, to influence the disposal and reuse of wastewater is suggested. "

The Samanalawewa reservoir is expected to act as an additional storage for irrigation water supply. A study was carried out to investigate the operational behavior of these two reservoirs. The model used in the study is based on stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) and simulation techniques. Since, the direct application of \{SDP\} for two reservoirs is limited by the dimensionality of the problem, a sequential decomposition method is employed in the model. The algorithm employed breaks down the system into single-reservoir subsystems and subsequently, each subsystem’s operation is individually optimized using a \{SDP\} based optimization model and then simulated using a reservoir operation simulation model. The results indicate the usefulness of optimization techniques in planning reservoirs and deriving operational policies for them. The inclusion of the Samanalawewa reservoir reduces the irrigation water supply deficits at the Udawalawe reservoir. "

Most are poorly endowed with good agricultural land. Water resources vary tremendously, both in terms of reserves and consumption. Agriculture is in most cases the main consumer of water. Most arid zone countries have high population growth, and rural population densities are generally much higher than overall population densities. They have a wide disparity in wealth. The arid zones have a surprising diversity of agroecological niches, with edaphic conditions that can deviate substantially from those of surrounding areas. These niches often have a higher biomass or agricultural productivity. At the same time they are vulnerable to natural processes such as primary salinization, wind and water erosion. Increasing pressure of human and livestock population make that these natural environmental stresses lead to accelerated degradation and depletion of soil and water resources. As they exploit the various agroecological niches, the production systems of the arid zones are equally diverse, and cover the full spectrum of land use intensification from pastoral or transhumant livestock systems to rainfed or irrigated cropping systems. These production systems show rapid change under the pressures of environmental degradation, increasing land and water shortage, and the needs of expanding populations. With the exception of irrigation management, the agrometeorological needs of the arid zones have been insufficiently addressed in the past. Perceptions of homogeneity, low agricultural potential, low population density and the logistical problems of providing maintenance and collecting data from remote stations are largely to blame for this situation. Agrometeorological research can have a positive impact on the productivity, resource-efficiency and environmental sustainability of the arid zones by supporting a better characterization of the agricultural environments. Research targeted towards data spatialization and integration of meteorological and remote sensing information will help to alleviate the handicap of sparse meteorological data networks. At the same time these networks will need to be improved through installation of automatic stations and by establishing new partnerships with land users. "

We develop a groundwater vulnerability map describing the potential human health implications of harmful constituents in the Uda Walawe Basin, by overlaying geological and land use data with information describing the irrigation system, the oxygen isotope composition of water bodies, and the concentrations of selected contaminants. Given the limited data available, we examine the spatial distribution of harmful constituents and the potential human health risks. Fluoride poisoning from groundwater is the greatest health threat in our study area, where fluoride concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 9.2 mg/L are associated with a geologic origin. Arsenic occurs in high concentrations, up to 0.4 mg/L, in areas with low recharge, although the source of arsenic is not clear. Nitrate concentrations are low, ranging from 0.4 to 23 mg/L, despite high fertilizer inputs, except in areas with low recharge and non-favourable reducing conditions, where concentrations up to 136 mg/L are found. Faecal bacteria decrease from surface water via shallow groundwater to deep groundwater. Irrigation water appears to play a major role in increasing microbial contamination and diluting inorganic constituents in groundwater. Hence, the most important determinants for mapping groundwater vulnerability are local geology and infiltration of irrigation water. The method we present provides a qualitative, yet practical, alternative to commonly used vulnerability mapping techniques for countries where high human health risk via consumption of groundwater is inevitable, and thus acts as a tool for selecting preventive and curative measures.

To address this need, Molden and Sakthivadivel [Water Resour. Dev. 15 (1999) 55-71] developed a water-accounting procedure for analyzing water use patterns and tradeoffs between users. Their procedure treats groundwater and surface water as a single domain. We adapted this procedure to account for groundwater and surface water components separately, and applied the adapted procedure to the Singkarak–Ombilin River basin, Indonesia, where groundwater is a significant part of the overall water balance. Since 1998, a substantial proportion of water has been withdrawn from Singkarak Lake and diverted out of the basin, resulting in significant impacts on downstream water users and the lake ecosystem. Based on 15–20 years (1980–1999) of hydrometeorological, land use, soil, and other relevant data, a simple groundwater balance model was developed to generate the hydrogeologic information needed for the water-accounting procedure. The water-accounting procedure was then used to evaluate present and potential future water use performance in the basin. By considering groundwater and surface water components separately, a more realistic estimate of water availability was calculated than could be obtained by lumping these components together. Results show that the diversion of 37 m3/s from Singkarak Lake increases the amount of water that is not available for other uses, such as for irrigation, from 57–81 to 81–95% of total water available in the basin. The new water accounting procedure also demonstrates the viability of increasing downstream water supply and water use performance during the dry months (June–September). For example, by increasing irrigation during the wet months (January–April) or tapping water from a shallow, unconfined aquifer during the dry months, while keep maintaining sustainable groundwater levels.

The drying up has resulted in social conflicts between upstream and downstream users. It has also caused adverse impacts on the ecosystem of the Ruaha National Park, disrupting the lives of many animals and causing changes in their behaviour. In this paper we present the findings of a hydrological study conducted to estimate environmental flow requirements. The desktop reserve model was used to determine maintenance high and low flows, and drought low flow requirements within the Ruaha National Park. The results indicate that to maintain the basic ecological functioning of the river requires an average allocation of 635.3 Mm3/a (equivalent to 21.6% of mean annual runoff). This is the average annual maintenance flow; comprising of maintenance low flows (i.e. 15.9% MAR; 465 Mm3/a) and maintenance high flows (i.e. 5.8% of MAR; 170 Mm3/a). The absolute minimum water requirement was estimated to be 0.54 m3/s with the probability of exceedance of 0.99. The study confirms that in the absence of ecological information hydrological indices can be used to provide a first estimate of environmental water requirements. However, before being applied, greater understanding of the relationships between flow and the ecological condition of the riverine ecosystem is required. "

The Dendron dolomitic aquifer in the Northern Province of South Africa is a high potential one by local standards, with yields of about 20 l/s. Some boreholes in the area yield much higher than the average 20 l/s. The aquifer has been the sole source of irrigation water for commercial agriculture for more than 20 years. In the eighties groundwater levels were observed to be declining due to over-abstraction. This trend has continued to the present with current water levels averaging about 50–100 m below ground, a drop of more than 50 m in the last 30 years. In 1991 the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry informed farmers that a management strategy would be required to ensure sustainable use of groundwater. Several steps to manage groundwater were taken. Although users are of the opinion that groundwater levels have been increasing, in fact the rate of groundwater level decrease has been increasing.

Small-scale groundwater irrigation with boreholes provides a good option for poor households, bringing about significant positive impact in consumption expenditure. Groundwater, if adequately harvested, has a significant positive impact on the improvement of livelihoods of smallholding farmers; it is advantageous for the society if government and nongovernmental agencies are engaged in the expansion of deep groundwater wells on a sustainable basis.

The rapid uptake of small private irrigation in South Asia had a proven positive effect on poverty alleviation. In sub-Saharan Africa similar trends are emerging and several studies point to considerable upscaling potential. Achieving this potential would substantially boost smallholder incomes and food security. However, the spread of small private irrigation poses several challenges related to equity, efficiency, and sustainability. Women and resource poor farmers face challenges accessing affordable technologies; market inefficiencies and policy frameworks negatively affect farmer decision-making and technology access; and the unregulated spread of private irrigation may lead to over-abstraction, pollution, and conflicts. In this paper we argue that carefully designed intervention strategies and policy engagement are needed for two reasons. First, there is a need to address potential adverse effects of the ongoing, unregulated spread of small private irrigation while safeguarding its proven benefits on food security and poverty alleviation. Second, relatively straightforward measures can extend the benefits to a broader group of smallholders, including women and the poor, while at the same time ensuring sustainable use of the resource. Based on empirical evidence from case studies in six countries, we identified four elements of such an approach: (1) enhancing technology access; (2) catalyzing smallholder value chains; (3) fostering supportive policies; and (4) strengthening institutional capacity to manage potential trade-offs at the watershed scale.

They buy or rent irrigation equipment and draw water from nearby sources without depending on or without interference from public agencies or water user associations. The individualization of Agricultural Water Management has been ongoing for several decades in South Asia where most irrigation now takes place from privately owned wells. Recently, small private irrigation is emerging also in sub Saharan Africa. It is farmer-driven, responds to a genuine demand from smallholders and has substantial potential for poverty alleviation and rural development. In many countries the area under privately managed and owned irrigation is larger than under public irrigation schemes. However, the individualization of irrigation and its spontaneous, unchecked spread pose challenges to equitable access to and sustainable management of water resources. Irrigation investments and research efforts have largely focused on the underperforming public irrigation sector, ignoring small private irrigation. This special issue describes and analyzes this thriving but overlooked sector, drawing from examples from five countries in sub-Saharan Africa and two states in India. The authors explore ways to enhance the potential of small private irrigation for all, without jeopardizing the sustainability of the available water resources. "

In developed countries, the usual practice of mitigating flood disasters is by structural means which can reduce infrastructural damages as well as casualties but are unaffordable in most developing countries. The alternative then is to look for non-structural means that involve, among other things, early warning systems which can reduce casualties. The basic technical components of an early warning system involves a measurable input data set that trigger floods, a measurable output data set that quantify the extent of flood and an appropriate mathematical model that transforms the input data set into a corresponding output data set. There are many types of mathematical models that can be used to transform the input data into corresponding output data. The crux of this paper is on one type of data driven mathematical models, namely the use of fuzzy logic approach. The reliability and robustness of the approach are demonstrated with daily and 6-hourly discharge predictions in 4 rivers in 3 countries having contrasting climatological, geographical and land use characteristics. The first application is for two tropical rivers in Sri Lanka using daily upstream rainfall and discharge data to predict downstream discharge with the minimum implication function type Mamdani fuzzy inference system. The second application is for another tropical river in Fiji using similar type of data with daily and 6-h time scales. Both Mamdani type fuzzy inference system with minimum and product implication functions as well as Larsen type inference systems were used. In the third application, daily upstream and tributary discharges were used to predict downstream discharges in a temperate-climate river in China using the \{TSK\} type fuzzy inference system with clustering. The methods are robust and the results obtained are within reasonable agreement with observations. "

The developed models were tested for forecasting the downstream water levels of Guilemard and Kuala Krai stations using upstream hourly telemetric water levels of Dabong and Tualang stations. The membership functions (MFs) of triangular shapes with several fuzzy rule sets were utilized to check the efficiency of the fuzzy logic approach for the Kelantan River flood forecasting. For the Guilemard station, models of 8, 10 and 15 rules' sets were tested. In the calibration and validation events, the Guilemard station models' achieved MAE, ranges 0.35–0.45 m, N–S coefficient, ranges 0.87 – 0.89 and Coefficient of Determination ranges, \{R2\} ranges 0.91–0.95. The water level prediction model developed for the Kuala Krai station consisted of 19 rules with triangular shape MFs. It shows the ranges for MAE: 0.26–0.76 m, N–S coefficient: 0.78–0.93 and R2: 0.91–0.96 in calibration and validation periods. The efficiencies of the developed models show acceptable levels according to the tested performance indicators implying the potential of establishing a flood forecasting system by using the fuzzy logic approach in the Kelantan River basin, Malaysia.

This analysis is carried out at high spatial and temporal resolutions (8 × 8 km2 and daily) using observations from rain gauges as a reference for the period covering January 2003 to December 2006. Graphical comparisons and several statistical metrics such as bias, correlation coefficient, and standard deviation of rainfall differences are used to perform the evaluation analysis. Spatial maps of these statistical metrics were developed to assess the spatial dependency in the \{CMORPH\} accuracy. The bias is decomposed into different components, hit, missed, and false, in order to gain additional insight into the possible sources of systematic deviations in CMORPH. Overall, \{CMORPH\} was able to capture the seasonal and spatial patterns of rainfall over the basin, but with varying degrees of accuracy that depend on topography, latitude and lake-versus-land conditions within the basin. The results show that \{CMORPH\} captured rain occurrence relatively well in both wet and dry seasons over the southern part of the basin but it significantly overestimated those over the lake and its southern shore. The bias of \{CMORPH\} in the study area is characterized by seasonal and spatial variations (− 25 to 30% in wet season and − 40 to 60% in dry season). False as well as missed rains contribute significantly to the total rainfall amounts over the basin. Significant levels of the differences are observed at the daily resolution of CMORPH. The relation between \{CMORPH\} and gauge rainfall amounts is stronger (correlation mostly &gt; 0.4) in the wet season than in the dry (mostly &lt; 0.4). "

Sensitivity analysis of the vulnerability index maps highlight the importance of one parameter over another for a given hydrogeological setting, which will help to plan the field investigations based on the most or the least influential parameter. It is recommended to use modified Pesticide \{DRASTIC\} for weathered rock regions with irrigation practises and shallow aquifers (&lt;20 m bgl). The crucial input due to land use should not be neglected and to be considered in any hydrogeological setting. It is better to estimate the specific vulnerability wherever possible rather than the intrinsic vulnerability as overlay and index methods are more suited for this purpose. It is also necessary to consider the maximum and minimum values of input parameters measured during a normal year in the models used for decision making. "

While the literature on \{MAR\} in India is vast, the science of their construction is lacking. Furthermore, there is an absence of a structured approach to evaluate the performance and impact of \{MAR\} interventions. Often, performance and impacts of \{MAR\} have been commented upon together, without distinguishing the two. In this article, we aim to propose that performance and impact are different from each other, and that the evaluation of \{MAR\} interventions should take into account such differences between them. A framework for performance and impact analysis, based on three levels, viz. primary, secondary and tertiary, is outlined. It is then applied to seven selected \{MAR\} interventions in India, Adarsha watershed – Andhra Pradesh, Gokulpura-Goverdhanpura watershed – Rajasthan, Kodangipalayam watershed – Tamil Nadu, Chikalgaon watershed – Maharashtra, Rajasamadhiyala watershed – Gujarat, Satlasana watershed – Gujarat and Sujalam Sufalam Yojana – Gujarat. Although, the evaluations of these case studies reported were not categorized into performance and impact, most of them have addressed both. However, none of them could explicitly demonstrate that reported impacts were uniquely related to \{MAR\} interventions. If impacts are used as a surrogate for performance, it must be shown that impacts are uniquely linked to \{MAR\} interventions. "

Multiple interconnected basins through gates installed in the check banks and backflow at the inlet end are unique features of contour basin layouts used in southeast Australia. Design and management guidelines were developed using a two-dimensional computer simulation model (COBASIM) for contour basin layouts. The computer model was used to simulate and analyse the performance of single- and multiple-basin layouts in response to key design variables including aspect ratio, inflow rates, microtopography, vertical interval between basins and number of interconnecting drainage outlets. The main aim of this study was to provide designers and practitioners with an overall view of the likely impact trends arising from variations in key design factors and to improve design practices. Irrigation performance was measured by the time of advance needed to cover the entire basin area, application efficiency, water requirement efficiency and distribution uniformity. The study revealed that the aspect ratio and local microtopography have a significant impact on the performance in these layouts. A mild slope in the advance direction can improve performance when a small depth of irrigation is required, while there are no significant benefits from increasing the elevation difference between adjacent basins.

The causes of the problems are well known, as are the methods and investments required to manage salt-affected soils and shallow water tables. Yet the problems persist in many regions where farmers apply excessive irrigation water, and where farmers and irrigation departments fail to invest in adequate drainage solutions. Long ago, Professor E.W. Hilgard described the inevitability of salinity problems in arid areas and the measures required to prevent or overcome those problems. Hilgard warned of impending salinization in California's Central Valley, based partly on his understanding of salinity and waterlogging problems in India. More recently, Jan van Schilfgaarde, Jim Oster, and others also have described the inevitable environmental impacts of irrigation. These authors suggest that irrigation likely can be sustained, but the cost of reducing the environmental impacts to an acceptable level might be substantial in some areas. We review the perspectives of these authors, and others, with an outlook toward a future in which the goal of achieving sustainable irrigation coincides with the goal of intensifying agriculture more generally, to provide food and fiber for an expanding global population. We propose five activities that might be implemented in a comprehensive program to achieve successful management of salinity and waterlogging. We also introduce the notion of implementing a deposit or bond payment for the salt contained in irrigation water deliveries. Farmers would be reimbursed in accordance with their salt management and disposal practices. "

Measurements of actual evapotranspiration (Ea) from 90 lysimeter experiments at four locations in the basin were used to calibrate a non-linear regression model that predicted the combined crop coefficient (KcKs) as a function of the ratio of seasonal precipitation (P) to potential evapotranspiration (Ep). Crops included sorghum, pulses (mung bean, chickpea, soybean, pigeonpea) and oilseeds (safflower and sunflower). Ep was calculated with the Penman–Monteith equation using net radiation derived from two methods: (1) a surface radiation budget calculated from satellite imagery (EpSRB) and (2) empirical equations that use data from meteorological stations (EpGBE). The model of Ks as a function P/Ep was combined with a gridded time series of precipitation (0.5° resolution, 1901–2000) and maps of EpSRB to define the probability distributions of P, P/Ep and Ks for sorghum at each 0.5° cell over the basin. Sorghum, a \{C4\} crop, had higher Ea and Ks values than the \{C3\} plants (oilseeds, pulses) when precipitation was low (P &lt; 1 mm d−1) but lower maximum Ea rates (3.3–4.5 mm d−1) compared with \{C3\} crops (oilseeds and pulses, 4.3–4.9 mm d−1). The crop coefficient under adequate soil moisture (Kc) was higher than the FAO-56 crop coefficients by up to 56% for oilseeds and pulses. The seasonal soil moisture coefficient (Ks) for sorghum ranged from 1.0 under high rainfall (July–October) to 0.45 in dry seasons (November–March), showing strong soil moisture controls on Ea. EpSRB calculated at the lysimeter stations was 4–20% lower than EpGBE, with the largest difference in the dry season. Kc derived from EpSRB was only slightly (2–4%) higher than Kc derived from EpSRB, because the maximum Ea occurred during the monsoon when the differences between EpSRB and EpGBE were small. Approximately 20% of the basin area was expected to experience mild or greater soil moisture stress (Ks &lt; 0.80) during the monsoon cropping season 1 year in every 2 years, while 70% of the basin experienced mild or greater stress 1 year in 10. The maps of soil moisture stress provide the basis for estimating the probability of drought and the benefits of supplemental irrigation. "

The model-estimated irrigated areas by tertiary canals were in close agreement with actual values for both the Aus (early summer) and Aman (autumn) rice seasons. However, the agreement was better for the Aus season than for the Aman season which received much more rainfall.

In this work we investigate the processes that underpin this phenomenon by means of field experiments and modelling. The study area is located in northern Laos. Rainfall simulations were conducted in two 1-m2 plots using a portable field simulator. The drop size distribution and kinetic energy were similar to that occurring on the occasion of tropical downpours. Soils exhibited a clay loam texture and very similar organic matter contents across experimental plots, but differed greatly in slope gradient (30% and 75%). Runoff water samples were collected at intervals ranging from 1 to 3 min, depending on the runoff intensity. Plots microtopography was measured before and after rainfall simulations using an automatic surface roughness meter on a 1-cm grid. High-resolution bulk density images were obtained from soil slices using a standard X-ray generator. Final infiltration rates of 6 and 21 mm h−1; soil detachment of 667 and 310 g m−2; surface lowering due to soil loss of 0.82 and 0.38 mm; surface lowering due to compaction of 1.21 and 0.90 mm; percentage area with sieving crust of 36% and 90%; percentage area with erosion crust of 63% and 0%; were obtained for the 30% and 75% slopes, respectively. Three main conclusions can be drawn from this work: (1) high intensity rainfall can rapidly transform soil surface features of steep bare soil; (2) on steeper slopes, the micro-relief tends to form micro-terraces much more pervious and less erodible than the ripple-like roughness that formed on gentler slopes; and (3) there was a more pronounced lowering of the soil surface due to compaction and denser microlayers on gentler slopes. The latter conclusion confirms the hypothesis that higher effective rainfall intensity is responsible for the formation of less permeable erosion crusts under 30% slope gradients while more permeable structural crusts develop under 75% slope gradients. The runoff results were modelled with the Green and Ampt model which accounts for time evolution of soil hydraulic conductivity. This modelling shows that soil is undoubtedly non homogeneous, evolves with time and that infiltration kinetics is slower and soil permeability greater for the 75% slope. "

Nutritional productivity is estimated in the agricultural context of California for the main crops and food products. In general vegetal products are much more productive than animal products. Four crops emerge as highly productive for one or several key nutrients: potato, groundnut, onion and carrot. A balanced diet based on these four crops requires a consumption of water (evapotranspired) of 1000 l per capita per day, while the current needs for the diet in the \{USA\} is 5400 l, and 4000 l for developed countries. On the basis of nutritional productivity analysis it is further demonstrated that a significant part of the additional water resource to produce food for the next century population can be generated by changes in food habits. A reduction of 25% of all animal products in the developed countries’ diet generates approximately 22% of the additional water requirements expected by the year 2025. "

The proposed method was tested through comparisons between \{ET0\} forecasts and \{ET0\} calculated from observed meteorological data and the \{PM\} model. The correlation coefficients between observed and forecasted temperatures for all stations were all greater than 0.94, and the accuracy of the minimum temperature forecast (error within ±2 °C) ranged from 60.48% to 76.29% and the accuracy of the maximum temperature forecast ranged from 50.18% to 62.94%.

The sources of errors were the error in the temperature forecasts and the fact that the effects of wind speed and relative humidity were not considered in the \{HS\} model. The applications illustrated that the proposed method could provide daily \{ET0\} forecasts with a certain degree of accuracy for real-time irrigation forecasts. "

Studies that evaluate downscaled simulations of General Circulation Models (GCMs) by Regional Climate Models (RCMs) for African basins are noticeably missing. Recently, the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) initiative has made multiple RCMs' outputs available for end users across the African continent. Before climate simulations receive applications in impact and adaptation studies, accuracy of the simulation results has to be evaluated. In this study, the rainfall accuracy of eight independent \{GCMs\} at a wide range of time scales over the Upper Blue Nile Basin (UBN) in Ethiopia is evaluated. The reference data for performance assessment was obtained from the rain gauge network of the National Meteorological Agency of Ethiopia (www.ethiomet.gov.et/). The models were evaluated using a suite of statistical measures such as bias, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Coefficient of Variation (CV). Plots of observed vs. simulated rainfall amounts are also used. Findings of this study indicate that the models have some limitations in simulating light (&lt; 1 mm) daily rainfall and heavy (&gt; 10 mm) daily rainfall amount. The annual rainfall bias of the models varies between − 1.4% and − 50% suggesting underestimation. In many aspects the MPI-ESM-LR climate model performed best in terms of bias and RMSE. However, it was found that the performance of the models differs subject to the performance measures used for evaluation. The use of the ensemble mean rainfall simulation did not improve representation of assessed rainfall characteristics in the basin. Based on the findings in this study, we suggest to use multi-models' simulations in order to capture different aspects of the Upper Blue Nile basin rainfall. Topography and rain rate dependent bias correction algorithms should be evaluated for the basin. This study is expected to be valuable for climate change impact and adaptation studies in the \{UBN\} basin. "

They now face considerable challenges with changes in the ejido property rights over land and water, the growing importance of alternative sources of livelihoods, and increasing scarcity and competition for water within the river basins.

The diverse terrain of the rural highlands requires spatially explicit investments in land management structures. This paper utilizes recent hydrological and meteorological data collected from the Mizewa watershed in the Blue Nile Basin of Ethiopia, as well as household survey data on farmer preferences and investments, in order to better understand the physical impact of sustainable land management activities. The effectiveness of the simulated conservation practices (terraces, bunds, and residue management) is evaluated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool taking into account investment decisions on different terrain types. Simulations include terracing on steep and mid-range hillsides; a mix of terracing and bunds on varying slope gradients; and a mix of terraces and residue management on varying terrain. Simulated conservation practices are evaluated at the outlet of the Mizewa watershed by comparing model simulations that take into account the limited investments that currently exist (status quo) with simulations of increased terracing and residue management activities within the watershed. Results suggest that a mixed strategy of terracing on steep slopes and residue management on flat and middle slopes dramatically decrease surface runoff and erosion. A landscape-wide investment of terraces and bunds throughout the watershed landscape provides the greatest reduction in surface flow and erosion. However, the type and amount of investment in sustainable land management activities have different implications with respect to labor input and may be cost-prohibitive in the medium term. "

Within the Zerafshan basin a basin efficiency approach is practiced. Here water quality data for a 30 year period are presented and analysed according to spatial distribution utilising box plots and cluster analysis. The results show quality declines in its middle and lower reaches due to return flows from intensively irrigated agricultural region as well as a “Hot spot” with organic and nutrient pollution due to return flows from industrial effluent and municipal wastewater. Comparison between upstream and downstream sites shows an increase of salinity and \{COD\} concentrations as well as a more sulphate-rich and chloride-rich composition of the downstream waters. The application of box plots, the Seasonal Mann–Kendall Test and the Mann–Kendall Trend in combination show a moderate increase in river water quality due to the reduction of industrial discharges after the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, during this period chloride has a strong decreasing trend which is connected to increased reuse of drainage and return waters. Overall the lower Zerafshan can be described as a collector for water pollutants causing water quality problems for local water supply. The outcomes support the more general debate on Zerafshan water quality with reliable and more detailed information and provide information on water quality issues for the inclusion in the basin efficiency discussions.

Downstream-focused engineering solutions that address flooding are vital, but do not necessarily capture the potential for basin-scale improvements to water security, food production and livelihood enhancement. Managed aquifer recharge, typically applied to annual harvesting of wet season flows in dry climates, can also be applied to capture, store and recover episodic extreme flood events in humid environments. In the Chao Phraya River Basin it is estimated that surplus flows recorded downstream above a critical threshold could be harvested and recharged within the shallow alluvial aquifers in a distributed manner upstream of flood prone areas without significantly impacting existing large-medium storages or the Gulf and deltaic ecosystems. Capturing peak flows approximately 1 year in four by dedicating around 200 km2 of land to groundwater recharge would reduce the magnitude of flooding and socio-economic impacts and generate around \{USD\} 250 M/year in export earnings for smallholder rainfed farmers through dry season cash cropping without unduly compromising the demands of existing water users. It is proposed that farmers in upstream riparian zones be co-opted as flood harvesters and thus contribute to improved floodwater management through simple water management technologies that enable agricultural lands to be put to higher productive use. Local-scale site suitability and technical performance assessments along with revised governance structures would be required. It is expected that such an approach would also be applicable to other coastal-discharging basins in Thailand and potentially throughout the Asia region. "

Since 2006, more than 6000 farmers in the state have invested in on-farm ponds. The investments are highly cost effective and farmers are able to recover their initial investment in approximately 3 years.

Time series of \{MODIS\} imagery taken every eight days before (2001–2002) and during (2002–2003) the supply shock were combined with agricultural census data to document changes in cropping patterns in four large irrigation projects in the downstream sections of the Krishna and Godavari River basins (total command area 18,287 km2). The area cropped in rice in the four irrigated command areas decreased by 32% during the drought year, and rice production in the two districts that experienced the largest flow reductions fell below production levels of 1980. The irrigation project that showed the largest change in double cropped area (−90%) was upstream of the Krishna Delta. In the Krishna Delta, large areas changed from rice–rice to rice–gram double cropping. Historical water management contributed to the vulnerability of rice production to drought: the main reservoir in the system was drained to dead storage levels by the end of each growing season over 1968–2000, with little carryover storage. The land cover change maps suggested that the lower Krishna Basin has experienced a “hard landing” during basin closure, and revised management strategies that account for the new flow regime will be required to maintain agricultural production during droughts.

Farmers and land resource professionals assess the options that optimise the productivity and sustainable land use through different knowledge systems. Both systems have advantages and drawbacks. Through a case study in a village of northwestern Syria, an approach was developed to integrate the knowledge of both farmers and land resource experts in order to promote adoption of new land use systems. This was done by comparing a farmer-led land suitability assessment (FLSA) with the results of an expert-led land suitability assessment (ELSA) so as to evaluate respective comparative advantages and complementarities. The results of \{FLSA\} and \{ELSA\} were integrated in a geographical information system (GIS). The farmers compared the results of \{FLSA\} and \{ELSA\} and their input \{ELSA\} was upgraded to suit local circumstances. Some striking differences came out between \{FLSA\} and ELSA, which could be explained by a participatory land evaluation. The farmers’ knowledge provided a better understanding of the impact of microclimatic variations on crop productivity. This is an important bonus of the participatory approach because detailed climatic data for long periods are rarely available in most rural communities. The \{FLSA\} procedure explained adequately the overriding weight of socio-economic constraints over biophysical opportunities. A constraint in the participatory approach is that useful and interesting indigenous knowledge is often scarce. \{GIS\} was instrumental in the correlation of indigenous and expert land units and in the farmers’ validation of land suitability. The benefits of this approach to the researchers were clear. The farmers on the other hand highly appreciated the improved communication with the scientists. The better interaction with the farmers will eventually pay off when it comes to adoption of improved management recommendations. "

By focusing on the basin trajectory this paper illustrates the importance of understanding how local-level institutional arrangements interface with national-level policies and basin-wide institutions. We expand Molle's typology of basin actors responses by explicitly introducing a meso-layer which depicts the interface where State-level and local-level initiatives and responses are played out; and focus on how this interaction finds expression in the creation and modification of hydraulic property rights. We subsequently apply this perspective to the case of Pangani River Basin in Tanzania. The Pangani River Basin development trajectory did not follow a linear path and sequence of responses. Attempts by the state government to establish ‘order’ in the basin by issuing water rights, levying water fees and designing a new basin institutional set-up have so far proven problematic, and instead generated ‘noise’ at the interface. So far water resources development in the Pangani has primarily focused on blue water, and the paper shows how investments in infrastructure to control blue water have shaped the relationship between water users, and between water user groups and the State. It remains unknown, however, what the implications will be of widespread investments in improved green water use throughout the basin – not only hydrologically for the availability of blue water, but also socially for the livelihoods of the basin population, and for the evolving relationships between green and blue water users, and between them and the State. The paper concludes with a question: will green water development engender a similar double-edged material-symbolic dynamic as blue water development has. The findings of this paper demonstrate that the expanded typology of basin actors’ responses helps to better understand the present situation. Such an improved understanding is useful in analysing current and proposed interventions. "

A climatic water balance analysis of 225 dominant rainfed districts provided information on the possible surplus runoff during the year and the cropping season. On a potential (excluding very arid and wet areas) rainfed cropped area of 28.5 million ha, a surplus rainfall of 114 billion m3 (Bm3) was available for harvesting. A part of this amount of water is adequate to provide one turn of supplementary irrigation of 100 mm depth to 20.65 Mha during drought years and 25.08 Mha during normal years. Water used in supplemental irrigation had the highest marginal productivity and increase in rainfed production above 12% was achievable even under traditional practices. Under improved management, an average increase of 50% in total production can be achieved with a single supplemental irrigation. Water harvesting and supplemental irrigation are economically viable at the national level. Net benefits improved by about threefold for rice, fourfold for pulses and sixfold for oilseeds. Droughts have very mild impacts on productivity when farmers are equipped with supplemental irrigation. "

Total seasonal rainfall may be enough to sustain crop production, but its distribution and occurrence of intra-season dry spells (ISDS) and off-season dry spells (ODS) affect crop production. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) and management, especially on-farm storage ponds for supplemental irrigation offers an opportunity to mitigate the recurrent dry spells. Farm ponds are small runoff storage structures of capacities ranging from 30 to 100 m3 used mainly for supplemental irrigation of kitchen gardens, and sometimes for domestic and livestock water supply. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the hydrological and economic performance of farm ponds with the view of assessing their contributions to water and food security in semi-arid agro-systems of Kenya. Agro-hydrological evaluation of on-farm runoff storage systems entailed field survey, monitoring of water losses, analysis of rainy seasons and dry spell occurrence, soil moisture and water balance, estimation of supplemental irrigation requirement (SIR) and farm-level cost-benefit analysis of cabbage production using low-head drip irrigation system. Significant water losses through seepage and evaporation, which accounted on average for 30–50% of the stored runoff, is one of the factors that affect the adoption and up-scaling of on-farm water storage systems. Frequency analysis of rainfall revealed that there is 80% probability of occurrence of dry spells exceeding 10 and 12 days during the long rains and short rains, respectively. The occurrence of off-season (after rainfall cessation) dry spells was more pronounced than intra-seasonal (within the rainy season) dry spells. The length of intra-seasonal (10–15 days) was less than off-season dry spells (20–30 days). The occurrence of off-season dry spells coincides with the critical crop growth stage, in particular flowering and yield formation stages.

This study aimed to determine how the earthworm casting activity influences soil porosity and its dynamics. The main hypothesis was that the deposition of belowground water-stable casts increases soil porosity and its water stability. First we quantified cast production by the endogeic earthworm species Metaphire posthuma under laboratory conditions for 15 days. Secondly, casts and the bulk soil were analysed for structural stability to water and were packed in soil and subjected to wetting under various conditions and energy levels. The shape and size of pores were measured by image analysis. Almost all casts (98%) were produced belowground. M. posthuma produced approximately five times its own weight per day. Casts were depleted in C and were more easily disaggregated by water than the bulk soil. Although casts initially led to larger soil porosity (on average 50%), their structure was unstable. As a consequence, water inputs led to a faster decrease in soil porosity in the presence of casts. Large pores in between casts were rapidly replaced by small elongated and rounded pores. These results suggest that cast lifespan and associated porosity are of primary importance in the regulation of soil porosity turnover and the ecological functions that are under its control. Our findings suggest that in the field, the low stability of casts is likely to lead to a rapid compaction of the soil after rainfall events. However, high levels of cast production may prevent soil porosity from being broken down. Soil structural porosity thus depends on the balance between the production and degradation of casts. Improvements to the soil structure will occur when the former predominates. "

This paper aims to provide one of the longest combined observations of land cover and hydrological changes for semiarid areas using a time series of normalised mosaics of aerial photographs dating back from 1950, field inquiries, and updated groundwater data. The 500 km2 study area in southwest Niger was chosen (i) for its rural environment representative of the rain-fed agriculture belt of the Sahel and (ii) to encompass the main hydrological study sites investigated in this region over the past two decades (Hapex-Sahel and \{AMMA\} experiments, 1990–2000s). Results have significant implications for future freshwater availability and food security in the Sahel. Between 1950 and 1992, ∼ 80% of the study area has been cleared, firstly to open new areas for agriculture and secondly for firewood supply (59% of the plateaux, 42% of the valley bottoms, and 87% of the hillslopes). Intermediate aerial photograph surveys (1960, 1975) attest an accelerated loss in the woody savannah that could not be recovered on the short term. A strong, indirect impact of land clearance is observed on the water resources. Land clearance has resulted in a modification of the soil properties and infiltration capacity and has led to an increase in Hortonian runoff collected in numerous gullies and ponds. Between 1950 and 1992, aerial photographs show a ∼ 2.5 fold increase of the drainage density with the development of large drainage systems and new ponds. Groundwater data also indicate a continuous rise in the water table, mostly noticeable since the 1980s with a mean groundwater level rise of ∼ 4 m for the 1963–2005 period (+ 15% in aquifer reserves). The relatively short ∼ 30 year time-lag between the onset of land clearance and the beginning of the water table rise is linked to the process of indirect groundwater recharge and is timed with the connectivity of the drainage network and the formation of new ponds. Finally, the sustained increase in surface runoff and groundwater recharge during the past four decades indicates that the indirect impact of land clearance on the terrestrial water balance has been stronger than that of the long-lasting Sahelian drought. As the rate of land clearance increased for the past century in semiarid Africa, its main hydrological effects may not yet be fully perceptible. "

These soils form the basis of agricultural production systems on which significant numbers of people depend upon for livelihoods. The objectives of this study were to investigate soil acidification following the introduction of Stylosanthes in cropping systems of a tropical semi-arid region. Most soils in Northeast Thailand are sandy and acidic (pH 4.0 in CaCl2), with high rate of drainage. Soil acidification was studied over a 6-year period on plots that had been treated either with or without lime additions under different cropping patterns. In the initial first 3 years, a rotation of maize and cowpea was compared to a bare soil treatment where no vegetation was allowed to establish. During the following 3 years, a rotation of maize and Stylosanthes was compared to a continuous Stylosanthes hamata (stylo) treatment. Total soil acidification was calculated from measured pH changes and pH buffer capacity. Acidification due to root system activity was estimated from the above ground biomass production and its ash alkalinity. In the limed systems, soil pH decrease was well correlated with the ash alkalinity of the crop and its removal from the plot. Acidification was highest in the bare soil (6.3 kmol H+ ha−1 year−1), due to leaching of applied N fertilizers. The cowpea–maize rotations did not increase significantly the rate of acid addition (7.6 kmol H+ ha−1 year−1), since the crop residues were returned to the plot. The introduction of stylo in the cropping system resulted in a lower net acidification rate when it was cultivated in rotation with maize (1.3 kmol H+ ha−1 year−1), due to the lower rate of leaching. In contrast, continuous cultivation of stylo triggered accelerated acidification (7.2 kmol H+ ha−1 year−1), as a result of the large quantities of biomass with high ash alkalinity being removed from the plot. In the no-lime system, the pH of the soil profile remained stable at pH 4.0 regardless of the cropping system, even though the acidification rates were quite similar to those in the limed treatments. This would suggest that the soil was strongly buffered at pH 4.0. \{XRD\} patterns showed that kaolinite, the main clay mineral, was more disordered and less crystalline in the surface horizons than at depth. It is suggested that the dissolution of kaolinite is responsible for the buffering of soil pH at 4.0. From the dissolution equation of kaolinite, it is expected that the amount of aluminium in the topsoil would increase along with the release silica that would accelerate cementation processes between soil particles resulting in further degradation.

More food necessarily means more consumptive use of so-called green water flow (vapour flow sustaining crop growth). Every increase in food production upstream in a watershed will impact on water user and using systems downstream. Intensifying agriculture has in the past often been carried out with negative side effects in terms of land and water degradation. Water legislation is increasingly incorporating the requirement to safeguard a water reserve to sustain instream ecology. To address the challenges of increasing food production, improving rural livelihoods, while safeguarding critical ecological functions, a research programme has recently been launched on “Smallholder System Innovations in Integrated Watershed Management” (SSI). The programme takes an integrated approach to agricultural water management, analysing the interactions between the adoption and participatory adaptation of water system innovations (such as water harvesting, drip irrigation, conservation farming, etc.), increased water use in agriculture and water flows to sustain ecological functions that deliver critical ecosystem services to humans. The research is carried out in the Pangani Basin in Tanzania and the Thukela Basin in South Africa. A nested scale approach is adopted, which will enable the analysis of scale interactions between water management at the farm level, and cascading hydrological impacts at watershed and basin scale. This paper describes the integrated research approach of the \{SSI\} programme, and indicates areas of potential to upgrade rainfed agriculture in water scarcity-prone agro-ecosystems while securing water for downstream use.

How earthworms influence the dynamics of soil organic matter (SOM) and mineral nutrients is still poorly understood, partly because the relationships between cast dynamics and \{SOM\} and mineral nutrient cycling are unknown. In this study, two laboratory experiments were carried out on free aggregates (casts or soil clods) sampled from the soil surface in a tropical fallow field before the rainy season (March 2008). In the first experiment, a 12 h rainfall simulation (intensity: 44 mm h−1) experiment was used to monitor fragmentation and nutrient leaching from Amynthas khami earthworm casts and soil clods. Control soil aggregates &gt; 5000 μm were rapidly (∼2 h) broken into large water-stable aggregates (&gt;500 μm) and then into smaller water-stable aggregates (&lt;500 μm). Conversely, the fragmentation of earthworm casts was progressive and more than 12 h were needed to totally fragment the casts into small size aggregates (&lt;500 μm). Soil nutrient loss varied depending on aggregate size but it was always higher from cast than from control soil aggregates. NH4+ and NO3− releases showed linear dynamics vs. time, whereas K and P were tightly associated with the soil aggregates and their losses were significant only after 4 h of rainfall. The total amount of N-NH4+, N-NO3−, K and P losses were, respectively, 8-, 7-, 12- and 2-fold greater from casts than from the control soil aggregates. In the second experiment, different aggregate sizes (50–250, 250–500 and 500–2000 μm) from casts and control soil aggregates were sampled during the rainfall simulation and incubated at 28 °C for 21 days. The total amount of K and P was not affected by soil aggregate size. The aggregate hierarchy concept was not confirmed because more C was observed in the smaller aggregate size fractions. Organic C and N mineralization, however, increased with increasing aggregate size for casts, but the opposite trend was observed for the control soil aggregates. This study therefore highlights the importance of earthworm activity for the transfer of mineral nutrients and the protection of \{SOM\} within microaggregates. "

If the influence of earthworms on soil properties and plant growth has been extensively studied in aerobic ecosystems, their effects remain largely unknown in partially flooded environments such as paddy fields. The aim of this study was to describe the potential influence of earthworms on soil properties and rice yield in Northeast Thailand. We studied the abundance of aboveground casts produced by Drawida beddardi in two paddy rice systems (transplanting: \{TP\} and direct seeding: DS) and we measured the soil physicochemical properties of casts and their influence on rice growth and yield. Cast abundance was low (∼250 casts per ha) and not different in \{TP\} and DS. Casts appeared as patches of fertility with more fine particle sizes and organic matter contents, a higher CEC, as well as a much higher concentrations of mineral elements (N, P and K). As a consequence, our results suggest that earthworm activity lead to a significant higher rice yield. These results stress the importance earthworms could have in the regulation of rice productivity in paddy fields. More research is now needed to understand the ecological mechanisms that regulate earthworm abundance and activity in these environments. "

In these areas and in many others in the world, soil erosion becomes a major issue while the factors that determine it are still misunderstood. Earthworm's activity is believed to influence soil erosion rate, but we are still unable to precisely quantify their contribution to soil erosion. In this study, we used Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIRS) to quantify the proportion of soil aggregate in eroded soil coming from earthworm activity. This was done by generating \{NIRS\} signatures corresponding to different soil surface aggregates (above-ground soil casts produced by earthworms vs. surrounding topsoil). In order to test the proposed approach, we compared the NIRS-signature of eroded soil sediments to those of earthworms' casts and of the surrounding soils. Our results strongly supported that \{NIRS\} spectra might be used as “fingerprints” to identify the origin of soil aggregates. Although earthworms are generally assumed to play a favorable role in promoting soil fertility and ecosystem services, this method shows that cast aggregates constitute about 36 and 77% of sediments in two tropical plantations, Paspalum atratum and Panicum maximum plantations, respectively. In light with these results, we estimated that earthworms led to an annual loss of 3.3 and 15.8 kg of carbon ha− 1 yr− 1, respectively in P. atratum and P. maximum agroecosystems. "

Gully Erosion Under Global Change. Sichuan Science Technology Press, Chengu, China, 354 pp.]. This growing interest is associated with the increasing concern over off-site impacts caused by soil erosion at larger spatial scales than the cultivated plots. The objective of this paper is to review recent studies on impacts, factors and control of gully erosion and update the review on ‘gully erosion and environmental change: importance and research needs’ [Poesen et al., 2003. Catena 50 (2–4), 91–134.]. For the farmers, the development of gullies leads to a loss of crop yields and available land as well as an increase of workload (i.e. labour necessary to cultivate the land). Gullies can also change the mosaic patterns between fallow and cultivated fields, enhancing hillslope erosion in a feedback loop. In addition, gullies tend to enhance drainage and accelerate aridification processes in the semi-arid zones. Fingerprinting the origin of sediments within catchments to determine the relative contributions of potential sediment sources has become essential to identify sources of potential pollution and to develop management strategies to combat soil erosion. In this respect, tracers such as carbon, nitrogen, the nuclear bomb-derived radionuclide 137 Cs, magnetics and the strontium isotopic ratio are increasingly used to fingerprint sediment. Recent studies conducted in Australia, China, Ethiopia and \{USA\} showed that the major part of the sediment in reservoirs might have come from gully erosion. Gullies not only occur in marly badlands and mountainous or hilly regions but also more globally in soils subjected to soil crusting such as loess (European belt, Chinese Loess Plateau, North America) and sandy soils (Sahelian zone, north-east Thailand) or in soils prone to piping and tunnelling such as dispersive soils. Most of the time, the gullying processes are triggered by inappropriate cultivation and irrigation systems, overgrazing, log haulage tracks, road building and urbanization. As exemplified by recent examples from all over the world, land use change is expected to have a greater impact on gully erosion than climate change. Yet, reconstructions of historical causes of gully erosion, using high-resolution stratigraphy, archaeological dating of pottery and 14C dating of wood and charcoal, show that the main gully erosion periods identified in Europe correspond to a combination not only of deforestation and overuse of the land but also to periods with high frequency of extreme rainfall events. Many techniques have proved to be effective for gully prevention and control, including vegetation cover, zero or reduced tillage, stone bunds, exclosures, terracing and check dams. However, these techniques are rarely adopted by farmers in the long run and at a larger spatial scale because their introduction is rarely associated with a rapid benefit for the farmers in terms of an increase in land or labour productivity and is often contingent upon incentives.

The second year, two of the microplots under \{FAL\} and \{EUC\} were treated with herbicide (FALh, EUCh), one of them was burnt (FALh+b, EUCh+b). The highest yearly surface runoff coefficient of 16%, and soil detachment rate of 700 g m− 2 yr− 1 in average with a maximum of 1305 g m− 2 yr− 1 have been recorded under CAS. On \{FALh\} and FALh+b, runoff ratios were 8.7 and 13.5%, respectively and detachment rates were 86 and 389 g m− 2. On \{FAL\} and \{BRA\} the yearly runoff ratio varied from 5.9 to 9.8% but the detachment rate was limited at 24 to 35 g m− 2. \{FOR\} and \{EUC\} annual runoff was ≤ 3.1% and annual soil detachment ≤ 71 g m− 2. These values were very low compared to the values reported on steep slopes in Laos within similar climate and vegetation cover. The runoff and detachment rates underlined the importance of rainfall intensities, soil physical properties, soil surface features, soil vegetation cover and biological activity. The annual surface runoff was highly correlated to the soil surface crusting. \{CAS\} and \{BRA\} plots were prone to crusting especially after weeding at the onset of the rainy season, when the soil surface was still uncovered. Soil bioturbation (earthworm casting activity) was the second factor that explains local variation of surface runoff and soil detachment. The continuous production of earthworms casts on soil surface, especially on \{FOR\} and \{EUC\} microplots, induced a marked surface roughness and reduced the surface runoff. The production of casts was very limited in \{FAL\} and completely absent in \{CAS\} microplots. So it is evident that our results confirm the deleterious effects of cassava on soil and water conservation. "

First, we analyse the evaporation from a wetland with emergent vegetation (Ea) versus open water evaporation (Ew) by applying the Penman–Monteith equation to identical climate input data, but with different biophysical characteristics of each surface. Second, we assess the variability of measured Ea/Ew through a literature review of selected wetlands around the globe. We demonstrate that the ratio Ea/Ew is site-specific, and a function of the biophysical properties of the wetland surface, which can also undergo temporal variability depending on local hydro-climate conditions. Second, we demonstrate that the Penman–Monteith model provides a suitable basis to interpret Ea/Ew variations. This implies that the assumption of wetland evaporation to behave similar to open water bodies is not correct. This has significant implications for the total water consumption and water allocation to wetlands in river basin management. "

This study assessed in a densely populated area the risk from microbial contamination of various sources of drinking water, by conducting a Quantitative Microbiological Risk Assessment (QMRA) to estimate the risk to human health from microorganism exposure and dose–response relationships. Furthermore the cost-effectiveness in reducing the disease burden through targeted interventions was evaluated. Five risk pathways for drinking water were identified through a survey (110 families), namely household storage, private yard taps, communal taps, communal wells and water sachets. Samples from each source were analyzed for Escherichia coli and Ascaris contamination. Published ratios between E. coli and other pathogens were used for the \{QMRA\} and disease burden calculations. The major part of the burden of disease originated from E. coli O157:H7 (78%) and the least important contributor was Cryptosporidium (0.01%). Other pathogens contributed 16% (Campylobacter), 5% (Rotavirus) and 0.3% (Ascaris). The sum of the disease burden of these pathogens was 0.5 \{DALYs\} per person per year, which is much higher than the \{WHO\} reference level. The major contamination pathway was found to be household storage. Disinfection of water at household level was the most cost-effective intervention (&lt; 5 USD/DALY-averted) together with hygiene education. Water supply network improvements were significantly less cost-effective. "

In this paper we analyse, in a conceptual way, the interplay of community risk coping culture, flooding damage and economic growth. We particularly focus on three aspects: (i) collective memory, i.e., the capacity of the community to keep risk awareness high; (ii) risk-taking attitude, i.e., the amount of risk the community is collectively willing to be exposed to; and (iii) trust of the community in risk reduction measures. To this end, we use a dynamic model that represents the feedback between the hydrological and social system components. Model results indicate that, on the one hand, by under perceiving the risk of flooding (because of short collective memory and too much trust in flood protection structures) in combination with a high risk-taking attitude, community development is severely limited because of high damages caused by flooding. On the other hand, overestimation of risk (long memory and lack of trust in flood protection structures) leads to lost economic opportunities and recession. There are many scenarios of favourable development resulting from a trade-off between collective memory and trust in risk reduction measures combined with a low to moderate risk-taking attitude. Interestingly, the model gives rise to situations in which the development of the community in the floodplain is path dependent, i.e., the history of flooding may lead to community growth or recession.

Equitable allocation of water is crucial to sustain livelihoods and agro-ecosystems, and to sustain international agreements. As compliance monitoring of water distribution by flow meters is laborious, expensive and only partially feasible, a novel approach has been developed to estimate water withdrawals using satellite measurements. Direct withdrawals include pumping from rivers, impoundments and groundwater, for irrigation and other human uses. Indirect withdrawals include evaporation processes from groundwater storage, unconfined shallow aquifers, seepage zones, lakes and reservoirs, and inundations, in addition to evaporation from pristine land surface conditions. Indirect withdrawals intercept lateral flow of water and reduce downstream flow. An innovative approach has been developed that employs three main spatial data layers inferred from satellite measurements: land use, rainfall, and evaporation. The evaporation/rainfall ratio was computed for all natural land use classes and used to distinguish between evaporation from rainfall and incremental evaporation caused by water withdrawals. The remote sensing measurements were validated against measured evaporative flux, stream flow pumping volume, and stream flow reductions. Afforested areas in the whole basin was responsible for an indirect withdrawal of 1241 Mm3/yr during an average rainfall year while the tripartite agreement among the riparian countries specifies a permitted total withdrawal of 546 Mm3/yr. However, the irrigation sector is responsible for direct withdrawals of 555 Mm3/yr only while their allocated share is 1327 Mm3/yr – the long term total withdrawals are thus in line with the tripartite agreement. South Africa withdraws 1504 Mm3/yr while their share is 1261 Mm3/yr. The unmetered stream flow reduction from the afforested areas in South Africa represents the big uncertainty factor. The methodology described using remotely sensed measurements to estimate direct and indirect withdrawals has the potential to be applied more widely to water stressed basins having limited availability of field data.

Conversely, Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) has demonstrated a bias toward the formal state-based institutions for water management. A study was carried out to examine how local water rights and local informal institutional arrangements influence water management in the Great Ruaha River catchment in the Rufiji basin in Tanzania. Participatory appraisals were carried out, supplemented by focus group discussions, interviews, and a stakeholders’ workshop. It was found that local water rights, local water rotations and local water user groups are widely in use and are more influential than the formal water rights, water fees and water user associations (WUAs). Water allocation at the driest period depends on local informal relations among irrigators. More than 70% of water users surveyed choose to settle disputes over water via informal channels and the latter are more effective in resolving water conflicts and reconciling the antagonists compared to the formal routes. It was also found that although much emphasis and many resources have been expended in transforming local water rights and water related organisations to formal registered ones, the former have remained popular and water users feel more affiliated to local arrangements. The paper concludes that local informal water management can offer the best lessons for the formal management arrangements and should not be simply overlooked. Finally, the paper recommends that the formal and informal institutions should be amalgamated to bring forth a real Integrated Water Resource Management framework. "

The missing term in the water balance was used to estimate groundwater extractions and unaccounted extraction from the river. For Abshar-Left groundwater extraction surpassed surface water applications, while for Nekouabad-Left groundwater extractions were very low. For Abshar-Right a large amount of water was pumped directly out of the river. The assessment of the systems was expressed by the productivity of water, defined as kg biomass over m3 water evaporated. Productivity was higher (∼0.72 kg m−3) for the systems relying on surface water (Nekouabad-Left and Abshar-Right) than for the conjunctive systems, reflecting the difference in water quality between groundwater and surface water. Finally, it was concluded that the advantages of the methodology presented here over the traditional assessments are: (i) most data is readily available, (ii) all water users are included, (iii) groundwater extraction can be estimated, and (iv) a real time assessment can be setup using this approach.

On-farm trials were conducted in northern Vietnam to study the impact of mulch treatments and explore economically feasible and eco-friendly mulching options. The effect of three mulching materials (polythene, rice straw and chemical) on weed infestation, soil temperature, soil moisture and pod yield were studied. Polythene and straw mulch were effective in suppressing the weed infestation. Different mulching materials showed different effects on soil temperature. Polythene mulch increased the soil temperature by about 6 °C at 5 cm depth and by 4 °C at 10 cm depth. Mulches prevent soil water evaporation retaining soil moisture. Groundnut plants in polythene and straw mulched plots were generally tall, vigorous and reached early flowering. Use of straw as mulch provides an attractive and an environment friendly option in Vietnam, as it is one of the largest rice growing countries with the least use of rice straw. Besides, it recycles plant nutrients effectively. "

In the present study, imaging spectrometer data were used to detect and map desert-like surface features. Absorption feature parameters in the spectral region between 0.4 and 2.5 μm wavelengths were analysed and correlated with soil properties, such as soil colour, soil salinity, gypsum content, etc. Soil groupings were made based on their similarities and their spectral reflectance curves were studied. Distinct differences in the reflectance curves throughout the spectrum were exhibited between groups. Although the samples belonging to the same group shared common properties, the curves still showed differences within the same group. Characteristic reflectance curves of soil surface features were derived from spectral measurements both in the field and in the laboratory, and mean reflectance values derived from image pixels representing known features. Linear unmixing and spectral angle matching techniques were applied to assess their suitability in mapping surface features for land degradation studies. The study showed that linear unmixing provided more realistic results for mapping “desert-like” surface features than the spectral angle matching technique. "

As a result, these wells have some technical, environmental and social constraints, which hinder the sustainability of these wells. As an initial step to improve the well technology, the hydraulic and hydro-salinity responses of the fresh-saline aquifer under different pumping regimes need to be monitored. The present paper reports the hydraulic and hydro-salinity behavior of the Indus basin aquifer in Pakistan under field conditions at farmers’ wells. Two sites, having 6- and 16-strainer wells were monitored during July 2000–December 2001. The 6-strainer well was operated for 4 h with single-, 4- and 6-strainer arrangements and the spatial behaviors of specific drawdown were observed under these arrangements. The 16-strainer well was monitored continuously for the above period. The well discharge, pumped water quality and pumping duration was recorded of every pumping event under farmer’s practice to extract groundwater. The rainfall and temporal water table fluctuation was also recorded at this site. The impact of 24 years of well operation on groundwater quality was observed by comparing the hydro-salinity profiles of 1974 and 1998 under 3-strainer well. The results showed that the specific drawdown was higher for single-strainer and it decreased with the increase in number of strainers in skimming wells and hence reduced the chances of saline-upconing. Each strainer in multi-strainer well contributes equally in well discharge provided the horizontal distances among the strainers are equal. The pumped water quality in fresh-saline aquifer was a very sensitive function of fresh water recharge and pumping duration. It was observed that with the increase in daily operation from 2 to 12 h per day, the pumped quality deteriorated three-folds and there was also 30% reduction in well discharge due to high suction lift. It was observed that continuous operation of a 3-strainer well having discharge of 14 lps over the 24 years had raised the fresh-saline interface (iso-concentration line of 1.5 dS/m) to 9 m. Keeping in review the observations, it is recommended that the daily operation of 4–6 h keep the water quality within marginal limit (&lt;1.5 dS/m) and the pumping operation is also cost-effective with only 15–20% reduction in well discharge for the study area.

To assess on a global scale where water productivity can be improved and what the causes are for not reaching its potential, the current levels must be understood. This paper describes the development and validation of a \{WATer\} \{PROductivity\} (WATPRO) model for wheat that is based on remote sensing-derived input data sets, and that can be applied at local to global scales. The model is a combination of Monteith's theoretical framework for dry matter production in plants and an energy balance model to assess actual evapotranspiration. It is shown that by combining both approaches, the evaporative fraction and the atmospheric transmissivity, two parameters which are usually difficult to estimate spatially, can be omitted. Water productivity can then be assessed from four spatial variables: broadband surface albedo, the vegetation index NDVI, the extraterrestrial radiation and air temperature. A sensitivity analysis revealed that \{WATPRO\} is most sensitive to changes in \{NDVI\} and least sensitive to changes in air temperature. The \{WATPRO\} model was applied at 39 locations where water productivity was measured under experimental conditions. The correlation between measured and modelled water productivity was low, and this can be mainly attributed to differences in scales and in the experimental and modelling periods. A comparison with measurements from farmer's fields in areas surrounded by other wheat fields located in Sirsa District, \{NW\} India, showed an improved correlation. Although not a validation, a comparison with SEBAL-derived water productivity in the same region in India proved that \{WATPRO\} can spatially predict water productivity with the same spatial variation.

Increasing water productivity is an often cited solution, though the current levels of water productivity are not systematically mapped. A global map of water productivity helps to identify where water resources are productively used, and identifies places where improvements are possible. The \{WATPRO\} water productivity model for wheat, using remote sensing data products as input, was applied at a global scale with global data sets of the \{NDVI\} and surface albedo to benchmark water productivity of wheat for the beginning of this millennium. Time profiles of the \{NDVI\} were used to determine the time frame from crop establishment to harvest on a pixel basis, which was considered the modelling period. It was found that water productivity varies from approximately 0.2 to 1.8 kg of harvestable wheat per cubic metre of water consumed. From the 10 largest producers of wheat, France and Germany score the highest country average water productivity of 1.42 and 1.35 kg m−3, respectively. The results were compared with modelling information by Liu et al. (2007) who applied the \{GEPIC\} model at a global scale to map water productivity, and by Chapagain and Hoekstra (2004) who used \{FAO\} statistics to determine water productivity per country. A comparison with Liu et al. showed a good correlation for most countries, but the correlation with the results by Chapagain and Hoekstra was less obvious. The global patterns of the water productivity map were compared with global data sets of precipitation and reference evapotranspiration to determine the impact of climate and of water availability reflected by precipitation. It appears that the highest levels of water productivity are to be expected in temperate climates with high precipitation. Due to its non-linear relationship with precipitation, it is expected that large gains in water productivity can be made with in situ rain water harvesting or supplemental irrigation in dry areas with low seasonal precipitation. A full understanding of the spatial patterns by country or river basin will support decisions on where to invest and what measures to take to make agriculture more water productive. "

Water use and crop water productivity were assessed in the Upper Bhima catchment in southern India using an innovative integration of remotely sensed evapotranspiration and a process-based hydrological model. The remote sensing based Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) was used to derive an 8 month time series of observed actual evapotranspiration from October 2004 to May 2005. This dataset was then used in the calibration of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). This hydrological model was calibrated by changing 34 parameters to minimize the difference between simulated and observed actual evapotranspiration. The calibration efficiency was assessed with four different performance indicators. The calibrated model was used to derive a monthly basin water balance and to assess crop water productivity and crop water use for the irrigation year 2004–2005. It was found that evapotranspiration is the largest water loss in the catchment and total evaporative depletion was 38,172 Mm3 (835 mm). Of the total evaporative depletion 42% can be considered as non-beneficial and could be diverted to other beneficial utilization. Simulated crop water productivities for sugarcane, sorghum and winter wheat are relatively high at 2.9 kg/m3, 1.3 kg/m3 and 1.3 kg/m3, respectively. The frequency distributions of crop water productivity are characterised by low coefficient of variation, yielding limited scope for improvement in the agricultural areas under the current cropping systems. Further improvements in water productivity may however be achieved by shifting the crop base from sugarcane to a dual crop and introducing a fallow period from March to May or by converting non-productive rangelands to bio fuel production or other agricultural land uses.

The article presents the case study of \{EEZ\} in Cajamarca, Peru to analyse the \{LUP\} process in a situation of conflicting interests over future land and water use. Cajamarca is a department with rich gold deposits in the headwater catchment area upstream of the city of Cajamarca. During the last decade, rural communities and urban populations have continuously protested against the opening of new open pit mines, as they fear this will affect their water supply. Therefore, the \{EEZ\} process became part of a controversy between a powerful pro-mining coalition led by the central government and a conservation coalition led by the regional government. We conclude that in these circumstances, \{LUP\} cannot, technically or politically, accommodate the different values attributed to the headwater catchment. "

This study assessed the mechanism of this positive rotational effect in terms of soil P availability using a greenhouse trial with large volume (74 l) containers. The rotation effect was analysed in relation to \{PR\} application, previous legume growth and incorporation of the legume residues. Velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens) and maize were grown in a representative Acrisol from the Nigerian Northern Guinea savannah (NGS). All soils were applied with sufficient urea to exclude N-effects in the rotations. In a first season, velvet bean and maize responded similarly to \{PR\} application, and P uptake by both crops increased by 45%. The soil total labile P quantity (E-value) and P concentration in soil solution ( P solution 31 ) after plant growth were increased by PR-application only in soils previously grown by velvet bean, suggesting enhanced \{PR\} solubilisation in the legume-grown soils. In the subsequent season, grain yields and P uptake of a maize crop following velvet bean were twice as large compared to maize following a first maize crop. This residual effect of velvet bean was even significant in treatments without PR-application, although both maize and velvet bean withdrew similar amounts of P during the first season and no differences in soil P availability were observed. Furthermore, legume residue incorporation in soils previously grown by maize did not affect yields or P uptake of the subsequent maize crop, while it significantly increased the E-value and P solution 31 during the first 7 weeks in the second season. As such, the positive rotational effects of velvet bean were larger than predicted by soil P availability measures. Maize yield significantly increased with increasing plant P concentration among all treatments. However, the rotational effect was unrelated to internal P concentration: significantly larger yields were obtained for maize following velvet bean than for maize following maize at identical internal P. This suggested the presence of another growth-limiting which is counteracted by the previous velvet bean growth. In conclusion, our results confirmed that the introduction of a legume supplied with \{PR\} into a maize-based cropping system increases yield and P-uptake by a subsequent maize crop, compared to maize following a first maize crop supplied with PR. These stimulations, however, went beyond improved P nutrition. Results strongly suggested that the legume in the rotation system has other positive, possibly soil-microbiological effects which enhance maize growth and production. "

A perverse link between energy subsidies and groundwater overdraft has left the state with a bankrupt electricity utility and depleted aquifers, especially since the late 1980s. Moreover, this perverse relationship has meant that groundwater irrigators have essentially held Gujarat's non-farm rural economy to ransom. Efforts to regulate groundwater overdraft since the early 1970s have been unsuccessful, as have attempts to charge a rational electricity tariff to groundwater irrigators. During 2003–2006, drawing upon a proposal outlined by researchers, the government launched the Jyotigram (lighted village) scheme, which invested US$ 290 million to separate agricultural electricity feeders from non-agricultural ones, and established a tight regimen for farm power rationing in the countryside. By 2006, Gujarat covered almost all of its 18,000 villages under the Jyotigram scheme of rationalized power supply. With this, two major changes have occurred: (a) villages receive 24 h three-phase power supply for domestic uses, in schools, hospitals, village industries, all subject to metered tariff; (b) tubewell owners receive 8 h/day of power of full voltage and on a pre-announced schedule. The Jyotigram scheme has radically improved the quality of village life, spurred non-farm economic enterprises, halved the power subsidy to agriculture, and reduced groundwater overdraft. It has also produced positive and negative impacts on medium and large farmers, while notably harming marginal farmers and the landless, who depend for their access to irrigation on water markets which have become much smaller, post-Jyotigram. In addition, the water prices charged by tubewell owners have increased by 30–50%. We propose that the Jyotigram scheme, with some refinements, can be implemented successfully in other regions of South Asia facing similar challenges of groundwater governance. "

Performance assessment studies provide a tool to evaluate and promote this objective. The study examines the existing planning procedures and assesses irrigation performance of four Water User Associations (WUAs) located in Osh Province, Kyrgyzstan. Performance was evaluated using indicators of adequacy, efficiency, dependability and equity. Indicators were calculated for each irrigation season over the period 2003 to 2007. In general, all \{WUAs\} were found to be strong in terms of adequacy and efficiency standards. However, performance with respect to dependability and equity was poor. The results suggest that more effort is needed to improve temporal uniformity and equity in water distribution. In order to achieve this, estimations of irrigation requirements by \{WUA\} managers needs to be improved and mechanisms developed to request water in quantities, which are needed to maintain equity across the \{WUA\} outlets and among water users. The study concludes that the establishment of \{WUAs\} in Kyrgyzstan has helped to address the problem of water distribution and allocation among a large number of farmers. However, further training of farmers and managers is required to build their capacity to share water and ensure equity among users particularly during periods of less than optimal water supply. The findings of this research suggest that application of a pre-determined set of indicators can be a useful and cost effective tool to measure the performance of WUAs. This is particularly important for Central Asia where the performance of the recently established and state initiated \{WUAs\} to replace former collective farms is now a key element in future sustainable water management. The study identified uncertainties in the estimation of \{WUA\} water demands based on previous methods and suggests more attention and care required in calculating water requirements. "

The large aperture scintillometer (LAS) is an optical device used to monitor fluctuations in refractive index of the turbulent atmosphere over a relatively large area. The study reported here has estimated \{ET\} fluxes for an area of mixed vegetation at Horana, a field site about 40 km southeast of Colombo, Sri Lanka. \{ET\} estimates derived from the scintillometer and net radiometer were compared with estimates obtained from a remote sensing based surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL). The \{SEBAL\} estimating of \{ET\} were derived using \{NOAA\} satellite images without any a priori calibration. The average deviation of \{ET\} estimates between \{SEBAL\} and \{LAS\} for 10-day periods was 17%. However, this deviation fell to 1% when monthly estimates were considered. This suggests regional \{ET\} values derived from remote sensing are reasonable estimates, however, the \{LAS\} was used in only one agro-ecosystem to validate the \{SEBAL\} model. The \{LAS\} is a low cost alternative to other methods of estimating heat fluxes for use in basin scale water use studies. "

This paper reviews research results of a model study on the impact of irrigation practices, i.e., irrigation quantity, quality and frequency, on soil salinity and crop transpiration of cotton and wheat in a conjunctive use environment. Four fields with a different soil texture and irrigation water quality were selected and monitored during three cropping seasons. The agro-hydrological model \{SWAP93\} was used to analyse the water flow and salt transport for the prevailing conditions. In the calibration process, the simulated water and salt balance appear to be sensitive to rooting depth, crop factors, actual soil evaporation and the soil retention function. Two concepts were used to account for field-scale heterogeneity of water infiltration and preferential flow. Taking into account this heterogeneity, the percolation losses increase, while the leaching of salts decreases. The calibrated model was used to evaluate the effects of various irrigation practices on salinization and crop transpiration. The irrigation water quantity, in terms of under-irrigation, has a greater impact than the quality of the irrigation water. Irrigation frequency may have a significant impact on the water and salt balance, especially on sandy soils. Finally, long term effects of current irrigation practices are discussed, in relation to the different soils in the study area. Soil texture appears to affect crop transpiration and salinization considerably. "

Few tropical watershed studies have lasted long enough to facilitate a credible analysis of the long-term effects of land use change on the environmental services provided by watersheds. This paper examines the driving forces and patterns of historical land use change in two long-term watershed studies in Kenya and Sri Lanka and their hydrological impacts. The upper Ewaso Ng’iro north basin is located to the north and west of Mt. Kenya, and has experienced dramatic changes in both land ownership and land use due to rapid population growth of 7–8% per annum. The upper Nilwala basin is located in the south of Sri Lanka and the area has undergone serious deforestation over the last 50 years, for agricultural land uses mainly for tea and home gardens. The loss of watershed functions associated with the impacts of land use change and their socio-economic dimensions are discussed, along with lessons that can be drawn from these studies. These case studies confirm the importance of long-term monitoring of the interaction between land use changes and catchment health. Moreover, the involvement of all stakeholders is crucial for problem identification through to the research and the search for any viable ecological, social and economical solutions. A holistic approach involving relevant disciplines in watershed studies is vital. The paper concludes that use of models that integrate both biophysical and socio-economic data should be encouraged to derive decision support tools for farmers and managers alike who are faced with resolving conflicts and other issues related to limited land and water resources.

abstract = "Summary An accurate understanding of the behavior of the water and energy balance terms in agricultural areas is of interest for a number of different disciplines. The objective of this paper is to use a multi-sensor and multi-model approach to study the water and energy budget of a winter wheat field in North-Eastern Germany. The study has been performed as part of the AgriSAR 2006 campaign. A Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS) and a Bowen-Ratio Energy Balance (BREB) installation have been used to analyze the energy balance. Soil moisture profiles were continuously monitored at a number of depths. It has been found that the \{LAS\} and \{BREB\} estimates of the sensible heat flux are consistent during daytime, but that during nighttime the \{LAS\} estimates are approximately 100 Wm−2 lower than the \{BREB\} estimates. This may be explained by the effect of the uncertainty in the stability functions for stable conditions on the \{LAS\} results. Further, generally low Bowen ratio values, in the order of 0.5, were obtained, even during very hot, dry days. This implies that the evapotranspiration rates are determined by the moisture content of the deeper soil layers. The soil moisture values of the upper and lower soil layers become decoupled under dry conditions. Two commonly used hydrologic models, \{PROMET\} and TOPLATS, were applied during the study period. \{PROMET\} reproduces the soil moisture profile slightly better than TOPLATS, while the latter model simulates the partitioning of the energy balance slightly better. This can be explained by the manner in which the energy and water balances are solved by both models. Overall, the results suggest that the evapotranspiration rates of the winter wheat field are not correlated with the surface soil moisture values, that these surface soil moisture values are not correlated with the lower soil moisture values under dry conditions, and that commonly used hydrologic models can reproduce these observations.

Nonetheless, they do not allow the extraction of all the information required, particularly semantic information. Thus, the combination of laser data with existing information is a prerequisite. This process of combining laser data with existing geographic information is not trivial. The rate of success depends much on the quality of the individual datasets and the method used to combine them.

The city of Kolkata generates almost 5500 ton of municipal solid waste (MSW) per day. The waste of the city is maintained by Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and around 80% of this waste is collected by corporation waste management system \{KMC\} has introduced the Modern Scientific Waste Compacting Stations (MSWCS) under the Clean City initiative. The \{MSW\} thus collected were taken to the nearest compactor station which houses around two to five compactors depending upon the area, in total there are 90 compactors and 30 mobile compactors functioning till date. The number is expected to go up by the end of 2015 to 163 compactors at a cost of \{INR\} 152 crore. The previous method of dumping in open Vat was unhygienic and produced odor and vector born diseases in the vicinity and the people living near were largely affected. Though the addition of compactor has enhanced the cleanliness of the city but the sustainability of these waste compactors is a major issue and which is needed to be addressed. The disposal of the compacted waste is still being carried out in traditional landfill site and the landfill site and city distance being smaller raise a question on transportation savings which may have been incurred due to the compactor thus the payback period and long-term sustainability of the compactor is in question. The sustainability issues and challenges were identified based on a preliminary field study in 15 of the compactor station in Kolkata. The waste quantity, waste characteristics, number of trip of the compactors, labors requirements and number of other sustainability factors were evaluated. The data collected were benchmarked based on the literature, with the practices of other countries. The study reveals that there is number of issues which are lacking and needed to be implemented within the waste compactor management system to make the project sustainable in long run. The analysis revealed the need for a sanitized landfill site for methane extraction and segregation of waste before compacting for increasing the sustainability of the system. The studies finding if implemented can led to a more sustainable, economical and environmentally sound waste management system for the city of Kolkata. There are number of literature specific to waste management practices but specific study for waste compactor in a city and for Kolkata is unavailable in literature. "

Within this study, \{GIS\} scripts were developed to represent and assess several different modes of ecosystem service flows between supply and demand, using ecosystem services scoring tables. By integrating the flows, the ecosystem services can be better evaluated. The outcomes do not give quantitative information on whether supply meets demand, but indicate the spatial distributions of both supply and delivery and where ecosystem services are under threat because of changes in ecosystem or flow mechanisms.

Elgon) are some of the most productive agricultural regions, often dominated by coffee and banana cultivation. Consequently, these regions suffer from a high and increasing population density with a declining soil fertility status imposing pressure on the available land, which in turn results in encroaching into the national forests. This study documents the soil fertility constraints along the slopes of Mt. Elgon and explores its corresponding gradients in plant nutritional status. This research links the topography of Mt. Elgon to the prevailing soil types and their current fertility status. It reveals important relations and gradients between soil fertility parameters and its corresponding environment along the slope. Soil pH, soil available P and exchangeable K, Ca and Mg are significantly decreasing with elevation. Thereby, gradients and constraints in macro- and micro-nutrient uptake by coffee and banana are revealed along the toposequence and different altitude-specific nutrient limitations are determined for both crops. K, Mn and Si uptake in both crops is decreasing with elevation along the slope, while the Mo and Ni uptake in both crops is increasing. With increasing elevation, B uptake is only decreasing in coffee and P uptake is only decreasing in banana. In addition, the antagonistic interaction between K and Mg limits the Mg uptake of both crops in the lower areas, while in the high region the Mg uptake is simply limited by low soil availability. It follows that a general fertilizer recommendation cannot be made in these regions and that the soil fertility problems along these slopes should be specifically addressed and appropriately managed according to the local requirements.

This paper examines conservation agriculture (CA) from the perspective of: (i) increased yield and farm income, (ii) adaptation to heat and water stresses, and (iii) reduction in greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions. The analyses and conclusions are based on the literature and evidences from a large number of on-station as well as farmers’ field trials on \{CA\} in the cereal systems of IGP. Our analyses show that CA-based system substantially reduces the production cost (up to 23%) but produces equal or even higher than conventional system; thereby increasing economic profitability of production system. CA-based production systems also moderated the effect of high temperature (reduced canopy temperature by 1–4°C) and increased irrigation water productivity by 66–100% compared to traditional production systems thus well adapting to water and heat stress situations of IGP. Our continuous monitoring of soil flux of CO2, \{N2O\} and \{CH4\} revealed that CA-based rice-wheat systems emit 10–15% less \{GHGs\} than conventional systems. This is the first time that \{CA\} and its components are synthesized and analyzed from food security-climate change nexus. From this holistic analysis, we suggest that wide-scale promotion of suitable \{CA\} practices by integrating into national agriculture development strategy is a way forward to address food security, climate change adaptation and mitigation challenges faced by present agriculture.

The application is for the \{HBV\} rainfall–runoff model at daily time-step for the Karkheh River Basin (51,000 km2) in Iran. Monte Carlo Simulation serves to estimate parameter values and to assess uncertainty for three calibration cases. In case one streamflow is used as the calibration target. In case two satellite-based \{ETa\} is used as calibration target. For both cases model performance is evaluated for the second variable that closes the water balance. In case three a preference-based multi-variable objective function is applied which is weighted for Qs and satellite-based ETa. For cloudy days a procedure is developed to complete the daily time series of satellite-based \{ETa\} that cover 4 years. Results on multi-variable calibration indicated satisfying results for both water balance terms. Results are compared against field observations and results of single-variable calibration. For cases one and two the second variable only is poorly simulated and resulted in poor reproduction of the water balance. The most important contribution of this work is that the catchment water balance is best reproduced when both Qs and satellite-based \{ETa\} serve as calibration target. "

Prior research has hypothesized a link with drinking water quality, but rigorous studies are lacking. This study assesses the relationship between nephrotoxic elements (namely arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and uranium (U)) in drinking water, and urine samples collected from individuals with and/or without \{CKDu\} in endemic areas, and from individuals without \{CKDu\} in nonendemic areas. All water samples – from a variety of source types (i.e. shallow and deep wells, springs, piped and surface water) – contained extremely low concentrations of nephrotoxic elements, and all were well below drinking water guideline values. Concentrations in individual urine samples were higher than, and uncorrelated with, those measured in drinking water, suggesting potential exposure from other sources. Mean urinary concentrations of these elements for individuals with clinically diagnosed \{CKDu\} were consistently lower than individuals without \{CKDu\} both in endemic and nonendemic areas. This likely stems from the inability of the kidney to excrete these toxic elements via urine in \{CKDu\} patients. Urinary concentrations of individuals were also found to be within the range of reference values measured in urine of healthy unexposed individuals from international biomonitoring studies, though these reference levels may not be safe for the Sri Lankan population. The results suggest that \{CKDu\} cannot be clearly linked with the presence of these contaminants in drinking water. There remains a need to investigate potential interactions of low doses of these elements (particularly Cd and As) with other risk factors that appear linked to CKDu, prior to developing public health strategies to address this illness.

Multiple sources of natural recharge include infiltration from ephemeral stream flow in the Todd River; groundwater throughflow between connected alluvial basins; regional groundwater flow from the underlying Tertiary aquifer; and diffuse recharge. In addition treatment, storage and irrigation reuse of Alice Springs’ waste water has resulted in additional recharge of effluent, via infiltration. Water resource management plans for the region include effluent reuse through Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) within one of the connected alluvial basins, with the purpose of managing the excess waste water overflows while also supplementing groundwater resources for irrigation and protecting their quality. Hydrogeochemical tracers, chloride and the stable isotopes of water, were used in a three-member mixing model to define and quantify the major recharge sources. The mixing model was not sensitive enough to quantify minor contributions from effluent in groundwater that were identified only by an evaporated isotopic signature. The contribution of the multiple recharge sources varied spatially with proximity to the recharge source; with Todd River, effluent and Town Basin throughflow contributing to the Inner Farm Basin groundwater. The Outer Farm Basin was largely influenced by the Todd River, the Inner Farm Basin throughflow and the older Tertiary aquifer. While Inner Farm groundwater throughflow contains an effluent component, only Outer Farm Basin groundwater near the interface between the two basins clearly illustrated an effluent signature. Aside from this, effluent recharge was not evident in the Outer Farm Basin, indicating that past unmanaged recharge practices will not mask signs of Managed Aquifer Recharge through the Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) operation. The long-term impact of effluent recharge is a shift from sodium and calcium as co-dominant cations in the groundwater, as evident in the Outer Farm Basin, to dominance by sodium alone, as typical for the Inner Farm Basin.

When third-party interests, such as donors or governments, design \{PES\} programs to achieve goals that lie outside the conceptual scope of payments for ecosystem services, the improvements in resource management and enhancements in livelihoods can fall short of expectations. We examine this potential dissonance in \{PES\} program implementation, taking the case of \{PES\} in the forestry sector in Vietnam. We question whether \{PES\} in Vietnam has the potential to enhance forest protection and watershed management. We highlight the importance of institutions and governance (i.e., the policies, rules, and regulations) in determining program significance and we illustrate how \{PES\} programs are implemented as part of the government's subsidy scheme. We conclude that in the absence of a competitive market structure and appropriate regulations, governments can reshape \{PES\} programs to function primarily as tools for strengthening state control over natural resources.

A simple salt balance model was developed at irrigation scheme and yearly time scales and applied in Fatnassa oasis (Nefzaoua, Tunisia). It accounts for input by irrigation, export by drainage and groundwater flow, and provides novel computation of the influence of biogeochemical processes and variations in the resident amount of salt for each chemical component in the soil and shallow groundwater. Impediments were overcome by limiting the depth of the system so that the resident amount of salt that remained was of the same order of magnitude as salt inputs and allowed indirect and reliable estimation of groundwater flow. Sensitivity analyses as partial derivatives of groundwater salinity were carried out according to non-reactive salt balance under steady-state assumption. These analyses enabled the magnitude of the salinization process to be foreseen as a function of hydrological changes linked to irrigation, drainage, groundwater flow and extension of the irrigated area. From a salt input of 39 Mg ha−1 year−1 by irrigation, 21 Mg ha−1 year−1 (54%) and 10 Mg ha−1 year−1 (26%) were exported by groundwater flow and drainage, respectively. 7 Mg ha−1 year−1 (18%) were removed from groundwater by geochemical processes, while a non-significant 2 Mg ha−1 year−1 were estimated to have been stored in the soil and shallow groundwater where the residence time was only 2.7 years. The leaching efficiency of drainage was estimated at 0.77. With a water supply of 1360 mm by irrigation and 90 mm by rainfall, drainage, groundwater flow and actual evapotranspiration were 130, 230, and 1090 mm, respectively. The current extension of date palm plantations and salinization of groundwater resources are expected to significantly increase the salinity hazard while the degradation of the drainage system is expected to be of lesser impact. The approach was successfully implemented in Fatnassa oasis and proved to be particularly relevant in small or medium irrigation schemes where groundwater fluxes are significant. "

For the first time, malformations in male periwinkles closely related to the \{TBT\} contamination can be described; the reduction of male mamilliform penial glands shows highly significant correlations to \{TBT\} concentrations in tissues.

Unfortunately, the flowers developed into invasive species due to their adaptability for a wide range of fresh water ecosystems and their interference with human activities. In the 21st century, they were considered as an alternative to fossil fuels, as many researchers found them capable of converting their content into fuel energy at less cost and recognized as an eco-friendly product. As water hyacinth is among the group of fastest growing plants, its biomass has the potential to become a potential renewable energy source and replace conventional fossil fuels, perhaps during the next decade. This is an essential mission to overcome the depletion of energy sources and also to fulfill the increasing demand of world energy. Instead of fuel energy, the dried biomass can also be fabricated as briquettes, which is suitable as co-firing agent in coal power plant. Thus, in future compacted biomass residues produced in the form of briquettes may decrease the dependence of coal to provide more energy The other application of water hyacinth into a co-compost material such as soil amendment to the sandy soil, can improve hydro-physical, chemical parameters of soil and will supply the growing crops with several nutrients. Water hyacinth has also drawn attention due to its bioremediation ability, capable of removing pollutants from domestic and industrial waste water effluents. Thus, the issue of water hyacinth should be evaluated from energy, engineering as well as environmental perspectives. In this review, the potential uses of water hyacinth are being classified and discussed. "

Examination of the core, borehole geophysics, Radon-222, electromagnetic flowmeter (EMF) profiles and step-drawdown pumping tests did not identify whether fractures contribute to groundwater flow. A number of injection and recovery tests lasting from 3 days to 3 months using potable water showed a large degree of mixing with native groundwater. Withdrawal greater than 12–17% of the injected volume resulted in recovered water containing more native groundwater than injected water. A finite element solute transport model was set up to reproduce the observed salinity in recovered water. Without the inclusion of discrete fractures in the model it was not possible to get a fit between the observed and modelled salinity of recovered water within a realistic range of dispersivity values. The model was subsequently verified by using data from long-term injection and recovery trials. This evaluation of mixing conclusively demonstrated that the aquifer behaved as a fractured rock aquifer and not as an aquifer with primary porosity alone. Therefore, aquifer storage and recovery can be a very useful hydrogeological method to identify the occurrence of fracture flow in aquifers where there is a measurable concentration difference between the injected water and ambient groundwater.

The modelling approach is based on integrating a network allocation model (REALM) and a social Cost Benefit economic model, to evaluate the physical and economic outcomes from alternative water allocation policies in a river basin or sub-basin. From a hydrological perspective, surface and groundwater models were first applied to assess surface and groundwater resource availability. Then an allocation model was applied to reconcile the calculated surface and groundwater resources. From an economic perspective initially the value of water allocated to different uses in each demand centre within the system was estimated. These values were then placed in a social Cost Benefit Analysis to assess the economic consequences of different allocation scenarios over time and space. This approach is useful as it allows policymakers to consider not only the physical dimensions of distributing water, but also the economic consequences associated with it. This model is considered superior to other models as water is increasingly being seen as an economic good that should be allocated according to its value. The framework outlined in this paper was applied to the Musi sub-basin located in the Krishna Basin, India. In applying this framework it was concluded that competition for Musi water is very high, the transfer of water from agriculture to urban users is likely to grow in future and the value of water used in different agricultural zones is very low.

Policy makers identified a number of different but plausible scenarios that could apply in the sub-basin, involving; supplying additional urban demand from agricultural allocations of water, implementing a number of demand management strategies, changing the timing of releases for hydropower generation, changing the crops grown under irrigation, reducing existing stream flows and allowing for more environmental flows. The framework chosen to undertake this assessment was a simulation model that measures and compares the economic values of water allocation scenarios determined from a water allocation model that accounts for supplies of groundwater and surface water across a number of regions and over a variety of uses. Policy makers are provided with the range of measures on the security of the supply of water and the social costs and benefits of reallocating water between sectors and across regions within the sub-basin. Taking water from agriculture to supply urban users has a greater impact on irrigation supplies during dry years. It was also found that changing the allocation of water between sectors, by taking it away from agriculture had a large positive economic impact on the urban sector. Yet the costs involved in undertaking such a strategy results in a significant loss in the net present value of the scheme. Stream flow reductions, if significantly large (at around 20%), were found to have a large physical and economic impact on the agricultural sector. Implementing water saving strategies in Hyderabad was found to be more cost effective than taking water from agriculture, if rainwater tanks are used to achieve this. Changing the timing of hydropower flows resulted in best meeting of irrigation demand in \{NSLC\} and NSRC. Under this scenario, the crops grown under irrigation were found to have a significant economic impact on the sub-basin, but not as large as farmers undertaking crop diversification strategies, ones which result in farmers growing less rice. The security of supplying water to different agricultural zones has significantly improved under this scenario. Finally, releasing water for environmental purposes was found to have only a minor impact on the agricultural sector. "

With the increasing scarcity of freshwater available to agriculture, the need to use of reclaimed water (RW) from Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) in agriculture has increased. In this study, we explored how \{RW\} from an \{STP\} can be used directly, without Aquifer Storage and Recovery, as a source of irrigation water in conjunction with groundwater for agriculture. Average data from Muscat, Oman in the years from 1996 to 2010 was used for calculation of crop water requirement. Wheat, cowpea and maize were chosen as crops to be grown in rotation through the year. Using \{RW\} irrigation conjunctively with groundwater cropping areas of wheat, cowpea and maize can be increased by 323, 250 and 318% respectively, against utilization \{RW\} only. Of the total irrigation requirement 57.6% was met with reclaimed water (RW) and 42.4% was met with groundwater (GW). Therefore, it is recommended that decision makers should consider piping \{RW\} to areas where groundwater of good quality is available to conjunctively use and meet crop water requirements, rather than piping it to areas where groundwater is saline and unsuitable for irrigation. This will prevent disposal of \{RW\} to the sea and minimize stress on fresh groundwater zones. "

The study results showed that overall situation of the ‘groundwater sustainability infrastructures’ in Kathmandu Valley is relatively poor (GSII = 0.22). The scores of all the components of the index lie on the lower side of the sustainability scale (0–1, 1 representing the highest degree of sustainability). Therefore, more attentions are required to strengthen the sustainability infrastructures and subsequently achieve groundwater sustainability in the valley. Results of the \{GSII\} application demonstrated that the index could highlight areas for improvement and ultimately guide appropriate action and policy-making towards sustainable groundwater management.

This paper investigates three major factors leading to reduction in performance of \{ASR\} systems in brackish or saline aquifers: lateral flow, density-driven flow and dispersive mixing. Previous analyses of aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) have considered at most two of the above processes, but never all three together, and none have considered lateral flow and density effects together. In this analysis, four dimensionless parameters are defined to give an approximate characterisation of lateral flow, dispersive mixing, mixed convection (density effects during pumping) and free convection (density effects during storage). An extensive set of numerical models spanning a wide parameter range is then used to develop a predictive framework using the dimensionless numbers. If the sum of the four dimensionless numbers (denoted RASR) exceeds 10, the \{ASR\} operation is likely to fail with no recoverable freshwater, while if \{RASR\} &lt; 0.1, the \{ASR\} operation is likely to provide at least some recovery of freshwater. The predictive framework is tested using limited data available from \{ASR\} field sites, broadly lending support to the framework. This study has several important implications. Firstly, the lack of completeness of field data sets in the literature must be rectified if we are to properly characterise mixed-convective flow processes in \{ASR\} operations. Once data are available, the dimensionless numbers can be used to identify suitable \{ASR\} sites and the desirable operational conditions that maximise recovery efficiencies. "

Bypass flow processes were studied in a cracked, previously puddled rice soil. Vertical continuity of soil cracks (10-10 mm in width) was determined in the field using a morphological staining technique. Cracks reached a depth of 0.65 m. An infiltration experiment showed that water was mainly absorbed in the subsoil between 0.2 and 0.5 m epth. In a laboratory experiment, simulated rainfall was applied to large undisturbed soil columns taken from the field. High bypassing ratios (greater than 0.9) were obtained for low (10 mm h−1) and high (30 mm h−1) rain intensities. Shallow surface tillage (0–50 mm) in the field reduced bypass flow, and laboratory experiments showed 45–60% water savings as a result of making the cracks discontinuous. For rainfed rice areas, introduction of this tillage practice may lead to earlier transplanting and therefore reduced risk of late drought. In some areas this may broaden the scope for a second crop. In irrigated rice systems, water savings during land preparation may allow an increase in the command area of an irrigation system. "

We evaluated the potential of satellite and weather forecast data as input to a parsimonious flood forecasting model to provide information for flood early warning in the central part of Nigeria. We calibrated the HEC-HMS rainfall-runoff model using rainfall data from post real time Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi satellite Precipitation Analysis product (TMPA). Real time \{TMPA\} satellite rainfall estimates and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) rainfall products were tested for flood forecasting. The implication of removing the systematic errors of the satellite rainfall estimates (SREs) was explored. Performance of the rainfall-runoff model was assessed using visual inspection of simulated and observed hydrographs and a set of performance indicators. The forecast skill was assessed for 1–6 days lead time using categorical verification statistics such as Probability Of Detection (POD), Frequency Of Hit (FOH) and Frequency Of Miss (FOM). The model performance satisfactorily reproduced the pattern and volume of the observed stream flow hydrograph of Benue River. Overall, our results show that \{SREs\} and rainfall forecasts from weather models have great potential to serve as model inputs for real-time flood forecasting in data scarce areas. For these data to receive application in African transboundary basins, we suggest (i) removing their systematic error to further improve flood forecast skill; (ii) improving rainfall forecasts; and (iii) improving data sharing between riparian countries.

abstract = "Abstract Based on the hydrological characteristics of a rice-based irrigation system in Southern China, the \{SWAT\} (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model was modified in order to develop the Rice Irrigation System-Soil and Water Assessment Tool (RIS-SWAT). The irrigation water movement, water balance module, and rice yield calculations of the paddy field were improved within the \{SWAT\} model. In addition, the seepage of the irrigation canal and the pond’s effect on the irrigation modules were added to the RIS-SWAT. The impact of water management on the water cycle of the small watershed irrigation system (SWIS) was evaluated by conducting a scenario analysis with RIS-SWAT. The results indicated that an increase in the maximum water ponding depth of a paddy field could decrease irrigation water and rainfall loss. The canal water supply was reduced by 20%, resulting in an increase in irrigation water productivity without a reduction in the rice yield. The temporal and spatial distributions of the irrigation water in different subbasins did not significantly affect the water cycle within the SWIS. Furthermore, when the canal water supply was reduced by 20–40% and the pond water supply was increased, the rice yield was not affected. Thus, the water productivity of irrigation systems could be improved through the implementation of water management policies and practices that reduce field outflows and reuse the return flows captured by ponds.

The energy balance closure showed a gap of 12%. For water productivity analysis the Ea was then computed with the Bowen ratio determined from the eddy covariance fluxes. The mean accumulated Ea for the two seasons was 1419 mm year−1, which corresponded to a daily average rate of 3.7 mm day−1. The mean values of the crop coefficients based on evapotranspiration (Kc) and based on transpiration (Kcb) were 0.91 and 0.73, respectively. The single layer Kc was fitted with a degree days function. Twenty percent of evapotranspiration originated from direct soil evaporation. The evaporative fraction was 0.83 on average. The average relative water supply was 1.1, revealing that, in general, irrigation water supply was in good harmony with the crop water requirements. The resulting evapotranspiration deficit was 73–95 mm per season only. The mean aerodynamic resistance (ra) was 37 s m−1 and the bulk surface resistance (rs) was 135 s m−1. The mean unit yield was 45 tonne ha−1 being equivalent to a crop water productivity of 3.2 kg m−3 when based on Ea with an economic counterpart of US$ 3.27 m−3. The drawback of this highly productive use of water resources is an unavoidable percolation flux of approximately 300 mm per growing season that is detrimental to the downstream environment and water users.

Despite considerable rice-growing potential, lack of water control systems, access to improved seeds, agrochemicals and appropriate mechanization have resulted in modest production growth rates, unable to alter the region's dependency on imported rice. Governments aim to boost production with import duties and input subsidies. However, questions remain as to whether these policies enable the rice sector to respond to changing consumers preferences for high grade rice and to contribute to national economic growth. We present the results from a Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM) on rice production in Ghana, Burkina Faso and Niger and under three water management systems: irrigation (public scheme), supplemented rain-fed (rainfall aided by autonomously-sourced water supplies) and purely rain-fed. Our results show that policy interventions in these West African countries (i.e., input subsidies and import taxes) did not significantly enhance the profitability of rice production to farmers due to the effect of market failures (limited capital access and non-competitive market for rice) and the low quality of local milled rice. The \{PAM\} results point strongly to the importance of improving rice quality and yields through more efficient water management and post-harvest handling/processing and targeted breeding to match consumers' preferences.

The Alfisol humic acid samples were characterized by a higher content of unsaturated (110-0 ppm) carbons and a lower content of quaternary ( 145-120 ppm) carbons than those of the Vertisol.

In this study, we evaluate the effect of soil depth and subsurface flow on shallow landslide prediction using the shallow landslide stability (SHALSTAB) model. Three detailed soil depth data—the average soil depth, weathered soil depth, and bedrock soil depth—were collected using a knocking pole test at a small hillslope site composed of granite in the Republic of Korea. The \{SHALSTAB\} model was applied to a ground surface topographic digital elevation model (DEM) using the three soil depths and upslope contributing area (SCA) assuming subsurface flow calculated from four DEMs: a ground surface topography (GSTO) DEM, weathered soil topography (WSTO) DEM, bedrock topography (BSTO) DEM, and low-level bedrock topography (EBSTO) DEM. The model performance was measured using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. While evaluating the effect of the soil depth with \{SCA\} using \{GSTO\} DEM, it was found that the bedrock soil depth had higher prediction accuracy compared to that of the average soil depth or weathered soil depth. To evaluate the saturated subsurface flow between the soil and bedrock, \{SCAs\} calculated using \{WSTO\} and \{BSTO\} \{DEMs\} were applied. From these simulations, we found that \{SCA\} from \{BSTO\} \{DEM\} and the bedrock soil depth affect the shallow landslide prediction; however, these prediction effects are not significantly increased by large differences in the elevation (between the lowest and highest elevation values). Therefore, we considered the influence of the bedrock depression and \{SCA\} from \{EBSTO\} DEM. In applying \{SCA\} from EBSTO, the prediction accuracy was significantly increased compared to the other predictions. Our results demonstrate that the influence of the bedrock topography on the prediction of shallow landslides may be particularly significant at the scale of a hillslope. "

Empirical analysis based on data from stratified random sampling of rural households in five provinces of China shows that about 85% of human excreta was still used as manure in agriculture in 2007 which was less than a decade ago when nearly all human excreta was used as manure. Econometric results suggest that income growth, rising population density and improvement in rural transportation significantly contribute to declining use of human excreta as manure in agriculture. These results imply that the current downward trend will continue given China's rising economic growth, urbanization and rural infrastructural improvement. "

This paper improves our understanding of these tradeoffs by conducting an empirical analysis based on a set of nationwide panel data collected in 2008 and 2012 and covering five provinces, 101 villages, and 2020 households. Evidence is found to suggest that it is not always the case that rural households that are affected by pollution reap the off-farm employment benefits associated with industrialization. Specifically, although industrial pollution incidence is found to be positively related with the level of local off-farm employment, this relationship is statistically insignificant when migrant labor is included. It can be explained as areas that less economically benefited from industrialization tent to have more labors migrated out and the average annual wage income of one migrant labor is much higher than that of local off-farm labor.

The daily \{ET\} was estimated (RMSE of 0.38 mm d−1) for mixed agricultural and natural ecosystems.

Ten Landsat images for a period from 2001 to 2007 were used, together with the locally calibrated Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and agro-meteorological data to derive information on regional actual evapotranspiration (ET), biomass production (BIO), and crop water productivity (CWP).

Similar incremental \{ET\} values between natural and irrigated ecosystems were found from micro-meteorological field experiments. The consequence of this land use change on São Francisco River's downstream stream flow was assessed by estimating volumetric incremental evapotranspiration at the regional scale. The bio-physical crop water productivity per unit of actual evapotranspiration (CWPET) varied between 0.4 and 1.7 l of wine per m3 of water for wine grapes; 1.7 and 4.0 kg of fruits per m3 of water for table grapes; and 2.2 and 5.0 kg of fruits per m3 of water for mangos.

The goal of this study is to introduce a new, globally applicable downscaling method and to demonstrate its applicability to derive fine resolution results from coarse global inundation estimates. The downscaling procedure predicts the location of surface water cover with an inundation probability map that was generated by bagged decision trees using globally available topographic and hydrographic information from the SRTM-derived HydroSHEDS database and trained on the wetland extent of the \{GLC2000\} global land cover map. We applied the downscaling technique to the Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS) dataset to produce a new high-resolution inundation map at a pixel size of 15 arc-seconds, termed GIEMS-D15. GIEMS-D15 represents three states of land surface inundation extents: mean annual minimum (total area, 6.5 × 106 km2), mean annual maximum (12.1 × 106 km2), and long-term maximum ( 17.3 × 106 km2); the latter depicts the largest surface water area of any global map to date. While the accuracy of GIEMS-D15 reflects distribution errors introduced by the downscaling process as well as errors from the original satellite estimates, overall accuracy is good yet spatially variable. A comparison against regional wetland cover maps generated by independent observations shows that the results adequately represent large floodplains and wetlands. GIEMS-D15 offers a higher resolution delineation of inundated areas than previously available for the assessment of global freshwater resources and the study of large floodplain and wetland ecosystems. The technique of applying inundation probabilities also allows for coupling with coarse-scale hydro-climatological model simulations. "

The results emphasized that few plots were continuously submerged during the 2005 season, when rainfall was low.

The yield decrease due to drought was about 87% and that due to salinity was 20%. When neither salinity nor water were limiting, the soil nutrient supply was high enough to achieve about 80% of the maximum yield reported in the literature for the rice cultivar in this area.

The motivation comes from field observations made after the tsunami in December, 2004 in South Asia. The focus is on the role and effects of heterogeneity on flushing effectiveness. A scheme that combines experimentation in a 4.8 m long laboratory tank and numerical modeling was used. To demonstrate the effects of geologic heterogeneity, plume migration and flushing times were analyzed in both homogeneous and layered media and under different boundary conditions (ambient flow, saltwater infiltration rate, freshwater recharge). Saltwater and freshwater infiltrations imitate the results of the groundwater salinization from the tsunami and freshening from the monsoon rainfall. The saltwater plume behavior was monitored both through visual observations (digital photography) of the dyed salt water and using measurements taken from several electrical conductivity sensors installed through the tank walls. The variable-density, three dimensional code \{HST3D\} was used to simulate the tank experiments and understand the fate and movement of the saltwater plume under field conditions. The results from the tank experiments and modeling demonstrated that macro-scale heterogeneity significantly influenced the migration patterns and flushing times of diffuse saltwater contamination. Ambient flow had a direct influence on total flush-out time, and heterogeneity impacted flush-out times for the top part of the tank and total flush-out times. The presence of a continuous low-permeability layer caused a 40% increase in complete flush-out time due to the slower flow of salt water in the low-permeability layer. When a relatively small opening was introduced in the low-permeability layer, salt water migrated quickly into a higher-permeable layer below causing a reduction in flush-out time. Freshwater recharge caused an early dilution of salt water in the top part of the tank in the case of a layered media, but also pushed the saltwater plume into the low-permeability layer which led to increased total flush-out times.

In this context we: 1) highlight those applications where \{EO\} technologies are ready for wider uptake by wetland managers, and provide suggestions for supporting such uptake; 2) indicate where \{EO\} technologies and applications currently in the research and development stages could potentially be useful in wetland management; and 3) provide recommendations for new research and development of \{EO\} technologies, that can be utilized to address aspects of wetland management not covered by the range of current \{EO\} applications.

The solution is seen as a move away from traditional agricultural practices which are inefficient water users and lead to high groundwater recharge and toward high water use enterprises that can minimise groundwater recharge. Previous modelling studies have shown that land use change in local groundwater systems has the potential to impact upon groundwater levels and streamflow within a decadal scale time frame, however there are few field based studies to prove the modelling correct. The current study reports on 13 years of groundwater and surface water monitoring on a 129 ha first order catchment in the Boorowa River catchment in NSW, Australia. The land use has changed from annual cropping and pastures to tree belts with perennial pastures. Five years after the land use change, the groundwater levels have fallen dramatically due to almost no recharge, runoff has been significantly reduced and the salt input–output ratio of the catchment has halved. Analysis of the measured components of the water cycle show that the reduction in recharge and runoff are due to the land use change and not merely a reflection of the reduced rainfall since the implementation of the land use change. Numerical groundwater modelling has shown that the reduction in salt affected area in this catchment and the export of salt out of this catchment will reduce for the next few decades. "

Rooting in the current knowledge of consumer psychology, and employing the game-theoretic modelling framework, we formalise the decision making process of individuals about their resource consumption levels depending on their level of environmental concern, and relative importance placed on social and ecological information. Our model demonstrates, in a stylized fashion, how profound preference to social information can help avert free-riding behaviour and result in globally stable resource consumption dynamics. This avoids the “Tragedy of the Commons”, leading to affluence in the resource stock as well as in the individual consumption. Furthermore, we find that heterogeneity of the levels of individuals’ environmentalism promotes free-riding, whereas heterogeneity in relative information preferences helps avoiding tragedies. Our analysis demonstrates that accounting for heterogeneity of consumers and their social relationships can yield additional insights regarding to what kind of societies may have better chances to ensure sustainable consumption of a natural resource.

Di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) was compared to manure, ashes, combinations of those, 1/2 Tithonia 1/2 \{DAP\} (TD) and no input. 1/3rd of the labour was saved when placing seeds in trenches as compared to individual holes without losing significant grain yield. Broadcasting requires 1/9th of the planting time while losing only 15% grain. 5% grain was lost by weeding once instead of twice, while saving 36% of the time. The time saved at planting can be more productively invested in collecting inputs. Plots without input yielded 537 kg ha−1 grain and 642 kg ha−1 biomass in 2006. Inputs increased both grain and biomass yields significantly with 27–51%, without significant difference between local and mineral inputs (with exception of TD).

During the last century, compartmentalization of hydrologic flows in the Florida Everglades by canals and levees has had a profound impact on the natural timing and supply of freshwater and nutrients across the southern Everglades. Nitrogen (N) is an understudied nutrient in the phosphorus-limited Everglades; it plays an important role in many Everglades processes. To gain a better understanding of the overall N-dynamics in southern Everglades’ marshes and the role that canals play in the distribution of N across this landscape, we analyzed δ15N natural abundance data for the primary ecosystem components (the macrophyte Cladium jamaicense, marl soils, peat soils, and periphyton). Three sample transects were established in the three main basins of the southern Everglades: Shark River Slough, Taylor Slough, and the C-111 basin. Each transect included sample sites near canal inflows, in interior marshes, and at the estuarine ecotone. Natural abundance δ15N signatures provided insights into processes that may be enriching the 15N content of ecosystem components across the marsh landscape. We also conducted a combined analysis of δ15N data, tissue N concentrations, and water column N data to provide a broad overview of N cycling in the freshwater marshes of the southern Everglades. The primary trend that emerged from each basin was a significant 15N enrichment of all ecosystem components at near-canal sites, relative to more downstream sample sites. These data suggest that the phosphorus-limited marshes of the southern Everglades are not inactive conduits for N. Rather, these marshes appear to be actively cycling and processing N as it flows from the canal–marsh interface through downstream freshwater marshes. This finding has important implications to downstream coastal estuaries, including Florida Bay, and to nearshore coastal ocean ecosystems, such as coral reefs, where N is the limiting nutrient. "

An important part of the overall project consists of the use of the event-based \{EUROSEM\} model (European Soil Erosion Model) to predict soil erosion rates. This paper evaluates the use of the model both for single event and yearly soil loss estimations using erosion plot data from Nicaragua and data obtained through rainfall simulator experiments in Costa Rica and Mexico. \{EUROSEM\} was calibrated based on the hydrographs followed by the sedigraphs in Costa Rica and Mexico and this was followed by a model validation. In Nicaragua, model calibration was done using total soil loss values for 1993 and the model was consecutively validated using plot data for 1994 and 1995. The study stresses the importance of calibrating the model for individual catchments, and that the total area of plant stems and soil cohesion are crucial calibration parameters when modelling grassland with cover percentages above 60%. \{EUROSEM\} generally did not perform well on single event simulations in terms of simulating hydrographs and sedigraphs. Whereas the difference between observed and simulated total soil loss was between 0.0% and 100.0%, differences in total discharge, peak run-off rate and peak soil loss ranged between 2.0% and 326.5%. The difference was attributed to the model's inability to model crusting. The application of the model for yearly soil loss predictions looks promising with simulated and observed total soil loss values in Nicaragua differing by between 2.5% and 5.0%. "

This raises the question to which extent irrigation supply can be reduced without detriment to yield. Our study focuses on the yield–water uptake relationship for maize in the moderate water stress range in order to determine the onset of stress-induced dry-matter and yield losses. Compensatory plant responses under moderate stress levels are discussed in relation to seasonal climatic conditions. Summer-sown and spring-sown maize were irrigated with a decreasing amount of water in a field experiment in Pakistan. Water supply ranged from 100% water required to maintain soil at field capacity (FC) to 40% of FC. The average dry-matter and yield levels were slightly higher for summer-sown (15.0 Mg ha−1) compared to spring-sown maize (13.1 Mg ha−1). The onset of significant dry-matter and yield reduction started at the least irrigation treatment in both seasons. The amount of water required to avoid production losses was 272 mm in the summer-sown maize during the autumn growing season, and 407 mm for the spring-sown maize in the summer season, when the evaporative demand of the atmosphere was +27% higher. Water use efficiency (WUEET), normalized by vapour pressure deficit, of the summer-sown maize which was 10.0 kg kPa m−3, was +15% higher compared to the spring-sown crop; while the irrigation water productivity (2.9 kg m−3) was +11% more. \{WUEET\} increased over the whole range of applied water deficits for summer-sown maize, while the spring-sown crop showed a decreasing \{WUEET\} in the less irrigated treatment. Due to the higher efficiency in summer-sown maize, the potential in irrigation reduction without production losses (129 mm) was higher compared to the spring-sown maize (57 mm). Our results showed that in Pakistan water saving irrigation practices can be applied without yield loss mainly during the cooler growing season when the crop can efficiently compensate a lower total water uptake by increased use efficiency. For spring-sown maize the increasing evaporative demand of the atmosphere towards summer implies a higher risk of yield losses and narrows the range to exploit higher irrigation water productivity under moderate water deficit conditions.

This is a problem when designing a water harvesting system, for instance, with micro-catchments. This paper presents a design method for micro-catchments, based on a simulation approach. Available rainfall and evaporation data are supplemented with soil physical data, determined from samples taken on the spot. A linear regression model combined with a transient one-dimensional finite difference water balance model is used to simulate the complete water harvesting process for a number of years. The theoretical basis of the model, including initial and boundary conditions is discussed. Experimental data from the Northern Negev Desert are used to calibrate the model. The water balance is simulated for two sets of soil physical properties, and for extremely arid and arid conditions. The performance of micro-catchments with varying runoff area A and basin area B is studied. This \{AB\} ratio is a key parameter in micro-catchment design. The following conclusions are drawn: (1) extremely arid conditions (‘true desert’) are too dry for micro-catchment-water-harvesting; (2) for arid conditions with average annual rainfall of ca. 200 mm, and the trees and loess soil considered, a preliminary design would have a basin area B of ca. 40 m2 and a runoff area A of between 40 and 80 m2.

Presumably the interest in synergies springs from the appeal of creating win–win situations by implementing a single climate policy option. However, institutional complexity, insufficient opportunities and uncertainty surrounding their efficiency and effectiveness present major challenges to the widespread development of synergies. There are also increasing calls for research to define the optimal mix of mitigation and adaptation. These calls are based on the misguided assumption that there is one single optimal mix of adaptation and mitigation options for all possible scenarios of climate and socio-economic change, notwithstanding uncertainty and irrespective of the diversity of values and preferences in society. In the face of current uncertainty, research is needed to provide guidance on how to develop a socially and economically justifiable mix of mitigation, adaptation and development policy, as well as on which elements would be part of such a mix. Moreover, research is needed to establish the conditions under which the process of mainstreaming can be most effective. Rather than actually developing and implementing specific mitigation and adaptation options, the objective of climate policy should be to facilitate such development and implementation as part of sectoral policies. Finally, analysis needs to focus on the optimal use and expected effectiveness of financial instruments, taking into account the mutual effects between these instruments on the one hand, and national and international sectoral investments and official development assistance on the other.

The question arises whether stock management can be adapted to mitigate the consequences of this climatic change. Here, we estimate the effects of increasing water temperatures on fisheries yield and population dynamics of whitefish, a typical cold-water fish species. Using a process-based population model calibrated on an empirical long-term data set for the whitefish population (Coregonus lavaretus (L.) species complex) of the pre-alpine Lake Irrsee, Austria, we project density-dependent and temperature-dependent population growth and compare established stock enhancement strategies to alternative stocking strategies under the aspect of increasing water temperatures and cost neutrality. Additionally, we contrast the results obtained from the process-based model to the results from simple regression models and argue that the latter show qualitative inadequacies in projecting catch with rising temperatures. Our results indicate that increasing water temperatures reduce population biomass between 2.6% and 7.9% and catch by the fishery between 24% and 48%, depending on temperature scenario and natural mortality calculation. These reductions are caused by accelerated growth, smaller asymptotic size and lower annual survival of whitefish. Regarding stocking strategies under constant temperatures, we find that stocking mostly whitefish larvae, produces higher population biomass than stocking mostly one-summer-old whitefish, while catch remains almost constant. With increasing temperatures, stocking one-summer-old fish is more beneficial for the angling fishery. Adaption to climate change by changing stocking strategies cannot, however, prevent an overall reduction in catch and population size of this cold-water fish species. "

Ninety-four images based on 8 day temporal and 250 m spatial resolutions were analyzed for the hydrological years 2009 and 2010. Unsupervised and supervised clustering techniques were utilized to identify various \{LULC\} types with aid of ground information on crop calendar and the land features of the river basin. Ground truthing data were obtained during two rainfall seasons to assess the classification accuracy. The results showed an overall classification accuracy of 85%, with the producer’s accuracy of 83% and user’s accuracy of 86% for confidence level of 98% in the analysis. The overall Kappa coefficient of 0.85 also showed good agreement between the \{LULC\} and the ground data. The land suitability classification based on FAO-SYS framework for the various \{LULC\} types were also consistent with the derived classification results. The existing local database on total smallholder irrigation development and sugarcane cultivation (large scale irrigation) showed a 74% and 95% variation respectively to the \{LULC\} classification and showed fairly good geographical distribution. The \{LULC\} information provides an essential boundary condition for establishing the water use and management of green and blue water resources in the water stress Pangani River Basin. "

The effects of drain condition (bare earth vs. grazed pasture) and management (weed growth and herbicide application) are investigated over four drainage events. The results show that farm drains (160 m long) significantly alter the phosphorus concentrations in drainage water. The changes in phosphorus concentration and to a lesser extent phosphorus form appear to be affected by the condition as well as the management of the drain. For example the wetting front concentrations increased by 4.4 mg P/l down a pasture-based drain and decreased by 1.2 mg P/l down an earthen drain. Understanding the transport of phosphorus between the paddock and farm boundary appears to be an important step in developing strategies to minimise the potential export of phosphorus from irrigated dairy farms.

We exposed pre-limb bud stage tadpoles (Gosner stages 25–26) of the Asian Common Toad, Duttaphrynus melanostictus to the same pleurolophocercous type cercariae under laboratory conditions. Molecular and morphological identification showed that these cercariae belonged Acanthostomum burminis infecting freshwater snakes as definitive hosts. These cercariae induced malformations (27.8%) and reduced survival to metamorphosis (53.8%). The magnitude of the effects increased with the dose of cercariae. Types of malformations were mainly axial, such as scoliosis and kyphosis. Severe limb malformations such as extra or missing limbs as reported for amphibians exposed to R. ondatrae were not observed in the D. melanostictus. Same authors reported a higher percentage of malformations previously when P. cruciger was exposed to the cercariae A. burminis compared to D. melanostictus. However, tadpoles of D. melanostictus, which are smaller compared to those of P. cruciger, experienced higher mortality than P. cruciger tadpoles. Trematode induced malformations and mortality in amphibians are highly variable and depend on multiple factors such as host species differences such as resistance to infection and tolerance, life-history characteristics such as size at metamorphosis and length of the metamorphosis period, and other factors such as size of the amphibian at the time of trematode exposure.

Driven largely by hydrologic algorithms for upland, wetland and shallow-water habitats, the model captures the response of macrophyte and algal communities to simulated levels of nutrients, water, and environmental inputs. It explicitly incorporates ecological processes that determine water levels, plant production, nutrient cycling associated with organic matter decomposition, consumer dynamics, and fire. While the model may be used to simulate ecosystem dynamics for a single homogenous habitat, our primary objective is to replicate it as a “unit” model in heterogeneous, grid-based dynamic spatial models using different parameter sets for each habitat. Thus, we constrained the process (i.e., computational) complexity, yet targeted a level of disaggregation that would effectively capture the feedbacks among important ecosystem processes. A basic version was used to simulate the response of sedge and hardwood communities to varying hydrologic regimes and associated water quality. Sensitivity analyses provided examples of the model dynamics, showing the varying response of macrophyte production to different nutrient requirements, with subsequent changes in the sediment water nutrient concentrations and total water head. Changes in the macrophyte canopy structure resulted in differences in transpiration, and thus the total water levels and macrophyte production. The GEM's modular design facilitates understanding the model structure and objectives, inviting variants of the basic version for other research goals. Importantly, we hope that the generic nature of the model will help alleviate the “reinventing-the-wheel” syndrome of model development, and we are implementing it in a variety of systems to help understand their basic dynamics.

Historical data on land use, channel morphology and sedimentology were collected, based on a spatial analysis of aerial photographs (1963–1995) and a field survey (2002). Analysis of channel cross-sectional profiles and sedimentological data revealed a major change in morphology and sedimentology of the Deleg River during the past four decades: (i) the active river channel narrowed by over 45%, (ii) the riverbed incised on average by over 1.0 m and (iii) the median grain size of the bed surface decreased from 13.2 cm to 4.7 cm. The spatial pattern of land cover within the Deleg catchment also changed considerably: highly degraded agricultural land in the low-lying areas was abandoned and partially afforested for timber and wood production, whereas secondary upland forest was increasingly cleared for expansion of cropland and pastures. Notwithstanding large changes in the spatial organization of land use within the catchment, the overall land use did not change significantly during the past four decades. This suggests that the response of the Deleg River to land-use change not only depends on the overall land-use change, but also on the spatial pattern of land-use/cover change within the catchment. Although forestation and regeneration of bare gully slopes and floors throughout the catchment only represented a minor part of the total land-use change, these land-use/cover changes had a major impact on the hydrological and sediment connectivity in the landscape.

Groundwater levels are declining despite water harvesting measures to enhance aquifer recharge which are supported on a massive scale by watershed development programmes. New programmes are being implemented to improve artificial percolation (i.e., managed aquifer recharge, MAR) although the impact of former measures on aquifer recharge has not yet been assessed. It is therefore crucial to increase our understanding of \{MAR\} to successfully overcome the threat of groundwater scarcity in the near future. This paper scrutinizes the ability of a typical percolation tank to recharge the aquifer using a comprehensive approach combining water accounting, geochemistry and hydrodynamic modelling. Over 2 years of observation, the percolation efficiency (percolated fraction of stored water) of the tank ranged from 57% to 63%, the rest being evaporated. Modelling showed that the percolated water was mostly (80%) pumped straight back by the neighbouring boreholes, limiting the area of \{MAR\} influence but increasing percolation efficiency. "

In September 2011, a ten-year return-period flood in the study area reworked and deposited braid bars. After the flood, we surveyed three bars with different geomorphologies using a \{GPR\} system with a 250-MHz antenna and identified seven fundamental radar depositional facies: Inclined reflections (facies Ia and Ib), horizontal to subhorizontal reflections (facies \{IIa\} and IIb), discontinuous reflections (facies \{IIIa\} and IIIb), and facies assemblage with a large-scale channel-shaped lower boundary (facies IV). Combinations of these facies in\dicate bar formation processes: channel filling, lateral aggradation, and lateral and downstream accretion. In the Abe River, aerial photographs and airborne laser scanning data were obtained before and after the flood. The observed changes of the surface topography are consistent with the subsurface results seen in the \{GPR\} sections. This study demonstrated that the erosional and depositional architecture observed among bars with different channel styles was related to river width and represented depositional processes for high-sediment discharge. The quantitative characterizations of the sedimentary architecture will be useful for interpreting gravelly fluvial deposits in the rock record. "

Both play major roles in serving the demands of growing populations, and climate change models predict both semi-arid to arid regions to become hotter and/or drier in the future. The Jordan River basin, shared by five nations, is already experiencing a critical level of environmental damage. Its lower stretch is practically a sewage canal with less than 10% of its natural base-flow. Due to its unique historical, religious and environmental role, restoration efforts have gained momentum and wide public support. In the Colorado River Basin, water law is characterized by the “Law of the River” and water use is managed through regional allocation constraints. The Colorado River, shared by seven U.S. states and Mexico, is highly managed and over-allocated. Shortage declarations have serious implications for low priority users, with the Central Arizona Project being among the lowest. This makes large population centers and agricultural users vulnerable to curtailment of deliveries. We argue that there are common factors with respect to the policy and management options of these two basins that may provide insights into the similarities and divergences of their respective future pathways. These factors are: regional water supply and demand pressures, water governance, transboundary issues and demand for environmental flows. With a particular focus on the Israel and Arizona portions of these respective river basins, we address synergies and tradeoffs between groundwater and surface water usage, sectoral allocation strategies, public vs. private water ownership and legality, transboundary sharing, technical options for addressing growing regional water scarcity, and economic considerations. Difficult and bold decisions are required in both regions. "

abstract = "Climate change will affect hydrologic and thermal regimes of rivers, having a direct impact on freshwater ecosystems and human water use. Here we assess the impact of climate change on global river flows and river water temperatures, and identify regions that might become more critical for freshwater ecosystems and water use sectors. We used a global physically based hydrological-water temperature modelling framework forced with an ensemble of bias-corrected general circulation model (GCM) output for both the \{SRES\} \{A2\} and \{B1\} emissions scenario. This resulted in global projections of daily river discharge and water temperature under future climate. Our results show an increase in the seasonality of river discharge (both increase in high flow and decrease in low flow) for about one-third of the global land surface area for 2071–2100 relative to 1971–2000. Global mean and high (95th percentile) river water temperatures are projected to increase on average by 0.8–1.6 (1.0–2.2) °C for the \{SRES\} B1–A2 scenario for 2071–2100 relative to 1971–2000. The largest water temperature increases are projected for the United States, Europe, eastern China, and parts of southern Africa and Australia. In these regions, the sensitivities are exacerbated by projected decreases in low flows (resulting in a reduced thermal capacity). For strongly seasonal rivers with highest water temperatures during the low flow period, up to 26% of the increases in high (95th percentile) water temperature can be attributed indirectly to low flow changes, and the largest fraction is attributable directly to increased atmospheric energy input. A combination of large increases in river temperature and decreases in low flows are projected for the southeastern United States, Europe, eastern China, southern Africa and southern Australia. These regions could potentially be affected by increased deterioration of water quality and freshwater habitats, and reduced water available for human uses such as thermoelectric power and drinking water production.

The total concentration of \{PCBs\} ranged from 0.59 to 12.38 ng/g dw, with a mean value of 3.82 ng/g dw. The seven indicators of \{PCB\} concentrations are significantly correlated with the total \{PCB\} concentrations (R = 0.950, p = 0.000). The temporal trend of \{PCBs\} in sediments showed that the total \{PCBs\} in the Songhua River have decreased since 2008. Point source pollution, discharge of historical usage and industrial sewage, and emissions of unintentionally produced \{PCBs\} were the predominant sources in sediment. A risk assessment indicated that most of the sampling sites in the sediment were at low potential ecological risk. The apparent decrease of \{PCBs\} in the sediment appeared after the China National Coordination Group for Implementation of the Stockholm Convention was established.

In 2007, the use of the fallout radionuclide 137Cs as a tracer for estimating the magnitude of medium-term (40–50 years) rates of soil redistribution was tested at a research station in Ibadan, Nigeria, to investigate, for the first time, its applicability in the derived savanna of West Africa. Because of the traditional tillage practice for cassava cultivation of creating downslope oriented ridges and furrows during the annual ploughing, there was a need to adapt the 137Cs approach to these specific condition. The mean inventory was determined for cores collected from both ridges and furrows at different positions down the slope and this value was used to estimate the downslope variation in the longer term soil redistribution rate. The mean 137Cs reference inventory obtained for an undisturbed site was 568 ± 138 Bq m−2. The average inventory for the upper slope of the cassava field (423 ± 323 Bq m−2) was generally lower than the average inventory for the middle slope (509 ± 166 Bq m−2) and for the lower slope (606 ± 245 Bq m−2) and these results provided clear evidence of the downslope movement of soil. The mean 137Cs inventory for the study area within the cassava field (496 ± 273 Bq m−2) was 13% lower than the reference inventory, indicating that some of the soil mobilised and redistributed by erosion had been exported beyond the field. Using 137Cs data set and the conversion model mass balance model 2 (MBM2), the gross erosion rate from the cultivated site was estimated to be 18.3 t ha−1 year−1 and the net erosion rate 14.4 t ha−1 year−1, providing a sediment delivery ratio of 78%. These estimates are comparable to the rates generated by conventional soil loss measurements made close to the study site. The study demonstrates that the 137Cs technique can be successfully used to obtain data on medium-term soil redistribution in the derived savanna of Nigeria, and that it could be a useful tool for supporting the improvement of soil conservation on farmland in West Africa.

We collected diverse biophysical data to allow spatial variability of soil organic carbon and factors contributing to this variation to be determined statistically, and used well established simulation models to interpret the data, predict long-term carbon dynamics and determine the potential for improvements in soil quality and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. The spatial variation in soil organic carbon in the 0–20 cm soil depth was significant across study areas (P &lt; 0.01, 21.6 g kg−1–37.8 g kg−1), and between land-uses (P &lt; 0.05, 27.9 g kg−1 in cropland and 43.0 g kg−1 soil in forestland). In a multiple linear regression model, among the 11 explanatory variables used, four (total nitrogen, shrubs, trees and land use) showed a significant positive effect (P &lt; 0.01), while three (impact of grazing, impact of erosion and clay) showed a significant negative effect (P &lt; 0.01). Simulations using the assumption of steady state to estimate carbon dynamics suggested that plant inputs from croplands are generally lower than grass or shrublands, resulting in build-up of recalcitrant organic matter in shrublands compared to grass or croplands. Erosion results in a decline in both the absolute and relative amounts of carbon in recalcitrant pools, but the more active pools remained unchanged, meaning that the overall activity of soil organic matter is increased when the soil is eroded, and it becomes more difficult to sequester soil carbon. More rapid decrease in soil organic carbon is likely to be due to increased erosion, persistent removal of organic materials, grazing pressures, and higher rate of decompositions in cropland and grazing land-uses. Conversion to shrubland shows high potential to quickly restore eroded soils and build up a pool of recalcitrant soil carbon, suggesting that management of land using periodic 20 year exclosures, preventing cropping and grazing and allowing shrubland succession, could be beneficial in restoring degraded soils. Simulations using a calibration approach, rather than assuming steady state, corroborated these findings, suggesting that after 30 years of current management, croplands will deplete soil organic carbon by 5.6, 7.1 and 7.2 t ha−1, and grasslands by 3.5, 3.9 and 2.7 t ha−1, while shrublands will build-up soil organic carbon by 0.6, 0.1 and 1.3 t ha−1 at study sites. At one study site, forests, will further increase soil organic carbon by 6.7 t ha−1 after 30 years. The significant positive impact of shrubs and trees on soil organic carbon suggests the need to focus on introduction of agroforestry systems in crop and grasslands. "

Here we report a study of a field that has been unexplored until now: analytical evaluation of the properties of the emission of \{CH4\} and \{N2O\} and methods of restricting their emission in soil-trench wastewater treatment processes, the use of which is spreading, mainly in developing nations. The results have provided the following information. A field fact-finding survey has confirmed that soil trenches emit 9.3–13.9 g \{CH4\} m−3 and 8.2–12.2 gN2O m−3 in Japan, and 3.0–4.5 g \{CH4\} m−3 and 3.3–5.0 g \{N2O\} m−3 in China. The emission properties widely vary according to the structure of the treatment system. The conversion ratio for nitrogen in the wastewater influent to \{N2O\} by a soil trench is between 2 and a maximum of 8%, and ranges from a few- to several 10-fold as much as that with the activated sludge method, suggesting that this can be a large source of \{N2O\} emission. It has also clearly been shown that the aerobic–anaerobic state inside the treatment system is closely related to its \{CH4\} and \{N2O\} emission characteristics. By performing ventilation to maintain the oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) near the trench at an aerobic condition of +200 mV or more, the quantities of \{CH4\} and \{N2O\} emitted can be reduced by as much as 50% from the levels without this ventilation, and that this can make a large contribution.

Using the Zhejiang Small Hydropower Programme financed by the \{WB\} as a real-world application case study, a comparison is made between the project management policies espoused in China and those of the WB, with management constraints being examined in detail. Owing to the need for certain modifications to current management techniques, a framework model of programme management is put forward, with the project management office (PMO) at its core, and staged implementation and multi-level management constituting its principal methods. In addition, this model of programme management meets the requirements concerning the policies and procedures stipulated by the WB, with other benefits including a reduction in terms of cost as well as in the duration of the construction of related subprojects. This is especially relevant if we take into consideration the sheer number of small hydropower plants and the diversity of their locations throughout China. This model should therefore be considered for promoting the scale-up development of small hydropower and other renewable energies in China, and its application may have a wider significance. "

In the Uda Walawe irrigation scheme in southern Sri Lanka, irrigation canals are being lined with concrete to save water, meant to enable extension of the irrigated area. The effects of lining on the availability of water for multiple uses were investigated by field measurements of water levels and by an inventory of the perceptions of changed water availability by the population through focus group discussions. From the measurements it was determined that canal seepage provides an important contribution to groundwater recharge. It was estimated that after concrete lining the annual groundwater recharge in the irrigated areas will be reduced by approximately 50%. This saves a substantial amount of water that can be used to extend the irrigation area so more people can benefit from the available irrigation water. However, in the currently irrigated areas lining will have negative impacts by lowering groundwater levels due to a reduction in seepage from canals. This seepage contributes to the recharge of shallow wells used by the population to obtain water for drinking and cooking. The perception of the population was that enough water remains for domestic use. Other changes, such as reduced yields from home gardens were considered to be more important. Despite these negative impacts the expected positive impacts in the extension area justify, from a social equity point of view, concrete lining as a measure to redistribute the available water over the Uda Walawe area.

The laboratory results show that the occurrence of toppling failures is more probable than the simple shear-type mechanism that has been analyzed most frequently by prior researchers. We go on to model these toppling failures numerically. Specifically, a Mohr-Coulomb model, within the framework of SIGMA/W software (ver. 7.17), was used to simulate the stress–strain behavior of the experimental banks. The numerical results for loess materials are in good agreement with the laboratory observations, but the simulations do not replicate experimental failures observed in higher density, more cohesive soils.

SHAW, as a physically based, Land-surface model, provides a useful tool for understanding and analyzing soil freezing and thawing processes. In this paper, using the measured data of temperate desert ecosystem in Dachaidan assessed the model performance in simulating soil freezing and thawing processes. Comparison of the simulated results by \{SHAW\} to the measured data showed that in the initial stage of freezing the simulated frozen depth was thinner than the measured; in the thawing period the simulated thawing rate was higher than the measured due to the overestimated soil temperature below 10 cm; however, for the most cold stage (the stable frozen stage), the simulated matched quite well with the measured. For the maximum frozen depth the simulation only overestimated by as much as 4%. On the whole, the \{SHAW\} model performed satisfactorily.

This study determined the toxicity of Cu and U individually, and in combination, to a tropical freshwater macrophyte, Lemna aequinoctialis (duckweed), in a synthetic soft water (27 °C; pH, 6.5; hardness, 40 mg CaCO3 l−1, alkalinity, 16 mg CaCO3 l−1), typical of many fresh surface waters in coastal northern Australia. The growth rate of L. aequinoctialis decreased with increasing Cu or U concentrations, with the concentration of Cu inhibiting growth by 50% (EC50) being 16 ± 1.0 μg l−1, with a minimum detectable effect concentration (MDEC) of 3.2 μg l−1. The concentration of U inhibiting growth by 50% (EC50) was 758 ± 35 μg l−1 with a \{MDEC\} of 112 μg l−1. The \{EC50\} value for the exposure of L. aequinoctialis to equitoxic mixtures of Cu and U was significantly (P ⩽ 0.05) higher than one toxic unit (1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.18–1.52), indicating that the combined effects of Cu and U are less than additive (antagonistic). Therefore, inhibition of the growth rate of L. aequinoctialis was reduced when Cu and U were present in equitoxic mixtures, relative to individual metal exposures. Since non-additive (e.g. antagonistic) interactions of metal mixtures cannot be predicted using current mixture models, these results have important potential implications for the protection of freshwater ecosystems through the derivation of national water quality guidelines.

However, they remain relatively unstudied because of the inaccessibility of the terrain and the difficulties in field work caused by the thick debris mantles. Observations of debris-covered glaciers are therefore scarce and airborne remote sensing may bridge the gap between scarce field observations and coarse resolution space-borne remote sensing. In this study we deploy an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) before and after the melt and monsoon season (May and October 2013) over the debris-covered tongue of the Lirung Glacier in Nepal. Based on stereo-imaging and the structure for motion algorithm we derive highly detailed ortho-mosaics and digital elevation models (DEMs), which we geometrically correct using differential \{GPS\} observations collected in the field. Based on \{DEM\} differencing and manual feature tracking we derive the mass loss and the surface velocity of the glacier at a high spatial accuracy. On average, mass loss is limited and the surface velocity is very small. However, the spatial variability of melt rates is very high, and ice cliffs and supra-glacial ponds show mass losses that can be an order of magnitude higher than the average. We suggest that future research should focus on the interaction between supra-glacial ponds, ice cliffs and englacial hydrology to further understand the dynamics of debris-covered glaciers. Finally, we conclude that \{UAV\} deployment has large potential in glaciology and it may revolutionize methods currently applied in studying glacier surface features. "

With respect to the BRB, and Nepal in general, the study results show variations in adaptive capacity of the water resources system across the river basin (eight districts within the BRB), at different geographical (district, river basin and national level) as well as temporal (over decades) scale. Such variations suggest a need of differential policy interventions at different spatial scale to achieve adaptive management of the water resources. The adaptive capacity index can be used to prioritize basins, the adaptive capacity parameters can be used to identify the broader areas of intervention in the selected basin, and adaptive capacity indicators reveal the degree of attention required to strengthen adaptive capacity of the water resources system.

Daily total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) fluxes were measured for 2 years in Taylor River, and ten 10-day intensive studies were conducted in this creek to estimate the seasonal flux of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), total organic carbon (TOC), and suspended matter. Four 10-day studies were conducted simultaneously in Taylor, McCormick, and Trout Creeks to study the spatial variation in concentration and flux. The annual fluxes of TOC, TN, and \{TP\} from the Southern Everglades were estimated from regression equations. The Southern Everglades watershed, a 460-km2 area that includes Taylor Slough and the area south of the C-111 canal, exported 7.1 g C m−2, 0.46 g N m−2, and 0.007 g P m−2, annually. Everglades P flux is three to four orders of magnitude lower than published flux estimates from wetlands influenced by terrigenous sedimentary inputs. These low P flux values reflect both the inherently low P content of Everglades surface water and the efficiency of Everglades carbonate sediments and biota in conserving and recycling this limiting nutrient. The seasonal variation of freshwater input to the watershed was responsible for major temporal variations in N, P, and C export to Florida Bay; approximately 99% of the export occurred during the rainy season. Wind-driven forcing was most important during the later stages of the dry season when low freshwater head coincided with southerly winds, resulting in a net import of water and materials into the wetlands. We also observed an east to west decrease in TN:TP ratio from 212:1 to 127:1. Major spatial gradients in N:P ratios and nutrient concentration and flux among the creek were consistent with the westward decrease in surface water runoff from the P-limited Everglades and increased advection of relatively P-rich Gulf of Mexico (GOM) waters into Florida Bay. Comparison of measured nutrient flux from Everglades surface water inputs from this study with published estimates of other sources of nutrients to Florida Bay (i.e. atmospheric deposition, anthropogenic inputs from the Florida Keys, advection from the GOM) show that Everglades runoff represents only 2% of N inputs and 0.5% of P input to Florida Bay.

Nevertheless knowledge about the quantification of the hydrological functions provided by wetlands is still limited. The current study was carried out on a small rural catchment in South Africa (263 km2), where according to the locals, a change in hydrological regime has occurred during the past decade. A small wetland area occupies the bottom of the catchment, and this wetland has been drastically reduced by small scale farming activities. The purpose of the study was twofold; on the one hand to determine if any hydrological change occurred, and on the other hand to relate it to the land use change, which is considered the cause of the change by conservationist groups. A comparative analysis of the land use of the catchment during the past decade was carried out using satellite images. The hydrological behavior of the basin during the last two decades was then studied using the conceptual rainfall-runoff model GR4J. Indeed the available climate and hydrological data was very poor and only a scarce-parameters lumped model could be used. According to Nash coefficient of efficiency, the model was able to simulate the observed runoff of the catchment with acceptable accuracy. The method showed that under similar rainfall conditions, the basin was generating more runoff in recent years than in the early 1990s. This observation matched an observed reduction in the wetland area. To check if this change in land use could be the cause of the hydrological change, rapid estimations were made of the water transfer processes in the different land use units. It appears that, in particular in the wetlands area, the processes related to land use change only account for a small proportion of the observed increase in runoff at the catchment scale. Under conditions of inaccurate hydrometeorological information, the approach used is appropriate to study the changes in the water balance at the catchment scale. We suggest that future applications of this method should in addition include an uncertainty assessment. Moreover it may be relevant to analyse if this method performs better than other parsimonious empirical models. "

Easy access to groundwater is seen as one of the major threats to their maintenance and functioning. Potentially, however, conjunctive use of water from rain, tanks and groundwater reserves, supported by proper monitoring, could improve the resilience and productivity of traditional tank irrigation systems. To date, few quantitative multi-annual analyses of such climate-smart systems have been published. To redress this, we assess the sustainability of a rehabilitated tank irrigation system, by monitoring all inputs and outputs over a period of six years (12 cropping seasons). Our results show that during the period considered, improved conjunctive use resulted in a more stable cropping intensity, increased economic water productivity and higher net agricultural income. Groundwater tables were not negatively affected. We argue that improved conjunctive use can considerably reduce the vulnerability of tank irrigation to rainfall variability and thus is a valuable strategy in light of future climate change. "

Because experiments with only a few fertility management options on a limited number of sites and years cannot fully capture the complex and highly non-linear soil–climate–crop interactions, crop growth simulation models may suitably complement experimental research to support decision making regarding soil fertility and water management. By means of a long term (23 years) scenario analysis using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model, this study investigates millet response to N in view of establishing N recommendations better adapted to subsistence small-holder millet farming in the Sahel. Prior to this, the \{APSIM\} model was tested on a rainfed randomized complete block experiment carried out during the 1994 and 1995 cropping seasons, having contrasting rainfall conditions. The experiment combined, at three levels each, the application of cattle manure (300, 900 and 2700 kg ha−1), millet residue (300, 900 and 2700 kg ha−1) and mineral fertilizer (unfertilized control, 15 kg N ha−1 + 4.4 kg P ha−1 and 45 kg N ha−1 + 13.1 kg P ha−1) at \{ICRISAT\} Sahelian Center, Niger. The model suitably predicted plant available water \{PAW\} and the simulated water and nitrogen stress were in agreement with measurement (water) and expectation (N) regarding the fertilizer and rainfall conditions of the experiment. \{APSIM\} simulations were in satisfactory agreement with the observed crop growth except for the highest crop residue application rates (&gt;900 kg ha−1). For biomass and grain yield, the model performance was relatively good in 1994 but biomass yields were slightly overpredicted in 1995. The model was able to adequately reproduce the average trend of millet grain yield response to N inputs from manure and fertilizer, and to predict the overall observed higher grain yield in 1995 compared to 1994, despite the better rainfall in 1994. The 23-year, long term scenario analysis combining different application rates of cattle manure, millet residue and mineral fertilizer, showed that moderate N application (15 kg N ha−1) improves both the long term average and the minimum yearly guaranteed yield without increasing inter-annual variability compared to no N input. Although it does imply a lower average yield than at 30 kg N ha−1, the application of 15 kg N ha−1 appears more appropriate for small-holder, subsistence farmers than the usual 30 kg N ha−1 recommendation as it guarantees higher minimum yield in worst years, thereby reducing their vulnerability.

This is, in large part, due to the high variability of rainfall and the huge potential impact of extreme hydrologic events on structures and on the landscape in general. Magnitudes of runoff and soil loss or sedimentation rates in those environments are better not assessed by conventional modelling techniques, which tend to average out event magnitude and recurrence variability in time and space. A probability-based approach is proposed here to analyse and predict rainfall erosion losses. The maximum annual storm and its associated erosivity is used as a core element in the assessment of annual interrill and rill erosion rates. Frequency and cumulative soil loss distributions are obtained by combining verified annual and maximum daily rainfall frequency distributions with a proposed erosion algorithm. This stochastic representation of erosion permits to evaluate soil losses for the maximum annual storm, as well as annual erosion rates as a function of recurrence interval. The proposed method was verified with a short series of measured soil loss data in Cape Verde. The physical basis underlying the prediction algorithm and method in general, could be sustained by experimental data and field survey evidence. The method seems applicable to arid and semiarid ecosystems with a high seasonal concentration of precipitation and with rainfall limited to only a few major storm events. "

These effects have been shown to significantly affect spatio-temporal variations in water availability and rice productivity in Asia. Therefore, this study addresses the spatio-temporal variations of the various water components within irrigated toposequences in an African inland valley and assesses its effect on water productivity and respective rice yields for two irrigation practices: (i) continuous flooding (CF), a well-known water management practice in rice cultivation used worldwide and (ii) a reduced irrigation scheme (RI) where irrigation is applied every 5 days resulting in a 1–2 cm water layer after irrigation. The lateral flow observed in the inland valley had a strong two-dimensional character, contributing to water gains between fields, located at the same toposequential level as well as along toposequences. The toposequential effect on sub-surface hydrological processes masked the overall effect of water management treatment on rice production. Additionally, the associated water productivity (WP) was not found to differ significantly between the treatments when standard calculations (i.e. net irrigation and evapotranspiration) were used but a clear toposequential effect was found for the fertilized lower lying fields when the net irrigation was corrected by the lateral flow component. Results of the established mixed regression model indicated that based on the groundwater table, rainfall and standard soil physico-chemical characteristics rice yields can be predicted in these African inland valleys under continuous flooding and reduced irrigation practices. Validation of the established regression function of inland valleys, representing various groundwater tables in the region, could lead to improved regression functions suitable to estimate spatial variation in rice production and water consumption across scales as affected by water management, fertilizer application and groundwater tables.

Based on a long-term (&gt;30 years) water quality monitoring program in the Western Lake Erie area, United States, this study compared seasonal variation of nitrate export from an agricultural watershed and an urbanized watershed. A seasonality index was adapted to quantitatively characterize seasonal variation of nitrate export from the two watersheds. Results showed that monthly nitrate concentrations from the two watersheds exhibited different seasonal variation. Seasonality index of monthly nitrate loading for the agricultural watershed is approximately 3 times of that from the urbanized watershed and the difference is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0001). Meanwhile, calculated historical seasonality indexes of monthly nitrate loading for both watersheds exhibited significant (p &lt; 0.05) decreasing trends according to the non-seasonal Mann-Kendall test. The identified differences in seasonal nitrate export from the two watersheds were mainly attributed to their distinct nitrogen sources, physical and biogeochemical settings. The declining seasonality index of monthly nitrate loading from the agricultural watershed could be partially caused by historical climate change in the study region, especially increased temperature during winter. Urbanization could be one key factor contributing to the declining seasonality index of monthly nitrate loading from the urbanized watershed. Information derived from this study have practical implications for developing proper management practices to mitigate nitrate pollution in Midwestern United States. "

Despite the above soil physical quality improvements and effectiveness in runoff and soil loss reduction, biomass and plant height of tef were significantly higher in \{TRAD\} than PB. The significantly high weed dry matter at first weeding, the types of weeds and their water uptake behavior might have caused the lower tef yield on the PB.

We also quantified net areal fluxes along the open water portion of the channel to determine the relative importance of either zone (vegetated vs. unvegetated) in the regulation of nutrient exchange in this system. Taylor River's hydrology is driven mainly by precipitation and wind, as there is little influence of tide. Therefore, quarterly samplings of the vegetated and unvegetated flumes were slated to include typical wet season and dry season periods, as well as between seasons, over a duration of two years. Concentrations of dissolved and total organic carbon (DOC and TOC) were highest during the wet season and similar to one another throughout the study, reflecting the low particulate loads in this creek. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (nitrate+nitrite+ammonium) was 10–15% of the total nitrogen (TN) content, with NO−x and NH+4 showing similar concentration ranges over the 2-year study. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) was usually &lt;0·05μM, while total phosphorus (TP) was typically an order of magnitude higher. Net areal fluxes were calculated from nutrient concentration change over the length of the flumes. Most flux occurred in the vegetated zone. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen and \{DOC\} were usually taken up from the water column; however, we saw no seasonal pattern for any constituent over the course of this study. Total nutrients (TOC, TN, and TP) showed little net exchange and, like SRP, had fluxes that shifted irregularly throughout the study. Despite the lack of a clear seasonal pattern, there was a great deal of consistency between vegetated flumes, especially for NO−x and NH+4, and fluxes in the vegetated flumes were generally in the same direction (import, export, or no net flux) during a given sampling. These findings suggest that the fringe mangrove zone is of considerable importance in regulating nutrient dynamics in lower Taylor River. Furthermore, the influence of this zone may at times extend into northeast Florida Bay, as the bay is the primary recipient of water and nutrients during the wet season. "

Large amounts of N (7 kg N ha−1 per year in 2000 and 44 kg N ha−1 per year in 2002) were lost in the control treatment through runoff and eroded sediments, which corresponds respectively to about 10 and 43% of the total outflow of N. Sole stone rows and grass strips reduced erosion N losses to 8 and 12%, respectively, of the total annual loss. The combined application of \{SWC\} measures and nutrients inputs reduced erosion N losses to only 2–7% of the annual N loss. The application of urea-N or compost-N led to the lowest soil N mining over the 3 years, whereas the highest N mining was observed in plots without added N. We conclude that N mining in poor fertile soils of West Africa can be mitigated through an integration of local water and nutrient management practices. "

Conventional water treatment is expensive, requires advanced technology and often breaks down in less developed countries so low cost interventions are needed. Field and laboratory based trials were carried out in order to investigate the effect of the natural coagulant Moringa oleifera (MO) seed extracts in reducing helminh eggs and turbidity in irrigation water, turbid water, wastewater and tap water. In medium to high turbid water \{MO\} extracts were effective in reducing the number of helminth eggs by 94–99.5% to 1–2 eggs per litre and the turbidity to 7–11 NTU which is an 85–96% reduction. \{MO\} is readily available in many tropical countries and can be used by farmers to treat high turbid water for irrigation, however, additional improvements of water quality, e.g. by sand filtration, is suggested to meet the guideline value of ≤1 helminth egg per litre and a turbidity of ≤2 NTU as recommended by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for water intended for irrigation. A positive correlation was established between reduction in turbidity and helminth eggs in irrigation water, turbid water and wastewater treated with MO. This indicates that helminth eggs attach to suspended particles and/or flocs facilitated by \{MO\} in the water, and that turbidity and helminth eggs are reduced with the settling flocs. However, more experiments with water samples containing naturally occurring helminth eggs are needed to establish whether turbidity can be used as a proxy for helminth eggs. "

Despite that an extensive literature describes the theoretical mechanisms of turbulent water vapour transport above and within crop canopies fewer studies have examined land surface parameters within composite landscapes of irrigated crops and semi-arid natural vegetation. Aiming to improve parameterizations of the radiation and energy balance in irrigated crops and natural vegetation, micro-climatic measurements were carried out on irrigated land (vineyards and mango orchard) and natural vegetation (caatinga) in the semi-arid zone of the São Francisco River basin (Brazil) from 2002 to 2005. The fractions of 24 h incident solar radiation available for net radiation were 46%, 55%, 51% and 53%, for wine grape, table grape, mango orchard and caatinga, respectively. Daily evaporative fractions of the net available energy used as latent heat flux (λE) were 0.80, 0.88, 0.75 and 0.33 respectively. The daylight values of bulk surface resistances (rs) averaged 128 s m−1, 73 s m−1, 133 s m−1 and 1940 s m−1 for wine grape, table grape, mango orchard and caatinga, respectively. Simplified parameterizations on roughness and evaporation resistances were performed. It could be concluded that net radiation can be estimated by means of a linear expression with incident global solar radiation depending on the type of vegetation. The variability of aerodynamic resistance (ra) could be mainly explained by the friction velocity (u∗) which on turn depends on the surface roughness length for momentum transport (z0m). The experimental data showed that for sparse canopies z0m being 9% of the mean vegetation height is a doable operational rule for the semi-arid region of São Francisco River basin. The seasonal values of rs for irrigated crops were highly correlated with water vapour pressure deficit. The availability of analytical methods to assess ra and rs makes the one-step Penman–Monteith equation suitable for the computation of actual evapotranspiration and water productivity analyses. "

abstract = "Summary Water flow and solute transport in soils forms an essential part in many groundwater hydrology studies. This is especially true for Northeast Thailand, where the agricultural land is affected by the soil salinity, which is a widespread and an increasing phenomenon affecting 25% of the agricultural land. Salinization appears as scattered discrete patches of 10–100 m2 in the lowlands, illustrated by white efflorescences during the dry season and bare soil during the cropping season. A field study was undertaken in farm plots to measure the water flow and solute transport within the soil surface and the vadose zone, both inside and outside a saline patch. The water flow was measured on the soil surface with lysimeters and infiltration rings, and was derived in the soil from the hydraulic gradients measured with tensiometers placed at different depths. The salt transport was evaluated with water traps also placed at different depths, where the soil water’s electrical conductivity was measured throughout the rainy season. Field study results demonstrated that the accumulation of saline solutions in rain fed paddy fields, occurred mainly during the rainy season while the soil surface remained flooded. During this period the saline water table rose towards the soil surface independently of infiltration into the soil. It happened in specific places where the compacted soil layer, generally ubiquitous in the area at a depth of 40–50 cm, is interrupted. Therefore salinity appeareds in discret points as patches. Artesian upward flow already described in this area (Haworth et al., 1966; Williamson et al., 1989; Imaizumi et al., 2002) is most probably responsible for this water table rise, thereby affecting crop productivity. Numerical modelling of water flow using HYDRUS-3D further supported these results and showed that managing the depth of flooding within the plot can significantly reduce the outbreak of these saline plumes.

The output \{MRS\} geophysical parameters, i.e. water content and decay constants versus depth, were compared to hydrogeological characteristics, i.e. water table depth, total porosity, specific yield and transmissivity estimated from direct measurements, pumping tests and transient groundwater modelling. The MRS-determined parameters were then used to estimate the rates of groundwater recharge. Contained in poorly consolidated Tertiary sandstones, the \{CT3\} aquifer's water table has continuously risen by 4 m in total over the past four decades. Additionally, a significant portion of this increase has occurred in the past decade alone, with an annual rise now ranging between 0.1 and 0.3 m depending on the monitored well. Increase in groundwater recharge due to land clearance and deforestation explains this situation. According to previous estimations, the pre-clearing recharge ranged from 1 to 5 mm per year in 1950–60 s, while more recent recharge rates (1990s–2000s) range from 20 to 50 mm per year. These recharge values are directly affected by estimated aquifer specific yield value, while the spatial variation of rates of water table rise can be attributed to large scale hydrodynamic heterogeneities in the aquifer. However, few field measurements were available to confirm these assumptions. The main results of this study are: (1) The water table depth and aquifer transmissivity are estimated from \{MRS\} output parameters with an average accuracy of ± 10% and ± 9% respectively. (2) The MRS-determined water content is linked to both the total porosity and the specific yield of the aquifer, but no quantitative formulation can be proposed as yet. (3) Using the average MRS-determined water content over the investigated area, i.e. 13%, the groundwater recharge rates can be estimated to be ~ 2 mm per year in the 1950–1960s (pre-clearing period), and ~ 23 mm per year for the last decade. (4) The variations in specific yield and transmissivity cannot explain by themselves the spatial variability of the rise of the water table. (5) The ranges in transmissivity and water content obtained from \{MRS\} are more realistic than the groundwater modelling outputs. Therefore, \{MRS\} could be used to better constrain the aquifer parameters in groundwater modelling with a dense site network. Finally, this work illustrates how \{MRS\} can successfully improve characterisation and transient multi-year groundwater balance of commonly found sedimentary aquifers, particularly when integrated with well observations and pumping tests.

Low flood risk awareness leads to inefficient spatial developments and increased flood risk. We show that personal experience, risk communication, financial instruments like insurance from flooding and technical instruments like building on high elevations, are factors that increase individual risk awareness. Evidence that these factors indeed affect housing prices and land use patterns is provided. We discuss proactive instruments that can be used in coastal zone management in the Netherlands to increase individual risk awareness.

However, there have been limited comprehensive studies of this and other basins with diverse agroecologies. We analyzed the variability of gross soil loss and sediment yield rates under present and expected future conditions using a newly devised methodological framework. The results showed that the basin generates an average soil loss rate of 27.5 t ha− 1 yr− 1 and a gross soil loss of ca. 473 Mt yr− 1, of which, at least 10% comes from gully erosion and 26.7% leaves Ethiopia. In a factor analysis, variation in agroecology (average factor score = 1.32) and slope (1.28) were the two factors most responsible for this high spatial variability. About 39% of the basin area is experiencing severe to very severe (&gt; 30 t ha− 1 yr− 1) soil erosion risk, which is strongly linked to population density. Severe or very severe soil erosion affects the largest proportion of land in three subbasins of the \{UBNR\} basin: Blue Nile 4 (53.9%), Blue Nile 3 (45.1%), and Jema Shet (42.5%). If appropriate soil and water conservation practices targeted ca. 77.3% of the area with moderate to severe erosion (&gt; 15 t ha− 1 yr− 1), the total soil loss from the basin could be reduced by ca. 52%. Our methodological framework identified the potential risk for soil erosion in large-scale zones, and with a more sophisticated model and input data of higher spatial and temporal resolution, results could be specified locally within these risk zones. Accurate assessment of soil erosion in the \{UBNR\} basin would support sustainable use of the basin's land resources and possibly open up prospects for cooperation in the Eastern Nile region. "

In this mining area, 40 ground water samples, mainly from drilled wells, were collected. The groundwaters have generally from neutral to acidic pH values and their Eh values indicate oxidising conditions. The dominating ions are calcium, sodium, and bicarbonate. The metal concentrations in the study area are generally lower than those typically found in mining regions. Only 17 wells show metal concentrations exceeding \{WHO\} guidelines for at least one metal. The main contaminants are manganese and iron, but arsenic and aluminium also exceed the guidelines in some wells probably affected by acid mine drainage (AMD). Metal concentrations in the groundwater seem to be controlled by the adsorption processes. Hydrogeochemical modelling indicates supersaturation of groundwater with respect to several mineral phases including iron-hydroxides/oxides, suggesting that adsorption on these minerals may control heavy metal and arsenic concentrations in groundwater. The area is hilly, with many groundwater flow divides that result in several local flow systems. The aquifers therefore are not strongly affected by weathering of minerals due to short groundwater residence times and intense flushing. The local character of groundwater flow systems also prevents a strong impact of acid mine drainage on groundwater systems in a regional scale. "

These discharges typically display significant spatial and temporal variability making assessments difficult. Groundwater seepage is patchy, diffuse, temporally variable, and may involve multiple aquifers. Thus, the measurement of its magnitude and associated chemical fluxes is a challenging enterprise. A joint project of \{UNESCO\} and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has examined several methods of \{SGD\} assessment and carried out a series of five intercomparison experiments in different hydrogeologic environments (coastal plain, karst, glacial till, fractured crystalline rock, and volcanic terrains). This report reviews the scientific and management significance of SGD, measurement approaches, and the results of the intercomparison experiments. We conclude that while the process is essentially ubiquitous in coastal areas, the assessment of its magnitude at any one location is subject to enough variability that measurements should be made by a variety of techniques and over large enough spatial and temporal scales to capture the majority of these changing conditions. We feel that all the measurement techniques described here are valid although they each have their own advantages and disadvantages. It is recommended that multiple approaches be applied whenever possible. In addition, a continuing effort is required in order to capture long-period tidal fluctuations, storm effects, and seasonal variations. "

Effectiveness of facilitators’ strategies to manage frame diversity in the Fogera case is discussed. Two main elements challenging effectiveness are identified: counter-strategies used by facilitators and most-powerful stakeholders, and the constraining factors knowledge, champions and frame sponsorship.

Grain yield and plant nutrient accumulation in above-ground plant dry matter (DM) were measured at physiological maturity of rice (n ∼ 2000) in on-station and on-farm experiments in six Asian countries between 1995 and 1997. These data were used to model the nutrient requirements for yields up to 11 t ha−1 using the \{QUEFTS\} (Quantitative Evaluation of the Fertility of Tropical Soils) approach. The model required the estimation of two borderlines describing the minimum and maximum internal efficiencies (IE, kg grain per kg nutrient in plant DM), which were estimated at 42 and 96 kg grain kg−1 N, 206 and 622 kg grain kg−1 P and 36 and 115 kg grain kg−1 K, respectively. The model predicted a linear increase in grain yield if nutrients are taken up in balanced amounts of 14.7 kg N, 2.6 kg P and 14.5 kg K per 1000 kg of grain until yield targets reached ca. 70–80% of the climate-adjusted potential yield (Ymax). The corresponding \{IEs\} were 68 kg grain kg−1 N, 385 kg grain kg−1 P and 69 kg grain kg−1 K for a balanced nutrition. The model predicted a decrease in \{IEs\} when yield targets approached Ymax. The derived borderlines are valid for current modern, high-yielding indica cultivars with a harvest index of 0.50 kg kg−1 and can be used for all methods of crop establishment. Only Ymax is required as site- or season-specific information when estimating nutrient requirements for a yield target making the model applicable for all irrigated lowlands in South- and Southeast Asia.

However, this information on \{SOM\} stability and \{MRT\} is expensive to determine via radiocarbon dating, precluding a wide spread use of stability measurements in soil science. In this paper, we test an alternative method, first developed by Conen et al. (2008) for undisturbed Alpine grassland systems, using C and N stable isotope ratios in more frequently disturbed agricultural soils. Since only information on carbon and nitrogen concentrations and their stable isotope ratios is required, it is possible to estimate the \{SOM\} stability at greatly reduced costs compared to radiocarbon dating. Using four different experimental sites located in various climates and soil types, this research proved the effectiveness of using the C/N ratio and δ15N signature to determine the stability of mOM (mineral associated organic matter) relative to \{POM\} (particulate organic matter) in an intensively managed agro-ecological setting. Combining this approach with δ13C measurements allowed discriminating between different management (grassland vs cropland) and land use (till vs no till) systems. With increasing depth the stability of mOM relative to \{POM\} increases, but less so under tillage compared to no-till practises. Applying this approach to investigate \{SOM\} stability in different soil aggregate fractions, it corroborates the aggregate hierarchy theory as proposed by Six et al. (2004) and Segoli et al. (2013). The organic matter in the occluded micro-aggregate and silt &amp; clay fractions is less degraded than the \{SOM\} in the free micro-aggregate and silt &amp; clay fractions. The stable isotope approach can be particularly useful for soils with a history of burning and thus containing old charcoal particles, preventing the use of 14C to determine the \{SOM\} stability. "

However, the relation of farmers' cognitive soil maps to scientific soil maps in the Geographical Information Systems (GIS), developed as an integration domain, was problematic. In-depth analysis was only achieved through geo-referencing local knowledge (LK) using global positioning system (GPS). In Bangladesh, ethnographic methods obtained local soils knowledge and its socio-cultural context, and accompanied scientific surveys of floodplain soils and agroecosystems. Subsequent data processing included database and \{GIS\} tools, but there were problems systematically relating the two knowledge bases.

Here, we quantitatively demonstrate the role and significance of different drivers (climate change, fertilizer use, change in rice cultivation area, and changes in crop varieties and management) in explaining rice yield development in China, through the use of two temporally and regionally calibrated crop models – \{EPIC\} and DSSAT. China’s rice yield has increased from 4324 kg ha−1 in 1981 to 6553 kg ha−1 in 2010, with an evidently slowing growth rate over this time period. The observed flattening growth trend is well captured by both crop models. \{EPIC\} simulated a yield increase of 2024 kg ha−1 up to 2010, with agricultural intensification together with increased application of chemical fertilizer and improved crop varieties and management dominating the growth, contributing 64% and 37% respectively, while changes in climate (2%) and cultivation area (−3%) contributed only minimally. The recent slowing rate of rice yield growth is largely interpreted as a decreasing relative contribution of fertilizer, that is not being compensated by relative benefits from improved varieties and management. We also find that adaptation to climate change may have contributed to the observed increase of rice yield by facilitating the relocation of rice growing areas and the adoption of improved rice cultivars. Crop model simulations demonstrate that additional yield increases could be achieved through the introduction of rice cultivars and management optimized for climate, suggesting viable options for reversing the slowing of rice yield growth. Moving towards an agriculture that utilizes climate benefits more smartly is one of the solutions to enhance future food supply in China. "

We examined the \{DF\} prevalence and severity among 491 children (10 to 15 years old) who are life-long residents of 33 rural communities in which groundwater concentrations of F− cover a wide range. A subset of 156 children was selected for urinary F− measurements. Our results showed that the mean F− concentrations in groundwater were 8.5 ± 4.1 mg/L (range: 1.1–18 mg/L), while those in urine were 12.1 ± 7.3 mg/L (range: 1.1–39.8 mg/L). The prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe \{DF\} in children's teeth was 17%, 29%, and 45%, respectively, and the majority (90%; n = 140) of the children had urinary F− concentrations above 3 mg/L. Below this level most of the teeth showed mild forms of DF. The exposure–response relationship between F− and \{DF\} was positive and non-linear, with \{DF\} severity tending to level off above a F− threshold of ~ 6 mg/L, most likely due to the fact that at ~ 6 mg/L the enamel is damaged as much as it can be clinically observed in most children. We also observed differential prevalence (and severity) of \{DF\} and urinary concentration, across children exposed to similar F− concentrations in water, which highlights the importance of individual-specific factors in addition to the F− levels in drinking water. Finally, we investigated urinary F− in children from communities where defluoridation remediation was taking place. The lower F− concentration measured in urine of this population demonstrates the capacity of the urinary F− method as an effective monitoring and evaluation tool for assessing the outcome of successful F− mitigation strategy in relatively short time (months) in areas affected with severe fluorosis.

Three groundwater systems have been identified, namely, GWS-1, GWS-2 and GWS-3 according to the watershed distribution in the Ordos Desert Plateau. Ca2+ and Mg2+ are the most dominant cations in GWS-1, while Na+ is dominant in GWS-3. In addition, there is more SO42− and less Cl− in GWS-1 than in GWS-3. The shallow groundwater in GWS-2 seems to be geochemically between that in GWS-1 and GWS-3. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the shallow groundwater are high in GWS-1 and GWS-2 and are low in GWS-3. By geochemically comparing the nearby Yellow River, local precipitation and deep groundwater, the shallow groundwater is recharged only by local precipitation. The ionic and isotopic ratios indicate that carbonate dissolution is an important process controlling the chemistry of the shallow groundwater. The intensity of the water–rock interactions varies among the three groundwater systems and even within each groundwater system. Three end-members controlling the groundwater chemistry are isotopically identified: (1) precipitation infiltration, (2) carbonate dissolution and (3) silicate weathering. The relative Sr contributions of the three end-members show that precipitation infiltration and carbonate dissolution are the primary sources of the shallow groundwater Sr in GWS-3 whereas only carbonate dissolution is responsible for the shallow groundwater Sr in GWS-1 and GWS-2. Silicate weathering seems insignificant towards the shallow groundwater's chemistry in the Ordos Desert Plateau. This study is helpful for understanding groundwater chemistry and managing water resources. "

Per capita mass loads of \{PFRs\} were calculated using the accurate Census head counts. The results indicate that tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) has the highest per capita input into wastewater followed by tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP), tris(isobutyl) phosphate (TIBP), tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) and tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP). Similar \{PFR\} profiles were observed across the Australian \{STPs\} and a comparison with European and U.S. \{STPs\} indicated similar \{PFR\} concentrations.

Available data are generally fragmented and scattered with different organizations and mostly cover the valleys. Here, we combine most of the available station data with the indirect precipitation estimates at the accumulation zones of major glaciers to analyse altitudinal dependency of precipitation in the high-altitude Indus basin. The available observations signified the importance of orography in each sub-hydrological basin but could not infer an accurate distribution of precipitation with altitude. We used Kriging with External Drift (KED) interpolation scheme with elevation as a predictor to appraise spatiotemporal distribution of mean monthly, seasonal and annual precipitation for the period of 1998–2012. The KED-based annual precipitation estimates are verified by the corresponding basin-wide observed specific runoffs, which show good agreement. In contrast to earlier studies, our estimates reveal substantially higher precipitation in most of the sub-basins indicating two distinct rainfall maxima; 1st along southern and lower most slopes of Chenab, Jhelum, Indus main and Swat basins, and 2nd around north-west corner of Shyok basin in the central Karakoram. The study demonstrated that the selected gridded precipitation products covering this region are prone to significant errors. In terms of quantitative estimates, ERA-Interim is relatively close to the observations followed by \{WFDEI\} and TRMM, while \{APHRODITE\} gives highly underestimated precipitation estimates in the study area. Basin-wide seasonal and annual correction factors introduced for each gridded dataset can be useful for lumped hydrological modelling studies, while the estimated precipitation distribution can serve as a basis for bias correction of any gridded precipitation products for the study area.

It has a significant impact on water quantity and quality and influences food, water, and energy security. The consequences of drought vary in space and time, from the local scale (e.g. county level) to regional scale (e.g. state or country level) to global scale. Within the regional scale, there are multiple socio-economic impacts (i.e., agriculture, drinking water supply, and stream health) occurring individually or in combination at local scales, either in clusters or scattered. Even though the application of aggregated drought information at the regional level has been useful in drought management, the latter can be further improved by evaluating the structure and evolution of a drought at the local scale. This study addresses a local-scale agricultural drought anatomy in Story County in Iowa, USA. This complex problem was evaluated using assimilated AMSR-E soil moisture and MODIS-LAI data into a crop model to generate surface and sub-surface drought indices to explore the anatomy of an agricultural drought. Quantification of moisture supply in the root zone remains a gray area in research community, this challenge can be partly overcome by incorporating assimilation of soil moisture and leaf area index into crop modeling framework for agricultural drought quantification, as it performs better in simulating crop yield. It was noted that the persistence of subsurface droughts is in general higher than surface droughts, which can potentially improve forecast accuracy. It was found that both surface and subsurface droughts have an impact on crop yields, albeit with different magnitudes, however, the total water available in the soil profile seemed to have a greater impact on the yield. Further, agricultural drought should not be treated equal for all crops, and it should be calculated based on the root zone depth rather than a fixed soil layer depth. We envisaged that the results of this study will enhance our understanding of agricultural droughts in different parts of the world. "

Overall, it is argued here that restricting access to the most hazardous pesticides would be of paramount importance to reduce the number of severe acute poisoning cases and case-fatalities and would provide greater opportunities for preventive programmes to act effectively. The aim should be to achieve an almost immediate phasing out of the \{WHO\} Classes I and \{II\} pesticides through national policies and enforcement. These short-term aims will have to be supported by medium- and long-term objectives focusing on the substitution of pesticides with safe and cost-effective alternatives, possibly guided by the establishment of a Minimum Pesticide List, and the development of future agricultural practices where pesticide usage is reduced to an absolute minimum. Underlying factors that make individuals at risk for self-harm include domestic problems, alcohol or drug addiction, emotional distress, depression, physical illness, social isolation or financial hardship. These should be addressed through preventive health programmes and community development efforts. "

Nineteen of 26 farms (73%; 95% \{CI\} = 56–90%) were classified as positive for Salmonella. The odds of testing positive for Salmonella were 10 times higher in large farms, compared to small farms (OR = 10.80; 95% \{CI\} = 1.01, 115.10; p = 0.04). More small farms (8/11) cleaned and disinfected poultry facilities quarterly or more often than large farms did (1/10) (p &lt; 0.01). Prevalence of Salmonella in commercial egg-laying farms in Barbados is high. Salmonella ser Enteritidis was the most common serotype identified in study farms, and this is a public health issue of concern. This is the first prevalence survey of Salmonella in egg-laying farms in Barbados. Study results can be used as a baseline for future control programmes aimed at reducing the prevalence of Salmonella in egg-laying farms in the country. "

We hypothesise that substitution of triple super phosphate (TSP) fertiliser with farmyard manure (FYM) and its localised application in the planting row increases the agronomic use efficiency (AE) of the P fertiliser applied. Field experiments were conducted during the 2009 long rains (LRs) and short rains (SRs) at three sites (Sega, Bokoli and Teso) located in western Kenya, to assess (i) the effect of concentrating \{FYM\} in different areas of the planting rows, (ii) \{FYM\} and \{TSP\} applications at different substitution rates and (iii) the effect of \{FYM\} and \{TSP\} additions and/or their combinations on soil pH, available P, maize yields, \{AE\} and economic benefits. Treatments included substituting \{TSP\} by \{FYM\} at 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% of the 26 kg P ha−1 recommended rate. Further, 13 kg P ha−1 \{FYM\} was either applied to 100% of planting area (i.e. broadcast) or localised in only 50% or 25%, of the planting area of the maize row. Results show that \{FYM\} and \{TSP\} combinations increased maize grain yields by over 200% in Sega, 90–150% in Teso and 20–50% in Bokoli relative to the control. The \{AE\} largely depended on the relative fertility of the soils but increased with an increase in \{FYM\} in the substitutions. Soil pH and available P were improved by \{FYM\} applications only in the second season (2009 SRs). Maximising P from \{FYM\} in the substitutions increased net benefits by over 33% with gross benefit cost ratios &gt; 4.5 $ $−1 relative to sole \{TSP\} application at 26 kg P ha−1. Concentrating \{FYM\} in 25% of the planting area gave over 32% increases in net benefits relative to broadcast. This study confirms that it is possible to reduce the quantity of \{FYM\} if it is applied only in the planting row but its profitability largely depends on the quality of the material selected. "

In order to avoid this fouling problem and increase the filtration flux, an electric field was applied across the membrane as an antifouling technique (cross-flow electro-microfiltration—CFEMF). The surface charges of the precipitates were modified by adding a dispersant. The experimental results indicate that this modified process of \{CFEMF\} is highly effective in reducing the membrane fouling, which eventually leads to a remarkable filtration flux increase. The application of this antifouling technique of \{CFEMF\} is cited only for the suspensions containing charged particles and colloids.

The methods consisted of (a) segmenting the 952-band \{MFDC\} based not only on elevation-precipitation-temperature zones but on major and minor irrigated command area boundaries obtained from India’s Central Board of Irrigation and Power (CBIP), (b) developing a large ideal spectral data bank (ISDB) of irrigated areas for India, (c) adopting quantitative spectral matching techniques (SMTs) such as the spectral correlation similarity (SCS) R 2 -value, (d) establishing a comprehensive set of protocols for class identification and labeling, and (e) comparing the results with the National Census data of India and field-plot data gathered during this project for determining accuracies, uncertainties and errors. The study produced irrigated area maps and statistics of India at the national and the subnational (e.g., state, district) levels based on \{MODIS\} data from 2001–2003. The Total Area Available for Irrigation (TAAI) and Annualized Irrigated Areas (AIAs) were 113 and 147 million hectares (MHa), respectively. The \{TAAI\} does not consider the intensity of irrigation, and its nearest equivalent is the net irrigated areas in the Indian National Statistics. The \{AIA\} considers intensity of irrigation and is the equivalent of “irrigated potential utilized (IPU)” reported by India’s Ministry of Water Resources (MoWR). The field-plot data collected during this project showed that the accuracy of \{TAAI\} classes was 88% with a 12% error of omission and 32% of error of commission. Comparisons between the \{AIA\} and \{IPU\} produced an R 2 -value of 0.84. However, \{AIA\} was consistently higher than IPU. The causes for differences were both in traditional approaches and remote sensing. The causes of uncertainties unique to traditional approaches were (a) inadequate accounting of minor irrigation (groundwater, small reservoirs and tanks), (b) unwillingness to share irrigated area statistics by the individual Indian states because of their stakes, (c) absence of comprehensive statistical analyses of reported data, and (d) subjectivity involved in observation-based data collection process. The causes of uncertainties unique to remote sensing approaches were (a) irrigated area fraction estimate and related sub-pixel area computations and (b) resolution of the imagery. The causes of uncertainties common in both traditional and remote sensing approaches were definitions and methodological issues. "

Households in one group of villages were encouraged to seek water from wells below the national standard. Households in the second group of villages received additional information explaining that lower-arsenic well water is always safer and these households were encouraged to seek water from wells with lower levels of arsenic, irrespective of the national standard. A simple model of household drinking-water choice indicates that the effect of the emphasis message is theoretically ambiguous. Empirically, we find that the richer message had a negative, but insignificant, effect on well-switching rates, but the estimates are sufficiently precise that we can rule out large positive effects. The main policy implication of this finding is that a one-time oral message conveying richer information on arsenic risks, while inexpensive and easily scalable, is unlikely to be successful in reducing exposure relative to the status-quo policy.

To evaluate the spatial transferability, the model was calibrated and validated using available time series data in six catchments. Results show that the model performed well in simulating various runoff components and capturing the seasonal and annual variations in runoff. The model parameters of donor catchments were selected based on the similarity index and applied in other two data limited catchments using the regionalisation scheme. Results show that the model could reproduce the runoff volume, base flows, seasonal and annual variations in runoff when the model parameters were transferred spatially. To evaluate temporal transferability, two different scenarios were tested in a river catchment, Bagmati river. The first scenario used three data sets: 1994–1997 for calibration, 1998–1999 for validation, and 2000–2002 data for evaluation. The second scenario also used three data sets: 2000–2002 for calibration, 2003 for validation and 1994–1997 for evaluating transferability of model parameters. Only a marginal loss in model performance was observed when calibrated parameters were transferred from one period to another period. This study therefore suggests that the calibrated parameters of \{BTOPMC\} model can be spatially and temporally transferred within river catchments located in similar physiographic regions and especially in those catchments where data is sparse. Such regionalized models can be used for hydrological simulations to study the impacts of land use and climate changes. "

This price is evidently even higher when common modeling routines such as calibration and uncertainty analysis are involved. Likewise, methods and techniques for reducing computation time in large scale socio-environmental modeling software is growing. Recent advancements in distributed computing such as Grid infrastructure have provided further opportunity to this effort. In the interest of gaining computational efficiency, we developed generic tools and techniques for enabling the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model application to run on the \{EGEE\} (Enabling Grids for E-science projects in Europe) Grid. Various program components/scripts were written to split a large scale hydrological model of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), to submit the split models to the Grid, and to collect and merge results into single output format. A three-step procedure was applied to take advantage of the Grid. Firstly, a python script was run in order to split the \{SWAT\} model into several sub-models. Then, individual sub-models were submitted in parallel for execution on the Grid. Finally, the outputs of the sub-basins were collected and the reach routing process was performed with another script executing a modified \{SWAT\} program. We conducted experimental simulations with multiple temporal and spatial scale hydrological models on the Grid infrastructure. Results showed that, in spite of computing overheads, parallel computation of socio-environmental models on the Grid is beneficial for model applications especially with large spatial and temporal scales. In the end, we conclude by recommending methods for further reducing computational overheads while running large scale model applications on the Grid. "

These two areas often have also different organic matter contents and soil compaction properties, and hence also soil hydraulic properties, thus causing further differences in the local infiltration rates close to and away from trees. In this study we analyzed possible differences in the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties of the stemflow and throughfall areas below an oil palm tree. Tension disc infiltrometer experiments were carried out underneath the canopy and in the interspace area of an oil palm tree plantation at successive tensions of 5, 2, and 0 cm. Soil hydraulic properties were estimated inversely from the measured data using the HYDRUS-2D/3D software package. Four van Genuchten soil hydraulic parameters (i.e., the residual water content, θr, the shape factors α and n, and the saturated hydraulic conductivity, Ks) were optimized. Saturated water contents, θs, were fixed at their laboratory-measured values. Initial estimates of the optimized parameters were set according to Wooding's solution, which ensured rapid convergence of the inverse solution. The stemflow and throughfall regions exhibited contrasting hydraulic properties as indicated by the estimated hydraulic parameters. Values of θs, α, n and Ks for the stemflow area were all found to be higher as compared to those of the throughfall area. The inverse solution using tension disc infiltrometer data proved to be very useful for rapid characterization of hydraulic properties of soil under the oil palm trees. "

The main objective of this paper is to identify the effects of hydropower development, flood protection and engineering works for navigation on the Danube and to examine specific impacts of these developments on sediment transport and river morphology. Whereas impoundments are characterised by deposition and an excess of sediment with remobilisation of fine sediments during severe floods, the remaining five free flowing sections of the Danube are experiencing river bed erosion of the order of several centimetres per year. Besides the effect of interruption of the sediment continuum, river bed degradation is caused by an increase in the sediment transport capacity following an increase in slope, a reduction of river bed width due to canalisation, prohibition of bank erosion by riprap or regressive erosion following base level lowering by flood protection measures and sediment dredging. As a consequence, the groundwater table is lowered, side-arms are disconnected, instream structures are lost and habitat quality deteriorates affecting the ecological status of valuable floodplains. The lack of sediments, together with cutting off meanders, leads also to erosion of the bed of main arms in the Danube Delta and coastal erosion. This paper details the causes and effects of river engineering measures and hydromorphological changes for the Danube. It highlights the importance of adopting a basin-wide holistic approach to river management and demonstrates that past management in the basin has been characterised by a lack of integration. To-date insufficient attention has been paid to the wide-ranging impacts of river engineering works throughout the basin: from the basin headwaters to the Danube Delta, on the Black Sea coast. This highlights the importance of new initiatives that seek to advance knowledge exchange and knowledge transfer within the basin to reach the goal of integrated basin management. "

Results from this study indicate that this phenomenon exists among two shrub species (Guiera senegalensis and Piliostigma reticulatum) that co-exist with annual food crops in Sahelian agro-ecosystems. Real-time measurements were conducted for soil water content, soil water potential and microclimate variables notably; air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation and solar irradiance. Additionally, sap flow measurements were conducted in shrub roots using the thermal dissipation technique on intact and coppiced shrubs. Monthly predawn leaf water potential was measured using a portable pressure chamber. Soil water potential (Ψs) at the 20 cm depth declined significantly during the dry season with diel changes in Ψs of −0.6 to −1.1 MPa. These variations were attributed to passive water release from shrub roots resulting in overnight rewetting of drier upper soil layers. Sap flow measurements on tap and lateral shrub roots indicated daily reversals in the direction of flow. During the peak of the dry season, both positive (toward shrub) and negative (toward soil) flows were observed in lateral shrub roots with sap flow in the lateral roots frequently negative at night and rapidly becoming positive soon after sunrise. The negative sap flow at night in superficial lateral roots and the periodic positive flow in the descending tap roots were indicative of hydraulic redistribution. Hydraulic redistribution may be an important mechanism for drought stress avoidance while maintaining plant physiological functions in both shrubs and neighboring annuals in water-limited environments.

The number of years of water harvesting, family size, tank operation and maintenance, and presence of local associations were statistically significantly related to adequate efficient water management. The number of years of water harvesting was linked to women's participation in household chores more than to the participation of men, the way of livelihoods lived for many years. Large families were concurrent with a reduction in water shortages, partially because of the availability of active labour. The findings also reveal important information regarding water-related operations and maintenance at the household level and the presence of local associations that could contribute some of the information necessary to minimise water-related health risks. Overall, this investigation revealed important observations about the water management carried out by women with respect to underlying safe-water shortages, gender perspectives, and related challenges in Uganda that can be of great importance to developing countries.

Study focus In addition to monsoons and strong climate variability, \{GB\} is facing growing demands for freshwater availability by a continually growing population and rapidly developing of agricultural and industrial sectors. The management of water resources is thus of highest priority and, in the context of current over-abstraction of groundwater, accurate estimates of terrestrial freshwater storage are essential. We propose a multi-satellite approach to estimate surface freshwater storage (SWS) and subsurface water storage (SSWS, groundwater + soil moisture) variations over GB. New hydrological insights Basin-scale monthly \{SWS\} variations for the period 2003–2007 show a mean annual amplitude of ∼410 km3, contributing to about 45% of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE)-derived total water storage variations (TWS). During the drought-like conditions in 2006, we estimate that the \{SWS\} deficit over the entire \{GB\} basin in July–August–September was about 30% as compared to other years. The \{SWS\} variations are then used to decompose the \{GB\} GRACE-derived \{TWS\} and isolate the variations of \{SSWS\} whose mean annual amplitude is estimated to be ∼550 km3. This new dataset of water storage variations represent an unprecedented source of information for hydrological and climate modeling studies of the ISC. "

This article presents photovoltaic solar panels as an important alternative in the context of the Brazilian energy crisis. Solar irradiations levels were considered to calculate the number of solar panels necessary to supply the average electricity demand of social housing programs. A scenario approach and an \{OFAT\} sensitivity analysis were used to evaluate feasibility (IRR, NPV, cash flow and payback) based on existing electricity charging policies and usual long-term financing plans for social housing programs. The results for all the proposed scenarios indicate that photovoltaics are an environmentally and economically feasible alternative. Deploying between four to seven 217 W photovoltaic panels onto each house would meet the needs of all solar irradiation zones considered, making dwellers significantly less dependent on the grid and capable of up to 47% grid feedback for up to 30 years. Finally, feed-in tariff policies and a trust fund for maintenance and reinvestment costs are suggested in order to stimulate the use of photovoltaics as a sustainable alternative. "

Measurements of estrogen concentrations in pond water by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry showed that mean 17 β-estradiol concentrations were higher in the wastewater ponds (WWP, 6.6 ng/L ± 2.7 ng/L; WSP, 4.9 ng/L ± 1.0) than the reference (RP, 3.4 ± 1.1 ng/L). Estrone concentrations were found to be highest in the \{WSP\} (7.8 ng/L ± 1.7) and lowest in the \{WWP\} (2.2 ng/L ± 2.4) with the \{RP\} intermediate (4.7 ± 5.0). Fish serum estrogenicity assayed by E-SCREEN was significantly higher in female vs. male catfish in the \{RP\} and \{WSP\} but not in the \{WWP\} (p ≤ 0.05). Histological examination of liver and gonad tissue showed no apparent signs of intersex or pathology in any ponds.

Regular discharge measurements in the \{RRD\} are available for three upstream stations, while the other hydrological stations provide only water level records; however, the \{MIKE\} 11 model allowed overall calibration curves to be established, which enabled the conversion of available daily mean water level data into discharge values. Four gauging surveys were conducted under flood and dry season in 2007 and 2008 to experimentally validate these calibration curves. After the database was generated, a water balance was established for two years with contrasting climatic and hydrological characteristics. During the wet year (1996), the main branch of the Red River represented the largest input of freshwater to the sea (approximately 60%). Conversely, during the dry year (2006), the inputs were more evenly distributed among the three main fluvial branches. The total volume annually delivered to the sea from the \{RRD\} was approximately 140 and 100 km3 for 1996 and 2006, respectively. When the five sub-basins within the \{RRD\} were evaluated, it was shown that the water resources were far from evenly distributed within the area. In particular, the Bui sub-basin, which has the highest population density and the lowest water resources per unit area, is experiencing a critical situation in terms of pressure on water resources.

Most practitioners, decision-makers and researchers having adopted participatory approaches also acknowledge the need to monitor and evaluate such approaches in order to audit their effectiveness, support decision-making or improve learning. Many manuals and frameworks exist on how to carry out monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) for participatory processes. However, few provide guidelines on the selection and implementation of M&amp;E methods, an aspect which is also often obscure in published studies, at the expense of the transparency, reliability and validity of the study. In this paper, we argue that the selection and implementation of M&amp;E methods are particularly strategic when monitoring and evaluating a participatory process. We demonstrate that evaluators of participatory processes have to tackle a quadruple challenge when selecting and implementing methods: using mixed-methods, both qualitative and quantitative; assessing the participatory process, its outcomes, and its context; taking into account both the theory and participants’ views; and being both rigorous and adaptive. The M&amp;E of a participatory planning process in the Rwenzori Region, Uganda, is used as an example to show how these challenges unfold on the ground and how they can be tackled. Based on this example, we conclude by providing tools and strategies that can be used by evaluators to ensure that they make utile, feasible, coherent, transparent and adaptive methodological choices when monitoring and evaluating participatory processes for NRM.

A total of 148 water samples were collected from two drainage basins within the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER). In the Ziway–Shala basin in particular, wells had high fluoride levels (mean: 9.4 ± 10.5 mg/L; range: 1.1 to 68 mg/L), with 48 of 50 exceeding the \{WHO\} drinking water guideline limit of 1.5 mg/L. Total average daily intake of fluoride from drinking groundwater (calculated per weight unit) was also found to be six times higher than the No-Observed-Adverse-Effects-Level (NOAEL) value of 0.06 mg/kg/day. The highest fluoride levels were found in highly-alkaline (pH of 7 to 8.9) groundwater characterized by high salinity; high concentrations of sodium (Na+), bicarbonate (HCO3−), and silica (SiO2); and low concentrations of calcium (Ca2 +). A progressive Ca2 + decrease along the groundwater flow path is associated with an increase of fluoride in the groundwater. The groundwater quality problem is also coupled with the presence of other toxic elements, such as arsenic (As) and uranium (U). The health impact of fluoride was evaluated based on clinical examination of dental fluorosis (DF) among local residents using the Thylstrup and Fejerskov index (TFI). In total, 200 rural inhabitants between the ages of 7 and 40 years old using water from 12 wells of fluoride range of 7.8–18 mg/L were examined. Signs of \{DF\} (TF score of ≥ 1) were observed in all individuals. Most of the teeth (52%) recorded \{TF\} scores of 5 and 6, followed by \{TF\} scores of 3 and 4 (30%), and 8.4% had \{TF\} scores of 7 or higher. Sixty percent of the teeth exhibited loss of the outermost enamel. Within the range of fluoride contents, we did not find any correlation between fluoride content and DF. Finally, preliminary data suggest that milk intake has contributed to reducing the severity of DF. The study highlights the apparent positive role of milk on DF, and emphasizes the importance of nutrition in management efforts to mitigate \{DF\} in the \{MER\} and other parts of the world. "

However, spatially explicit and crop-specific information on global N losses into the environment and knowledge of trade-offs between N losses and crop yields are largely lacking. We use a crop growth model, Python-based Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (PEPIC), to determine global N losses from three major food crops: maize, rice, and wheat. Simulated total N losses into the environment (including water and atmosphere) are 44 Tg N yr− 1. Two thirds of these, or 29 Tg N yr− 1, are losses to water alone. Rice accounts for the highest N losses, followed by wheat and maize. The N loss intensity (NLI), defined as N losses per unit of yield, is used to address trade-offs between N losses and crop yields. The \{NLI\} presents high variation among different countries, indicating diverse N losses to produce the same amount of yields. Simulations of mitigation scenarios indicate that redistributing global N inputs and improving N management could significantly abate N losses and at the same time even increase yields without any additional total N inputs.

Implementing no-tillage practices in maize–wheat and cotton–wheat production systems would yield an additional 6.6 Mt C. This offset is equivalent to 9.6% of India's annual greenhouse gas emissions (519 Mt C) from all sectors (excluding land use change and forestry), or less than one percent per annum. The economic analysis was summarized as carbon supply curves expressing the total additional C accumulated over 20 year for a price per tonne of carbon sequestered ranging from zero to \{USD\} 200. At a carbon price of \{USD\} 25 Mg C−1, 3 Mt C (7% of the soil C sequestration potential) could be sequestered over 20 years through the implementation of no-till cropping practices in rice–wheat systems of the Indian States of the IGP, increasing to 7.3 Mt C (17% of the soil C sequestration potential) at \{USD\} 50 Mg C−1.

In the present study, a biosolids availability factor (BAF) approach was adopted to investigate the ecological thresholds for copper (Cu) in land-applied biosolids and biosolid-amended agricultural soils. First, the soil property-specific values of \{HC5add\} (the added hazardous concentration for 5% of species) for Cu2+ salt amended were collected with due attention to data for organisms and soils relevant to China. Second, a \{BAF\} representing the difference in availability between soil Cu added via biosolids and soluble salts was estimated based on long-term biosolid-amended soils, including soils from China. Third, biosolids Cu \{HC5input\} values (the input hazardous concentration for 5% of species of Cu from biosolids to soil) as a function of soil properties were derived using the \{BAF\} approach. The average potential availability of Cu in agricultural soils amended with biosolids accounted for 53% of that for the same soils spiked with same amount of soluble Cu salts and with a similar aging time. The cation exchange capacity was the main factor affecting the biosolids Cu \{HC5input\} values, while soil pH and organic carbon only explained 24.2 and 1.5% of the variation, respectively. The biosolids Cu \{HC5input\} values can be accurately predicted by regression models developed based on 2–3 soil properties with coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.889 and 0.945. Compared with model predicted biosolids Cu \{HC5input\} values, current standards (GB4284-84) are most likely to be less protective in acidic and neutral soil, but conservative in alkaline non-calcareous soil. Recommendations on ecological criteria for Cu in land-applied biosolids and biosolid-amended agriculture soils may be helpful to fill the gaps existing between science and regulations, and can be useful for Cu risk assessments in soils amended with biosolids.

By drawing together the experience of a global group of \{EDSS\} developers, we have identified and assessed key challenges in \{EDSS\} development and offer recommendations to resolve them. Challenges related to engaging end users in \{EDSS\} development emphasise the need for a participatory process that embraces end users and stakeholders throughout the design and development process. Adoption challenges concerned with individual and organisational capacities to use \{EDSS\} and the match between \{EDSS\} and organisational goals can be overcome through the use of an internal champion to promote the \{EDSS\} at different levels of a target organisation; co-ordinate and build capacity within the organisation, and; ensure that developers maintain focus on developing \{EDSS\} which are relatively easy and inexpensive to use and update (and which are perceived as such by the target users). Significant challenges exist in relation to ensuring \{EDSS\} longevity and financial sustainability. Such business challenges may be met through planning and design that considers the long-term costs of training, support, and maintenance; revenue generation and licensing by instituting processes which support communication and interactions; and by employing software technology which enables easy model expansion and re use to gain an economy of scale and reduce development costs. A final group of perhaps more problematic challenges relate to how the success of \{EDSS\} ought to be evaluated. Whilst success can be framed relatively easily in terms of interactions with end users, difficulties of definition and measurability emerge in relation to the extent to which \{EDSS\} achieve intended outcomes. To tackle the challenges described, the authors provide a set of best practice recommendations concerned with promoting design for ease of use, design for usefulness, establishing trust and credibility, promoting \{EDSS\} acceptance, and starting simple and small in functionality terms. Following these recommendations should enhance the achievement of successful \{EDSS\} adoption, but more importantly, help facilitate the achievement of desirable social and environmental outcomes.

abstract = "Abstract A large proportion of Pakistan's irrigation water supply is taken from the Upper Indus River Basin (UIB) in the Himalaya–Karakoram–Hindukush range. More than half of the annual flow in the \{UIB\} is contributed by five of its snow and glacier-fed sub-basins including the Astore (Western Himalaya — south latitude of the UIB) and Hunza (Central Karakoram — north latitude of the UIB) River basins. Studying the snow cover, its spatio-temporal change and the hydrological response of these sub-basins is important so as to better manage water resources. This paper compares new data from the Astore River basin (mean catchment elevation, 4100 m above sea level; m asl afterwards), obtained using \{MODIS\} satellite snow cover images, with data from a previously-studied high-altitude basin, the Hunza (mean catchment elevation, 4650 m asl). The hydrological regime of this sub-catchment was analyzed using the hydrological and climate data available at different altitudes from the basin area. The results suggest that the \{UIB\} is a region undergoing a stable or slightly increasing trend of snow cover in the southern (Western Himalayas) and northern (Central Karakoram) parts. Discharge from the \{UIB\} is a combination of snow and glacier melt with rainfall-runoff at southern part, but snow and glacier melt are dominant at the northern part of the catchment. Similar snow cover trends (stable or slightly increasing) but different river flow trends (increasing in Astore and decreasing in Hunza) suggest a sub-catchment level study of the \{UIB\} to understand thoroughly its hydrological behavior for better flood forecasting and water resources management.

This study reports the results of a methodology for identifying and prioritizing local, stakeholder-driven response options to climate change in agriculture. The approach is based on multi-criteria scoring methods previously applied to research planning and priority-setting in agricultural and natural resource management research, public health, and other areas. The methodology is a sequential approach built around needs assessments by local stakeholders; the incorporation of climate science results; the sharing of these results and climate adaption response options with stakeholders at a series of workshops; stakeholder priority-setting exercises using multi-criteria scoring; and validation with policymakers. The application is to three diverse agroecosystems in Mexico, Peru and Uruguay. Among the many findings is that, notwithstanding the wide diversity of agro-ecosystems, there are numerous similarities in the agricultural adaptation responses prioritized by local stakeholders. "

However, a standardized soil sampling protocol is needed in such emergencies to facilitate the collection of large, tractable samples for measuring gamma-emitting radionuclides. In this study, we developed an emergency soil sampling protocol based on preliminary sampling from the \{FDNPP\} accident-affected area. We also present the results of a preliminary experiment aimed to evaluate the influence of various procedures (e.g., mixing, number of samples) on measured radioactivity. Results show that sample mixing strongly affects measured radioactivity in soil samples. Furthermore, for homogenization, shaking the plastic sample container at least 150 times or disaggregating soil by hand-rolling in a disposable plastic bag is required. Finally, we determined that five soil samples within a 3 m × 3-m area are the minimum number required for reducing measurement uncertainty in the emergency soil sampling protocol proposed here. "

Compared to forest clear-felling and conversion, the impacts of these less intense but complex disturbance regimes on biodiversity remain poorly understood. Given the challenges of protecting pristine tropical forests for conservation in developing regions, there is a strong imperative to understand the role of altered forests with a range of low to moderate disturbance regimes in long term biodiversity conservation. We sampled tropical rainforest reptile and amphibian diversity over a nine year period along a gradient of moderate anthropogenic disturbance to intact primary rainforest in Sulawesi, Indonesia. We evaluated the relative influences of anthropogenic disturbance proxies and natural habitat variability on species richness and assemblage composition. Reptile and amphibian species richness were affected by natural variability in a range of habitat characteristics, but not by moderate anthropogenic disturbance. In contrast, species composition varied with both natural and anthropogenic disturbance metrics. Our results indicate that even low to moderate levels of anthropogenic disturbance have measurable, pervasive, impacts on tropical herpetofaunal diversity. However, moderately disturbed and altered forests that retain relatively high canopy cover and habitat complexity still retained most species associated with primary forest, indicating that they provide a significant contribution to herpetofaunal biodiversity conservation. Management implications from these findings complement those for birds and large mammals in tropical Asia, in that sustainable biodiversity conservation is likely to be best achieved by maintaining larger forest areas of variable disturbance and usage regimes around more remote, minimally disturbed core areas.

abstract = "Food is fundamental to human wellbeing and development. Increased food production remains a cornerstone strategy in the effort to alleviate global food insecurity. But despite the fact that global food production over the past half century has kept ahead of demand, today around one billion people do not have enough to eat, and a further billion lack adequate nutrition. Food insecurity is facing mounting supply-side and demand-side pressures; key among these are climate change, urbanisation, globalisation, population increases, disease, as well as a number of other factors that are changing patterns of food consumption. Many of the challenges to equitable food access are concentrated in developing countries where environmental pressures – including climate change, population growth and other socio-economic issues – are concentrated. Together these factors impede people's access to sufficient, nutritious food; chiefly through affecting livelihoods, income and food prices. Food security and human development go hand in hand, and their outcomes are co-determined to a significant degree. The challenge of food security is multi-scalar and cross-sector in nature. Addressing it will require the work of diverse actors to bring sustained improvements inhuman development and to reduce pressure on the environment. Unless there is investment in future food systems that are similarly cross-level, cross-scale and cross-sector, sustained improvements in human wellbeing together with reduced environmental risks and scarcities will not be achieved. This paper reviews current thinking, and outlines these challenges. It suggests that essential elements in a successfully adaptive and proactive food system include: learning – through connectivity between scales to local experience and technologies – high levels of interaction between diverse actors and sectors ranging from primary producers to retailers and consumers, and use of frontier technologies.

Use of pesticides is poorly regulated and often dangerous; their easy availability also makes them a popular method of self-harm. In 1985, the \{UN\} Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) produced a voluntary code of conduct for the pesticide industry in an attempt to limit the harmful effects of pesticides. Unfortunately, a lack of adequate government resources in the developing world makes this code ineffective, and thousands of deaths continue today. \{WHO\} has recommended that access to highly toxic pesticides be restricted—where this has been done, suicide rates have fallen. Since an Essential Drugs List was established in 1977, use of a few essential drugs has rationalised drug use in many regions. An analogous Minimum Pesticides List would identify a restricted number of less dangerous pesticides to do specific tasks within an integrated pest management system. Use of safer pesticides should result in fewer deaths, just as the change from barbiturates to benzodiazepines has reduced the number of deaths from pharmaceutical self-poisoning. "

In 2011 it decided to convene an Ad Hoc Working Group on Scientific Advice (AGSA) and gave it a unique challenge: to design a new mechanism for science-policy communication based on the best available scientific evidence. This paper outlines the innovative ‘modular mechanism’ which the \{AGSA\} proposed to the \{UNCCD\} in September 2013, and how it was designed. Framed by the boundary organization model, and an understanding of the emergence of a new multi-scalar and polycentric style of governing, the modular mechanism consists of three modules: a Science-Policy Interface (SPI); an international self-governing and self-organizing Independent Non-Governmental Group of Scientists; and Regional Science and Technology Hubs in each \{UNCCD\} region. Now that the \{UNCCD\} has established the SPI, it is up to the worldwide scientific community to take the lead in establishing the other two modules. Science-policy communication in other \{UN\} environmental conventions could benefit from three generic principles corresponding to the innovations in the three modules—joint management of science-policy interfaces by policy makers and scientists; the production of synthetic assessments of scientific knowledge by autonomous and accountable groups of scientists; and multi-scalar and multi-directional synthesis and reporting of knowledge.

Agricultural production is highly vulnerable even to 2C (low-end) predictions for global mean temperatures in 2100, with major implications for rural poverty and for both rural and urban food security. Agriculture also presents untapped opportunities for mitigation, given the large land area under crops and rangeland, and the additional mitigation potential of aquaculture. This paper presents a summary of current knowledge on options to support farmers, particularly smallholder farmers, in achieving food security through agriculture under climate change. Actions towards adaptation fall into two broad overlapping areas: (1) accelerated adaptation to progressive climate change over decadal time scales, for example integrated packages of technology, agronomy and policy options for farmers and food systems, and (2) better management of agricultural risks associated with increasing climate variability and extreme events, for example improved climate information services and safety nets. Maximization of agriculture's mitigation potential will require investments in technological innovation and agricultural intensification linked to increased efficiency of inputs, and creation of incentives and monitoring systems that are inclusive of smallholder farmers. Food systems faced with climate change need urgent, broad-based action in spite of uncertainties. "

Phase 2 of the Distributed Model Intercomparison Project (DMIP 2) was formulated primarily as a mechanism to help guide the U.S. \{NWS\} as it expands its use of spatially distributed watershed models for operational river, flash flood, and water resources forecasting. The overall purpose of \{DMIP\} 2 was to test many distributed models forced by high quality operational data with a view towards meeting \{NWS\} operational forecasting needs. At the same time, \{DMIP\} 2 was formulated as an experiment that could be leveraged by the broader scientific community as a platform for the testing, evaluation, and improvement of distributed models. \{DMIP\} 2 contained experiments in two regions: in the \{DMIP\} 1 Oklahoma basins, and second, in two basins in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in the western USA. This paper presents the overview and results of the \{DMIP\} 2 experiments conducted for the two Sierra Nevada basins. Simulations from five independent groups from France, Italy, Spain and the \{USA\} were analyzed. Experiments included comparison of lumped and distributed model streamflow simulations generated with uncalibrated and calibrated parameters, and simulations of snow water equivalent (SWE) at interior locations. As in other phases of DMIP, the participant simulations were evaluated against observed hourly streamflow and \{SWE\} data and compared with simulations provided by the \{NWS\} operational lumped model. A wide range of statistical measures are used to evaluate model performance on a run-period and event basis. Differences between uncalibrated and calibrated model simulations are assessed. Results indicate that in the two study basins, no single model performed best in all cases. In addition, no distributed model was able to consistently outperform the lumped model benchmark. However, one or more distributed models were able to outperform the lumped model benchmark in many of the analyses. Several calibrated distributed models achieved higher correlation and lower bias than the calibrated lumped benchmark in the calibration, validation, and combined periods. Evaluating a number of specific precipitation-runoff events, one calibrated distributed model was able to perform at a level equal to or better than the calibrated lumped model benchmark in terms of event-averaged peak and runoff volume error. However, three distributed models were able to provide improved peak timing compared to the lumped benchmark. Taken together, calibrated distributed models provided specific improvements over the lumped benchmark in 24% of the model-basin pairs for peak flow, 12% of the model-basin pairs for event runoff volume, and 41% of the model-basin pairs for peak timing. Model calibration improved the performance statistics of nearly all models (lumped and distributed). Analysis of several precipitation/runoff events indicates that distributed models may more accurately model the dynamics of the rain/snow line (and resulting hydrologic conditions) compared to the lumped benchmark model. Analysis of \{SWE\} simulations shows that better results were achieved at higher elevation observation sites. Although the performance of distributed models was mixed compared to the lumped benchmark, all calibrated models performed well compared to results in the \{DMIP\} 2 Oklahoma basins in terms of run period correlation and %Bias, and event-averaged peak and runoff error. This finding is noteworthy considering that these Sierra Nevada basins have complications such as orographically-enhanced precipitation, snow accumulation and melt, rain on snow events, and highly variable topography. Looking at these findings and those from the previous \{DMIP\} experiments, it is clear that at this point in their evolution, distributed models have the potential to provide valuable information on specific flood events that could complement lumped model simulations.

abstract = "Irrigated rice (Oryza sativa L.) yield increases in Asia have slowed down in recent years. Further, yield increases are likely to occur in smaller increments through fine-tuning of crop management. On-farm experiments at 179 sites in eight key irrigated rice domains of Asia were conducted from 1997 to 1999 to evaluate a new approach for site-specific nutrient management (SSNM). Large variation in initial soil fertility characteristics and indigenous supply of N, P, and K was observed among the eight intensive rice domains as well as among farms within each domain. Field- and season-specific \{NPK\} applications were calculated by accounting for the indigenous nutrient supply, yield targets, and nutrient demand as a function of the interactions between N, P, and K. Nitrogen applications were fine-tuned based on season-specific rules and field-specific monitoring of crop N status. The performance of \{SSNM\} was tested for four successive rice crops. Average grain yield in the \{SSNM\} increased by 0.36 Mg ha−1 (7%) compared to the current farmers’ fertilizer practice (FFP) measured in the same cropping seasons or 0.54 Mg ha−1 (11%) compared to the baseline \{FFP\} yield before intervention. Average nutrient uptake under \{SSNM\} increased by about 10% in the same seasons or by 13% (N) and 21% (P, K) compared to the baseline data. Yield increases were associated with a 4% decrease in the average N rate, but larger amounts of fertilizer-K at sites where the previous K use was low. Average N use efficiencies increased by 30–40%, mainly through the use of improved in-season N management schemes. Across all sites and four successive rice crops, profitability increased by US$ 46 ha−1 per crop or 12% of the total average net return. The performance of \{SSNM\} did not differ significantly between high-yielding and low-yielding climatic seasons, but improved over time with larger benefits observed in the second year. Average profitability increased from US$ 32 ha−1 pre crop in the first year to US$ 61 ha−1 pre crop in the second year due to improvements in the \{SSNM\} approach and re-capitalization of P and K applied in the first year. \{SSNM\} required little extra credit for financing, and remained profitable even if rice prices are somewhat lower than current levels. Further, scope for improvement exists at many sites by alleviating other crop management constraints to nutrient use efficiency. Profit increases ranged from US$ 4 to 82 ha−1 per crop among eight rice domains. However, profit decreases occurred in about 25% of all cases, indicating that a certain minimum level of crop care is required for \{SSNM\} to be profitable. Yields at sites with labor-saving direct-seeding of larger fields were about 1 Mg ha−1 lower than those achieved at sites with labor-intensive transplanting and good management, raising concern about future trends in rice production. \{SSNM\} has potential for improving yields and nutrient efficiency in irrigated rice to close existing yield gaps. The major challenge for \{SSNM\} will be to retain the success of the approach while reducing the complexity of the technology as it is disseminated to farmers. The nature of the approach will need to be tailored to specific circumstances in different countries. In some areas, \{SSNM\} may be field or farm specific, but in many areas it is likely to be just region and season-specific. "

abstract = "Abstract Agricultural soils account for more than 50% of nitrogen leaching (LN) to groundwater in China. When excess levels of nitrogen accumulate in groundwater, it poses a risk of adverse health effects. Despite this recognition, estimation of \{LN\} from cropland soils in a broad spatial scale is still quite uncertain in China. The uncertainty of \{LN\} primarily stems from the shape of nitrogen leaching response to fertilizer additions (Nrate) and the role of environmental conditions. On the basis of 453 site-years at 51 sites across China, we explored the nonlinearity and variability of the response of \{LN\} to Nrate and developed an empirical statistical model to determine how environmental factors regulate the rate of N leaching (LR). The result shows that LN-Nrate relationship is convex for most crop types, and varies by local hydro-climates and soil organic carbon. Variability of air temperature explains a half (∼52%) of the spatial variation of LR. The results of model calibration and validation indicate that incorporating this empirical knowledge into a predictive model could accurately capture the variation in leaching and produce a reasonable upscaling from site to country. The fertilizer-induced \{LN\} in 2008 for China's cropland were 0.88 ± 0.23 TgN (1σ), significantly lower than the linear or uniform model, as assumed by Food and Agriculture Organization and MITERRA-EUROPE models. These results also imply that future policy to reduce N leaching from cropland needs to consider environmental variability rather than solely attempt to reduce Nrate. "

While considering optimization of region-specific standards for F−, it is reasonable, however, to consider how local diet, water sourcing practices, and non-F− elements in water may be related to health outcomes. In this study, we hypothesized that non-F− elements in groundwater and lifestyle and demographic characteristics may be independent predictors or modifiers of the effects of F− on teeth. Dental examinations were conducted among 1094 inhabitants from 399 randomly-selected households of 20 rural communities of the Ziway–Shala lake basin of the Main Ethiopian Rift. \{DF\} severity was evaluated using the Thylstrup-Fejerskov Index (TFI). Household surveys were performed and water samples were collected from community water sources. To consider interrelations between the teeth within individual (in terms of \{DF\} severity) and between F− and non-F− elements in groundwater, the statistical methods of regression analysis, mixed models, and principal component analysis were used. About 90% of study participants consumed water from wells with F− levels above the \{WHO\} recommended standard of 1.5 mg/l. More than 62% of the study population had DF. F− levels were a major factor associated with DF. Age, sex, and milk consumption (both cow's and breastfed) were also statistically significantly (p &lt; 0.05) associated with \{DF\} severity; these associations appear both independently and as modifiers of those identified between F− concentration and \{DF\} severity. Among 35 examined elements in groundwater, Ca, Al, Cu, and Rb were found to be significantly correlated with dental health outcomes among the residents exposed to water with excessive F− concentrations. Quantitative estimates obtained in our study can be used to explore new water treatment strategies, water safety and quality regulations, and lifestyle recommendations which may be more appropriate for this highly populated region.

All three causes are related to information failures which in turn can be linked to the complexity and ‘invisibility’ of spatial relationships among groundwater, surface water and wetland vegetation. Integrated wetland research combining social and natural sciences can help in part to solve the information failure to achieve the required consistency across various government policies. An integrated wetland research framework suggests that a combination of economic valuation, integrated modelling, stakeholder analysis, and multi-criteria evaluation can provide complementary insights into sustainable and welfare-optimising wetland management and policy. Subsequently, each of the various components of such integrated wetland research is reviewed and related to wetland management policy. "

To achieve this goal, a combination of physically based surface flux models and high-quality remote-sensing data are needed. Data from the \{ASTER\} sensor are particularly well-suited to the task, as it collects high spatial resolution (15–90 m) images in visible, near-infrared, and thermal infrared bands. Data in these bands yield surface temperature, vegetation cover density, and land-use types, all critical inputs to surface energy balance models for assessing local environmental conditions. \{ASTER\} is currently the only satellite sensor collecting multispectral thermal infrared images, a capability allowing unprecedented surface temperature estimation accuracy for a variety of surface cover types. Availability of \{ASTER\} data to study surface energy fluxes allows direct comparisons against ground measurements and facilitates detection of modeling limitations, both possible because of ASTER's higher spatial resolution. Surface energy flux retrieval from \{ASTER\} is demonstrated using data collected over an experimental site in central Iowa, USA, in the framework of the Soil Moisture Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (SMACEX). This experiment took place during the summer of 2002 in a study of heterogeneous agricultural croplands. Two different flux estimation approaches, designed to account for the spatial variability, are considered: the Two-Source Energy Balance model (TSEB) and the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm or Land model (SEBAL). \{ASTER\} data are shown to have spatial and spectral resolution sufficient to derive surface variables required as inputs for physically based energy balance modeling. Comparison of flux model results against each other and against ground based measurements was promising, with flux values commonly agreeing within ∼50 W m− 2. Both \{TSEB\} and \{SEBAL\} showed systematic agreement and responded to spatially varying surface temperatures and vegetation densities. Direct comparison against ground Eddy Covariance data suggests that the \{TSEB\} approach is helpful over sparsely vegetated terrain. "

Frameworks for implementing nexus thinking, however, have failed to explicitly or adequately incorporate sustainable livelihoods perspectives. This is counterintuitive given that livelihoods are key to achieving sustainable development. In this paper we present a critical review of nexus approaches and identify potential linkages with sustainable livelihoods theory and practice, to deepen our understanding of the interrelated dynamics between human populations and the natural environment. Building upon this review, we explore the concept of ‘environmental livelihood security’ – which encompasses a balance between natural resource supply and human demand on the environment to promote sustainability – and develop an integrated nexus-livelihoods framework for examining the environmental livelihood security of a system. The outcome is an integrated framework with the capacity to measure and monitor environmental livelihood security of whole systems by accounting for the water, energy and food requisites for livelihoods at multiple spatial scales and institutional levels. We anticipate this holistic approach will not only provide a significant contribution to achieving national and regional sustainable development targets, but will also be effective for promoting equity amongst individuals and communities in local and global development agendas.

With direct injection of the samples, target analytes were identified and quantified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Cocaine and \{MDMA\} residues and metabolites were mainly quantifiable in the urban catchment while methamphetamine residues were consistently detected in both urban and rural catchments. There was no consistent trend in the population normalised mass loads observed for cocaine and \{MDMA\} at the urban site between 2009 and 2015. In contrast, there was a five-fold increase in methamphetamine consumption over this period in this catchment. For methamphetamine consumption, the rural area showed a very similar trend as the urban catchment starting at a lower baseline. The observed increase in per capita loads of methamphetamine via wastewater analysis over the past six years in South East Queensland provides objective evidence for increased methamphetamine consumption in the Australian population while the use of other illicit stimulants remained relatively stable.

The amount of information used for calibration has only a minor effect on most models' climate response, and even small multi-model ensembles prove beneficial. Wheat model clusters reveal common characteristics of yield response to climate; however models rarely share the same cluster at all four sites indicating substantial independence. Only a weak relationship (R2 ≤ 0.24) was found between the models' sensitivities to interannual temperature variability and their response to long-term warming, suggesting that additional processes differentiate climate change impacts from observed climate variability analogs and motivating continuing analysis and model development efforts.

The project brought together nineteen participants, from Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Japan, Morocco, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States of America and Vietnam, involved in the use of nuclear techniques and, more particularly, fallout radionuclides (FRN) to assess the relative impacts of different soil conservation measures on soil erosion and land productivity. The overall objective of the \{CRP\} was to develop improved land use and management strategies for sustainable watershed management through effective soil erosion control practices, by the use of 137Cs (half-life of 30.2 years), 210Pbex (half-life of 22.3 years) and 7Be (half-life of 53.4 days) for measuring soil erosion over several spatial and temporal scales. The environmental conditions under which the different research teams applied the tools based on the use of fallout radionuclides varied considerably – a variety of climates, soils, topographies and land uses. Nevertheless, the achievements of the CRP, as reflected in this overview paper, demonstrate that fallout radionuclide-based techniques are powerful tools to assess soil erosion/deposition at several spatial and temporal scales in a wide range of environments, and offer potential to monitor soil quality. The success of the \{CRP\} has stimulated an interest in many \{IAEA\} Member States in the use of these methodologies to identify factors and practices that can enhance sustainable agriculture and minimize land degradation.

The monitoring and evaluation of both implemented marine plans and the planning process itself is susceptible to various uncertainties. Here, uncertainties related to a stepwise monitoring and evaluation framework for spatially managed areas were characterised and quantified with the help of two modified and developed tools. In particular, Walker-type and pedigree matrices were utilised to assess both the sources and respective relative levels of uncertainty present in the assessment of nine European case studies that conducted a stepwise monitoring and evaluation process applying a common framework. Across the southern and northern European case studies major sources of uncertainty were found in relation to the knowledge base, management scenarios with related objectives and data availability. Although case studies made flexible use of the framework to account for the particularities of the local realms, the revealed pattern of associated uncertainty was highly consistent across the case studies. The scored pedigree matrices showed that the criteria ‘stakeholder engagement’ and ‘cross validation’ had greatest influence on the overall robustness of the case study assessments. The observed distribution of median pedigree scores was within acceptable ranges with respect to simulated possible score distributions. In addition, a sensitivity analysis revealed that the scoring of the pedigree criteria by five or more experts would result in less variable interquartile ranges of respective median scores. In conclusion, the developed complementary tools showed great flexibility in characterising and assessing uncertainty despite context-dependent differences among case studies such as geographical area, quality of available data, level of spatial management implementation or management objectives. Moreover, the obtained findings allow prioritising efforts and future research to support an iterative monitoring and evaluation of marine spatial plans. "

Ideally, monitoring in large international river basins should be harmonised to provide a basin-scale assessment of sources and impacts of human activities, and the effectiveness of management actions. This paper examines current water quality issues in the Danube River Basin and evaluates the approach to water quality monitoring in the context of providing information for a basin-wide management plan. Lessons learned from the monitoring programme in the Danube are used to suggest alternative approaches that could result in more efficient generation of water quality data and provide new insights into causes and impacts of variations in water quality in other large international river basins.

abstract = "Environmental processes have been modelled for decades. However, the need for integrated assessment and modeling (IAM) has grown as the extent and severity of environmental problems in the 21st Century worsens. The scale of \{IAM\} is not restricted to the global level as in climate change models, but includes local and regional models of environmental problems. This paper discusses various definitions of \{IAM\} and identifies five different types of integration that are needed for the effective solution of environmental problems. The future is then depicted in the form of two brief scenarios: one optimistic and one pessimistic. The current state of \{IAM\} is then briefly reviewed. The issues of complexity and validation in \{IAM\} are recognised as more complex than in traditional disciplinary approaches. Communication is identified as a central issue both internally among team members and externally with decision-makers, stakeholders and other scientists. Finally it is concluded that the process of integrated assessment and modelling is considered as important as the product for any particular project. By learning to work together and recognise the contribution of all team members and participants, it is believed that we will have a strong scientific and social basis to address the environmental problems of the 21st Century.

However, it often remains unclear whether a model is realistic and reliable enough. Good practice for developing and testing ecological models has not yet been established. Therefore, TRACE, a general framework for documenting a model's rationale, design, and testing was recently suggested. Originally \{TRACE\} was aimed at documenting good modelling practice. However, the word ‘documentation’ does not convey TRACE's urgency. Therefore, we re-define \{TRACE\} as a tool for planning, performing, and documenting good modelling practice. \{TRACE\} documents should provide convincing evidence that a model was thoughtfully designed, correctly implemented, thoroughly tested, well understood, and appropriately used for its intended purpose. \{TRACE\} documents link the science underlying a model to its application, thereby also linking modellers and model users, for example stakeholders, decision makers, and developers of policies. We report on first experiences in producing \{TRACE\} documents. We found that the original idea underlying \{TRACE\} was valid, but to make its use more coherent and efficient, an update of its structure and more specific guidance for its use are needed. The updated \{TRACE\} format follows the recently developed framework of model ‘evaludation’: the entire process of establishing model quality and credibility throughout all stages of model development, analysis, and application. \{TRACE\} thus becomes a tool for planning, documenting, and assessing model evaludation, which includes understanding the rationale behind a model and its envisaged use. We introduce the new structure and revised terminology of \{TRACE\} and provide examples. "

The map was created using an on-screen visual interpretation technique and has an accuracy of 90%, as assessed using 15,565 ground control points. India has hitherto been using potential vegetation/forest type map prepared by Champion and Seth in 1968. We characterized and mapped further the vegetation type distribution in the country in terms of occurrence and distribution, area occupancy, percentage of protected area (PA) covered by each vegetation type, range of elevation, mean annual temperature and precipitation over the past 100 years. A remote sensing-amenable hierarchical classification scheme that accommodates natural and semi-natural systems was conceptualized, and the natural vegetation was classified into forests, scrub/shrub lands and grasslands on the basis of extent of vegetation cover. We discuss the distribution and potential utility of the vegetation type map in a broad range of ecological, climatic and conservation applications from global, national and local perspectives. We used 15,565 ground control points to assess the accuracy of products available globally (i.e., GlobCover, Holdridge’s life zone map and potential natural vegetation (PNV) maps). Hence we recommend that the map prepared herein be used widely. This vegetation type map is the most comprehensive one developed for India so far. It was prepared using 23.5 m seasonal satellite remote sensing data, field samples and information relating to the biogeography, climate and soil. The digital map is now available through a web portal (http://bis.iirs.gov.in). "

This chapter describes both active methods of mitigation based on the reduction of the incident wave energy, such as the use of wave energy converters, floating breakwaters and artificial reefs, and passive methods, consisting of increase in overtopping resistance of dikes, improvement of resilience of breakwaters against failures, and the use of beach nourishment as well as tailored dredging operations.

abstract = "Abstract Ensembles of process-based crop models are increasingly used to simulate crop growth for scenarios of temperature and/or precipitation changes corresponding to different projections of atmospheric \{CO2\} concentrations. This approach generates large datasets with thousands of simulated crop yield data. Such datasets potentially provide new information but it is difficult to summarize them in a useful way due to their structural complexities. An associated issue is that it is not straightforward to compare crops and to interpolate the results to alternative climate scenarios not initially included in the simulation protocols. Here we demonstrate that statistical models based on random-coefficient regressions are able to emulate ensembles of process-based crop models. An important advantage of the proposed statistical models is that they can interpolate between temperature levels and between \{CO2\} concentration levels, and can thus be used to calculate temperature and [CO2] thresholds leading to yield loss or yield gain, without re-running the original complex crop models. Our approach is illustrated with three yield datasets simulated by 19 maize models, 26 wheat models, and 13 rice models. Several statistical models are fitted to these datasets, and are then used to analyze the variability of the yield response to [CO2] and temperature. Based on our results, we show that, for wheat, a [CO2] increase is likely to outweigh the negative effect of a temperature increase of +2 °C in the considered sites. Compared to wheat, required levels of [CO2] increase are much higher for maize, and intermediate for rice. For all crops, uncertainties in simulating climate change impacts increase more with temperature than with elevated [CO2]. "

Understanding the drivers, state, trends and impacts of different land systems on social and natural processes helps to reveal how changes in the land system affect the functioning of the socio-ecological system as a whole and the tradeoff these changes may represent. The Global Land Project has led advances by synthesizing land systems research across different scales and providing concepts to further understand the feedbacks between social-and environmental systems, between urban and rural environments and between distant world regions. Land system science has moved from a focus on observation of change and understanding the drivers of these changes to a focus on using this understanding to design sustainable transformations through stakeholder engagement and through the concept of land governance. As land use can be seen as the largest geo-engineering project in which mankind has engaged, land system science can act as a platform for integration of insights from different disciplines and for translation of knowledge into action.

abstract = "Abstract A critical requirement in assessing progress towards global biodiversity targets is improving our capacity to measure changes in biodiversity. Global biodiversity declined between 2000 and 2010, and there are indications that the decline was greater in freshwater than in terrestrial or marine systems. However, the data, tools and methods available during that decade were inadequate to reliably quantify this decline. Recent advances in freshwater monitoring make a global assessment now close to becoming feasible. Here we identify priorities for freshwater biodiversity assessment for 2020 and 2030, based on the Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) framework. We identify 22 priority activities for 2020 under three of the \{EBV\} classes (species populations, community composition, and ecosystem structure), which include: a globally systematic approach to collecting and assessing species data, collating existing and new data within global platforms, coordinated effort towards mapping wetland extent at high spatial resolution, linking in-situ data to modelling across regions, and mobilising citizen science for the collection and verification of data. Accomplishing these will allow the state of global biodiversity to be assessed according to a Red List Index with expanded geographic and taxonomic cover, an improved freshwater Living Planet Index with a greater number and phylogenetic range of species, measures of alpha and beta diversity, and globally-consistent estimates of wetland extent. To assess variables in the other \{EBV\} classes (genetic composition, species traits, and ecosystem function) we identify 15 priorities, which include development of environmental \{DNA\} methods, species-traits databases, eco-informatics and modelling over the next 15 years.

These tests raise ethical and economic concerns and are considered as inappropriate for assessing all of the substances and effluents that require regulatory testing. Hence, there is a strong demand for replacement, reduction and refinement strategies and methods. However, until now alternative approaches have only rarely been used in regulatory settings. This review provides an overview on current regulations of chemicals and the requirements for animal tests in environmental hazard and risk assessment. It aims to highlight the potential areas for alternative approaches in environmental hazard identification and risk assessment. Perspectives and limitations of alternative approaches to animal tests using vertebrates in environmental toxicology, i.e. mainly fish and amphibians, are discussed. Free access to existing (proprietary) animal test data, availability of validated alternative methods and a practical implementation of conceptual approaches such as the Adverse Outcome Pathways and Integrated Testing Strategies were identified as major requirements towards the successful development and implementation of alternative approaches. Although this article focusses on European regulations, its considerations and conclusions are of global relevance. "

abstract = "The first public product of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is its Conceptual Framework. This conceptual and analytical tool, presented here in detail, will underpin all \{IPBES\} functions and provide structure and comparability to the syntheses that \{IPBES\} will produce at different spatial scales, on different themes, and in different regions. Salient innovative aspects of the \{IPBES\} Conceptual Framework are its transparent and participatory construction process and its explicit consideration of diverse scientific disciplines, stakeholders, and knowledge systems, including indigenous and local knowledge. Because the focus on co-construction of integrative knowledge is shared by an increasing number of initiatives worldwide, this framework should be useful beyond IPBES, for the wider research and knowledge-policy communities working on the links between nature and people, such as natural, social and engineering scientists, policy-makers at different levels, and decision-makers in different sectors of society.

abstract = "SummaryBackground The question of how many marine species exist is important because it provides a metric for how much we do and do not know about life in the oceans. We have compiled the first register of the marine species of the world and used this baseline to estimate how many more species, partitioned among all major eukaryotic groups, may be discovered. Results There are ∼226,000 eukaryotic marine species described. More species were described in the past decade (∼20,000) than in any previous one. The number of authors describing new species has been increasing at a faster rate than the number of new species described in the past six decades. We report that there are ∼170,000 synonyms, that 58,000–72,000 species are collected but not yet described, and that 482,000–741,000 more species have yet to be sampled. Molecular methods may add tens of thousands of cryptic species. Thus, there may be 0.7–1.0 million marine species. Past rates of description of new species indicate there may be 0.5 ± 0.2 million marine species. On average 37% (median 31%) of species in over 100 recent field studies around the world might be new to science. Conclusions Currently, between one-third and two-thirds of marine species may be undescribed, and previous estimates of there being well over one million marine species appear highly unlikely. More species than ever before are being described annually by an increasing number of authors. If the current trend continues, most species will be discovered this century. "
