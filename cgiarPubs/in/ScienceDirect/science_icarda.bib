In recent years improvements in land and water use have come from an agricultural sector that is moving from state to market control, but without greater changes the region will continue to be constrained by environmental degradation, institutional inefficiencies, and persistently high population growth rates. This chapter presents a trend analysis of major cropping groups for the period 1961–2002 and summarizes ways to address the key problems of food security, poverty reduction, and conservation of natural resources throughout the \{CWANA\} region.

In West and Central Asia goats are raised in dry regions with prolonged drought, extreme climate fluctuation, and water scarcity, and are confined to mixed flocks interspersed with sheep. Goats supply kids, milk and fiber, especially to farmers moving their animals through seasonal grazing. Goats in these systems have not been adequately studied, nor have they received the same attention as sheep. Only a few production systems are solely based on goats; these include intensive dairy Damascus goat production (Syria and Cyprus) and extensive fine-fiber production (mohair and cashmere) in other countries of West and Central Asia. Variability for fine-fiber production has yet to be fully assessed and exploited. Goats in the arid lands of the Inter-Andean valleys are associated with the poorer sectors of the population, even more so than their Asian counterparts. Most goat farmers in the Andean valleys live under extreme poverty, occupying degraded areas with limited cropping possibilities, where Criollo goats, introduced during colonial times, are dominant. Their genetic base has yet to be characterized. While improved management/feeding is possible for these systems, access to improved germplasm is required. Technological improvements can only be viable if market incentives and some degree of intensification are possible. Thus, research and development needs to focus on market issues. "

The chosen sites have a Mediterranean climate with an average annual rainfall between 280 and 480 mm (cv 35–28%). The analysis examined the effects on crop productivity of manipulating crop genotype (early, medium or late-maturing) or management (sowing date, fallowing, sowing rate). Cumulative frequency distributions of grain-yield, and dates of germination, anthesis and maturity, were derived from the simulation results and were used to discriminate between alternative choices. Means of simulated crop growth, water use, rooting depth and wetting depth were used to illustrate aspects of wheat production in this highly variable climate. Sowing close to the break of season showed a definite yield advantage at all sites, with simulated yield reductions of 4.2% per 1-week delay in germination. Average grain-yields increased from 217 g m−2 (CV 53%) at the driest site to 471 g m−2 (CV 48%) at the wettest site. Optimum anthesis dates were identified for each location, with an average yield reduction of 3–9% per 1-week delay in anthesis. Environmental pressure on wheat production in the area is high, as is shown by average simulated water-stress-free periods finishing 3 weeks prior to the optimum anthesis date at the driest site, and around anthesis at the wettest site. It was concluded that an early-maturing cultivar was most appropriate for the driest site and a medium-late-season cultivar for the wettest site, with medium-early cultivars for the intermediate sites. The simulated output was judged to be a realistic representation of the studied crop system. The wheat model \{SIMTAG\} can therefore be recommended for use in similar climates. "

This corresponds to optimum seed rates of from about 30 to 150 kg/ha depending upon seed size and expected field establishment. Yield at the optimum population was also strongly correlated with growing season water supply indicating that selection of a plant population that matches the expected w There was a strong positive correlation between grain yield and the length of the grain maturation period. However, since the length of this period can be severely curtailed by high atmospheric evaporative demand and reduced water supply in Mediterranean environments, selection of varieties with a reduced grain filling period could lead to a reduction in risk in triticale production. Further, yield at the optimum population was more closely related to kernel size than to tiller or spike number and was not significantly related to spike size (seeds per spike). This also demonstrates the dependence of triticale yield on conditions during the grain filling period. "

The technique is illustrated using data from a trial in which wheat (c.v. Mexipak) and barley (c.v. Beecher) were grown with and without nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer at two locations in Northern Syria, namely Tel Hadya and Breda. T values were very low during the cool winter months, reflecting poor interception of radiant energy, and \{ESC\} accounted for nearly 100% of \{ET\} during this period. In early spring, as G increased, T values also increased and reached maximum values around anthesis of 3.7 and 3.4 mm/day for fertilized and unfertilized wheat at Tel Hadya, and 2.0 and 1.7 mm/day for fertilized and unfertilized barley at Breda. \{ES\} values dropped correspondingly. In the post anthesis period, due to greater soil moisture depletion during the pre-anthesis period, fertilized crops had lower T values and this was reflected in both plant water status and grain weight measurements. During this period, as moisture stress increased and leaf senescence occurred, T values dropped sharply and \{SC\} values rose. On a seasonal basis, T acounted for 68 and 61% of \{ET\} in thefertilized and unfertilized wheat and 50 and 38% of \{ET\} for the fertilized and unfertilized barley. The pattern of seasonal variation in \{TE\} was influenced, in the preanthesis period, by the absence of root dry matter measurements, but reached values between 65 and 75 kg/ha/mm around anthesis when root growth ceased. \{TE\} values were inversely related to vapour pressure deficit (represented by E0) in the post anthesis period and corresponded well to predicted values. On a seasonal basis, \{TE\} values were very similar across crop, treatment and location ranging between 42.8 and 45.7 kg/ha/mm. "

The production of green material at the tillering stage and subsequent grain yields were measured. The production of green material (measured as dry matter) at the time of tillering or grazing was increased by up to 59% (0.7 t/ha) from applications of from 50–120 kg N/ha depending upon site, season, seed rate and variety. Dry matter at tillering increased by 5–53% (0.2–1.0 t/ha) when a seed rate of 240 kg/ha was used instead of the more usual seed rate, for the area, of 120 kg/ha. In one experiment where variety, seed rate and nitrogen rate were studied together, all the main effects and first order interactions were significant (P &gt; 95%). The combination of 120 kg/ha of seed and 60 kg/ha of nitrogen resulted in the highest yields for both the varieties tested in that experiment. Grain yields after grazing were also increased by the addition of nitrogen fertilizer. However, the rates required to reach maximum yield in grazed plots were approximately double those required in ungrazed plots (50–100 kg/ha). Depending on variety and season, the highest yields were obtained from seed rates of 30–120 kg/ha. Significant interactions (P &gt; 95%) were also found between variety and seed rate in grain production after grazing. In one experiment, where grazing was practised at three different growth stages (early tillering, late tillering, jointing) dry matter yields were increased, but grain yields were reduced, as grazing was delayed. Nitrogen fertilizer increased grain production relatively more than dry matter production in all experiments. The reverse was most often true for increases in seed rate. A group of varieties selected as ‘forage’ types did not perform differently for dry matter at tillering or grain yield, than a group of barleys selected as ‘dual-purpose’ types. On the basis of two season's data some varieties did perform better than others for both dry matter and grain yield. Comparisons between the landrace variety Arabi Abied and the improved variety C-63 over a number of experiments and seasons showed that Arabi Abied produced more green grazing under cooler conditions and more grain at lower levels of applied nitrogen, whilst C-63 was more responsive to improved agronomic techniques including early sowing, increased seed and nitrogen rates. It was concluded that considerable scope exists for increasing output from barley livestock systems in northern Syria based on a combination of variety and improved agronomic inputs. "

Significant yield differences (P &gt; 95%) were found between varieties in their yields at zero applied nitrogen and in their yields at higher levels of nitrogen. Differences were also found in yield responsiveness to applied nitrogen (grain yield per unit of nitrogen applied) and in the nitrogen rates required to reach maximum grain yield. However, meaningful differences in the latter parameter were difficult to measure unless about eight rates of nitrogen were used. Factors observed to modify differences in varietal response to nitrogen were, soil phosphate supply, initial soil mineral nitrogen, and possibly seasonal factors such as water supply and temperature. As a consequence of some of these factors the responses of only about half the varieties tested in two experiments could be considered repeatable leading to the conclusion that relatively uniform conditions are required for experiments of this type. However, reproducibility of nitrogen characteristics under a range of field conditions is considered desirable in potential parental genotypes and testing over a number of seasons is suggested. Experimental conditions suitable for detecting differences in the field are also suggested. "

abstract = "Some indices of nitrogen use efficiency of a relatively large number of varieties were measured under field conditions. The reliability of the estimates depended not only on the field and analytical technique employed but on the necessity to measure responses over more than one season. The influence of management and seasonal factors was demonstrated in the first paper of this series. One important finding of the experiments was that some varieties are capable of yielding more under low fertility conditions whilst others are capable of responding more to higher levels of nitrogen fertilizer. There was in general, a negative correlation between yield at zero applied nitrogen and agronomic efficiency (grain yield per unit of applied nitrogen). It is postulated that some varieties that are capable of efficient utilization of soil nitrogen may be less efficient users of applied nitrogen. Yield at zero applied nitrogen was only correlated significantly with maximum yield in one of the experiments reported. This suggests that varieties that had a high yield potential did not necessarily express it at all levels of nitrogen. In addition, there was only one significant, and in that case negative, correlation between agronomic efficiency of nitrogen use and maximum yield. Efficiency of nitrogen use was thus not consistently related to yield potential. Agronomic efficiency was related both to uptake efficiency (total nitrogen uptake/nitrogen applied) and to utilization efficiency (grain yield per unit of nitrogen uptake) but more strongly to the former. It is calculated that agronomic efficiency in winter cereals can be doubled (from 20–30 to about 50 g grain/g nitrogen applied) if the combination of high uptake and utilization efficiencies measured in the experiments can be achieved by plant breeding. It was found that whilst there was a reasonably consistent positive relationship between nitrogen harvest index and harvest index, the former was not consistently related to utilization efficiency in these experiments. This inferst that translocation of an increased proportion of total plant nitrogen to the grain did not necessarily result in increased grain production per unit of nitrogen taken up. There was a significant negative correlation between utilization efficiency and grain percentage in two experiments on durum wheat but not in bread wheat or triticale. If minimum grain protein contents are to be maintained whilst utilization efficiency is increased, parental lines which do not exhibit such a negative correlation should be chosen. "

A number of lines suitable for dual-purpose use were identified and the performance of the two most promising lines is reported. Days to heading or maturity appeared to be the main factor affecting yields while tiller number, head number and plant height were less important.

Drought is defined as deficiency of precipitation over an extended period of time resulting in water scarcity. Our best minds should be concentrated where the greatest challenges lie today – on discoveries and new solutions to cope with the challenges facing dry areas particularly drought and water scarcity. In addition to facing severe natural resource constraints caused by the lack of water in many of the developing world׳s drylands, we also have to cope with rapid growth of the younger segment of the growing population, and high levels of poverty. Coping with drought and water scarcity are critical to address major development challenges in dry areas namely poverty, hunger, environmental degradation and social conflict. Drought is a climatic event that cannot be prevented, but interventions and preparedness to drought can help to: (i) be better prepared to cope with drought; (ii) develop more resilient ecosystems (iii) improve resilience to recover from drought; and (iv) mitigate the impacts of droughts. Preparedness strategies to drought include: (a) geographical shifts of agricultural systems; (b) climate-proofing rainfall-based systems; (c) making irrigated systems more efficient; (d) expanding the intermediate rainfed–irrigated systems. The paper presents successful research results and case studies applying some innovative techniques where clear impact is demonstrated to cope with drought and contribute to food security in dry areas. The \{CGIAR\} Consortium Research Program (CRP) on “Integrated and Sustainable Agricultural Production Systems for Improved Food Security and Livelihoods in Dry Areas” (in short, “Dryland Systems”), led by ICARDA, was launched in May 2013 with many partners and stakeholders from 40 countries. It addresses farming systems in dry areas, at a global level, involving 80 partner institutions. The Dryland Systems Program aims at coping with drought and water scarcity to enhance food security and reduce poverty in dry areas through an integrated agro-ecosystem approach. It will also deliver science-based solutions that can be adopted in regions that are not yet experiencing extreme shocks, but will be affected in the medium to long-term. The approach entails shifting the thinking away from the traditional focus on a small number of research components to take an integrated approach aiming to address agro-ecosystems challenges. Such an approach involves crops, livestock, rangeland, trees, soils, water and policies. It is one of the first global research for development efforts that brings “systems thinking” to farming innovations leading to improved livelihoods in the developing world. The new technique uses modern innovation platforms to involve all stakeholders, adopting the value chain concept along a research-to-impact pathway for enhanced food security and improved livelihoods in dry areas.

abstract = "Selecting appropriate crops and applying deficit irrigation can help increase water productivity in water-limited regions such as the Mediterranean. The objective of this study was to develop water production functions of major cereal and legume crops under the same environmental and management conditions. Bread and durum wheat, faba bean, chickpea, and lentil were grown under full supplemental irrigation (FSI), two deficit irrigations levels of 2/3 of \{FSI\} (2/3SI) and 1/3 of \{FSI\} (1/3SI), and under rainfed conditions (no irrigation). In average, the actual evapotranspirations (ETs) under \{FSI\} were 549, 552, 365, 451 and 297 mm, for bread wheat, durum wheat, faba bean, chickpea and lentil, respectively. For the same crops, they were 463, 458, 330, 393 and 277 mm for the treatment 2/3SI and 357, 351, 265, 318 and 244 mm for the treatment 1/3SI, respectively. In the case of the rainfed treatment, \{ETs\} for the mentioned crops were 250, 251, 227, 237 and 215 mm, respectively. The experiment was conducted at the \{ICARDA\} experimental station at Tel Hadya, near Aleppo, Syria, over three growing seasons from 2007 to 2010. Results showed that, in general, the treatment with 1/3 of \{FSI\} gave the highest rate of increase in grain yield and water productivity. The mean grain yield from rainfed, 1/3SI, 2/3SI, and \{FSI\} were 1.36, 3.82, 5.18, and 5.70 t/ha for bread wheat; 1.24, 3.80, 5.10, and 5.75 t/ha for durum wheat; 1.57, 2.35, 2.86, and 3.54 t/ha for faba bean, 1.36, 2.63, 3.36, and 3.74 t/ha for chickpea, and 0.64, 1.16, 1.42, and 1.58 t/ha for lentil respectively. Grain yield reductions due to the application of 2/3SI were around 10, 5, 15.6, and 10.2% of \{FSI\} on average for wheat, chickpea, faba bean, and lentils, respectively. Deficit irrigation at 2/3SI increased water productivity compared to rainfed treatments, by 200, 223, 126, 148 and 190% for bread wheat, durum wheat, faba bean, chickpea, and lentils, respectively. However, differences in total water productivity of crops grown under full irrigation compared to deficit irrigation were not significant. Irrigation water productivity ranged from 25 kg ha−1 mm−1 in wheat with 1/3SI to 10 kg ha−1 mm−1 for legumes under the \{FSI\} treatment. Unlike legumes, maximizing wheat grain yield caused a decline in water productivity. "

abstract = "The world's drylands will face not only increasing temperatures with climate change but more importantly also disruptions to their hydrological cycles resulting in less and more erratic rainfall that will exacerbate the already critical state of water scarcity and conflicts over water allocation. The rural poor in dry areas will suffer the most from these changes and will require a range of coping strategies to help them adapt to changing climates. Strategies will include changing of cropping systems and patterns, switching from cereal-based systems to cereal–legumes and diversifying production systems into higher value and greater water use efficient options. The latter include judicious use of water using supplementary irrigation systems, more efficient irrigation practices and the adaptation and adoption of existing and new water harvesting technologies. Scope for the application of conservation agriculture in dry areas is thought to be limited by low biomass production but current evidence suggests that even small amounts of residue retention can significantly decrease soil erosion losses. These options will be supplemented by the development of more drought and heat tolerant germplasm using traditional and participatory plant breeding methodologies and better predictions of extreme climatic events. The majority of drylands are occupied by rangelands with some 828 Mha in West Asia and North Africa alone. These vast areas provide environmental services such as the regulation of water quantity and quality, biodiversity and carbon sequestration. Rangelands have been neglected in the past partly because of problems of ownership, access and governmental policies that discourage investments in rangelands. The idea of payment for environmental services in rangelands is in its infancy but is discussed here as a potential option for better use and management of rangelands and as a safety net to reduce the vulnerability of rangeland inhabitants to climate change. In addition to the promising technological options to reduce vulnerability to climate change a brief discussion is included on the institutional and policy options needed to create a better enabling environment for increased adaptation and ecosystem resilience.

Its seed is a rich source of protein for human consumption, and the straw is a valued animal feed in Near East. In the Mediterranean environment, lentil productivity is limited primarily by the amount and distribution of rainfall and temperature extremes. This study aimed to develop simple models to predict lentil seed and straw yields as a function of seasonal weather data (rainfall and temperature). Historical weather and yield trial data over 39 environments from three contrasting locations in Syria and Lebanon were used. Best-fit models for seed and straw yields in terms of climatic variables based on stepwise regression were developed. These accounted for over 77% variance in yield for both models. The overall responses to total seasonal rainfall were 5.16 kg ha−1 mm−1 seed yield and 10.7 kg ha−1 mm−1 for straw yield. Although May (period of pod-filling) rain contributed substantially to seed yield, high May temperatures reduced yield drastically. For straw yield, absolute minimum temperature and February temperature are important factors, in addition to total seasonal rainfall. The simple regression models developed from historical data not only describe the variation in lentil yields but can also be used for yield prediction purposes in the Near East. "

The model-farm approach allows close supervision of animals but otherwise had several weaknesses, in particular the difficulty of mimicking the real farm environment on a research station.

Data were pooled across years and sites and response functions estimated. Simple optimization analysis shows that economic optimum fertilizer rates vary considerably with rainfall and relative prices. Historical rainfall data are combined with the estimated response functions, and stochastic dominance analysis is used to compare the riskiness of fertilizer treatments in terms of net benefits and benefit-cost ratios. Results show that, given the estimated expected rainfall in barley producing areas, fertilizer use, especially at low levels, may not be as risky as has been believed. Extensions of the methodology to include other environmental variables, or to target recommendations, are discussed. "

The results indicated that the use of multiple linear regression models within small watershed subdivisions enabled the prediction of soil depth with a difference of 50 cm for 77% of the field observations. The spatial distribution of the predicted soil depth was visually coincided and had good correlations with the spatial distribution of the classes amalgamating three terrain attributes, slope steepness, slope shape, and compound topographic index. These suggested that the modeling of soil-landscape relationships within small watershed subdivisions using the three terrain attributes was a promising approach to predict other soil attributes. "

We hypothesized that for WANA, the best-adapted cultivars should produce high yields in years with low rainfall and be responsive to moisture supply in years with high rainfall. Studies were therefore conducted to determine whether there is genetic variability in response to moisture supply and if so, to develop breeding strategies that support our hypothesis. Chickpea cultivars of diverse origin were grown under a soil moisture gradient using a line-source sprinkler irrigation system at Tel Hadya, northern Syria during the 1986/87, 1987/88 and 1988/89 seasons. In 1986/87 rainfall (359 mm) was similar to the long-term average but temperatures in the March-May period were lower. In 1987/88 rainfall was high (504 mm); and in 1988/89, it was low (234 mm) and temperatures during the March-May period were higher than the long-term average. Rainfed mean grain yields were 0.984 t/ha in 1986/87; 1.099 t/ha in 1987/88 and 0.187 t/ha in 1988/89. Cultivars varied significantly in response of grain yield to moisture supply (3.93–9.29 kg/ha/mm in 1986/87; 2.15–8.19 kg/ha/mm in 1987/88; and 3.10–9.57 kg/ha/mm in 1988/89). Responsiveness to moisture supply (regression slope) was highly correlated with yield potential. However, the correlation between the responsiveness to moisture supply and drought (rainfed) yield was non-significant. Widely adapted (stable) cultivars (i.e. cultivars which are considered well adapted to variation in moisture supply) in 1986/87 and 1987/88 were those with high mean yield, high rainfed yields and high yield potential; and in 1988/89 when the rise in temperature in spring was fast, additional requirements for wide adaptation were early phenology and high harvest index. Chickpea cultivars with wide adaptation had deep root systems and high pre-dawn leaf water potential. "

This paper examines the contribution of crop traits to yield under drought and determines the relative contributions of drought escape, yield potential and a drought response index (DRI) to such yield. In years with mild drought (1986/87 and 1987/88), high biomass, high yield potential and high harvest index were highly correlated with grain yield. During the severe drought of 1988/89, early flowering and low straw yield, high harvest index, yield potential, pod and seed number and seed mass were correlated with rainfed grain yield. Differences among chickpea cultivars in rainfed (drought) yield were partitioned into drought escape, yield potential and DRI. Drought escape accounted for 41% in 1986/87, 37% in 1987/88 and 69% in 1988/89; yield potential accounted for 47%, 37% and 1%, respectively; and \{DRI\} accounted for 4%, 17% and 17% of the variations, respectively. The three factors combined explained an average of 90% of the variability in grain yield. The \{DRI\} was used to quantify tolerance or susceptibility of a cultivar independently of drought escape (early flowering) and yield potential. Of the traits which were significantly associated with drought yield, high harvest index, large number of pod and high seed mass were associated with drought escape (early flowering), while deep root system, high leaf water potential at dawn and large number of seeds were associated with drought tolerance (DRI).

Two experiments were therefore conducted to study the morphological characteristics, chemical composition and rumen degradation of barley straw fractions from several genotypes over a range of watering levels. The range was obtained by using sprinklers to apply various levels of water in addition to normal rainfall. In Experiment 1, there were four genotypes of barley and three levels of watering, and in Experiment 2, another three genotypes of barley and four levels of watering. Grain and straw yield, stem height, the proportions of chaff, leaf and stem, the chemical composition of these morphological fractions, and the dry matter losses (DML) of fractions from nylon bags placed in the rumen, were determined. The extent and rate of \{DML\} was estimated. In both experiments, applying additional water almost doubled stem height. The effects of watering level on grain and straw yield and plant morphological fractions were therefore generally greater than the effects of genotype. In Experiment 1, genotype and watering level had few significant effects on the chemical composition of straw fractions and in Experiment 2 chaff composition was generally affected by genotype, but both genotype and watering level usually affected leaf composition. Both genotype and watering level affected the extent of digestion of leaf in Experiment 1, whereas in Experiment 2 genotype was more important than watering level in affecting the extent and rate of digestion of stem. The results show that water stress can affect the composition and rumen degradation of barley straw to a similar extent as can genotype. This finding should be recognised when comparing cereal straw from genotypes harvested in different years and locations in semi-arid environments. "

Tannin expressed as \{CE\} was no more than 8.27 g kg−1 in any of the species and seven of the 91 lines of V. narbonensis had no detectable \{CE\} levels. There was considerable intraspecies variability in \{CE\} as indicated by the high coefficients of variation (CV), which ranged from 17.48% in V. palaestina to 68.99% in V. sativa. In comparison with most conventional legumes, \{TIA\} values were generally low in all the species, ranging from 0.36 g kg−1 \{DM\} in selection \{IFLVP\} 2524 to 5.00 g kg−1 \{DM\} in \{IFLVS\} 2560. Values for \{TIA\} in V. palaestina were particularly low (0.51 ± 0.13 g kg−1 DM) and a \{CV\} of 25.86% suggests that selection for lower inhibitor levels is possible. Seed weight was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) correlated with \{CE\} in both V. sativa and V. palaestina, while \{CP\} was weakly negatively correlated (r = −0.48) with \{TIA\} among the V. sativa genotypes. There was no significant relationship between seed weight and \{TIA\} in any of the species investigated. "

Moreover, imidacloprid seed treatment significantly improved lentil yields of moderately resistant and susceptible lentil genotypes, but had no effect on the yield of resistant genotypes. In addition, seed treatment was more effective in increasing seed yield of \{BLRV\} and FBNYV-inoculated plots compared to SbDV-inoculated plots. Based on these results, seed treatment with imidacloprid at 1.4 g a.i./kg of seeds can effectively reduce the incidence of two persistently transmitted aphid-borne viruses, \{BLRV\} and FBNYV, affecting faba bean and lentil crops.

As post-planting soil inoculation is often practiced when seed inoculation fails, the effect of delayed inoculation was investigated. Roots of Medicago rigidula (L.). All selection 716, and Medicago rotata Boiss. selection 2132, were initially pre-exposed to Rhizobium meliloti strains. Subsequently, roots were exposed to a secondary inoculum after 6, 48 and 168 h to simulate delayed inoculation. and subsequent establishment of others strains in the nodules were investigated. Combinations of highly effective and host compatible \{ICARDA\} strains (M15 and M53) and effective-ineffective strains (M15 and M28) were used to evaluate proportional nodulation responses. Plants were harvested after 6 weeks of growth. Nodules were assessed for distribution in the root system and for occupancy based on their differential resistance to kanamycin and streptomycin, and, in the case of \{ICARDA\} M28, on nodule characteristics. The strain \{ICARDA\} \{M15\} was a better competitor than \{ICARDA\} \{M53\} when applied in equal density in M. rotata, at zero time. While forming nodules with M. rigidula, \{ICARDA\} \{M53\} was equally competitive under the same conditions. With \{ICARDA\} \{M15\} as the primary inoculum, and \{ICARDA\} \{M53\} delayed for 6, 48 and 168 h, the incidence of \{ICARDA\} \{M15\} nodules increased on M. rigidula from 43% (at zero time) to 86, 94, and 97% and, on M. rotata, from 78% (at zero time) to 88%, 95%, and 98% for the three time delays, respectively. Pre-exposure of 2-day old M. rigidula seedlings to the ineffective strain \{ICARDA\} \{M28\} as the primary inoculant was followed by significant nodule number increases (P ⩽ 0.01) as compared with \{ICARDA\} M15. Nonetheless, when \{ICARDA\} \{M15\} was the primary inoculum, \{M28\} was able to produce about 35% of the nodules when applied at the 6 and 48 h time delays. However, with \{ICARDA\} \{M28\} as the primary inoculum, followed by \{ICARDA\} M15, nodule occupancy of \{ICARDA\} \{M28\} in M. rigidula increased from 40 (at zero time) to 75%, 80%, and 95% for the three time delays, respectively. The percentage of total nodulation by M28, applied at the three delay times, was markedly lower (10%, 5% and 1%, respectively) when M. rotata was pre-exposed to \{ICARDA\} M15. This suggested a host preference for \{ICARDA\} M15, even if applied as a late inoculum. Results indicate that the early events in the nodulation process of annual medics coupled with host-specificity factors are perhaps the most critical for competition among R. meliloti strains for nodule formation.

After weaning, which occurred at 56days, milk yield and milking length were measured weekly during the milking period (n = 381). Milk yield of \{TS\} and T ewes were 12% and 30% higher, respectively, than S ewes. Milk yield and milking length of \{TS\} ewes reflected additive inheritance and did not differ from the parental genotypes' average (p ≥ 0.199). Culling of low producing ewes in 2003 and 2004 also resulted in increased milk yield. Dams of all genotypes displayed similar weights at birth (p = 0.898) and weaning (p ≥ 0.677). The latter suggests dams of the different genotypes olerated equally the pre-weaning lactation load. Performance tended to improve as ewes aged, with milk yield and milking length peaking at 3years of age (p &gt; 0.05). Ewe lambing weight, birth–weaning ewe weight decline, litter size, and litter weight weaned peaked at 4–5years of age (p ≤ 0.016). With the exception of birth–weaning ewe weight decline, year effects influenced the traits under study (p ≤ 0.035). Excluding litter size, the best performance was in 2005, followed by 2003 and 2004. Milk yield increased with litter size at weaning (b = 18.7; p = 0.024). The lambing–weaning ewe weight decline (3.6kg) and ewe productivity (0.46kg litter weaned weight per kg ewe weight) did not differ between genotypes (p ≥ 0.178). Average litter size was 1.15, with the \{TS\} ewes displaying the largest litter size (1.23; p = 0.026). Single lambs were 25% heavier than twins at birth averaging 4.73kg and 3.8kg, respectively. Male lambs were 4% heavier than female lambs at birth (p &lt; 0.0001) and 9.3% heavier at weaning (p &lt; 0.0001). Lamb birth weights, weaning weights and daily weight gains were similar for all genotypes (p ≥ 0.210). The average proportion of fat (5.95%), crude protein (5.19%) and solids non-fat (11.29%) in the milk varied across genotypes where S &lt; \{TS\} &lt; T (p ≤ 0.0037). \{F1\} crosses with T increased the productivity of S ewes by 12.2%. It is noteworthy that this occurred under improved feeding and may not be recommended for other conditions. Culling low producing ewes led to a 12.8% increase in milk yield, which could translate into a substantial boost in revenue for farmers rearing traditional sheep flocks in milk producing areas. "

The 15N recovery fraction (15SNRF) is calculated as the amount of 15W-labeled N recovered in fertilized crops per unit 15SN-Iabeled N applied. The relationship between \{ARF\} and 15NRF is discussed on the basis of a complete-mixing model for the distribution of 15N-labeled N over different N pools in the soil-crop system. Mineralization-immobilization turnover in soil is not considered in the model. It is shown that in the lower range of \{ARF\} values, i.e., on soils high in available N, values of 15NRF are likely to exceed those of ARF. This is because the fertilizer N mixes with the soil mineral N pool and thus the plant derives its N from applied as well as soil N, even if there is little or no crop response to applied N. In the higher range of \{ARF\} values, i.e., in N-deficient soils, values of 15SNRF may be lower than those of \{ARF\} due to an increased uptake efficiency of soil N in fertilized treatments. Loss of N, either from the fertilizer or from the mixed soil mineral N pool, reduces the range of values of 15WRF and ARF. From an agronomic point of view, \{ARF\} is a meaningful quantity as it accurately reflects the overall effect of fertilizer application on crop N uptake, whereas 15SNRF is a meaningful quantity in 15N tracer studies on N fertilizer use efficiency and N balances in soil-crop systems. In the absence of mineralization-immobilization turnover in soil, the fertilizer N recovery in the crop is accurately estimated by 15NRF. "

However, no account has yet been published in which this effect had been fully quantified under rainfed semiarid Mediterranean conditions. To tackle the issue, in the 2009/2010 cropping season we studied the soil water dynamics of wheat grown after barley in northern Syria under two contrasting tillage regimes (zero tillage vs. conventional tillage, CT), two levels of surface residue retention (partial and full) and early and late planting. For a comprehensive quantification of the water balance, we applied the crop-soil simulation model CropSyst for the season under study and for the period 1980–2010 (30 years). Results showed that planting date had a notable impact on crop performance and yield (30-year average, early: 2.68 Mg/ha; late: 2.30 Mg/ha). Simulations indicated that planting wheat immediately after the first sufficient rainfall in autumn bears little risk of crop failure due to early season droughts, and more should be done to encourage farmers to do so. \{ZT\} and residue management changed yields only very little, even though in 25 out of 30 years, \{ZT\} yields were higher than \{CT\} yields. About 55% of the seasonal precipitation (∼150 mm) was lost by unproductive soil evaporation, whereas \{ZT\} and residue retention had only a minor mitigating impact; too little to be clearly distinguishable by field observations. A potential obstacle for meticulous simulation of \{CA\} with CropSyst is the model's inability to simulating the dynamic nature of tillage, i.e. its decreasing impact over time, and the beneficial effect of \{ZT\} and residue retention on soil water infiltration. However we argue that such impact may be limited on soils with self-mulching characteristics that are common in the region of this study. "

Selection techniques for pest resistance and agronomic characters have been developed. The F2-derived family, bulk-pedigree and two-cycle selection breeding methods are in common use for varietal development. Over 50 cultivars have been developed for winter sowing in the Mediterranean basin and for the rice fallow in South Asia.

Genetic resources merely stored safely are of little value to plant breeders unless they are evaluated and the resulting data is made widely available. Evaluation is, therefore, an essential link between conservation and use. Characterization provides a standardized record of readily observable morphological characters that, together with passport (origin) data, identify an accession in the genebank. The evaluation process for large collections follows several distinct stages—seed multiplication and preliminary evaluation, systematic evaluation of the entire collection, and further evaluation of selected accessions. Genetically uniform cultivars are employed by cereal farmers in the major cereal-producing countries of the world. Because plant breeding is essentially a process for exploitation of genetic variability, breeders could also examine means of conserving already existing genetically variable germplasm as well as creating new varieties.

The issue of production sustainability is all the more acute in semi‐arid and arid regions of the world where drought and related biophysical factors create a fragile and uncertain environment for production. In the West, mainly in temperate regions, long‐term agronomic trials have been invaluable in identifying new technologies and crop management systems that have contributed to enhanced crop output that is sustainable from the biological, environmental, and economical standpoints. Many of these trials continue to guide cropping trends into the foreseeable future. The Mediterranean region has served climatic constraints to its agriculture and despite being cultivated for millennia, it is largely food deficient. Yet long‐term cropping experiments that could direct agricultural production in a sustainable manner are relatively rare, and even most of such trials are of recent vintage. This review offers a background perspective on factors related to crop, production, and subsequently examines the various multiyear cropping system/tillage trials in countries of North Africa and West Asia that border the Mediterranean. Special emphasis is given to the wide range of trials conducted in Syria by the International Center for Agriculture Research in the Dry Areas across a range of rainfall zones that are typical of the region as a whole. The goal of many trials was to identify cropping systems as a substitute for fallow and continuous cereal cropping with implications for improved water‐use efficiency (WUE), crop quality, soil quality, and fertilizer use. Lessons learned from the trials are highlighted as well as future directions for cropping systems research. "

Management of crop residues and soil organic matter (SOM) and its interrelationship with tillage and crop rotation is of central importance for maintaining soil quality and sustaining crop yields. We examined the medium-term influence of conventional moldboard plowing compared with shallow tillage, under barley-vetch and barley-vetch–wheat-vetch rotation, with different levels of straw management (burned, removed, or incorporated) and compost addition (10 Mg ha−1 every 2 or 4 years) on the distribution with soil depth (0–30 cm) of SOM, total organic nitrogen (Ntot), and labile as well as microbial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). Shallow tillage increased \{SOM\} in 0–20 cm across all residue management treatments by on average 2.7 g kg−1. Compost addition every 2 years instead of burning or removing residues significantly increased Ntot in 0–20 cm by 0.22 g kg−1, doubled labile N and C in 0–5 cm depth, and increased the ratio of labile N to Ntot in 0–20 cm by 4%. Consequently, \{SOM\} accumulated in the labile pool, which reacts readily to changes in soil management practice, but which may also be depleted as quickly. Thus, shallow tillage in combination with compost addition can help build-up of SOM, and therefore soil quality. Under conditions of intensive cultivation, where crop residues are not in demand for livestock fodder, the system assessed constitutes a new agronomic direction under dryland agriculture in the Mediterranean region.

This study examined the distribution of B in profiles from agricultural experiment stations across a mean annual rainfall gradient (196–471 mm/yr) in the semi-arid cereal-production zone in north–western Syria. A more intensive surface and depth-wise sampling was conducted at the driest barley-growing station, Boueidar, where plant toxicity symptoms were observed. The wetter stations had low levels of B throughout the profile, while the drier ones tended to have potentially toxic levels, which increased with profile depth. Only the Boueidar site had B accumulations within 20–40 cm of the surface. Profile sampling at Boueidar showed three distinct B distribution patterns, i.e., increasing with depth, uniform with depth, and a zone of B accumulation at 25–75 cm. Surface (0–20 cm) samples at Boueidar had spatially variable B concentrations. Leaching to remove excess B is impractical. Ideally, the problem may be tackled by exploiting genetic variation in B uptake. However, spatial and depth-wise variability shown in this study makes screening for B tolerance difficult in the field; as an alternative, B toxicity tolerance can be evaluated in the greenhouse. This work has heightened awareness of B toxicity in other countries of this agro–ecological zone. "

abstract = "Abstract Cropping systems in the drylands of west Asia are characterized by grazing, burning or harvesting of stubbles, multiple cultivations and late sowing, which can limit yields and lead to soil erosion and degradation. There is a lack of information on more conservation-based technologies developed in other countries to address some of these problems, particularly manipulations of tillage and time of sowing. This long-term field experiment was conducted under rainfed conditions at \{ICARDA\} near Aleppo in northern Syria to investigate the effects of conventional tillage (CT) and zero tillage (ZT) in combination with early and late times of sowing on the performance (production and profitability) of bread wheat, chickpea, barley and lentil grown in rotation over six years (2006–07 to 2011–12). As expected, the amount and pattern of rainfall was a major driver of crop performance, varying from 222 to 453 mm among the growing seasons. The grain yield of crops was often similar under \{ZT\} and \{CT\} (≈70% of year–crop–time of sowing combinations) and with early and late sowing (≈80% of year–tillage–crop combinations), but there were also many instances when \{ZT\} yielded significantly better than \{CT\} (≈25%) and early sowing yielded better than late sowing (≈13%). Importantly, over the four years from 2008–09 to 2011–12, the improved crop management system of \{ZT\} and early sowing gave higher grain yields than the conventional farmer system of \{CT\} sown late in two (13%) of the 16 year × crop combinations, similar yields in 13 (81%) combinations and lower yields for \{ZT\} early in one (6%) combination. During this time, the average grain yield increases with \{ZT\} and early sowing when compared to \{CT\} and late sowing were a significant 332 kg ha−1 (18%) for wheat, 127 kg ha−1 (20%) for chickpea and 135 kg ha−1 (15%) for lentil, and a non-significant 295 kg ha−1 (12%) for barley. Corresponding increases in gross margins ($US) were 162, 147, 89 and 176 $ ha−1 for wheat, chickpea, barley and lentil, respectively. In chickpea, the most profitable treatment was \{ZT\} sown late, producing an extra 281 kg ha−1 and 271 $ ha−1 compared to \{CT\} sown late. Early sowing improved crop establishment with increased plant densities of 30%, 48% and 29% for wheat, barley and lentil respectively, while \{ZT\} increased densities by 19%, 22% and 12% for chickpea, barley and lentil, respectively, when sown early. Other yield components reflected the grain yield responses. The increased grain yields achieved in this study, in combination with lower costs and greater profits, suggest \{ZT\} plus early sowing should be evaluated and promoted more widely as an attractive cropping technology for farmers in the Middle East.

abstract = "Small ruminants are key components of smallholder production systems in dry areas and need technological change if farmers are to escape the vicious cycle of poverty. The disparity in income and the living conditions of these producers is alarming, but society, governments, and research and development (R&amp;D) commit little to modify their livelihoods. Prospects for change are good, considering the expanding demand for small ruminant products, but smallholders are not yet benefitting from this opportunity. This paper reviews the status of small ruminant populations in dry areas of Central Asia, the Caucasus, West Asia, North Africa, and some countries of Latin America. Overall the small ruminant population is increasing in these regions. The market opportunities for products of these species are also reviewed. Meat is in high demand all over the countries and demand is often not met by local supply. Milk is produced only in some regions. The prices of wool are depressed whereas fine fibers can reach attractive prices. Smallholder systems could supply the expanding demand but are still unprepared because conditions do not favor technology adoption. The main trends affecting the production systems in dry areas are discussed: enhanced market demand with opportunities and constraints, feed scarcity and climate change. A research strategy is then described, based on the experience gathered by the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas and its collaborators, focusing on the improvement of productivity and smallholders’ incomes. Examples of successful experience of adaptive research tested by farmers at a small scale are noted. To achieve sustained improvement of productivity and of farmers’ income, certain basic conditions must be met: the joint action of R&amp;D, within the domain of development projects, through outscaling of technologies; appropriate policies; participatory action, and the mid- to long-term commitment to sustain these conditions by government and donor/funding agencies. South–south and south–north exchanges can facilitate this process. The problems faced by farmers are not insurmountable. With the commitment of all actors involved in the development of a given dry region/country, R&amp;D could induce a change and improve the living conditions of small ruminant farmers and halt rural migration.

Water harvesting (WH) systems are currently being used in many areas to sustain crops and increase water productivity. This study investigated the effect of three treatments (S15: 50-m2 catchment area with 15% slope, S8: 50-m2 catchment area with 8% slope, and L8: 70-m2 catchment area with 8% slope) on the amount of water harvested in tree basin for young olive (Olea europaea L.) trees from November 2002 to July 2003. Soil moisture was monitored weekly during the rainy season and bi-weekly afterwards. To determine moisture changes in the catchment and target areas and amount of water harvested (in liters) for each tree, volumetric soil moisture content was measured at three or four points along the slope using a neutron probe down to a maximum depth of 120 cm, as soil depth allowed. \{WH\} structures increased soil moisture content in the rootzone compared to the catchment area. The rainfall threshold for runoff generation was less than 15 mm. Land slope was more important than micro-catchment size for increasing the amount of water harvested. Compared to the 8% slope, the 15% slope resulted in larger harvested amounts for small storms, but the two were comparable when storms were large. The large micro-catchment size resulted in higher amounts of harvested water only in the presence of storms greater than 26 mm. After adding the amounts lost by evapotranspiration, the net amount of water harvested in the tree basin of each tree for the 2002–2003 rainy season reached 722 and 688 l (or 361 and 344 mm) for treatments \{S15\} and S8, respectively. Deeper soil profiles (i.e., &gt;90 cm) were important to ensure longer storage periods. By early July, soil moisture content in the tree basin for treatments S15, \{L8\} and \{S8\} was still higher by 38, 13, and 5% respectively, than the levels recorded at the onset of the experiment. \{WH\} increased soil moisture content during the spring and early summer, a critical period for olive production.

Experimental and analytic technology and statistical tools are needed to enhance lentil breeding progress. One of the concerns of field experimentation is to design experiments in suitable block designs and model the data to account for any left-over trend in the field layout and for correlations in the plot errors. Elite breeding lines of lentil developed through conventional breeding methods at \{ICARDA\} were evaluated in three contrasting environments in northern Syria and Lebanon during 1999–2005. This study examines the data on seed and straw yields from 226 trials conducted in randomized complete block (RCB) and in square lattice designs. Suitable models incorporating blocking structures, linear trends and spatially correlated plot-errors were fitted to the individual datasets. The results indicated that the spatial analysis model, which accounts for the spatial pattern of the field, was better than the commonly used \{RCB\} design model. The spatial analyses gave substantial increases in precision of predicted means for the genotypes. An average efficiency of pairwise genotype means comparison over \{RCB\} was 141% for seed yield and 158% for straw yield from the trials conducted in incomplete blocks and where found superior to RCB. It also enhanced estimates of broad sense heritability on mean-basis, with an average of 72% for seed and 70% for straw yield under the superior models, compared to 62 and 55% for \{RCB\} model, respectively. The percentage genetic gain due to selection at 10% intensity was 26% for seed and 20% for straw yield based on those models, which were 2–3% higher than those from the \{RCB\} model. In general, it is recommended to continue the use of incomplete block designs for variety trials in lentils and use the most suitable spatial pattern for statistical analysis to assist field crop breeders to enhance precision in selection of desirable genotypes. These results are consistent with findings of a number of other variety trials in lentil. "

The observed patterns of soil moisture dynamics and crop water use were typical of those previously observed in Mediterranean-type environments. Moisture supply, as reflected by rainfall, was the principal factor affecting total water use, but both the application of fertilizer (N and P) and varietal differences also resulted in increased water use, particularly at the wetter location. There were no differences in the water-use efficiency between the two varieties, but the application of fertilizer resulted in large increases of water-use efficiency at both locations. Separation of crop evapotranspiration into crop transpiration and soil evaporation indicated that increased water-use efficiency was partially due to increased transpiration efficiency but was largely due to a reduction in soil evaporative loss, through greater soil shading by the crop canopy, and increased crop transpiration. Examination of this dataset together with the patterns of root and shoot growth suggest that fertilizer and varietal effects on root growth are linked to patterns of water use, growth and yield formation in barley.

With the climate change scenario it has emerged as a viable crop option for fragile agro-ecosystems, where successful cultivation of major crop species is apparently not difficult. However, grass pea seeds are known to have a neurotoxin known as β-N-oxalyl-l-α, β-diaminopropionic acid (β-ODAP). Its overconsumption as a staple food in an unbalanced diet for an extended period of 3–4 months can cause spastic paraparesis of the legs in human beings. Therefore, β-ODAP needs to be reduced through genetic means to a safe level for human consumption. Unfortunately, a paucity of efforts towards development of genetic and genomic resources for this species has hampered the progress in breeding low \{ODAP\} varieties in the past. Some progress has been made in recent years for collection, conservation, characterization, evaluation and utilization of Lathyrus genetic resources at the national and international levels, resulting in large ex situ collections in various gene banks of the world. These resources need to be systematically characterized and evaluated for genetic improvement through conventional and contemporary approaches. In spite of a large number of wild relatives with useful traits, no significant efforts have been made for alien gene transfer in grass pea. This chapter reviews the present status of genetic and genomic resources of Lathyrus and their use in current breeding programmes. "

Using a case study from Syria and the application of the Minimum Data Analysis method (TOA-MD), this paper provides empirical evidence for ensuring wider adoption of SRMP. The paper argues that the introduction of financial incentives in the form of payments for agricultural-environmental services can increase the economic viability and enhance the adoption of \{SRMPs\} and is a better alternative to the unsustainable state subsidies for fodder purchases and barley cultivation on rangelands. Model results indicate that further investment in reasearch toward generating low cost technologies and tailored governance strategies including a financial incentive system would lead to better management of rangelands and improve livelihoods in the Syrian Badia. These findings are valuable for policy makers, donors as well as development and extension practitioners in the \{MENA\} region as they can better inform future courses of actions. "

The ratio of splitting the nitrogen application influenced the shape of the grain yield response. In two of the experiments less nitrogen was required to achieve maximum yield where all the nitrogen was applied at the tillering stage. As the proportion of the total nitrogen applied at sowing was increased, the amount required to achieve the maximum yield also increased. In one experiment where three barley varieties were compared, their yield responses to applied nitrogen varied from significantly positive, to significantly negative, depending on the ratio of application. Where all the nitrogen was applied at tillering no variety was responsive, but where all the nitrogen was applied at sowing one variety responded positively and another negatively. The percentage of vitreous kernels in durum wheat, an important determinant of price, was influenced by the ratio of nitrogen application in one experiment. More nitrogen was required to reach a given percentage of vitreous kernels as the proportion of nitrogen applied at tillering was increased. Possible practical implications for nitrogen application strategies for rainfed cereals in relation to soil nitrogen at sowing and rainfall distribution are discussed. "

Consequently, a major research challenge is to devise cropping systems that maximize water-use efficiency (WUE). In a long-term trial in northern Syria (1986–1998) we compared the effects of seven wheat-based rotations on soil water dynamics and \{WUE\} in both the wheat and non-wheat phase. The cropping systems were durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L.) in rotation with fallow, watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris), lentil (Lens culinaris), chickpea (Cicer arietinum), vetch (Vicia sativa), medic pasture (Medicago spp.), and wheat. Seasonal recharge/discharge were identified using the neutron probe. Depth of wetting varied with seasonal rainfall (233–503 mm). Based on crop yields, \{WUE\} was calculated for each cropping option in relation to the durum wheat crop. The greatest limitation to growth was the supply of water and not the soil moisture storage potential. Wheat grain yield was dictated by the extent to which the alternative crops in the rotation dried out the soil profile, in addition to seasonal rainfall and its distribution. Chickpea and medic extracted as much water as continuous wheat. Wheat after these crops was solely dependent on current seasonal rainfall, but fallow, lentil, watermelon, and vetch did not deplete soil moisture to the same extent, leaving some residual soil moisture for the succeeding wheat crop. This difference in soil water resulted in a significant difference in wheat yield and hence WUE, which decreased in the following crop rotation sequence: fallow, medic, lentil, chickpea, and continuous wheat. However, on the system basis, the wheat/lentil or wheat/vetch systems were most efficient at using rainfall, producing 27% more grain than the wheat/fallow, while the wheat/chickpea system was as efficient as wheat/fallow system, with continuous wheat being least efficient. With N added to the cereal phase, system \{WUE\} of the system increased, being least for continuous wheat and greatest for wheat/lentil. Wheat–legume rotation systems with additional N input in the wheat phase not only can maintain sustainable production system, but also are more efficient in utilizing limited rainfall. "

The period during which the crop's evaporative demand is high coincides with the end of the rainy season; thus, faba bean experiences considerable soil moisture stress during the reproductive growth stage and often produces poor yields. Limited water supply through supplemental irrigation (SI) can boost and stabilize faba bean production. The objective of this study was to elucidate the effects of limited irrigation and sowing date on the yield and water use efficiency of faba bean. An experiment was carried out over four cropping seasons (1996–2000) at ICARDA's main station at Tel Hadya (Aleppo, northern Syria) where mean annual rainfall is 330 mm. A local variety ‘Hama 1’ was grown in rotation with wheat. The experiment included three sowing dates (Early: early November; Normal: mid December, and Late: late January) and four levels of \{SI\} (full SI, 2/3 SI, 1/3 SI, and no SI, i.e., rainfed). The overall mean grain yield, which was 1.13 t/ha under rainfed conditions increased to 1.49, 1.77, and 1.89 t/ha at 1/3 SI, 2/3 SI, and full \{SI\} levels, respectively. Overall mean water use efficiency was 0.50 kg grain/m3 for rainfed, 0.57 kg grain/m3 for 1/3 SI, 0.61 kg grain/m3 for 2/3 \{SI\} and 0.61 kg grain/m3 for full SI. Similarly, the overall means obtained for biomass were 3.26 t/ha for rainfed, 4.0 t/ha for 1/3 SI, 4.50 t/ha for 2/3 SI, and 4.87 t/ha for full SI. The study's results indicated that a 2/3 \{SI\} level gives the optimum water use efficiency for both grain and biomass under SI. Early sowing date of faba bean steadily increased grain yield: 1.73 t/ha for early; 1.60 t/ha for normal; and 1.38 t/ha for late. Biomass yield followed a similar trend: 5.13 t/ha for early; 3.86 t/ha for normal; and 3.48 t/ha for late. Biomass water use efficiency under \{SI\} decreased with the delay of sowing from 1.72 kg/m3 for early to 1.33 kg/m3 for late sowing dates. Overall mean grain water use efficiency was 0.59 kg/m3 for early; 0.61 kg/m3 for normal and 0.52 kg/m3 for late indicating that the optimal sowing date is mid December. Both sowing date and \{SI\} had a highly significant effect on crop yield. A year-by-year data analysis showed that \{SI\} had a significant impact on yield, whereas sowing date did not show such impact in all years. Finally, water production functions for faba bean under supplemental and rainfed conditions were proposed. "

The survey data was analyzed using a single-stage model for estimating the technical inefficiencies of each production and its determinants. Technical efficiency ranges from 0.67 to 0.97, with considerable variation within each of the four production systems. The sedentary production system was the most efficient, and the migratory system the least efficient. The major factors causing inefficiencies included high abortion rate, low fertility, high lamb mortality, and long distances to markets and water sources. Improving the physiological conditions of the sheep and selecting the appropriate system of sheep production according to the location of the farm would improve efficiency of the sheep production substantially. Efficiency of sheep production in Syria can be improved by encouraging producers to shift to more intensive systems. As production and market conditions are fairly stable in Syria, the results and their implications are still valid. "

Groundwater recharge was simulated using the \{SWAT\} model for representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 climate change scenarios for the period 2012–2020. Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) was estimated using the \{SWAT\} model for the period 2010–2011. This was compared with the \{ETa\} determined using the surface energy balance algorithm (SEBAL) calibrated using data for the period 2005–2009. We concluded that the \{SWAT\} \{ETa\} estimates showed good agreement with those of \{SEBAL\} (coefficient of determination = 0.85 ± 0.05, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency = 0.83 ± 0.07). The total average annual groundwater recharge to the aquifer was 537 mm (±55 mm) with the maximum occurring during July (151 mm). The results showed that groundwater recharge would increase by 40%, as compared to the reference period, by the end of 2020 under \{RCP\} 4.5 and by 37% under \{RCP\} 8.5. The \{SWAT\} can thus be a handy tool for not only estimating the recharge at high spatial and temporal resolution, but also under changing climate. "

Thus, a 4 year field study (1992/1993 to 1995/1996) on a deep clay soil in northern Syria assessed the impact of \{SI\} (rain-fed, 1/3, 2/3 and full SI) combined with variable N application rates (0, 50, 100, 150 kg ha−1) and sowing date (early, normal, late) for four improved durum wheat varieties adapted to rain-fed and irrigated conditions. As rainfall and evapotranspiration varied over the 4 years, the amount of \{SI\} water required also varied. Yields varied with the season, and the main factors, except variety, were significant. Delaying sowing from November to January reduced yields and response to both \{SI\} and N. With irrigation, crop responses were generally significant up to 100 N ha−1, whereas the optimum response for rain-fed conditions occurred with 50 kg N ha−1. Limited \{SI\} (1/3) significantly increased yields, but almost maximum yields were obtained by 2/3 of full SI. Water- and N-use efficiencies were greatly increased by SI, with little variation among varieties. However, irrigation and delayed sowing decreased grain protein levels, which were partially compensated for by added N. A similar effect was observed for kernel vitreousness. Models developed from the response data can facilitate the potential transfer of these findings. Thus, in most growing seasons, minimum irrigation during the winter growing season, combined with appropriate fertilization, can enhance wheat output and yet maintain grain quality. "

Field experiments were conducted using two original synthetic populations derived from different genetic pools; the control populations (C) and two upward (S+), and two downward (S−) selected populations. In these populations, design and display of floral traits grouped into functional categories was studied. Outcrossing rates were estimated using codominant isozyme markers, and the mixed mating and the multilocus methods. The simultaneous responses of functional floral traits to selection for allogamy/autogamy were analyzed by using multivariate Discriminant Analysis. Whether selection was for increased or decreased outcrossing, the four selected groups shifted in the opposite direction of the selected type. Discriminant Analysis revealed how the patterns of increased or decreased outcrossing in the selected populations were due to a concordant multidimensional change in floral traits, thus limiting or contra-balancing the effects of artificial selection. Indirect selection does not act on traits individually, but on combinations of traits that are functionally integrated. Our results provide evidence that evolution towards self-fertilization has occurred by different genetic pathways after upward selection for outcrossing. This occurrence was by autogamous and by geitonogamous selfing. For the improvement of faba bean populations in the context of sustainable agriculture, direct selection on outcrossing cannot be a selection criterion. However, floral traits, in combination with pollinator behaviour, should be used as indirect selection criteria to increase allogamy. This approach, in turn, will allow the development of both pollinator-friendly varieties and enhance the environmental services of faba beans. "

While fallowing or growing legume crops in the alternate year have shown to consistently increase yields in semi-arid environments such as in the Mediterranean area, little emphasis has been given to cereal quality in rotation trials, especially with respect to N, and thus improved animal and human nutrition. This paper reports the effect of those treatments on cereal quality parameters, especially N, and thus protein, in wheat grain and straw in a long-term (14 years) rainfed cropping systems trial in the medium rainfall zone (300–400 mm year−1) in northern Syria that examined seven alternative-year options with durum wheat (Triticum turgidum var durum), i.e., vetch (Vicia sativa), medic (Medicago spp.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum), lentil (Lens culinaris), fallow, watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris) as a summer crop in the fallow year, and continuous wheat. Two ancillary treatments involved N fertilization (0, 30, 60, 90 kg N ha−1) in the cereal phase, and stubble grazing management (moderate and heavy grazing, and no grazing or stubble retention). Both the rotation and N treatments had a significant influence on all parameters (test weight, grain and straw N percentage, and total N uptake). By comparison, grazing management had little influence on quality parameters except test weight; however, the residue × N interaction was significant. Rotations such as those with medic and vetch enriched the N in grain and straw. These rotations thus improved the nutritional value in terms of protein of the grain, an important consideration as per capita consumption of bread is high in the Middle East and other sources of protein are limited. Similarly, as grazed or fed straw is dominant in the diet of sheep, the enhanced nutrition is of significance. While fallow produced the highest yields, and is a hedge against the effects of drought, it produces grain and straw of low nutritional value with respect to protein, as a result of dilution of available soil N in the increased biomass. Though less obvious than yield, crop quality parameters should be considered in any cropping system involving rotations, especially those involving legumes. "

The method can be used for developing high-resolution, low cost maps for rapid detection of resource-driven poverty in low income countries where agriculture is a major source of rural income, and where poverty mapping is rarely undertaken due to the high costs involved.

Persistently transmitted aphid-borne viruses pose a significant limitation to legume and cereal production worldwide. Surveys conducted in many countries in \{WANA\} during the last three decades established that the most important of these viruses are: Faba bean necrotic yellows virus (FBNYV: genus Nanovirus; family Nanoviridae), Bean leafroll virus (BLRV: genus Luteovirus; family Luteoviridae), Beet western yellows virus (BWYV: genus Polerovirus; family Luteoviridae), Soybean dwarf virus (SbDV: genus Luteovirus; family Luteoviridae) and Chickpea chlorotic stunt virus (CpCSV: genus Polerovirus; family Luteoviridae) which affect legume crops, and Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV (BYDV-PAV: genus Luteovirus; family Luteoviridae), Barley yellow dwarf virus-MAV (BYDV-MAV: genus Luteovirus; family Luteoviridae) and Cereal yellow dwarf virus-RPV (CYDV-RPV: genus Polerovirus; family Luteoviridae) which affect cereal crops. Loss in yield caused by these viruses is usually high when infection occurs early in the growing season. Many aphid vector species for the above-mentioned viruses are reported to be prevalent in the \{WANA\} region. In addition, in this region many wild species (annual or perennial) were found infected with these viruses and may play an important role in their ecology and spread. Fast spread of these diseases was always associated with high aphid vector populations and activity. Although virus disease management can be achieved by combining several control measures, development of resistant genotypes is undoubtedly one of the most appropriate control methods. Over the last three decades barley and wheat genotypes resistant to BYDV, faba bean genotypes resistant to BLRV, and lentil genotypes resistant to BLRV, \{FBNYV\} and SbDV have been successfully identified. Moreover, progress has been made in disease management of some of these viruses using a combination of management options. Experience gathered over the last few decades clearly showed that no single method of virus disease control suffices to reduce yield losses in legume and cereal crops. "

Short-term field studies do not capture the full nature of such risk and the extent to which modifications to crop, soil and water management recommendations may be made to mitigate the extent of such risk. Crop modeling studies driven by long-term daily weather data can predict the impact of climate-induced risk on crop growth and yield however, the availability of long-term daily weather data can present serious constraints to the use of crop models. To tackle this constraint, two weather generators namely, LARS-WG and MarkSim, were evaluated in order to assess their capabilities of reproducing frequency distributions, means, variances, dry spell and wet chains of observed daily precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, and solar radiation for the eight locations across cropping areas of Northern Syria and Lebanon. Further, the application of generated long-term daily weather data, with both weather generators, in simulating barley growth and yield was also evaluated. We found that overall LARS-WG performed better than MarkSim in generating daily weather parameters and in 50 years continuous simulation of barley growth and yield. Our findings suggest that LARS-WG does not necessarily require long-term e.g., &gt; 30 years observed weather data for calibration as generated results proved to be satisfactory with &gt; 10 years of observed data except in area with higher altitude. Evaluating these weather generators and the ability of generated weather data to perform long-term simulation of crop growth and yield is an important first step to assess the impact of future climate on yields, and to identify promising technologies to make agricultural systems more resilient in the given region.

The addition of fertilizer doubled (Breda) or trebled (Jindiress) shoot weight and green area by the beginning of stem extension in both varieties.

The number of kernels at maturity was highly correlated with the growth rate of the crops in the 3 weeks preceeding anthesis, which was in turn highly correlated with dry matter at the beginning of stem extension. Since sufficient water was available to adequately fill all kernels set there was also a good correlation between shoot weights at the beginning of stem extension and at maturity.

The paper also analyses the energy intensity of decentralized water systems and various water end-uses together with the major tools and models used. A major gap identified from this review is the lack of a holistic and systematic framework to capture the dynamics of multiple water–energy–GHG linkages in an integrated urban water system where centralized and decentralized water systems are combined to meet increased water demand. Other knowledge gaps identified are the absence of studies, peer reviewed papers, data and information on water–energy interactions while adopting a ‘fit for purpose water strategy’ for water supply. Finally, based on this review, we propose a water–energy nexus framework to investigate ‘fit-for-purpose’ water strategy. "

abstract = "The most important question in supplemental irrigation management is when and how much water to apply. It is a laborious and expensive task to develop supplemental irrigation schedules solely by conventional field experimentation. A cropping system simulation model (CropSyst) was evaluated for its ability to simulate growth, biomass, grain yield and evapotranspiration (ET) of wheat sown early with supplemental irrigation (SI). This was computed under rainfed conditions in a semiarid climate with cold winters in the highlands of Turkey. Experimental data from three growing seasons (1998–2001) were used. The experimental design incorporates Bezostia bread wheat cultivar tested under two main treatments: no irrigation at sowing (rainfed-A1) and irrigation at sowing with 50 mm of water (A2); and two sub treatments: rainfed (B1) and spring supplemental irrigation to replenish the total water requirement at 0–90 cm soil profile (B2) at the Ankara Research Institute of Rural Services. Crop input parameters were selected from the model documentation and experimental data. A few cultivar-specific parameters were adjusted within a narrow range of typical fluctuations by model calibration. Results showed that CropSyst was able to simulate yield, biomass and evapotranspiration as observed in the field experiments. Overall, the Willmott Index of agreement between simulated and observed values of grain yield, biomass and \{ET\} were 0.98, 0.76 and 0.91, respectively. CropSyst model predicted better the seasonal evapotranspiration under full supplemental irrigated conditions (A2B2) than under rainfed conditions (A1B1), with values of the Willmott index of agreement being 0.97 and 0.89, respectively. The model was run for 20 years (1982–2001) including the 4-year experimental period. Data showed that wheat grain yield could be improved by 15, 19 and 25% with applying only 50 mm of water at the sowing time of 15 October, 1 October and 15 September, respectively. In 80% of the cases, the respective \{SI\} applications would give 2.75, 2.7 and 2.95 t ha−1, of the long-term average rainfed yield of 2.1 t ha−1, respectively. "

Most farmers in Syria aim to maximize yield per unit of land regardless of the quantity of water applied. Water losses can be reduced and water productivity (yield per unit of water consumed) improved by applying deficit irrigation, but this requires a better understanding of crop response to various levels of water stress. This paper presents results from a 3-year study (2004–2006) conducted in northern Syria to quantify cotton yield response to different levels of water and fertilizer. The experiment included four irrigation levels and three levels of nitrogen (N) fertilizer under drip irrigation. The overall mean cotton (lint plus seed, or lintseed) yield was 2502 kg ha−1, ranging from 1520 kg ha−1 under 40% irrigation to 3460 kg ha−1 under 100% irrigation. Mean water productivity (WPET) was 0.36 kg lintseed per m3 of crop actual evapotranspiration (ETc), ranging from 0.32 kg m−3 under 40% irrigation to 0.39 kg m−3 under the 100% treatment. Results suggest that deficit irrigation does not improve biological water productivity of drip-irrigated cotton. Water and fertilizer levels (especially the former) have significant effects on yield, crop growth and WPET. Water, but not N level, has a highly significant effect on crop ETc. The study provides production functions relating cotton yield to \{ETc\} as well as soil water content at planting. These functions are useful for irrigation optimization and for forecasting the impact of water rationing and drought on regional water budgets and agricultural economies. The \{WPET\} values obtained in this study compare well with those reported from the southwestern USA, Argentina and other developed cotton producing regions. Most importantly, these \{WPET\} values are double the current values in Syria, suggesting that improved irrigation water and system management can improve WPET, and thus enhance conservation and sustainability in this water-scarce region.

The \{SI\} production function is taken as the difference between the total water production function (irrigation + rain) and that of rainwater. Theoretical analysis of the unconstrained objective function shows that the seasonal depth of \{SI\} to maximize profit occurs when the marginal product of water equals the ratio of unit water cost to unit product sale price. Applying this analysis to wheat in northern Syria, the production functions of \{SI\} under different rainfall conditions are developed. Coupled with current and projected water costs and wheat sale prices, the functions are used to develop an easy-to-use chart for determining seasonal irrigation rates to maximize profit under a range of seasonal rainfall amounts. Results show that, for a given seasonal rainfall, there is a critical value for the ratio of irrigation cost to production price beyond which \{SI\} becomes less profitable than rainfed production. Higher product prices and lower irrigation costs encourage the use of more water. Policies supporting high wheat prices and low irrigation costs encourage maximizing yields but with low water productivity. The resulting farmer practice threatens the sustainability of water resources. Balancing profitability versus sustainability is a challenge for policy makers. Our analysis can help national and local water authorities and policy makers determine appropriate policies for water valuation and allocation; and assist extension services and farmers in planning irrigation infrastructure and farm water management.

Based on this varying usefulness of rainfall throughout the year, a rainfall index that weights district rainfall over the wheat belt was found strongly to relate to state and national wheat yields. Accuracy of the model was improved by filtering out insignificant and excess rainfall according to the broad scale water holding capacities of regional soils. As one moves clockwise around Australia from the east the soil is less able to store water and truncated winter rainfall is a major problem on poorer soils. Assuming actual rainfall up to the forecast date and average rainfall beyond, hindcasted yields in 1988 and 1989 were within 10% of the final figure 3 months in advance of harvest. A marked trend to early sowing and higher yielding varieties, coupled with increased inputs caused the model to underestimate in 1990, 1991 and 1992. However, at the end of the year model predictions equalled, or were more accurate than official predictions in 4 out of 5 years. Large-area Australian yields appear to be a function of both rainfall amount and distribution, as well as the time of sowing and extent of frost in critical periods. "

Due to suboptimal seasonal rainfall amounts and distribution, wheat yields in the region are low and fluctuate substantially over seasons. Delayed sowing due to late rainfall affects early crop establishment before winter frost and causes substantial reduction in yield. A 4-year field study (1998/1999 to 2001/2002) was carried out at Ankara Research Institute of Rural Services to assess the impact of early sowing with supplemental irrigation (SI) and management options during other dry spells on the productivity of a bread wheat cultivar, “Bezostia”. Treatments included early sowing with 50 mm irrigation and normal sowing with no irrigation as main plots. Four spring (SI) levels occupied the sub-plots. These are rainfed (no-irrigation), full irrigation to sature crop water requirements and two deficit irrigation levels of 1/3 and 2/3 at the full irrigation treatments. Results showed that early establishment of the crop, using 50 mm of irrigation water at sowing, increased grain yield by over 65% and adding about 2.0 t/ha to the average rainfed yield of 3.2 t/ha. Early sowing with \{SI\} allowed early crop emergence and development of good stand before being subjected to the winter frost. As a result, the crop used rainwater more efficiently. Additional supplemental irrigation in the spring also increased yield significantly. Grain yields of 5120, 5170 and 5350 kg/ha were obtained by applying 1/3, 2/3 and full SI, respectively. The mean productivity of irrigation water given at sowing was 3.70 kg/m3 with maximum value of 4.5 kg/m3. Water productivity of 1/3, 2/3 and full \{SI\} were 2.39, 1.46 and 1.27 kg/m3, respectively, compared to rainwater productivity of 0.96 kg/m3. "

Rainfed cropping in the highlands of this region coincides with the severely cold winter with mostly, snow from November to April. Cereal yields, are low and variable mainly as a result of inadequate and erratic seasonal rainfall and associated management factors, such as late sowing (or late crop emergence). In an area where water is limited, small amounts of supplemental irrigation (SI) water can make up for the deficits in seasonal rain and produce satisfactory and sustainable yields. This field study (1999–2002) on a deep clay silty soil in north west of Iran was conducted with four \{SI\} levels (rainfed, 1/3, 2/3 and full irrigation requirements) combined with different N rates (0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 kg ha−1) with one wheat variety (Sabalan). Yields of rainfed wheat varied with seasonal rainfall and its distribution. A delay in the crop emergence from October (SI treatment) to November (rainfed) consistently reduced yields. With irrigation, crop responses to nitrogen were generally significant up to 60 kg N ha−1. An addition of only limited irrigation (1/3 of full irrigation) significantly increased yields and maximized water use efficiency (WUE). Use efficiency for water and N was greatly increased by SI. Under deficit irrigation, maximum \{WUE\} would be achieved when 60 kg N ha−1 is combined with 1/3 of full SI. Early crop germination is essential to ensure adequate crop stand before the winter frost and to achieve high yield. Early emergence can be achieved by applying a small amount (40–50 mm) of \{SI\} after sowing. Thus, when limited \{SI\} is combined with appropriate management, wheat production can be substantially and consistently increased in this highland semi-arid zone. "

Maximizing water productivity, and not yield per unit of land, is therefore a better strategy for dry farming systems. Under such conditions, more efficient water management techniques must be adopted. Supplemental irrigation (SI) is a highly efficient practice with great potential for increasing agricultural production and improving livelihoods in the dry rainfed areas. In the drier environments, most of the rainwater is lost by evaporation; therefore the rainwater productivity is extremely low. Water harvesting can improve agriculture by directing and concentrating rainwater through runoff to the plants and other beneficial uses. It was found that over 50% of lost water can be recovered at a very little cost. However, socioeconomic and environmental benefits of this practice are far more important than increasing agricultural water productivity. This paper highlights the major research findings regarding improving water productivity in the dry rainfed region of West Asia and North Africa. It shows that substantial and sustainable improvements in water productivity can only be achieved through integrated farm resources management. On-farm water-productive techniques if coupled with improved irrigation management options, better crop selection and appropriate cultural practices, improved genetic make-up, and timely socioeconomic interventions will help to achieve this objective. Conventional water management guidelines should be revised to ensure maximum water productivity instead of land productivity. "

Results from long-term research in experimental stations and farmer fields showed substantial increases in rainfed crop yields and water use efficiency in response to SI. Nevertheless, \{SI\} comes at a cost. The date of sowing winter wheat in a rainfed Mediterranean-type environment depends upon the onset of rainfall. The optimal date for achieving highest yield under rainfed conditions is around mid-November. However, farmers tend to sow wheat later than this date because of the delay and/or unreliability of initial rains. With SI, early sowing and crop establishment can be ensured. However, early sowing of all the fields’ results in higher water demand during a very short period in spring because all the fields will be at the peak use rate. Spreading out dates of sowing allows peak water demand to occur over a longer period, thus reducing the discharge and the size of irrigation system needed, and hence improves the economics of this practice. In this paper, the impact of adopting a multi-sowing date strategy on farm water demand and crop production is considered. A simplified optimization model solved by linear programming is presented. Four-years’ data (1992–1996) from field experimental research conducted on bread wheat in northern Syria have been used in the analysis. We showed that a multi-sowing date strategy has reduced the peak farm water demand rate by more than 20%, thus potentially reducing irrigation system capacity and/or size. Alternatively, the water demand rate of a larger area can be met with the same water supply. However, optimal sowing dates that minimize farm water demand rate do not always maximize total farm production. The outcome depends on crop water requirements and yield for each sowing date. Furthermore, this selection is greatly influenced by the level of water scarcity. The approach used can help in reducing the cost of irrigation and improving the efficiency of water use in SI. "

The crop’s high water demands coincide with the end of the rainy season. Thus, lentil often experiences considerable drought stress during reproductive development, which reduces yields. Limited supplemental irrigation (SI) can boost and stabilize productivity. The objective of this study was to elucidate the effect of limited irrigation and early sowing on yield and water productivity (WP) of lentil. An experiment was carried out over four cropping seasons (1996–2000) at ICARDA’s main station at Tel Hadya (Aleppo, northern Syria) where mean annual rainfall is 330 mm. A lentil cultivar (ILL 5883) was grown in rotation with wheat. The experiment included three sowing dates (early: mid November; normal: late December to mid January; and late: late January to mid February) and four levels of \{SI\} (full SI, 2/3 SI, 1/3 SI, and no SI). The results indicated that lentil grain and biomass yield increased with increased SI. Mean grain yield of 1.04 t ha−1 under rainfed conditions increased to 1.42 at 1/3 SI, 1.69 at 2/3 SI, and 1.81 t ha−1 at full SI, while mean water productivity was 0.44 kg grain m−3 water when rainfed, 0.54 at 1/3 SI, 0.6 at 2/3 SI, and 0.58 kg m−3 at full SI. Overall mean biomass production was 4.27 (rainfed), 5.35 (1/3 SI), 6.00 (2/3 SI), and 6.2 t ha−1 (full SI). The study’s results indicated that the 2/3 \{SI\} level gives the maximum water productivity for both grain and biomass under SI. Early sowing increased lentil biomass production by 0.47 and 1.56 t ha−1 over normal and late sowing dates. However, the highest grain yield of 1.60 t ha−1 was obtained at the normal sowing date. Grain water productivity with SI, however, increased when seeds were sown late in the season. Biomass water productivity, by contrast, increased with the earliness of sowing date—1.79 (late), 1.97 (normal), and 2.05 kg m−3 (early). Sowing date had the greatest impact on crop response under rainfed conditions. Finally, production functions relating lentil yield with field water supply under supplemental and rainfed conditions were proposed. "

The flocks were visited each month to start with and every three months later in the trial to collect faecal samples, and recordings were made of ewe and lamb live weight, ewe body condition score, changes in flock inventory and supplementary feeding practices. Treatment with the anthelmintic had no beneficial effect on ewe fertility, mortality and survival.

Stepwise regression analysis suggested that better management, such are more rigorous culling, resulted in higher ewe fertility and survival.

abstract = "The arid zones of the world are all characterized by a large deficit of rainfall in relation to the potential evapotranspiration. Their distribution around the world is governed by the interaction of global atmospheric circulation patterns, the distribution of land and sea, and local topography. Countries that have substantial areas with arid conditions belong to very different groups in terms of resource availability, agricultural productivity, population density and wealth. Most are poorly endowed with good agricultural land. Water resources vary tremendously, both in terms of reserves and consumption. Agriculture is in most cases the main consumer of water. Most arid zone countries have high population growth, and rural population densities are generally much higher than overall population densities. They have a wide disparity in wealth. The arid zones have a surprising diversity of agroecological niches, with edaphic conditions that can deviate substantially from those of surrounding areas. These niches often have a higher biomass or agricultural productivity. At the same time they are vulnerable to natural processes such as primary salinization, wind and water erosion. Increasing pressure of human and livestock population make that these natural environmental stresses lead to accelerated degradation and depletion of soil and water resources. As they exploit the various agroecological niches, the production systems of the arid zones are equally diverse, and cover the full spectrum of land use intensification from pastoral or transhumant livestock systems to rainfed or irrigated cropping systems. These production systems show rapid change under the pressures of environmental degradation, increasing land and water shortage, and the needs of expanding populations. With the exception of irrigation management, the agrometeorological needs of the arid zones have been insufficiently addressed in the past. Perceptions of homogeneity, low agricultural potential, low population density and the logistical problems of providing maintenance and collecting data from remote stations are largely to blame for this situation. Agrometeorological research can have a positive impact on the productivity, resource-efficiency and environmental sustainability of the arid zones by supporting a better characterization of the agricultural environments. Research targeted towards data spatialization and integration of meteorological and remote sensing information will help to alleviate the handicap of sparse meteorological data networks. At the same time these networks will need to be improved through installation of automatic stations and by establishing new partnerships with land users. "

Hence it is of pressing importance to quantify the spatial distribution of salinity and its changing trend in space and time and ascertain the driving forces thereof. This study aims at such a diachronic salinity mapping and analysis using multitemporal remote sensing taking a pilot site, the Dujaila area in Central Iraq, as an example. For this purpose, field survey and soil sampling were conducted in the 2011–2012 period, and a multitemporal remote sensing dataset consisting of satellite imagery dated 1988–1993, 1998–2002, and 2009–2012 was prepared. An innovative processing approach, the multiyear maxima-based modeling approach, was proposed to develop remote sensing salinity models. After evaluation of their suitability, the relevant models were applied to the images for multitemporal salinity mapping, quantification, and change tracking in space and time. The driving causes of salinization in the study area were evaluated. The results reveal that the developed salinity models can reliably predict salinity with an accuracy of 82.57%, indicating that our mapping methodology is relevant and extendable to other similar environments. In addition, salinity has experienced significant changes in the past 30 years in Dujaila, especially, very strongly salinized land got continuously expanded, and all these changes are related to land use practices and management of farmers, which are closely associated with the macroscopic socioeconomic environment of the country.

About 45% of the animals were positive (IIF method). Northwest provinces showed highest percentage of seropositive animals (up to 94%), while \{BD\} was almost absent in the southern provinces. Distribution of anti-BD antibodies appeared to be related to two aspects of flock management, distance of transhumance and the use and quality of pens. The higher prevalence in long distance transhumant flocks is possibly related to the higher risk of contacts with persistently infected and virus excreting animals. Similarly, stress due to sheltering in poorly ventilated and humid folds may facilitate occurrence of the infection. Sheep from the wettest regions, with more than 600 mm of rainfall per year (IA zone), showed a higher prevalence to BD, when compared to those from dry areas. This may be related to the rapid inactivation of the virus by desiccation. Occurrence of \{BD\} infection was related to a mortality rate up to 20% of lambs. "

The soil was labeled by growing wheat plants on soil fertilized with N enriched with 10.43 atom % 15N excess and by incorporating the labeled wheat as organic matter (2.08 atom % 15N excess) back into the soil. This method allowed estimation of \{N2\} fixed by medic and N transfer to wheat. Compared to the sole medic crop, dry herbage yield and total N of medic grown in mixture, were reduced. Medic plants alone (unmixed) assimilated 80% more soil N that wheat alone at the higher rate of P. When in mixture, wheat plants took up more soil N than medic plants. The percentage N derived from synbiosis (%Ndfa), by the sole medic, averaged 60%. In mixture, %Ndfa of the medic was 80%. The total N difference method gave higher values for %Ndfa (6–22%) than the isotope dilution technique, depending on the P rate. This was because P rates affected the N absorption of medic and wheat differently. Dry herbage yield and total N of medic and wheat grown alone and in mixture were improved by P supply. Competition between medic and wheat was affected by P fertilization, favoring wheat which became more competitive for uptake of soil N at the higher P rates. When no P was added to the soil, mixed medic took up 60% of the soil N absorbed by sole medic; at the higher P rate, this was reduced to 34%. Transfer of N fixed by medic to wheat was detected only after the second crop cycle. "

There are also low-fat cheeses such as Mushallaleh and Halloumi to meet the demand of urban, more health-conscious consumers. Studies on composition and characteristics of both sheep and goat milk and dairy products are available, but the most part of them are not readily available to the international scientific community. Differences in milk composition between species and breeds and variations during lactation, both affect the yield and characteristics of dairy products. The processing methods and the mixture of goat and sheep milk could be adjusted accordingly to maintain quality. The existing diversity in cheese and local knowledge offers a valuable base for meeting the increasing demand for animal products.

Machine milking of ewes began after weaning, 56 d after parturition, and continued until the milk yield of the ewes was &lt;200 mL/d. Milk yield obtained by hand milking and milk composition were measured weekly, and days in milk, total milk yield, and total yields of protein, fat, and nonfat solids in milk were calculated for each ewe. On d 70 of milking, morphological traits of the whole udder (circumference, width, height, and length), udder cistern (height), and teats (length, width, and position score) were measured. On the same day, the milk yield of ewes was recorded by hand milking. Positive and moderate to strong correlations (r = 0.36 to 0.76) between udder circumference and width, teat width, and milk production traits of total milk yield, and total yields of protein, fat, and nonfat solids were found. However, a more accurate predictor of milk production traits was milk yield on d 70, as higher positive correlations between this variable and the milk production traits were found (r = 0.63 to 0.89). Nine farmers were invited to independently estimate the hand-milked milk yield performance of a sample of 169 ewes (d 15 to 45 of milking) by visually observing each ewe and making a subjective linear score (1 to 5). Their assessments were significantly correlated with milk yield on the day of the observation (r = 0.52), total milk yield (r = 0.50), and days in milk (r = 0.45). Considering the perception details provided by farmers concerning each of the subjective linear scores, it was found that most predictive linear udder measurements of udder circumference and width and teat width identified in this study were implicit in these scores. The predictive ability of the measurements studied have practical implications for community-based breeding programs involving improvement of milk production—not just in Syria, but in other countries in dry areas as well—because it is possible for experienced farmers to visually assess milk production of dairy ewes or take simple udder measurements with predictive value.

The indigenous \{VAMF\} population was reduced by the fumigant dazomet. Growth and nutrient uptake of non-inoculated chickpea (‘low mycorrhizal’) plants were compared to growth and nutrient uptake of VAMF-inoculated (‘high mycorrhizal’) and P-fertilized chickpea plants. At flowering in ‘high mycorrhizal’ plants, mycorrhizal root length, total P uptake and shoot biomass were significantly higher than in ‘low mycorrhizal’ plants. At maturity, however, shoot biomass was similar, and harvest index was higher in ‘low mycorrhizal’ plants than in ‘high mycorrhizal’ plants. This negative effect on reproductive growth was related to a more shallow root distribution in the soil profile and a lower root: shoot ratio in the ‘high mycorrhizal’ plants. Although chickpea had a benefit from the mycorrhiza in terms of P uptake and vegetative growth, high infection with \{VAMF\} reduced reproductive growth, most probably due to higher water consumption and thus drought stress under the Mediterranean conditions.

abstract = "Fertilizer nitrogen (N) recovery fractions may be calculated by the difference or the isotope-dilution method. With the first method an apparent recovery fraction (ARF) and with the latter method a 15N recovery fraction (15NRF) is calculated. The two methods may give different results, \{ARF\} generally being higher than 15NRF, particularly in the higher range of ARF-values. Fertilizer N recovery fractions in crops calculated by the two methods were compared using experimental data derived from the literature. The experimental results could be largely explained on the basis of theoretical relationships between 15NRF and ARF, based on the assumptions of (1) complete and instantaneous mixing of initial soil mineral N and fertilizer N, and (2) zero order kinetics for plant uptake, mineralization and immobilization reactions. In the lower range of ARF-values, values of 15NRF exceeded those of ARF, presumably because the plant derives its N from fertilizer as well as soil N, even if there is no crop response to applied N. In the higher range of ARF-values, 15NRF tended to be lower than ARF, presumably because of the occurrence of mineralization-immobilization turnover, which causes the 15N content of the mineral N pool to decrease. This phenomenon, referred to as ‘pool substitution’, may be enhanced by increased uptake efficiency of soil N by fertilized crops or by increased mineralization in fertilized treatments. From an agronomic point of view, the use of \{ARF\} would be preferred, as this quantity accurately reflects the overall effect of fertilizer application on crop N uptake. 15NRF is a meaningful quantity in rebalance studies. It accurately estimates the fertilizer N recovery in the crop, provided 4N released in mineralization-immobilization turnover in soil is not considered fertilizer N. The theory developed in the present series of papers may contribute to the understanding of the dynamics and transformations of fertilizer N in soil-crop systems and thus help to develop criteria for efficient and effective fertilizer N management.

In this study, we tested 16 experimental hanfets constituting all possible combinations of four barley landraces and four wheat (two landraces and two varieties) at three locations in Eritrea for 3 years during which farmers (both men and women) made selections of suitable hanfets. Across locations and years, the grain yield of hanfets on average was similar to that of the pure barley but significantly higher than that of wheat. The analysis of the land equivalent ratio did not reveal differences between the hanfets but showed an average advantage of 50% by growing hanfets as compared to the pure crops. The stability analysis showed that the most stable entries always included some hanfets but that not all hanfets were necessarily more stable than the pure crops. The interactions of the hanfets with locations and years within locations were never significant while they were significant for some of the characters in the case of pure barley and pure wheat. We did not find major differences in selection between men and women: they both selected for high grain yield, earliness, short heads, low kernel weight and short plants. They appear to prefer those hanfets in which both components are early heading and maturing. We argue that because of possible differences in root architecture, the hanfets may exploit more efficiently water resources than pure crops. "

Enumeration of rhizobia populations in lentil fields of Egypt, Jordan and Turkey using most probable number (MPN) technique indicated a range of 3.1 × 101 to 6.9 × 105 viable rhizobia g−1 soil. Only 13% of the 61 soils sampled contained &lt; 103 cells g−1, while 20% of soils had &gt; 105 rhizobia g−1. Lentil fields in Jordan contained higher average population densities than other areas evaluated. The symbiotic effectiveness of all collected isolates was evaluated on lentil cv. \{ILL\} 16 in an aseptic N-free hydroponic gravel culture system. A greater proportion (up to 50%) of highly effective isolates was found in samples from eastern Turkey and Jordan: samples from Syria and Egypt mainly contained rhizobia with moderate to poor \{N2\} fixing capacity. Of the isolates collected from all locations, 44% were of low effectiveness; only 21% were classified as superior fixers. Distinct variations in salt and heat tolerance were observed for isolates from different regions. A greater proportion of Egyptian isolates and international standard strains grew at 35°C. Only 9 of 229 isolates grew at 40°C; 8 of these came from the southern Nile valley in Egypt. Isolates from Jordan and Turkey were more sensitive to 0.5% NaCl in the growth medium than the others, of which 30–50% were tolerant. Few isolates grew with 1.0% NaCl: most of these came from Syria. None of the heat- or salt-tolerant isolates was among the most effective \{N2\} fixers. "

Soil water is often limited in the top soil layer at the optimum sowing time, and stands of wheat may be established poorly and have low yields unless sowing is delayed until later rainfall. Sowing more deeply may enhance establishment due to higher soil water content in the seed zone, leading to better germination and emergence of seedling. Otherwise, a grain yield reduction will occur due to the delay in sowing after the optimum time. In a 2-year field experiment at Tel Hadya, Syria, the optimum time of sowing for rainfed cereals was between early November and early December. The establishment of plants sown 3, 9, and 12 cm deep and in ridges was poorer than that of plants sown at 6 cm, causing reductions in tiller numbers, leaf area index (LAI) and yield. Grain yield from ridge planting was 40% lower on average than from sowing at 6 cm. At this depth, yields declined by 5% per week with delay in sowing after the optimum time at 6 cm depth, but by lesser amounts for other depths, and varied little for the ridge method of planting. To maximize yield in this environment, i.e., 2.5 t ha−1, it is important that crops are sown early at the appropriate depth, even when pre-sowing rainfall is less than enough to wet the profile fully.

abstract = "Publisher Summary This chapter reviews the past work on disease resistance breeding in chickpea and discusses the strategies to tackle unsolved disease problems. Methods for breeding disease-resistant chickpea cultivars are similar to those used for yield breeding, except that the segregating materials have been challenged by the pathogen and selection is made for disease resistance along with other attributes. Some of the techniques employed by breeders include hybridization and mutation. Chickpea is grown primarily by resource-poor farmers on residual moisture with little if any inputs. The short growing season at lower latitudes (0–20◦) also limits yields. The fast-rising temperatures at the reproductive phase force the crop into premature drying. Thus, yields are low (less than one t/ha). At present productivity levels, use of disease-resistant cultivars appears to be the best alternative for management of chickpea diseases. "

There is a need to accurately understand the variation and the spatial distribution of soil properties within dry region of the Levant. Such understanding is required to optimize the use and management of scarce land and water resources. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of hillslope characteristics on the variation of selected soil chemical properties in an arid Mediterranean climate. At each of five selected transects four sites were chosen to represent four different topographic positions: summit, shoulder, backslope and toeslope. A soil profile was examined at each site and a representative sample from each horizon was withdrawn for chemical analyses. The analyses indicated that generally, the carbonate contents of the surface horizons decreased from higher to lower positions of the toposequence, the carbonate content increased with depth for profiles occupying the lower positions. This suggests more intense leaching within soil at lower positions. The effect of steepness and curvature on controlling the variation of soil properties was obvious at the summit and shoulder positions. Leaching process seems to hinder the effect of steepness and curvature for soils at lower positions. Lower positions receive runoff water and organic matter from upper positions, which complicate the relationship between landform shape and organic matter content. Continuous tillage resulted in lower organic matter contents for soils at lower positions. Higher pH values were reported for soils down along the transect due to the movement of soil material from upper hillslope positions. Electrical conductivity, exchangeable calcium and potassium contents decreased downslope due to higher moisture accumulation. However, no obvious relationship was found between the variation of pH or \{EC\} in one hand and the variation of steepness and curvature on the other. Potassium content was variable due to its greater mobility. The analyses indicated that variation in the soil \{CEC\} is governed by two factors: the leaching pattern, which is controlled by hillslope position, and the accumulation of Eolian carbonates at the soil surface. The distribution of iron oxides and types of clay minerals indicated more weathering in a descending direction and with soil depth, which is attributed to higher availability of soil moisture along the same direction. These relationships suggested systematic variation of chemical properties along toposequences in this arid environment. "

During the first two growing seasons in 2003–2004, the tree stands consisting of Elaeagnus angustifolia L., Populus euphratica Oliv., and Ulmus pumila L. were irrigated with 80 mm year−1, and, in 2005, were left to rely on the shallow (0.9–2.0 m deep) groundwater with a salinity of 1–5 dS m−1. Soil salinity increased but remained within the range of moderate-to-strong (4–14 dS m−1) during the three years. In the course of the growing season, plantations transpired 0.1–7 mm day−1 in 2003 and 1–13 mm day−1 in 2004–2005, as determined with the Penman–Monteith model. In the absence of irrigation, the annual stand transpiration averaged 1250, 1030, and 670 mm for E. angustifolia, P. euphratica and U. pumila, respectively. In 2005, the leaf area index of E. angustifolia ranged from 5 to 10, surpassing that of the other two species more than two-fold. Differences in canopy conductance and transpiration were significant among the tree species and the decoupling coefficient at no time exceeded 0.3, indicating strong physiological control of transpiration. The vigorous juvenile growth and high transpiration under deficit irrigation and after irrigation was terminated, suggested that afforestation with well-adapted tree species is a viable land use option for degraded cropland. The plantation responses to increasing soil salinity must be monitored to determine potential leaching demands in the long run. "

Thirty-one isolates of the 221 recovered were examined at 20, 25, 30, and 35 °C for 20 days for growth and sporulation. Growth and sporulation were generally highest at 25 °C. None of the isolates grew at 35 °C, and at 30 °C growth was retarded with no conidia being produced. Single- and multiple-concentration bioassays were conducted on greenhouse-grown wheat plants and in pine litter to evaluate virulence of fungi from several sources to E. integriceps. When tested at a single concentration, mortality after 15 days ranged from 66 to &gt;95% in the litter assays and 50 to 91% in the plant assays. There was a distinct concentration response for most of the isolates tested in the multiple-concentration assay, particularly in the in-litter environment. In litter, mortality tended to develop earlier than in on-plant assays. Several isolates of B. bassiana and one Metarhizium anisopliae displayed consistently high virulence against E. integriceps and were more virulent than two commercial strains.

abstract = "The objective of this paper is to determine spectral bands that are best suited for characterizing agricultural crop biophysical variables. The data for this study comes from ground-level hyperspectral reflectance measurements of cotton, potato, soybeans, corn, and sunflower. Reflectance was measured in 490 discrete narrow bands between 350 and 1,050 nm. Observed crop characteristics included wet biomass, leaf area index, plant height, and (for cotton only) yield. Three types of hyperspectral predictors were tested: optimum multiple narrow band reflectance (OMNBR), narrow band normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) involving all possible two-band combinations of 490 channels, and the soil-adjusted vegetation indices. A critical problem with \{OMNBR\} models was that of “over fitting” (i.e., using more spectral channels than experimental samples to obtain a highly maximum \{R2\} value). This problem was addressed by comparing the \{R2\} values of crop variables with the \{R2\} values computed for random data of a large sample size. The combinations of two to four narrow bands in \{OMNBR\} models explained most (64% to 92%) of the variability in crop biophysical variables. The second part of the paper describes a rigorous search procedure to identify the best narrow band \{NDVI\} predictors of crop biophysical variables. Special narrow band lambda (λ1) versus lambda (λ2) plots of \{R2\} values illustrate the most effective wavelength combinations (λ1 and λ2) and bandwidths (Δλ1 and Δλ2) for predicting the biophysical quantities of each crop. The best of these two-band indices were further tested to see if soil adjustment or nonlinear fitting could improve their predictive accuracy. The best of the narrow band \{NDVI\} models explained 64% to 88% variability in different crop biophysical variables. A strong relationship with crop characteristics is located in specific narrow bands in the longer wavelength portion of the red (650 nm to 700 nm), with secondary clusters in the shorter wavelength portion of green (500 nm to 550 nm), in one particular section of the near-infrared (900 nm to 940 nm), and in the moisture sensitive near-infrared (centered at 982 nm). This study recommends a 12 narrow band sensor, in the 350 nm to 1,050 nm range of the spectrum, for optimum estimation of agricultural crop biophysical information. "

Agronomic and physiological traits associated with drought tolerance are suitable indicators for selection of drought tolerance genotypes to reduce the impact of water deficit on crop yield in breeding program. The objective of this study was to identify indicators related to drought tolerance through analysis of photosynthetic traits in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). These traits included chlorophyll content, initial fluorescence (F0), maximum primary yield of photochemistry of photosystem \{II\} (Fv/Fo) and maximum quantum yield of photosystem \{II\} (Fv/Fm). Four genotypes (Tadmor, Arta, Morocco9-75 and WI2291) variable in drought tolerance were used to investigate the correlation between these traits and drought tolerance. The results reflected that all of these traits were affected negatively in the four genotypes at different levels of post-anthesis drought stress, but the decrease in drought tolerant genotypes was much less than that of drought sensitive genotypes. The results further revealed that the components of the photosynthetic apparatus could be damaged significantly in drought sensitive genotypes, while drought tolerant genotypes were relatively less affected. On the other hand, the values of chlorophyll content, Fo, Fv/Fo and Fv/Fm in drought tolerance genotypes were significantly higher than those in drought sensitive genotypes under drought stress. It was concluded that chlorophyll content, Fo, Fv/Fo and Fv/Fm could be considered as reliable indicators in screening barley germplasm for drought tolerance. "

The demand for wheat has been increasing tremendously with the increasing population. The production of wheat globally has increased dramatically from 218.5 million tons in 1961 to 732 million tons in 2013 mainly due to the adoption of semidwarf high-yielding and input-responsive wheat varieties. Wheat genetic resources have played a significant role in wheat improvement by contributing important sources of genes for yield potential, broad adaptation, short plant height, improved grain quality, and resistance/tolerance to major abiotic and biotic stresses. In view of the threat of genetic erosion associated with many natural and anthropogenic factors including climate change and the rapid expansion and domination of mega wheat cultivars across the major wheat agroecologies, efforts have been made to collect and conserve wheat genetic resources ex situ in genebanks. To date more than 900,000 wheat accessions (wild relatives, land races, synthetic wheats, breeding lines, and genetic stocks) are conserved in different genebanks at the global level. Management and utilization of such huge but important genetic resources, however, is a big challenge. Application of modern tools and strategies, such as Focused Identification of Germplasm Strategy, effective gene introgression methods, and genomics, are essential in improving genetic resource utilization and improving breeding efficiency.

Most of the research and development projects in these areas aim at developing alternative technologies to reduce land degradation and favour sustainable economic activities. The ‘spineless cactus-alley cropping system’ is an interesting alternative in the low rainfall areas of North Africa. This system limits land degradation by the use of perennial crops, produces cheap and drought resistant sources of feed, and favours biomass production in the inter spaces. The important question is how to promote the adoption of this technology. A bio-economic model has been developed to identify the conditions of development of the ‘spineless cactus-alley cropping system’ in an agro-pastoral community of Central Tunisia. Scenarios relating to different types of institutional support, either monetary or informational, were analysed. The results revealed larger cash flow, more livestock and less cereal cultivation on marginal land. Adoption of the technology is clearly favoured by public financial support and also largely by transmission of information on the expected yield of the system. The findings suggest that extension services play a crucial role in creating awareness among farmers of the impact of technology in terms of yields and income diversification. "

With improved packages (e.g. high yielding varieties, appropriate seed rates, time of sowing, and use of fertilizers) an average of 31% higher yields of rainfed wheat (Triticum aestivum) were obtained by farmers compared to their traditional practices. The net income under the improved package was about Rs. 70,000/ha (1 US$ = Rs. 72), almost double that under farmers’ current practices. The highest wheat yield of 5102 kg/ha obtained in small plots was 28% higher than for farmers’ current practices; followed by the raised bed yield of 4776 kg/ha. With only 20% extra cost for water used as \{SI\} for small plot sowing with improved practices, there was 47% higher wheat yield and over 60% higher net income obtained compared to farmers’ practices. Similarly, with about 10% additional cost for SI, groundnut (Arachis hypogea) yield and net income increased up to four times compared to farmers’ practices. It may be concluded that, in this environment, much of the yield gap between farmers and research may be closed by adopting simple and low cost integrated packages. "

Groundwater extractions is mainly for the irrigation sector, where more than 40% of the water used for irrigation comes from \{GW\} sources. The objective of this study is to critically review and analyze \{GW\} management instruments adopted in Tunisia during the last four decades. Evaluation of current instruments was based on a set of criteria (the impact of the instrument on increasing water productivity, reducing aquifer withdrawals, acceptability of the instrument and its implementation cost) assessed through interviews with policy makers and experts, in addition to discussions at farmers' focus groups. Results show that regulatory instruments are widely used but weakly enforced, which can explain their limited impact. To be more effective, economic instruments need a better vertical interplay between different stakeholders. Analysis of stakeholders’ participation shows limited awareness by farmers and a lack of collective actions for \{GW\} management at local levels. The alignment of \{GW\} policies to other cross-sectorial policies, the enhancement of the vertical interplay between water users’ associations and local and national water administrations, and the horizontal integration of different water users and managers at the local and regional levels, are among the main recommendations of this study.

Early live body weights, mohair quantity and mohair quality data were collected and genotypes compared after correcting for season, farm and sex of progeny, fitting age as a co-variable. Body weights at birth were higher in crossbreds (2.39 vs. 2.19 kg, P &lt; 0.001) but body weights at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months were similar. Fleece weights at first shearing were much higher in crossbreds (1.16 vs. 0.68 kg, P &lt; 0.001) as well as staple length (19.6 vs. 16.3 cm, P &lt; 0.001).

It was suggested to monitor later life performance of crossbreds and it is concluded that the introduction of Texan Angora bucks improved Tajik goats.

It is an example of success in achieving food policy objectives, but it has also introduced the challenge of groundwater sustainability. This paper examines the trends in groundwater abstraction for irrigation and the effect of government policies, including input subsidies – such as the diesel fuel subsidy and the crop procurement price support. The fuel subsidy is an important driving force in groundwater depletion and over-abstraction. This analysis examines the interaction between policy signals and the use and allocation of water by farmers. The rapid decline in groundwater resources shows the limitations of this agricultural development strategy and questions its sustainability unless policies change and the rate of abstraction is changed so as not exceed the recharge rate.

Within these clusters, the summer isolates from Syria and Turkey were grouped together in three sub-clusters (A3, A4, and B2). Also, principal coordinate analyses (PCA) showed clear separation (62.5%) between summer and winter isolates. These differences in the genetic structure may be explained by the variety of eco-geography over the sampled areas of B. bassiana isolates.

As supplies of good-quality irrigation water are expected to decrease in several regions due to increased municipal–industrial–agricultural competition, available freshwater supplies need to be used more efficiently. In addition, reliance on the use and reuse of saline and/or sodic drainage waters, generated by irrigated agriculture, seems inevitable for irrigation. The same applies to salt-affected soils, which occupy more than 20% of the irrigated lands, and warrant attention for efficient, inexpensive and environmentally acceptable management. Technologically and from a management perspective, a couple of strategies have shown the potential to improve crop production under irrigated agriculture while minimizing the adverse environmental impacts. The first strategy, vegetative bioremediation—a plant-assisted reclamation approach—relies on growing appropriate plant species that can tolerate ambient soil salinity and sodicity levels during reclamation of salt-affected soils. A variety of plant species of agricultural significance have been found to be effective in sustainable reclamation of calcareous and moderately sodic and saline-sodic soils. The second strategy fosters dedicating soils to crop production systems where saline and/or sodic waters predominate and their disposal options are limited. Production systems based on salt-tolerant plant species using drainage waters may be sustainable with the potential of transforming such waters from an environmental burden into an economic asset. Such a strategy would encourage the disposal of drainage waters within the irrigated regions where they are generated rather than exporting these waters to other regions via discharge into main irrigation canals, local streams, or rivers. Being economically and environmentally sustainable, these strategies could be the key to future agricultural and economic growth and social wealth in regions where salt-affected soils exist and/or where saline-sodic drainage waters are generated.

Four statistical methods, including joint regression analysis (JRA), additive mean effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analysis, genotype plus \{GE\} interaction (GGE) biplot analysis, and yield–stability (YSi) statistic were used to evaluate \{GE\} interaction in 20 winter wheat genotypes grown in 24 environments in Iran. The main objective was to evaluate the rank correlations among the four statistical methods in genotype rankings for yield, stability and yield–stability. Three kinds of genotypic ranks (yield ranks, stability ranks, and yield–stability ranks) were determined with each method. The results indicated the presence of \{GE\} interaction, suggesting the need for stability analysis. With respect to yield, the genotype rankings by the \{GGE\} biplot and \{AMMI\} analysis were significantly correlated (P &lt; 0.01). For stability ranking, the rank correlations ranged from 0.53 (GGE–YSi; P &lt; 0.05) to 0.97 (JRA–YSi; P &lt; 0.01). \{AMMI\} distance (AMMID) was highly correlated (P &lt; 0.01) with variance of regression deviation (S2di) in \{JRA\} (r = 0.83) and Shukla stability variance (σ2) in \{YSi\} (r = 0.86), indicating that these stability indices can be used interchangeably. No correlation was found between yield ranks and stability ranks (AMMID, S2di, σ2, and \{GGE\} stability index), indicating that they measure static stability and accordingly could be used if selection is based primarily on stability. For yield–stability, rank correlation coefficients among the statistical methods varied from 0.64 (JRA–YSi; P &lt; 0.01) to 0.89 (AMMI–YSi; P &lt; 0.01), indicating that \{AMMI\} and \{YSi\} were closely associated in the genotype ranking for integrating yield with stability performance.

Pastures were established in 2007 with red fescue (Festuca rubra L.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) and irrigated with 100 (optimum irrigation), 75, 50 or 25% of their full irrigation requirement. Established pastures were grazed rotationally by flocks of weaned lambs between 2008 and 2010. Liveweight gain was approximately 2 kg ha−1 d−1 from the 100 and 75% irrigation treatments. However, lower levels of irrigation caused reductions (P &lt; 0.01) in liveweight gains with animals gaining less than 1 kg ha−1 d−1 in the 25% irrigation treatment. Average total annual animal liveweight production was 498, 445, 380 and 198 kg ha−1 for 100, 75, 50 and 25% irrigation treatments, respectively. The water productivity of the full irrigation treatment per unit of dry matter and meat produced was low, particularly during the summer months, and it increased with deficit irrigation. Deficit irrigation between 50 and 75% of the full requirements during late spring and summer, prior to de-stocking, can provide efficient use of water when water resources are limited. The level of irrigation can be reduced further during the late summer and autumn when stocking rates and the demand for feed or energy from pastures are lower. "

Animals are kept on natural pasture most of the year; feed is only supplemented during winter. Farmers emphasise milk production. Milk products like ghee, Shinglish or Jameed are produced for home consumption and for sale. Major constraints mentioned by farmers are government policies for the conservation of forests, feed shortage and limited access to markets because of bad infrastructure and low market prices for their products.

This paper discusses some of these aspects, mainly relative to on-farm irrigation management including the use of treated wastewater and saline waters. First, the paper proposes some concepts relative to water scarcity, concerning aridity, drought, desertification and water shortage, as well as policies to cope with these water stressed regimes. Conceptual approaches on irrigation performances, water use and water savings are reviewed in a wide perspective. This is followed by a discussion of supply management to cope with water scarcity, giving particular attention to the use of wastewater and low-quality waters, including the respective impacts on health and the environment as water scarcity is requiring that waters of inferior quality be increasingly used for irrigation. The paper then focuses on demand management, starting with aspects relating to the improvement of irrigation methods and the respective performances, mainly the distribution uniformity (DU) as a fundamental tool to reduce the demand for water at the farm level, and to control the negative environmental impacts of over-irrigation, including salt stressed areas. Discussions are supported by recent research results. The suitability of irrigation methods for using treated wastewaters and saline waters is analysed. Supplemental irrigation (SI) and deficit irrigation strategies are also discussed, including limitations on the applicability of related practices. The paper also identifies the need to adopt emerging technologies for water management as well as to develop appropriate methodologies for the analysis of social, economic, and environmental benefits of improved irrigation management.

Under non-saline conditions, both varieties, slightly differing in pre-dawn leaf water potential during the growth period, gave almost the same yield. Salinity had a slight effect on the leaf water potential and the osmotic adjustment. Both were slightly higher for the drought tolerant variety, but much lower in comparison with sugar beet, tomato and lentil. The drought tolerant variety showed an earlier senescence in leaf and dry matter development and flowering which were accelerated by salinity. The drought sensitive variety, however, showed under slightly saline conditions (ECe=2.5 dS/m) from 135 days after sowing onwards a different behaviour by the growth of new leaves and flowers, a delay in senescence, leading to the same yield as under non-saline conditions. Under saline conditions (ECe=3.8 dS/m) the drought sensitive variety showed the same yield reduction of about 70% as the drought tolerant variety. "

Non-conventional water resources, such as saline and/or sodic drainage and groundwater represent complementary supply to narrow the gap between freshwater availability and demand. We carried out a 3-year field study in the Indus Plains of Pakistan to evaluate different irrigation and soil management strategies for using saline-sodic water to grow cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) on a sandy loam soil (ECe = 1.31–1.76 dS m−1, pHs = 8.47–8.61, \{SAR\} = 5.50–7.41, infiltration rate = 0.6–0.8 cm h−1, ρb = 1.56–1.61 Mg m−3). The treatments were: (1) irrigation with freshwater from a nearby canal (FW); (2) irrigation with saline-sodic water (EC = 3.32 dS m−1, \{SAR\} = 16.29, \{SARadj\} = 18.24, \{RSC\} = 5.25 mmolc L−1) (SSW); (3) cyclic use of fresh and saline-sodic water through alternate irrigations (FW − SSW); (4) Soil application of farm manure at 25 Mg ha−1 year−1 and irrigation with saline-sodic water (FM + SSW); and (5) soil application of gypsum equivalent to gypsum requirement of saline-sodic water and irrigation with the same water (G + SSW). The seed yield of first cotton crop was not significantly affected by different treatments. The yields of subsequent wheat and cotton crops were lower in the \{SSW\} than other treatments, indicating negative impacts of saline-sodic water when used in the absence of a soil or irrigation management approach. The treatments using saline-sodic water did increase soil \{ECe\} and \{SAR\} levels, but this increase was only significant in \{SSW\} treatment. Irrigation with saline-sodic water together with amendments significantly increased infiltration rate than \{SSW\} alone, where bulk density was increased. The net benefit was the maximum from \{FW\} − \{SSW\} treatment followed by FW, G + SSW, \{FM\} + \{SSW\} and SSW. "

abstract = "Chickpea is one of the major legume crops grown in the West Asia and North Africa (WANA) region. It has considerable importance as a food, feed and fodder. Traditionally, it is sown in spring as a rainfed crop in the region, which has highly variable and often insufficient rainfall. It is, therefore, largely raised on residual moisture, which results in low and variable yields and discourages farmers from investing inputs in its production. In the early 1990s, a winter-sown chickpea technology was developed that outweighs spring-sown chickpea in terms of productivity, water use efficiency and other traits. Limited supplemental irrigation can, however, play a major role in boosting and stabilizing the productivity of both spring-sown and winter-sown chickpea. Therefore, we investigated the effect of supplemental irrigation and sowing date on yield and water use efficiency in winter-sown chickpea. An experiment was carried out over four cropping seasons (1997–2001) at ICARDA’s main station at Tel Hadya, Aleppo, northern Syria (mean annual rainfall 330 mm). A cold-tolerant chickpea cultivar with improved resistance to ascochyta blight (ILC 3279, released as Ghab 2 in Syria) was grown in rotation with wheat. The experiment included three sowing dates (late November, mid-January, and late February) and four levels of supplemental irrigation (SI): full SI, 2/3 SI, 1/3 SI, and no SI, i.e. rainfed. The plots were replicated three times in a split-plot design, with date of sowing being the main plot treatment. Soil water content was monitored at approximately at 7–14-day intervals using a neutron probe. Crop evapotranspiration was determined for each subplot during each time interval, from sowing to harvest, using the soil-water balance equation. Water use efficiency was determined as the ratio of crop yield per unit area to seasonal evapotranspiration. The results showed that chickpea yield per unit area increases with both earlier sowing and increased SI. However, water use efficiency under supplemental irrigation decreases with earlier sowing, due to the relatively large increase that occurs in the amount of evapotranspiration at early sowing dates. The study’s results indicated that a 2/3 \{SI\} level gives the optimum water use efficiency for chickpea under supplemental irrigation. Under rainfed conditions, however, it was found that sowing chickpea around mid-January resulted in the highest WUE. The analysis also proposed a function, based on regression, which relates winter-sown chickpea yield to water use and which is applicable under both supplemental and rainfed conditions. "

Lentil has a high water-use efficiency, about 2 kg m−3 under non-saline conditions, much higher than legumes such as broadbean and soybean. The crop, however, is much more salt sensitive and can only be grown on non-saline soils. At an \{ECe\} of 2 dS/m, the limit between non-saline and slightly saline soils, the yield reduction is about 20% and at an \{ECe\} of 3 dS/m it is 90–100%.

Knowledge of wheat root depth and the vertical distribution during the winter growing season is needed for sound scheduling of irrigation and efficient use of water. This article reports evaluation of root development for three winter-grown bread (Triticum aestivum L.) and durum (Triticum turgidum L.) wheat under four soil water regimes (rainfed and full irrigation with two intermediate levels of 33 and 66% of full irrigation). Roots were sampled by soil coring to a depth of 0.75 m at four occasions during 2005–2006 growing season. Two distinct phases of root development were identified, a rapid downward penetration from emergence to end tillering phase, followed by a substantial root mass growth along the profile from tillering to mid-stem-elongation phase. Roots were detected as deep as 0.75 m during the initial rapid penetration, yet only 29% of the total seasonal root mass was developed. This downward penetration rate averaged 7 mm d−1 and produced 10.8 kg ha−1 d−1 of root dry-biomass. The bulging of root mass from tillering to mid-stem-elongation coincided with vigorous shoot growth, doubling root dry-biomass at a rate of 52 kg ha−1 d−1, compared to the seasonal root growth rate of 18.3 kg ha−1 d−1. A second-degree equation described the total root dry-biomass as a function of days after emergence (r2 = 0.85), whereas a simpler equation predicted it as a function of cumulative growing degree days (r2 = 0.85). The final grain yield was a strong function of irrigation regimes, varying from 3.0 to 6.5 t ha−1, but showed no correlation with root biomass which remained similar as soil water regimes changed. This observation must be viewed with care as it lacks statistical evidence. Results showed 90% of root mass at first irrigation (15 April) confined in the top 0.60–0.75 m soil in bread wheat. Presence of shallow restricting soil layers limited root depth of durum wheat to 0.45 m, yet total seasonal root mass and grain yield were comparable with non-restricted bread wheat. Most root growth occurred during the cool rainy season and prior to the late irrigation season. The root sampling is short of rigorous, but results complement the limited field data in literature collectively suggesting that irrigation following the rainy season may best be scheduled assuming a well developed root zone as deep as the effective soil depth within the top meter of soil.

Punctuating this landscape are broad, dry basins, or wadis, and gentle landscape depressions that exhibit localized elevated vegetation productivity and unique edaphic and hydrologic properties. Historically, continuous heavy grazing and aggressive agricultural activities resulted in excessive ecological degradation within these sensitive environments. Information is needed to determine the influence of livestock grazing on plant communities in landscape depressions and the impact that this has on ecosystem resilience. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effect of short-term sheep grazing on vegetation characteristics and plant community structure within depressions, and to provide recommendations for improved grazing management. Study plots were randomly located within paired topographic depressions located in northwestern Syria. Vegetation samples were collected along transects including plant biomass, plant density, herbaceous cover, and species diversity. In grazed plots, plant biomass was 49 g DM/m2 compared to 234.4 g DM/m2 in protected plots. Average plant density was 65 plants/m2 in grazed plots compared to 1013 plants/m2 in protected plots (P = 0.001). Herbaceous cover was 175% higher on protected sites compared to grazed plots. Average diversity (Shannon–Wiener index value) was 0.8 in grazed plots compared to 2.3 in protected plots. These results suggest that plant community structure will be impacted from short-term grazing and that a site's ability to positively respond to disturbance over time may be limited. We conclude that carefully planned grazing management should result in greater plant productivity and diversity. "

Given the many factors associated with P behavior in a range of soil environments, there is a need to go beyond site-specific situations. The use of crop simulation models is a valuable tool to evaluate the efficacy of applying P fertilizers under different soil, management and climatic conditions. A computer model was developed to simulate P in the soil–plant system adapted to soils with high P limitations. The soil P module is operated with two comprehensive crop simulation models (CERES and CROPGRO) within the \{DSSAT\} software. The P module comprises inorganic and organic P pools estimated from measured P fractionation data and works on a daily time step. The rate constants for P movement between the pools follow first order kinetics. The P module was calibrated and tested using three data sets from Colombia, Syria, and Tanzania. The limited testing showed that the P module simulated accurately grain yield and P uptake by wheat grown under semi-arid conditions. The wheat crop responded little to fertilization although measured Olsen P was as low as 2.6 mg kg−1. The P module overestimated P uptake for both soybean and bean crops grown in acidic soils, but predicted with a good degree of accuracy labile P in the soil and P uptake for maize grown under the same acidic conditions. Testing with more data sets is needed to improve model predictions. "

Cluster 2 consisted of large migratory flocks (400 head) of sheep and goats in roughly equal numbers. The flocks owned by landless farmers made heavy use of rangelands (&gt; 45% of annual diet). Cluster 3, with medium size (200 head) mixed flocks, made moderate use of rangelands, 30% of annual diet. The results indicated seasonality in production components and low productivity in all three clusters. Supplemental feeding and grazing reflected differences in feed sources used among clusters. Hand-feeding, however, accounted for 85% of diets between December and March. Small ruminant production contributed an average of 70% of farmers' income in all clusters, supplemented by off-farm activities (19%) and crop production (11%). Farmers' perception of the major constraints to sheep and goat productivity were similar among clusters. They include: (1) health problems, namely infective diseases and parasites, and lack of veterinary services, (2) feed availability, in particular expensive feed supplements, (3) poor marketing of animal products. Future research is needed in the following fields: (1) full-screening of all diseases to develop an adequate health program, (2) on-farm feeding trials to optimize feeding systems, (3) range and grazing research to determine proper stocking rates and season of use, (4) bioeconomic analysis and marketing research to asses the future viability of the small ruminant sector.

This happens while the fat tail is known as a criterion of adaptation to harsh conditions and fat-tailed animals are preferred for religious practices. The objectives of this study were to identify hidden reasons for these changes and assess the degree of crossbreeding between the Barbarin sheep and thin tailed breeds. A total of 912 surveys were conducted in three major sheep regions covering the capital (Tunis) and five departments, and including 601 sheep owners, 158 butchers and 153 consumers. The main results showed that even though raising sheep is still as an activity by itself, fattening activities (breeding–fattening or only fattening) are becoming more and more dominant and they represented 75%, 53% and 65% of the sheep activities in the capital Tunis, South East and North West regions, respectively. While breeders and consumers still prefer, in their majority (55–75%), the Barbarin fat tail lambs, butchers tend to favor thin tailed sheep because of the difficulty of selling the fat of the tail that represents up to 15% of the carcass weight. To meet the butchers’ demand, farmers are shifting to thin tail breeds and crosses and in the studied areas, market changes towards thin tailed breeds were dictated by butchers’ and not consumers’ preference. Sensory tests revealed little difference among the three studied genotypes but showed a superiority of the fat tail lambs in tenderness, flavour and smell. "

Ten years after the experiment started in 1983–1984, soil samples (0–20 cm) from the wheat–vetch, wheat–fentil, wheat–heat and wheat–chickpea rotations all contained similar quantities of organic C and microbial biomass C. The soil under the wheat–medic rotation had gained organic C and biomass C, compared with the wheat–wheat `rotation', whereas both organic C and biomass C had fallen in the wheat–fallow `rotation', although of all these differences, only the wheat–medic gain was significant (p=0.05).

An updated version (ROTHC-26.5) of the Rothamsted model for the turnover of organic matter in soil was used to simulate these measurements. Using ROTHC-26.5, the calculated annual inputs of plant C (in roots, stubble, root exudates, etc.) to the soil, averaged over the 2 years of each rotation, were: wheat–vetch, 0.87, wheat–lentil, 0.71, wheat–wheat, 0.71, wheat–chickpea, 0.75, wheat–fallow, 0.45, wheat–medic, 1.20 t C ha−1 year−1. The modelled turnover time of soil organic C (excluding inert organic C) in the wheat–wheat rotation was 19.2 years. The response to a change in management is slow in these Syrian soils: ROTHC-26.5 predicts that it will take 67 years for the soil under the wheat–medic rotation to move half-way to its final equilibrium value. Microbial biomass measurements were simulated to within experimental error. "

An experiment was established to investigate the productivity and N capturing abilities of barley (Hordeum vulgare cv. Cowboy) and oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus L.) crops seeded after a grazed green manure. Green manure was a mix of forage pea (Pisum sativum cv. 40–10), soybean (Gylcine max cv. Prudence) and oat (Avena sativa cv. Legget). The experiment was repeated twice in Carman, Manitoba in 2010 and 2011. Catch crops were seeded in late summer either no-till or after soil cultivation of the grazed plots. Wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Waskada) was seeded in the second year as a test crop for both experiments. Catch crop productivity and N uptake was influenced by season (greater in the wetter year) and catch crop type (barley and radish produced 1990 and 1490 kg ha−1, respectively) but not tillage system. The catch crops had their greatest overall effect on soil NO3-N content in 2010 under conditions of high autumn precipitation when N leaching was more severe. Here, the catch crops significantly reduced NO3-N at all depths. Under drier conditions in 2011, catch crops only reduced NO3-N in the top 30 cm. There was average 57 and 12 kg ha−1 more soil NO3-N in plots with no catch crops than plots where catch crops were grown in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Wheat N uptake at maturity was reduced around 25% when grown after catch crops. Similarly, wheat grain yield was 12–31% less after catch crops than no catch crops. This study showed that catch crops can be used to capture excess nutrients after grazing, but N release from the selected catch crops in the following year was not in synchrony with the wheat N demand.

Two experimental trials were conducted on Awassi milking ewes to evaluate nonconventional and balanced low-cost diets against the traditional unbalanced diet used by farmers (control) on the total yields (milk, fat, protein, and total solids) and milk composition (fat, protein, total solids, and lactose), an important indicator of milk quality. The first trial was conducted at the research station of the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA, Aleppo, Syria) to test 6 low-cost balanced diets using locally available feeds and agro byproducts against the control diet. Each diet was tested on 8 ewes that were kept on pasture as a basal diet, but received different supplements, including barley, wheat bran and nonconventional feeds (urea-treated wheat straw, molasses, sugar beet pulp, and cotton seed cake). Five balanced diets enhanced the total yields of milk, fat, protein, and total solids, in 2 cases, significantly. These diets increased total milk yield by 17.7 to 50.2% and decreased supplement feeding costs by 43% compared with the control. However, milk composition remained unaffected. The second trial was conducted on 3 different farms in northern Syria to assess in each farm a low-cost balanced diet on milking ewes (n = 15) in comparison to the farmer's control (n = 15). The balanced diet was a modification requested by farmers of the best performing diet in the on-station trial. Confirming the first trial's research results, the balanced diet outperformed the control in total yields; for instance, it increased total milk yield by 28 to 40% and raised net income by 30%, without affecting milk composition. Both trials showed that using locally available nonconventional feedstuffs, such as molasses, integrated into balanced dairy sheep diets can decrease feed costs of resource-poor farmers, while enhancing total yields of milk and milk constituents without compromising milk quality components. This will greatly improve the profitability of dairy sheep production in dry areas. "

Using agricultural by-products and treated straw or vetch grazing for supplementing sheep diets would provide resource-poor dairy farmers with increased options to reduce feed costs, but the effects of such feeds on the quality of yogurt (the main product) need to be better understood. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate these effects. The first trial evaluated alternative diets using locally available feedstuffs, including agricultural by-products, compared with traditional diets used by dairy sheep farmers, and was conducted on-station at the International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA, Tel Hadya, Aleppo, Syria). Milking Awassi ewes (n = 56) were used to test 6 alternative diets against a traditional control diet containing barley, wheat bran, and barley straw. The 6 alternative diets contained 4 or more of the following ingredients: barley, sugar beet pulp, molasses, cotton seed cake, wheat bran, urea-treated wheat straw, and barley straw. Ewes on one of the alternative diets grazed vetch pasture, whereas ewes on the control diet and the 5 alternative diets grazed native range pasture. The milk fat content was higher in diets containing urea-treated straw. Yogurt firmness and adhesiveness were significantly lower in energy-rich diets (e.g., the control diet) and in the diets rich in soluble sugar (molasses). The effects of diet on yogurt color and on citric and succinic acid contents were significant. A yogurt produced from the milk of the group grazing on vetch was the most yellowish in color, which is appealing to Syrian consumers. The content of citric acid tended to be higher in yogurts produced from diets containing molasses. The second trial was conducted on 3 farms in northern Syria to assess an alternative diet (1 of the 6 tested in the first trial) on 15 milking ewes compared with the farmer's traditional diet (control). The alternative diet increased yogurt firmness and adhesiveness by 7 to 9% and 10 to 16%, respectively. The use of nonconventional feeds available in the region enhances yogurt quality, may reduce requirements for expensive grains, and thus, increase farmers’ livelihoods by targeting expanding markets with better quality products.

Field experiments were conducted for 5 years under Mediterranean rainfed conditions at a site with moderate soil mineral N levels in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley (513 mm long-term, annual precipitation). In the first series of experiments, there were four N application rates: 0, 40, 80 and 120 kg ha−1, with three or six replicates. Seed and straw yield, leaf chlorophyll, shoot and seed N content and other agronomic characters were measured. In the second experiment, there were two N application rates: 0 and 40 kg ha−1. No significant response to N application was detected, except for N concentration in the lower part of the shoot at maturity in 2001–2002; in that season, a total of 125 kg ha−1 N was removed by the crop from the control which had no added N, suggesting that safflower is an efficient user of carryover N from prior cropping. Growing safflower after a fertilized crop may remove N from the lower part of the soil profile and thus reduce the possibility of this accumulated N eventually reaching the ground water. Cropping with safflower in rotation with other crops may have environmental benefits as well as saving on the costs of N fertilizers. The study supports the wider adoption of safflower in Mediterranean dryland cropping systems. "

The policy makers are insufficiently informed about the bottlenecks in the different livestock production units and base their policies mainly on general knowledge. This study analyzed the two major cattle farm types in the Khorezm province, 56 medium-scale farms (LS; on average 22 ha) and 80 household farms (HH; on average 0.2 ha). While \{LS\} farms produced more metabolizable energy and crude protein than required by their own ruminant livestock, the feeds produced by \{HH\} farms covered only a third of the requirements. Despite their limited farm size, the \{HH\} farmers took an active part in the commercial farming sector, for example, through the purchase of inputs for cattle and crop production, and product sales. The \{HH\} farms generated higher relative crop yields than their \{LS\} counterparts, while cattle productivity of both was comparable, albeit low. The present findings can be considered as a benchmark for monitoring developments in the cattle sector and as a source of information for directing improvements in feed supply, cattle health and husbandry.

These locations represent 23 agricultural irrigation areas in tropical, arid and temperate climates. The aims of this paper are to: compare the effects of different methods of estimating Clear-sky-radiation—(Rso); compare sum-of-hourly and daily ET0; compare the results of aggregation of hourly \{ET0\} over 24 h compared with daylight hours; and examine the impact of seasonality and climate type. At selected \{AWS\} locations, the hourly \{ET0\} was calculated using the hourly FAO-PM and the ASCE-PM equations and then summed to derive daily \{ET0\} (reported as ET0,soh). This was compared against the daily \{ET0\} values, calculated using the corresponding daily equation (reported as ET0,daily). Using Rso calculated following the “complex” approach improves the agreement between ET0,soh and ET0,daily of both hourly equations, compared with the “simple” approach. Better agreement between ET0,soh and ET0,daily estimates for the FAO-PM and ASCE-PM were found, when the hourly values are aggregated over 24 h rather than over daylight hours. The average ratio between ET0,soh and ET0,daily for the FAO-PM and ASCE-PM equations is 0.95 and 1.00, respectively. The range of the former is 0.90–0.98 and that of the latter is 0.96–1.04. There was very strong correlation between the two hourly equations at the daily time step: on average 0.997, with a range of 0.993–0.998. The results imply that the ASCE-PM hourly equation's daily \{ET0\} values are higher than those of FAO-PM, which can be explained by the difference in the treatment of surface resistances. Better agreements between ET0,soh and ET0,daily values for winter, spring and autumn were found for the FAO-PM version, while during summer, the ASCE-PM version showed better agreement. The best agreement between the hourly and daily results for the FAO-PM version was found in temperate climates and the ASCE-PM version showed best agreement in the tropical and arid climates. "

Host plant resistance is found to be the most effective and economic method of broomrape control. Efforts made at the International Center for Agriculture Research in the Dry Areas over many years to develop advanced breeding lines with acceptable resistance and tolerance levels to broomrape have resulted in the identification of several useful breeding lines. These lines were shared with National Agricultural Research Systems (Egypt, Sudan, Tunisia and Portugal) as part of the Faba Bean Orobanche International Nursery, in order to test their stability across three seasons (2005, 2006 and 2007). The results showed that Orobanche plant number, dry weight, Orobanche index, flowering date, maturing date and grain yield were significantly different among lines and locations. \{AMMI\} analysis showed that some lines derived from hybrid bulk populations “HBP/DS0/2000” and “HBP/ES0/2000” showed acceptable levels of yield stability in the presence of Orobanche infections across all environments compared with susceptible check. In highly infested soils, the tolerant and resistant lines gave acceptable levels of yield compared with the susceptible check. However, the yield potential of resistant and tolerant lines in non-infested soils was lower than the highly susceptible check. "

In contrast, M. truncatula was poorly nodulated by the indigenous strains, and nodulation and total \{N2\} fixed in this species were enhanced by inoculation with either \{WSM244\} or CC169. While seeding density did not generally influence %N2 fixed, it had a highly significant effect on total \{N2\} fixed, through the indirect effect of higher seeding rates increasing the dry matter and total N yields.

The larger size of 1Sl coded HMW-GSs sequenced from \{DAL1Sl\} and their phylogenetic similarity to the D-genome-coded subunits were suspected to be one of the major reasons for the increased dough strength of DAL1Sl. To transfer the chromosome 1Sl genes responsible for the good bread-making quality to wheat, we generated a chromosome-specific disomic substitution line [DSL1Sl(1A)] by crossing \{DAL1Sl\} with nulli 1A tetra 1B genetic stock and further selection. Grain quality analysis revealed significantly lower grain hardness and significantly higher dough strength, farinograph development time, stability time, gluten index, bread loaf volume, and bread quality score in DSL1Sl(1A), compared with wheat. However, the increased bread loaf volume and quality were not proportional to the relatively higher increases in dough strength and gluten index, indicating importance of other traits influencing bread making quality.

Despite the availability of technologies to control broomrapes in economically important crops, Orobanche infestation continues to increase, threatening the livelihoods of millions of farmers. Many of the technologies developed have not been effectively disseminated and there has been little or zero adoption by farmers—who continue to use ineffective management practices that exacerbate the problem. The adaptation and dissemination of appropriate management practices are major priorities in broomrape control. However, such work must take into consideration the specific socio-economic characteristics of individual farming systems. Orobanche is a community threat and effective management requires a community-based integrated management approach. Recognizing the central role of farmers in parasitic weed management, a technical cooperation project (TCP) involving FAO, \{ICARDA\} and seven countries in the Near East and North Africa (NENA) region was implemented to improve the dissemination of knowledge and skills by using a farmer field school approach: a form of education that uses experiential learning methods to build farmers’ expertise. This paper reviews conventional Orobanche research and development approaches, and highlights weaknesses in the management of the parasitic weed using these approaches as opposed to participatory approaches. The benefits and challenges of participatory farming system approaches in relation to integrated broomrape management (IBM) are also discussed. Lessons learned from achieving community ownership of, and institutional support for, \{IBM\} could be applied to other sectors (e.g. public health) in which there is a need for institutional learning and reform.

In recent years, resource conservation technologies (RCTs) like zero-tillage (ZT) and bed-planting are being promoted in the rice–wheat cropping systems of South Asia to address these concerns. However, weed control is a serious challenge in non-puddled, direct-seeded ZT/bed-planted rice. In the absence of weed control, rice yields are reduced by 35–100% in direct-seeded/RCTs systems. Herbicide-resistant rice (HR-rice) may facilitate adoption of \{RCTs\} by improving weed management options. The three major direct benefits of introducing HR-rice are to: (1) improve control of weeds specifically associated with rice, e.g. weedy Oryza species; (2) substitute currently used herbicides with new ones that are more efficient and that have better environmental profiles; and (3) provide new tools for managing weeds that have already developed resistance to current herbicides. In this paper, we discuss the current issues associated with the rice–wheat systems of India and role of HR-rice in addressing weed management constraints of direct-seeded rice. Direct-seeded ZT/bed-planted rice will save water, labor cost and drudgery involved in transplanting. Other potential benefits include improvement in soil health, timely sowing of wheat, and reduction in greenhouse gases. "

However, several important risks associated with \{HR\} rice should be examined before its widespread adoption is encouraged. The greatest risk in the commercialization of \{HR\} crops is the potential for transfer of the gene conferring the \{HR\} trait to related wild and weedy relatives. This could lead to increased weediness or invasiveness. Gene transfer between cultivated and wild or weedy rice is known to occur and existing scientific literature confirms that \{HR\} genes can move from \{HR\} rice to wild and weedy relatives forming hybrids. The likelihood of such gene transfer is especially high in India, where cultivated rice and its relatives are sympatrically distributed and their flowering times overlap. Such gene flow can impact crop invasiveness, fitness of wild species, and the loss of native biodiversity. Additionally, \{HR\} rice may contribute to the problems of crop volunteers and evolution of herbicide resistance. Based on existing scientific literature, it appears that these risks are low, but that additional studies are needed to fully assess the potential adverse consequences of widespread adoption of \{HR\} rice in India.

Farmers and land resource professionals assess the options that optimise the productivity and sustainable land use through different knowledge systems. Both systems have advantages and drawbacks. Through a case study in a village of northwestern Syria, an approach was developed to integrate the knowledge of both farmers and land resource experts in order to promote adoption of new land use systems. This was done by comparing a farmer-led land suitability assessment (FLSA) with the results of an expert-led land suitability assessment (ELSA) so as to evaluate respective comparative advantages and complementarities. The results of \{FLSA\} and \{ELSA\} were integrated in a geographical information system (GIS). The farmers compared the results of \{FLSA\} and \{ELSA\} and their input \{ELSA\} was upgraded to suit local circumstances. Some striking differences came out between \{FLSA\} and ELSA, which could be explained by a participatory land evaluation. The farmers’ knowledge provided a better understanding of the impact of microclimatic variations on crop productivity. This is an important bonus of the participatory approach because detailed climatic data for long periods are rarely available in most rural communities. The \{FLSA\} procedure explained adequately the overriding weight of socio-economic constraints over biophysical opportunities. A constraint in the participatory approach is that useful and interesting indigenous knowledge is often scarce. \{GIS\} was instrumental in the correlation of indigenous and expert land units and in the farmers’ validation of land suitability. The benefits of this approach to the researchers were clear. The farmers on the other hand highly appreciated the improved communication with the scientists. The better interaction with the farmers will eventually pay off when it comes to adoption of improved management recommendations. "

This hypothesis is analysed using specific experiments on salt-sensitive (chickpea and broad bean) and salt-tolerant (durum wheat and barley) species. For each of the four crops, two varieties that displayed a clear difference in yield production under a saline environment were subjected to two types of analysis. The first type of analysis was used to classify the salt-tolerance of different varieties using two criteria as follows: (1) the relationship between yield and soil salinity; (2) the water use efficiency. The second type of analysis determined the emergence rate as a function of the irrigation-water salinity. The criteria that were used in the current study for classifying the varietal salt-tolerance of each crop provided similar conclusions. However, the hypothesis that the emergence rate was associated with the varietal potential for salt-tolerance was not confirmed by the results of this analysis. On the contrary, the results demonstrated that some varieties combined poor emergence with a high crop salt-tolerance. These varieties included \{ILC\} 3279 of the chickpea and Cham-1 of the durum wheat.

The two levels of plant water status were obtained by supplying irrigation when the pre-dawn leaf water potential of the control treatments attained values of −0.3 and −0.6 MPa. The experiment was designed to analyse the effects of soil salinity, the effects of drought (detected by the level of the plant water status), and the combined effect of salinity and drought on the plant–water relationships, nitrogen balance and crop productivity (for both grain and straw). Soil salinity levels equal to or higher than 6.5 dS m−1 affected the plants by reducing the grain number but not the straw weight. Drought at flowering, early podding and grain-filling stages reduced both grain and straw yields. Moreover, yield reductions were associated with increasing soil salinity levels, confirming an interaction between the salinity and drought effects on faba bean productivity. Symbiotic nitrogen fixation, as evaluated by the nitrogen balance, was more affected by drought than by salinity, and it may explain the absence of any observed effects of salinity under drought conditions. The comparison of these results with those obtained in similar experiments on wheat and barley revealed that these cereals and faba bean have contrasting behaviours under saline-drought conditions.

Breeding for resistance is the only feasible approach to abate its effects. Nine major Hessian fly-resistance genes have been identified in bread wheat. Two bread wheat varieties have these characteristics; the first variety with complete resistance was `Saada', released to farmers in 1989, whereas a tolerant variety `Massira' was released in 1994. Another widespread limiting factor for all cereals in Morocco is lack of adequate nitrogen (N). With favorable farmer acceptance, Saada became the focus of on-farm N fertilizer trials throughout the low rainfall (250–450 mm year−1) zone, where it consistently out-yielded the susceptible common bread wheat, Nesma, except when no Hessian fly infestation occurred. In most cases, 40 kg N ha−1 was adequate for maximum yield. Substituting resistant cultivars for Hessian fly-susceptible cultivars and increased N use could have an immediate and positive effect on wheat production in Morocco, especially in areas where the insect is endemic. The future impact will be greater when Hessian fly resistance is also transferred to other bread wheat cultivars and to durum (T. durum) wheat, the major staple food in the Mediterranean region. "

These viruses do not have the same ecology and consequently require a variety of different preventive measures to control them. Some of these viruses have a narrow host range, such as Faba bean necrotic yellows virus (FBNYV), and others, such as Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), a very wide host range. Such features are important when identifying sources of virus inoculum in a region, and the vectors can transmit viruses from natural reservoirs to the crop plants. Some of these viruses are seed borne and, consequently, can be disseminated long distances through infected seeds. Crop losses caused by these viruses are variable, depending on the sensitivity and susceptibility of the crop to infection. Host resistance genes have been identified for some of these viruses, but in others, such as FBNYV, no resistance genes in faba bean have been identified yet. Significant progress was made in developing precise methods for the identification of these viruses, and new virus problems are being identified every year. This chapter is not intended to be a review for pea, bean, and faba bean viruses, but rather focuses on the major viruses which affect these crops in the Mediterranean basin with focus on the progress made over the past two decades.

In this paper, we report on nitrogen fertilizer-use efficiency (NFUE) by wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under 1/3, 2/3 and full irrigation with 15N-labeled fertilizer at different application rates (0, 50, 100 and 150 kg N ha−1) for two seasons with varying rainfall, i.e. 323 and 275 mm. \{NFUE\} values in the above-ground crop varied with measurement date, reaching a maximum before anthesis, and then, during the grain-filling period, either remaining constant under irrigation or decreasing, particularly under the rain-fed conditions. Irrigation increased the recovery of applied N in grain and straw at harvest from 10% in the wetter year to over 60% in the drier year. Nitrogen at 100 kg ha−1 level increased recovery by &gt;45% in the wetter year, while fertilizer recovery improved in the drier year only with enhanced water availability from irrigation. The Difference method (28–95%) for estimating N recovery diverged from the 15N Direct method (21–63%), emphasizing the need to examine both labeled, and unlabeled, N pools for interpretation of 15N studies. With irrigation, the crop removed significantly more fertilizer N than under rain-fed conditions, with less remaining in the soil; over 40% of the fertilizer N remained in the top 20-cm soil as organic N. Irrigation had no effect on the 15N recovery at depth, with no significant re-mineralization being detected. While \{NFUE\} is increased by higher rainfall and irrigation, fertilizer N losses under the Mediterranean climatic conditions of Syria are low. The apparent inefficiency induced by organic immobilization adds to total soil N, which can potentially be used by future crops. "

In addition to natural rainfall, supplemental irrigation at various rates (1/3, 2/3 and full irrigation) was also considered in assessing these parameters and their interactive effects. Grain yield and dry matter accumulation and N uptake varied between years, mainly due to rainfall and sowing date. Yields were increased by irrigation and N fertilization, with a greater response to N in 1991/1992 and to irrigation in the relatively drier 1992/1993 season. Most fertilizer N was taken up from tillering to anthesis; then it either stabilized or slightly declined, while soil N contributed further to plant N uptake. Compared to rain-fed conditions, more soil and fertilizer N was utilized by the irrigated crop, particularly in 1992/1993. In both years, grain N represented 60% of N accumulated at anthesis under rain-fed conditions, compared to 80% under irrigation. Fertilization and irrigation increased water-use efficiency, particularly under drier conditions. Thus, supplemental irrigation, applied at a sensitive growth stage, would be a valuable management practice for improving yield, water-use efficiency and crop N uptake under the dry conditions of a Mediterranean climate. Given the potential of both irrigation and N to increase output in dry areas, the amounts of both inputs are dictated by rainfall in any one year. "

Each accession was inoculated with Sinorhizobium strains appropriate for nodulation under low temperature (Sinorhizobium meliloti strain \{M620\} with accession A, strain \{M508\} with B and strain \{BZI\} with R). The percentage of nitrogen in the shoots derived from atmosphere was quantified using 15N dilution technique with barley as reference plant. Results demonstrated that responses of accessions depend on temperature, nitrogen and inoculated strain. Among the accessions tested, M. aculeata 5099 was more adapted to temperature and grew faster than the others at the lowest temperature. Strain \{M53\} performed better with M. rigidula 716 than with M. aculeata 80 and strain \{M620\} with M. aculeata 5099 than with M. aculeata 80 for yield and N nutrition of plants. \{M508\} for M. aculeata 5099 and \{BZI\} for M. rigidula 716 leaded to more N fixed per plant. Nitrogen fixation in inoculated treatment of accession M. aculeata × \{M508\} accounted for 88 and 78% of total plant N at 9 and 7 °C versus 49 and 51% for accession M. rigidula × M53. It was concluded that the selection of associations medics × Sinorhizobium is a promising way to improve yield and \{N2\} fixation at low temperature in areas where N fertilization cannot be possible.

Finding proper associations of medic-Rhizobium, capable to grow and fix nitrogen at low temperature, is necessary to extend the grazing period. In this paper, we studied the performance of three Medicago cultivars: M. aculeata accessions 80 (A) and 5099 (B) and M. rigidula accession 716 (R), grown in the field with three different nitrogen sources. The first treatment (N) was obtained through fertilization, while the second (I) was ensured by inoculation with different strains of Rhizobium meliloti (M620, \{M508\} and BZI). A third treatment (C) was used as a control, neither inoculated nor fertilized. The trial was repeated for 2 consecutive years (1998 and 1999) at \{ICARDA\} research station (Aleppo, Syria). Plant development, dry matter production and nodule initiation were investigated. The percentage of fixation-derived shoot nitrogen was also quantified using 15N dilution technique. Our results indicate a genotypic variation in low-temperature tolerance of annual medics. Accession A had a slow growth pattern with low dry matter production compared with B and R over the two seasons. In the two seasons and at the early growth stages, Rhizobium strain played a key role in plant growth, where both inoculated and fertilized plants of accession R had a comparable dry matter. Furthermore, the proportion of nitrogen derived from fixation in A was very low, which was reflected, in turn, on the total amount of fixed nitrogen. The proportion of fixed nitrogen of the association R-BZI was high for the 2 years, where it reached 72 and 87% of the total N in the plant, respectively. It is suggested that associations differed in their response to low winter temperature. Among those we studied, M. rigidula accession 716, inoculated with the strain BZI, proved to be the most adapted association to our environment. In addition, M. aculeata accession 5099 seems to be promising for winter growth, but it needs to be inoculated with a strain more adapted to low temperature. "

The model was adapted for durum wheat and landrace characteris tics, and for improvement of crop performance under water shortage at the end of the growing season. The availability of moisture and nitrogen interacted. At very low rainfall, moisture availability was the growth limiting factor, whereas at higher levels of moisture availability, nitrogen recovery and total dry matter production increased, and nitrogen availability became an additional growth-limiting factor. Grain nitrogen concentration was related inversely to harvest index and grain yield. The lowest observed straw nitrogen concentration was 0.0019 kg kg−1. Responses to environmental differences among seasons and locations were reproduced fairly well, and grain yield was predicted well in most circumstances. Despite shortcomings, the model presented a comprehensible tool to increase insight into plant growth processes. A crop growth simulation model can be applied in the preliminary evaluation of plant genetic resources, aimed at acquiring broad knowledge over diverse environments. "

Assessment was made of grain, straw and total biomass yield and crop P uptake and available P (Olsen). While crop responses varied due to seasonal rainfall fluctuations, they tended to decrease with increasing initial available soil P levels (2.7, 6.2, and 4.4 mg kg−1 for Breda, Tel Hadya and Jindiress, respectively). Residual P was not significant for cereals or legumes at any site, but direct P was significant for both crops at Breda and Jindiress, as well as for legumes at Tel Hadya. In contrast, residual and direct P significantly influenced Olsen-P and seasonal and total P uptake. With no P fertilizer, or where minimal amounts (15 kg \{P2O5\} ha−1) were applied annually, the balance between applied P and crop P offtake became increasingly negative; after 8 years without applied P, the P balance was −54, −38, −27, −17, and +7 kg ha−1 for the initial (residual) P application of 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 kg P205, respectively. This was counterbalanced by the higher annual application rates and to a lesser extent the amounts of P applied initially. The study demonstrated the highly variable nature of crop responses to fertilizer P under semi-arid field conditions over several years, with soil moisture from seasonal rainfall being the dominant influence on overall yields. While crop responses may not occur in any given year, especially if available P is near or above critical threshold levels, dryland cropping without P fertilizer is unsustainable in the long run. "

Forages from different woody plants and straw were tested in lactating sheep either in Syria (Exp. 1; Awassi sheep) or in Switzerland (Exp. 2; East Friesian Dairy sheep). Artemisia herba-alba, Atriplex leucoclada, Haloxylon articulatum, Noaea mucronata, and Salsola vermiculata were used in Exp. 1. The three most preferred plants (A. leucoclada, H. articulatum and S. vermiculata) were tested again in Exp. 2 together with Betula pendula, Castanea sativa and Juglans regia. Both experiments started with a binary choice test where one plant and barley straw were offered separately for 4 h in the morning to six sheep (test period) in a random sequence in consecutive 7-day sub-periods. A control group (n = 6 per experiment) received only straw in the test period. For the rest of the day, a basal diet composed of straw ad libitum and concentrate was offered. After the binary choice test, two 2-week periods followed, where in the first straw only and in the second all test plants were offered to all animals from both groups to ascertain equal familiarisation with all plants. For the following 7-day multiple choice test animals were allocated to two new groups. The ‘multiple choice’ group could choose among all test plants and straw during the 4-h test period, the ‘control’ group received only the basal diet. Intakes of test feeds during 4 h and 24 h as well as feeding behaviour during the first 30 min were recorded. Additionally, nutrient intake was determined. Total daily test feed intake was always higher in the choice groups, but this was more pronounced in the multiple choice situation (Exp. 1: 30 and 48, Exp. 2: 49 and 74 g dry matter/kg live-weight0.75 with ‘control’ and ‘multiple choice’, respectively). A. leucoclada (Exp. 1; proportionately 0.73 of total test plant intake) and B. pendula (Exp. 2; 0.87) were the preferred plants in the multiple choice test and also with binary choice. Most other feeds were only consumed in low amounts in the binary and even less in multiple choice situations. In conclusion, giving sheep the choice among low quality forages seemed to be advantageous. Even though in both experiments animals preferred especially one plant, choice still facilitated intake. "

abstract = "The Middle East region, embracing West Asia and North Africa (WANA), is characterized by a Mediterranean climate which dictates the agriculture of the region. Being one of the centers of origin of settled farming, where cereals and pulses originated along with sheep and goats, crop production is largely rainfed and is dependent on the limited rainfall (200–600 mm) during the cool moist season in late fall to late spring. The agricultural sector has changed in recent decades with intensification and pressure on land use. As elsewhere, increased chemical fertilizer use, especially nitrogen (N), has had an impact on the transition from a traditional system to a more market driven one with increased inputs. This review examines the varied aspects of N in the soils and cropping systems as reflected by research at The International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) in Syria in collaboration with other countries of the West Asia–North Africa region, especially in Morocco and other countries north and south of the Mediterranean. The synthesis, therefore, reflects a broad overview of conditions that impinge an N nutrition of crops and the evolution of N research achievements since the advent of commercial fertilization over three decades ago. With few exceptions, the soils of the Mediterranean region are low in organic matter and consequently in the reserves of total N, thus posing a limit of growing crops without fertilizer N or biological N fixation (BNF) through legumes. Soil calibration studies established the value of the soil nitrate test as a predictor of crop response with field trials to establish application rates for the main crops. Applicability is influenced by depth of sampling and the extent of mineralization. Dryland crop responses to N varied widely throughout the region from 30 to 150 kg N ha− 1, being dependent on soil N status and seasonal rainfall as the major determinant of yields. Splitting the N application was only advantageous in higher rainfall areas. Residual N from \{BNF\} by food and forage legumes influenced soil N supply for cereals and relative responses to N fertilizer. The contribution of rhizobia fixation to all the major legumes was quantified using 15N along with management factors that influenced \{BNF\} by legumes. Where legumes were newly introduced to a region, rhizobial inoculation was considered necessary. With cereal responses to fertilizer N, differences between varieties were highlighted. Where urea or ammonium–N fertilizers were used, volatilization was the main loss mechanisms rather than leaching or denitrification. Considerable work was done on N use within crop rotation systems and components of the N cycle defined along with inputs from urine and feces from grazing animals. Forage legumes were shown to enhance total soil N and both labile and biomass N, with the least influence from fallow. These N forms were shown to fluctuate during the year as moisture and temperature conditions changed. Fertilizer N use had a positive effect on grain quality with increased protein, as well as soil organic matter (SOM) and thus soil quality. The significant change of the gradual introduction of supplemental irrigation in traditional rainfed cropping areas and its implications for use of models to describe the complex nature of N in dryland cropping systems was described. With the likelihood of a continuation of intensification of the dryland cropping systems in the Mediterranean region, N fertilizer use will inevitably increase and along with it the need for greater use efficiency in the interest of production economics and the environment. While limited use has been made of modeling of N, this approach is likely to be of more significance in integrating the varied facets of N under Mediterranean cropping conditions. "

Crop-livestock integration is a possible solution for the sustainable intensification of farming systems. GAMEDE, a whole-farm model, was designed and used with six representative dairy farmers on the island to ex-ante assess differences in farm sustainability of various degrees of crop-livestock integration and to support discussions with farmers about these options. The model details the dynamics of the main biophysical and decisional processes affecting labour, gross margin, and energy and nutrient flows within the farm. We propose a method based on typology, modelling and participatory techniques to support policy making. All its methodological stages integrate both quantitative and qualitative data. The large majority of farm model implementation cases reported in the literature refers to constructed synthetic farms. However, in our case, actual farm simulation was particularly useful for capturing farmers’ expert knowledge and providing insights into how agro-ecosystems are really managed. This approach enabled taking farm diversity into account in defining relevant interventions. The reliability of extrapolations and recommendations for policy formulation based on farm-level simulation were verified by a rigorous evaluation of the representativeness of the farm sample, crossing expert data with data stemming from a multi-variate analysis. Our research indicates that actual farms can also be typical. "

Also, its ability to undertake symbiotic nitrogen fixation is an advantage over cereal crops. This study simulated lentil yield potential in order to determine the geographical areas in East Africa that offer potential for consistent lentil production. Results show that there is potential to further expand the geographical area in which lentil is currently grown in East Africa into Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and even Somalia. Response to a change in management practices on potential yield of lentil as a result of different sowing dates was also examined. In addition, the effect of phenology on yield potential was examined by comparing a short-season type vs. a long-season type. Delaying sowing alone or in combination with a long-season genotype can result in a high probability of crop yield increase in East Africa. For the long-season genotype, an optimum sowing window was found between June and July (152–229 day of year) for areas to the north of the Rift Valley. Later sowing dates (229–243 day of year) were found to be optimal in southern areas of East Africa. These simulations indicated that selection and breeding for lentil accessions in East Africa should consider changes in plant phenology and/or sowing dates. "

It is based upon two Leslie processes, one for each population. The elements of the Leslie matrices, the survival and fertility rates, are estimated with statistical methods. The survival rates are expressed in terms of life-time distributions and the fertility rates are parametrized as a function of age. The advantage of this method lies in the reduction of the large number of primary parameters to a few secondary ones. It is then possible to formulate the influence of the predator-prey interaction on the elements of the population projection matrices by simply modelling the influence on the parameters of the functions describing the time course of these elements. Thus a complex description is reduced to an easily comprehensible and applicable one. The model is supposed to answer questions that are important for the application of biological control of Tetranychus cinnabarinus by Scolothrips longicornis: How many individuals of Scolothrips longicornis are to be applied, and what is the appropriate date for application?

Using in vitro, in sacco and in vivo methods, we tested (i) the nutritional composition, (ii) digestibility and metabolizable energy, and (iii) intake and nitrogen balance in fat-tailed Awassi lambs of these feeds or diets prepared with these feeds. In vivo, the forages were fed in proportions of about 3/4 of the total diet to 30 animals allocated to five groups in a randomized complete block design. Diets, balanced for nitrogen, included concentrate (280 g/kg) and were offered at 1.1 kg dry matter (DM)/day with ad libitum access to water. Test forages had large differences in content (g/kg DM) of organic matter (OM; 690–916, Atriplex leaves vs. barley straw), crude protein (CP; 43–169, barley straw vs. vetch hay) and neutral detergent fiber (258–672, Atriplex leaves vs. barley straw). Olive leaves contained the highest phenol and ether extract levels (63 and 32 g/kg DM, respectively). Atriplex leaves were particularly rich in Na (94 g/kg) and K (39 g/kg). Atriplex leaf \{OM\} had the highest digestibility (0.68), but its low level reduced the metabolizable energy (ME; 6–7 MJ/kg DM) to that of barley straw. Its limited palatability caused significant refusals as well. Vetch hay, olive leaves, and lentil straw had superior \{OM\} digestibility to that of barley straw (the latter not significant). Olive leaf \{CP\} had limited ruminal degradability and total tract digestibility. None of the forages significantly affected body N retention, while olive leaves significantly reduced rumen microbial efficiency. The different models used to estimate \{ME\} ranked vetch hay first (9 MJ/kg DM), followed by olive leaves and lentil straw (6.5–8 MJ/kg DM). Overall, vetch hay was the most valuable forage in terms of energy and protein supply. Lentil straw and olive leaves were similar or slightly superior to barley straw, although they presented a different ruminal degradation pattern. Atriplex leaves, if fed restrictedly, could be used to replace barley straw when access to water is ad libitum. "

To investigate the causes of \{GE\} interaction, several genotypic and environmental covariables were used. In a combined ANOVA, environment was the predominant source of variation, accounting for 81.2% of the total sum of squares (TSS), and the remaining \{TSS\} due to the \{GE\} interaction effect was almost seven times that of the genetic effect. Cluster analysis separated the environments into four groups with similar discriminating ability among genotypes, and genotypes into five groups with similar patterns in yield performance. Pattern analysis confirmed two major environmental clusters (cold and warm), and allowed the discrimination and characterization of genotype adaptation. Within the cold-environment cluster, several subclusters were identified. The breeding lines were most adapted to moderate and warm environments, whereas the old varieties were adapted to cold environments. The results indicated that winter rainfall and plant height were among the environmental and genotypic covariables, respectively, that contributed most to \{GE\} interaction for grain yield in rainfed durum wheat.

The situation could be worse in middle and lower part of this basin which occupies 90% of the irrigated area. The objective of this research is to analyze the long term meteorological trends in the middle and lower parts of Indus basin of Pakistan. We used monthly data from 1971 to 2010 and applied non-parametric seasonal Kendal test for trend detection in combination with seasonal Kendall slope estimator to quantify the magnitude of trends. The meteorological parameters considered were mean maximum and mean minimum air temperature, and rainfall from 12 meteorological stations located in the study region. We examined the reliability and spatial integrity of data by mass-curve analysis and spatial correlation matrices, respectively. Analysis was performed for four seasons (spring—March to May, summer—June to August, fall—September to November and winter—December to February). The results show that max. temperature has an average increasing trend of magnitude + 0.16, + 0.03, 0.0 and + 0.04 °C/decade during all the four seasons, respectively. The average trend of min. temperature during the four seasons also increases with magnitude of + 0.29, + 0.12, + 0.36 and + 0.36 °C/decade, respectively. Persistence of the increasing trend is more pronounced in the min. temperature as compared to the max. temperature on annual basis. Analysis of rainfall data has not shown any noteworthy trend during winter, fall and on annual basis. However during spring and summer season, the rainfall trends vary from − 1.15 to + 0.93 and − 3.86 to + 2.46 mm/decade, respectively. It is further revealed that rainfall trends during all seasons are statistically non-significant. Overall the study area is under a significant warming trend with no changes in rainfall. "

Sixty multiparous fat-tailed Awassi ewes were allocated to 6 groups in a completely randomized block design. During 50 d, the ewes were group-fed 2.5 kg of dry matter/d per ewe 1 of 6 isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets (forage:concentrate, 0.3:0.7). The test feeds, comprising 30% of the diets, replaced either barley straw [lentil straw, olive leaves, and Atriplex (saltbush) leaves, rich in phenolic compounds or electrolytes] or conventional concentrate ingredients (olive cake and tomato pomace; ~10% lipids) from the control diet. The diets containing olive cake and tomato pomace were rich in oleic acid (18:1 cis-9; 27% of total dietary FA) and linoleic acid (18:2 cis-9,cis-12; 37%), respectively. Profiles of \{FA\} were determined in individual milk samples drawn on d 0 and in wk 1, 3, 5 and 7. Data was analyzed by repeated measurement analysis. No consistent treatment effects on yield and gross nutrient composition of the milk were observed, although some differences occurred. Milk resulting from the Atriplex leaf diet expressed the highest antiradical activity, which was low with control and olive leaves. Feeding the tomato pomace and olive cake diets decreased the proportions of short- and medium-chain FA, whereas oleic acid clearly increased in proportion to total FA. Olive leaves most effectively increased rumenic acid (18:2 cis-9,trans-11) and α-linolenic acid (18:3 cis-9,cis-12,cis-15) in milk fat. This also resulted in the highest α-linolenic acid transfer rate from feed to milk and suggests that olive leaves affect ruminal biohydrogenation at several steps. Several alternative feeds exist with an added value, as they enhance \{FA\} with potential health benefits and the stability of the milk with higher antioxidative activity, even though responses to test feeds differed largely. It remains to be investigated whether combinations of these feeds would be complementary in these beneficial effects. "

Synthetic experiments were conducted to examine the effect of bias in \{RS\} \{ET\} observations on calibration.

Rainfall distribution during the growing period was much more variable than the seasonal total, resulting in a limited growing period. Dependable rainfall is much lower than the mean, particularly for the low-rainfall regions (Asmara, Metahara and Melkasa). A close relationship between the amount of rainfall and the length of the growing season was observed. The beginning of the rainy season (planting time) ranged from early June to mid-July and the end of growing season varied from early September to November.

Triadimenol, tebuconazole, and carboxin + thiram reduced the number of infected seedlings and seedling root rot severity in both years. Number of tillers was higher in carboxin + thiram treated plots compared to other seed treatments. Compared to the control, carboxin + thiram increased grain yield by 9% and 8% in 2004 and 2005, respectively, and triadimenol by 6% in both years.

Short-term system-wide irrigation demand forecasts can assist in system operation. Here we developed a multivariate time series (ARMAX) model to forecast irrigation demands with respect to aggregated service points flows (IDCGi, ASP) and off take regulator flows (IDCGi, OTR) based across 5 command areas, which included area covered under four irrigation channels and the study area. These command area specific \{ARMAX\} models forecast 1–5 days ahead daily IDCGi, \{ASP\} and IDCGi, \{OTR\} using the real time flow data recorded at the service points and the uppermost regulators and observed meteorological data collected from automatic weather stations. The model efficiency and the predictive performance were quantified using the root mean squared error (RMSE), Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE), anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) and mean square skill score (MSSS). During the evaluation period, \{NSE\} for IDCGi, \{ASP\} and IDCGi, \{OTR\} across 5 command areas were ranged 0.98–0.78. These models were capable of generating skillful forecasts (MSSS ⩾ 0.5 and \{ACC\} ⩾ 0.6) of IDCGi, \{ASP\} and IDCGi, \{OTR\} for all 5 lead days and IDCGi, \{ASP\} and IDCGi, \{OTR\} forecasts were better than using the long term monthly mean irrigation demand. Overall these predictive performance from the \{ARMAX\} time series models were higher than almost all the previous studies we are aware. Further, IDCGi, \{ASP\} and IDCGi, \{OTR\} forecasts have improved the operators’ ability to react for near future irrigation demand fluctuations as the developed \{ARMAX\} time series models were self-adaptive to reflect the short-term changes in the irrigation demand with respect to various pressures and opportunities that farmers’ face, such as changing water policy, continued development of water markets, drought and changing technology.

This control is formulated using the soil moisture stress function (SSF), where the evaporative fraction (EF) or the fraction of the \{AET\} to \{PET\} (fPET) is assumed to be either a linear or a non-linear function of soil moisture. We examine the effectiveness of the soil moisture stress function to quantify soil moisture control on \{EF\} or fPET over a dryland wheat field in Victoria, Australia. Micrometeorological observations from two cropping seasons were used for the analysis. The efficacy of a root-density-weighted soil moisture estimate in predicting \{EF\} and fPET was investigated as against the commonly assumed fixed-depth root zone soil moisture. However, results indicate a strong relationship between \{EF\} and available soil water fraction (AWF) in the root zone only when solar radiation is higher than 5 MJ/m2/day. As the rooting depth increases with vegetation growth, \{SSF\} exhibits the strongest correlation with \{AWF\} for increasing soil profile depth. In the early and harvesting crop growth stages, \{ET\} is constrained mostly by surface soil moisture (0–5 cm). In the mid-growth stages, \{ET\} is strongly influenced by soil moisture in the root zone (0–60 cm). The shape of SSF, however, changes significantly between the two years (2012 and 2013). It is inferred that different temporal rainfall patterns between the years caused wheat’s different response to water stress. "

Excess levels of Mg2+ in irrigation waters and/or in soils negatively affect soil physical properties (infiltration rate and hydraulic conductivity) and ultimately crop growth and yield. Although few studies have been undertaken on productivity enhancement of magnesium-affected soils by adding a source of calcium (Ca2+) to mitigate the effects of excess Mg2+, there is no information available on optimizing the rate and time of the Ca2+-amendments. A 2-year field study was undertaken in southern Kazakhstan by applying phosphogypsum (PG), a source of Ca2+ and a byproduct of the phosphorous fertilizer industry, to a magnesium-affected soil. There were five treatments with four replications: (1) control (without \{PG\} application); (2) \{PG\} application in January (before snowfall) equivalent to \{PG\} requirement for 0.3 m soil depth (3.3 t ha−1); (3) \{PG\} application in January equivalent to \{PG\} requirement for 0.6 m soil depth (8.0 t ha−1); (4) \{PG\} application in April (after snowmelt) at 3.3 t ha−1; and (5) \{PG\} application in April (after snowmelt) at 8.0 t ha−1. All treatment plots were grown with cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), which is the most important summer crop in the region. The \{PG\} treatments performed significantly better than the control in terms of (1) improved soil quality with a reduction in exchangeable magnesium percentage (EMP) levels; (2) enhanced water movement into and through the soil vis-à-vis increased moisture storage in the root zone for use by the plant roots; (3) increased irrigation efficiency; (4) increased cotton yield and water productivity; and (5) greater financial benefits. In terms of the best rate and time of application, \{PG\} applied before the snowfall improved the soil properties to a greater extent than its application in spring after snowmelt. The economic benefits from the amendment application at 3.3 t ha−1 were double those from the treatments where it was applied at 8.0 t ha−1, suggesting that the lower rate was economically optimal. In addition to improving crop productivity, the study demonstrated the beneficial use of an industrial waste material in agriculture. "

The trial was set up in a randomised complete block design with two replicates under rain-fed conditions in 1994–1995 at the Agricultural Research and Educational Center (33°56′ N, 36°5′ E, 995 m above sea level). Eight two-phase barley-based rotations were compared: barley in rotation with barley, lentil, common vetch, bitter vetch, common vetch for grazing, medics for grazing, common vetch for hay, and common vetch with barley for hay. Seed and straw were harvested from barley and legumes in the first four rotations. Relative to the trial mean, seed and straw yield under barley monoculture slumped in 1997–1998 and did not recover since then. Infestation of wild barley was a cause of this yield decline. Barley–legume rotations yielded 44–80% more barley grain and 27–53% more barley straw than the barley monoculture over the 6 years (1995–1996 to 2000–2001). Furthermore, in the legume phase, common and bitter vetch gave higher seed yield than barley monoculture. Thus, all barley–legume rotations, except barley–medics, yielded more total dry matter than barley monoculture on the basis of per rotation cycle. Among the barley–legume rotations, the barley-common vetch for seed rotation gave the highest and most stable dry matter yield. In conclusion, barley monoculture was unsustainable, but barley yields could be increased and sustained by including legumes in the rotation. Farmers in semi-arid areas of Lebanon should discontinue practicing barley monoculture and adopt a barley–legume, such as common vetch, rotation. "

The \{WANA\} production systems are dominated by cereals, primarily wheat in the wetter and barley in the drier areas, in rotation with mainly food legumes such as chickpea, lentil and forage legumes. The \{SSA\} production systems are generally characterized by cereal/legume mixed-cropping dominated by maize, millet, sorghum, and wheat. The major constraints in both regions to crop production are low soil fertility, insecure rainfall, low-productive genotypes, low adoption of improved soil and crop management practices, and lack of appropriate institutional support. Different cropping systems and accompanying technologies are discussed as well as selected examples of impact of these technologies. Results indicate that there is an advantage to apply these technologies but being function of socio-economic and bio-physical conditions.

These validation trials are paired plot comparisons of conventional agricultural practice and conservation agriculture that had been established between 2004 and 2009. Traditional cropping systems vary across the study area although they all are tillage based and maize is the main crop grown. The treatments proposed on the validations trials reflect this variability in conventional practice and propose an adapted conservation agriculture option. The sites are thus grouped into four specific treatment comparisons. Bulk density and soil C concentrations were measured from samples collected at four depth layers (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm and 30–60 cm), thereafter C stocks were calculated. On the basis of the stover biomass harvest C inputs were assessed. No consistent differences in bulk density and soil C concentrations were found. Carbon stocks were found to be positively influenced by conservation agriculture only when a mouldboard ploughed maize-legume rotation was compared to a direct seeded maize legume rotation (with residue retention). Even when increases were significantly greater under conservation agriculture the order of magnitude was small (∼2 Mg ha−1). Limited C inputs, ranging between 0.1 and 1 g C kg−1 soil yr−1, are likely to be the major bottleneck for C increase. These results, based on on-farm validation trials indicate that there is a limited potential for conservation agriculture to significantly increase soil C stocks after up to 7 years of conservation agriculture practices, in the studied systems.

The combined results of the three seasons on disease parameters showed that sowing dates significantly affected final disease severity and area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC); faba bean genotypes significantly affected final disease severity, rate of disease development and AUDPC. The highest \{AUDPC\} (255% days) was observed in early than late planted (168% days) faba bean genotypes. The mean \{AUDPC\} of faba bean genotypes ranged from 189% days on genotype 1053–1325 to 234% days on ILB-1814. Only faba bean genotypes and fungicides showed significant interactions in affecting final disease severity and AUDPC. Fungicide sprays significantly affected mean percent pod infection and rate of disease development but not mean percent seed infection. Faba bean genotypes showed significant differences in dry seed yield and the yield ranged from 1.7 t ha−1 in cv. Ascot to 2.4 t ha−1 in faba bean genotype 945-105. Improved varieties with Ascochyta blight resistance are not currently released and available for farmers in northern Syria and the integration of early planting (November–December) with one foliar fungicide spray at vegetative stage can help to reduce Ascochyta blight severity, pod and seed infections. Chlorothalonil and azoxystrobin are widely used fungicides to manage Ascochyta blights on food legumes in many countries and one of them could be used depending on their availability and costs to managing faba bean Ascochyta blight in Syria and other Mediterranean type environments.

Saline water, in combination with freshwater or alone, is used to irrigate cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in Central Asia in summer when there are often severe freshwater shortages. The use of saline water without appropriate management can result in the accumulation of salts in the root zone with associated negative impacts on crop productivity. The accumulation of salts in surface soil layers can be managed by reducing evaporation from the soil surface. A 3-year field study on a saline soil (ECe = 13.9 dS m−1; \{SAR\} = 3.1) in the Syr-Darya River Basin of Uzbekistan was undertaken to evaluate the effects of wheat straw mulching on alternate irrigation furrows (1.5 t ha−1) and different levels of irrigation water salinity (4.0, 6.2, and 8.3 dS m−1) on soil salinity and sodicity dynamics, cotton yield, and crop water productivity. Compared to the pre-experiment status in 2005, the average increase in salinity in the upper 0.15 m layer of post-cotton 2007 soil under mulching treatments was significantly less than the non-mulching treatments. On average, there was a 20% increase in surface soil salinity of the non-mulching treatments compared to the mulching treatments. These treatment differences were less with increasing soil depth. Similar trends were observed with respect to changes in soil \{SAR\} in the top soil and across the soil profile. Cotton yield and water productivity under mulching treatments were significantly greater than non-mulched treatments at a given irrigation water salinity level. In addition, cotton yields were up to 800 kg ha−1 higher and crop water productivity (lint + seed) up to 0.47 kg m−3 greater in the mulching treatments than the farmers’ managed fields with conventional practices in the same region. These results suggest that by using appropriate combinations of water quality and mulching, there could be substantial increase in crop yield and water productivity resulting in water savings of up to 0.5 m3 for each kg of cotton produced. When translated on a broader scale, such water savings are significant in a region where freshwater supplies are constrained and salt-induced water quality deterioration is widespread. "

To provide baseline information for the development of a conservation strategy for the species, the current status of remaining semi-natural carob populations in Lebanon was assessed through an ecogeographic survey, a bio-climatic distribution study, and a genetic analysis. Field explorations were carried out throughout the reported natural distribution range of the target taxon (≤750 m altitude) and all areas where carob was found, were mapped. Data including land use, main associated vegetation, major threats, percentage of grafted trees, and landform were recorded for each population. Climate data were interpolated as functions of geographic parameters to create maps for mean minimum temperature of the coldest month (m), mean maximum temperature of the warmest month, and annual precipitation. These were then used to calculate the pluviometric quotient (pmq) as a measure of aridity. The largest populations encountered in the study were targeted for molecular analysis. Polymorphic amplification products of \{RAPD\} were analyzed for 10–15 trees from each population. The ecogeographic survey revealed that most remaining populations are very small consisting of low numbers of individuals. Anthropomorphic activities such as coppicing, grafting and/or grazing were evident in all populations, however, it was clear that these populations were abandoned and had become part of the Mediterranean maquis vegetation. Overlays of soil maps and carob distribution data indicated that the species occurs preferentially on Terra Rossa soils, which have typically poor agricultural capability. An examination of the climatic conditions in which carob could be found showed that the distribution of carob is limited by (m) of less than 1 °C and a pmq below 60. Analysis of \{RAPD\} products indicated that the populations did not cluster based on geographic proximity and revealed a significant difference between and within populations suggesting that the remaining populations constitute a valuable germplasm. The prospects for conservation of carob in the Lebanese context are discussed. "

In this study, we compared the dynamics of water content (WC), total C (Ctot), and available N (Navail) contents, and the distribution in size of aggregates in ageing below-ground casts of this species and in the bulk soil. In a native herbaceous savannah and a sown grass/legume pasture (Brachiaria humidicola, Arachis pintoi, Desmodium ovalifolium and Stylosanthes capitata), fresh surface casts were experimentally injected into artificial burrows of 1 cm Ø and 10 cm depth and sampled at different dates during a total period of 120 days. The injection procedure used resulted in a 34% decrease in \{WC\} of the casts from the sown pasture and reduced the mean mass diameter (MMD) of the aggregates of casts from the savannah by 19%. Other properties were not significantly affected by the procedure. For injected casts in both grasslands, \{MMD\} and Ctot were stable during cast ageing while \{WC\} and Navail were initially at levels several times higher than the bulk soil and decreased to similar bulk soil values with ageing. The Ctot was twice and one third higher in casts compared with the bulk soil in the pasture and the savannah, respectively. Overall means for cast \{MMD\} (8.3 and 7.4 mm) were twice as high as those in the bulk soil (3.8 mm) in the savannah and the pasture, respectively. However, \{MMD\} was not significantly different between the casts and the bulk soil in two occasions in the pasture. Available nitrogen (Navail) in injected casts was initially greater than bulk soil levels, reaching maximum levels just after injection (116 and 93 mg kg−1) and remained significantly greater during 1–2 weeks, in the savannah and the pasture, respectively. In conclusion, the tonnes of casts deposited in the soil profile by Martiodrilus sp. each year are likely to contribute greatly to plant nutrition and to the regulation of the soil structure. For each anecic earthworm species, the ecological impact of its below-ground casts is likely to be as important as its surface casts. "

This understanding is critical to predicting household water demand, particularly at an appropriate spatial and temporal resolution to support Integrated Urban Water Management based planning and to improve the understanding on how different household water demands respond to demand management strategies. The study used two sets of data each collected from 837 households under significantly different water use conditions in the years 2003 and 2011. Data from each household consist of the household characteristics and quarterly metre readings. Ordinary Least Square regression analysis followed by detailed analysis of each factor was used to identify key factors affecting household water use. The variables studied are household size, typology of dwelling, appliance efficiency, presence of children under 12 years, presence of children aged between 12 and 18 years, tenancy, dwelling age, presence of swimming pool, evaporative cooler, and dishwasher. All of them except presence of children aged between 12 and 18 years, tenancy and dwelling age were identified as variables that contribute to the variability of household water use in Melbourne. The study also found that the explanatory capacity of these variables increases with decreasing water use. This paper also discusses the significance of the explanatory variables, their impact and how they vary over the seasons and years. The variables found in this study can be used to inform improved prediction and modelling of residential water demand. The paper also explores other possible drivers to explain residential water use in light of the moderate explanatory capacity of the variables selected for this study thus, provides useful insights into future research into water demand modelling.

The main objectives were to (i) quantify phenotypic diversity and identify variation in the durum wheat landraces for the different stresses and (ii) characterize the agronomic profiles of landraces in reaction to the stresses. Significant changes in reactions of landraces to stresses were observed. Landraces resistant to each stress were identified and agronomically characterized. Percentage reduction due to the stresses varied from 11.4% (yellow rust) to 21.6% (cold stress) for 1000-kernel weight (TKW) and from 19.9 (yellow rust) to 91.9% (cold stress) for grain yield. Landraces from Asia and Europe showed enhanced genetic potential for both grain yield and cold tolerance under highland rainfed conditions of Iran. The findings showed that \{TKW\} and yield productivity could be used to assess the response of durum wheat landraces to different stresses. In conclusion, landraces showed high levels of resistance to both biotic and abiotic stresses, and selected landraces can serve in durum wheat breeding for adaptation to cold and drought-prone environments.

We describe the world's semi-arid and dry sub-humid savannah and steppe regions as global hotspots, in terms of water related constraints to food production, high prevalence of malnourishment and poverty, and rapidly increasing food demands. We argue that major water investments in agriculture are required. In these regions yield gaps are large, not due to lack of water per se, but rather due to inefficient management of water, soils, and crops. An assessment of management options indicates that knowledge exists regarding technologies, management systems, and planning methods. A key strategy is to minimise risk for dry spell induced crop failures, which requires an emphasis on water harvesting systems for supplemental irrigation. Large-scale adoption of water harvesting systems will require a paradigm shift in Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM), in which rainfall is regarded as the entry point for the governance of freshwater, thus incorporating green water resources (sustaining rainfed agriculture and terrestrial ecosystems) and blue water resources (local runoff). The divide between rainfed and irrigated agriculture needs to be reconsidered in favor of a governance, investment, and management paradigm, which considers all water options in agricultural systems. A new focus is needed on the meso-catchment scale, as opposed to the current focus of \{IWRM\} on the basin level and the primary focus of agricultural improvements on the farmer's field. We argue that the catchment scale offers the best opportunities for water investments to build resilience in small-scale agricultural systems and to address trade-offs between water for food and other ecosystem functions and services.

There were eight Awassi sheep in each stocking rate treatment, and the treatments were replicated three times in fenced paddocks. Milk yield, lamb production, liveweight and supplementary feeding of the sheep were monitored. The results showed significantly higher forage availability on the range over-sown with fodder shrubs, exceeding the native pasture by 82% and 41% in the medium and high rainfall seasons, respectively, and by 142% and 379% in the average and low rainfall seasons. The total energy used in the supplementary feed was greater under the native pasture than that in the shrub-sown pasture in five out of the seven seasons, while crude protein consumption was greater in the native pasture than on the shrub-sown pasture in all seven seasons. Milk production and lamb body mass were higher on shrub-sown pasture than those in native pasture in four and six out of the seven seasons, respectively. Benefits obtained from reduced feed costs, extra milk and lamb sales were higher on shrub-sown pasture than those in the native pasture in five out of the seven seasons. Total benefits measured over the entire study period were highest under the high stocking rate, reaching about 77 US$ ha−1.

The objective of this research was to compare the simulated yields of forage corn obtained from a common set of soil and water conditions for ENVIRO-GRO, HYDRUS, SALTMED, \{SWAP\} and UNSATCHEM. The physical and hydraulic properties of Panoche clay loam were used. The amounts of water applied weekly, based on the climatic conditions in the San Joaquin Valley of California, ranged from 0.9 to 1.3 times (Kirr) the potential evapotranspiration (PET) of corn. The salinity of the applied water (ECiw) ranged from 0.5 to 6 dS/m which brackets the threshold soil–water salinity of forage corn (Zea mays L.) of 3.6 dS/m. The model simulations were run for sufficient back-to-back crop seasons to establish transient matric and osmotic conditions within the root zone that did not change from one crop season to the next, a quasi steady-state condition. \{SALTMED\} simulated lower relative yields (RY) than the other models for all combinations of Kirr and ECiw. For the other models, \{RY\} values were similar (within about 7% or less) for \{ECiw\} ≤ 3 dS/m for all Kirr values. Plots of \{RY\} versus \{ECiw\} for HYDRUS, SWAP, and \{UNSATCHEM\} approximately paralleled each other except that \{UNSATCHEM\} produced higher values. ENVIRO-GRO produced the highest \{RY\} where Kirr ≥ 1.1 and \{ECiw\} ≤ 2.0 dS/m but decreased more rapidly for greater ECiw. ENVIRO-GRO has plant-based compensation which allows water uptake to meet \{PET\} as long as any portion of the root zone is not exposed to matric or osmotic stress that exceed threshold levels. This compensation factor produced higher \{RY\} at the lower \{ECiw\} values. More rapid decrease in \{RY\} with increasing values of \{ECiw\} simulated by ENVIRO-GRO is attributed to the assumption that the osmotic and matric stresses are additive, whereas the others assume that they were multiplicative. All the models except \{UNSATCHEM\} assume a constant relationship between \{EC\} and salt concentration in solution. \{UNSATCHEM\} takes into account the effects of the ionic composition and ion concentration on osmotic potential, resulting in higher \{RY\} values obtained with this model. Since the chemical composition of irrigation waters are all unique, this aspect of \{UNSATCHEM\} poses an important capability in the assessment of osmotic effects on crop yields. We conclude the models provide a valuable resource to assess the utility of moderately saline irrigation waters, for a broad range of transient conditions which include variable crops, precipitation, irrigation water management, and irrigation water salinity. We also highly recommend their use to assess the results obtained in experiments that focus on the responses of crop growth and yield to transient changes in soil water content and salinity. "

abstract = "In its broadest sense, water productivity (WP) is the net return for a unit of water used. Improvement of water productivity aims at producing more food, income, better livelihoods and ecosystem services with less water. There is considerable scope for improving water productivity of crop, livestock and fisheries at field through to basin scale. Practices used to achieve this include water harvesting, supplemental irrigation, deficit irrigation, precision irrigation techniques and soil–water conservation practices. Practices not directly related to water management impact water productivity because of interactive effects such as those derived from improvements in soil fertility, pest and disease control, crop selection or access to better markets. However, there are several reasons to be cautious about the scope and ease of achieving water productivity gains. Crop water productivity is already quite high in highly productive regions, and gains in yield (per unit of land area) do not necessarily translate into gains in water productivity. Reuse of water that takes place within an irrigated area or a basin can compensate for the perceived losses at the field-scale in terms of water quantity, though the water quality is likely to be affected. While crop breeding has played an important role in increasing water productivity in the past, especially by improving the harvest index, such large gains are not easily foreseen in the future. More importantly, enabling conditions for farmers and water managers are not in place to enhance water productivity. Improving water productivity will thus require an understanding of the biophysical as well as the socioeconomic environments crossing scales between field, farm and basin. Priority areas where substantive increases in water productivity are possible include: (i) areas where poverty is high and water productivity is low, (ii) areas of physical water scarcity where competition for water is high, (iii) areas with little water resources development where high returns from a little extra water use can make a big difference, and (iv) areas of water-driven ecosystem degradation, such as falling groundwater tables, and river desiccation. However, achieving these gains will be challenging at least, and will require strategies that consider complex biophysical and socioeconomic factors. "

However, there is little information on soil quality in Mediterranean environments where climatic factors limit carbon (C) input and yet promote mineralization of what little C is returned to the soil. The impact of any soil and crop management practice on soil quality attributes in any ecosystem can only be objectively assessed under long-term agronomic trials. In such trials, especially in fragile, semi-arid regions, little emphasis has been given to soil physical parameters despite the perceived importance of aggregation on crop growth, water relations and erosion. In one long-term, cereal-based trial from Syria, four representative crop sequences were selected as they have varying influence on soil organic matter (SOM) levels, e.g., fallow, continuous wheat (Triticum turgidum var durum), vetch (Vicia sativa), and medic (Medicago spp.). These rotations showed increased aggregate stability as \{SOM\} increased. Our study examined water-stable aggregates from these rotations at the micromorphological level using the polarizing (on thin sections) and scanning electron microscope. The observations of the influence of \{SOM\} at the micro level were inconsistent with those at the macro level as determined by wet sieving. This discrepancy may be related to the age of the \{SOM\} and the extent to which organic carbon is intimately mixed with mineral matter. Nevertheless, the changes determined on the shape and porosity characteristics of the water-stable aggregates suggest the value of the micro-scale approach in understanding the mechanism of soil microstructure development. Micromorphology can identify visual details of the physical changes in the evolution of soil microstructure under varying cropping systems. "

Two groups of 20 goats of different ages were combed with either a large or a small comb, three times with intervals of 2 weeks in early spring when natural fiber shedding has started. Combed cashmere weight, duration of combing, fiber diameter, and down yield were measured. A sample of combed cashmere was analyzed using a Laserscan instrument. A general linear model including type of comb, stage of combing and age of goat was fitted to analyze the data. Small combs collect more cashmere (31.0 vs. 21.7 g, P &lt; 0.01) than large combs without affecting down yield or down fiber diameter (P &gt; 0.05) but combing time is higher (3.75 vs. 2.79 min, P &lt; 0.01). In the first two combing sessions much more cashmere was obtained than in the last (28.1, 32.0 and 19.0 g, respectively, P &lt; 0.01), but the weight of total combed cashmere was much less than typical shorn fleece weights. Combing can be justified only if a considerable price premium can be obtained from selling combed cashmere instead of selling shorn cashmere, or if the combed cashmere is used to add value on-farm. If this is the case, small combs with short rods are preferable since more cashmere can be collected without affecting its quality. "

To determine the effect of grazing systems on rangelands, several studies were performed. Such studies included a description of soil profiles to categorize degradation and the evaluation of water erosion changes due to further degradation processes under grazing systems (rotational, \{RG\} and continuous, CG). The study was carried out on a rangeland of the ejido Pánuco, Zacatecas, from 2002 to 2005. Soil degradation was classified by identifying 6 groups with similar soil profiles (GSSP) which were described as: (1) low degradation soil; (2) medium degradation soil with A horizon lost; (3) high degradation soil without A and B horizons lost; (4) high degradation soil with in situ development; (5) high degradation soil with calcareous material; and (6) high degradation soil without development, which is a very shallow soil above the parental material. Further degradation was determined by soil erosion measurements performed in the study area and the surroundings. With respect to soil losses their values were systematically less for the \{RG\} system under the native vegetation conditions studied (P &lt; 0.01). Changes in the production systems may imply a reconversion of the system. Some changes include a modification in the intensity of use of rangelands, starting with a new grazing system, as well as changes in technology which may be simulated by GIS. "

Thirty-six 4-month-old Awassi lambs (mean live weight 23.0 kg) were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) the control group (C), in which lambs were provided with the diet used in fattening systems in Syria; (2) the faba bean and beet molasses group (FBM), in which the lambs were fed a reduced-cost diet in which the barley given in C was replaced with faba bean and beet molasses; and (3) the wheat bran and beet molasses group (MM) replacing a large portion of the broken maize and a small portion of the barley in C.

The \{FBM\} and \{MM\} alternative diets were 13.5% and 11.8% less expensive, respectively, than the C diet.

The economic returns per kilogram of weight gained did not differ, and the feed costs per kilogram weight gain were similar in the three groups (0.90, 0.98 and 0.89 \{USD\} in C, \{FBM\} and MM, respectively). No differences among groups were observed with regard to carcass traits and quality (P &gt; 0.05).

abstract = "Overgrazing and mismanagement of rangelands, climate change, drought and ‘salinisation’ of lands are threatening the sustainability of production systems and the fertility of cropping lands worldwide. This alarming situation drew the attention of policy makers, scientists and technicians and motivated them to develop feasible and sustainable strategies targeting the promotion of livestock sector in arid and semi arid zones, drought mitigation, protection and better use of natural resources (i.e. rangelands and water sources) and combating soil and water salinity. There has been an increasing awareness of the value of shrubs in forage production and for rehabilitation of depleted rangelands. Among the wide range of multipurpose fodder trees and shrubs, oldman saltbush (Atriplex nummularia Lindl.) has received increasing interest as livestock forage and valuable revegetation species on marginal saline lands, especially in arid zones of Australia and in the West Asia and North Africa (WANA) region. Adapted to drought and water and soil salinity, oldman saltbush produces important consumable biomass in areas where other crops cannot grow. To cope with these harsh conditions, this species accumulates high levels of salt and oxalates on its leaves rendering them less palatable and decreasing their nutritive value. Even though, satisfactory performance of small ruminants fed on A. nummularia has been reported in numerous research studies. This paper presents a thorough review of the literature on fodder potential of oldman saltbush and highlights the main constraints and opportunities to make better use of this shrub for feeding sheep and goat under different production systems.

Reduced-cost feeds and adequate management alternatives are needed for more efficient lamb-fattening systems. Therefore lamb fattening performances of different Awassi sheep genotypes, on different diets and fattening environments, were therefore evaluated. Two trials were conducted. The first trial was conducted on-farm in northern Syria to assess the fattening performance of Syrian Awassi, and Turkish × Syrian Awassi crossbred lambs, and the suitability of 2 cost-reducing feeding diets compared to the traditional spring fattening diet of grazing green barley with supplementation (C): intensive feeding based only on concentrate and barley straw (D1) and semi-intensive grazing on vetch (Vicia sativa) with minor supplementation using the same D1-mix (D2). Lambs of both genotypes did not significantly differ in weight gain in the 49-day fattening period. There were no significant differences in weight gains among C, \{D1\} and \{D2\} diets: 14.4, 15.3 and 15.9 kg/lamb, respectively. The \{D2\} diet reduced feeding costs by 20% and promoted high growth, notwithstanding its beneficial soil effects. The second trial was conducted on-station at the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), Syria, to assess the fattening performance of lambs of the above 2 genotypes in addition to Turkish × (Turkish × Syrian) crossbred lambs, both in indoor and outdoor conditions. Paralleling the first trial, live weight gains of the 3 genotypes did not differ significantly. Fattening lambs under a more favorable and healthier outdoor environment using a simple shed, avoiding negative effects of lack of ventilation and high temperature, produced significantly more live weight gain (5.8 kg) per lamb than indoors. No differences in smell, taste, juiciness and tenderness were found among genotypes in the second trial, confirming no negative effects of using these diets in the first trial, reported elsewhere. There were no statistical differences in smell, taste, juiciness and tenderness, in the meat with the distinct diets or the fattening (indoor/outdoor) environments. Both trials showed that whereas no gains could be expected by using the Turkish genotype for fattening, vetch grazing and molasses are suitable options for reducing high feed costs and could be safely used by farmers without compromising meat quality. Raising animals in a more favorable and healthier environment outdoors under a simple shed can also translate into substantial revenue in large batches of fattened lambs with considerable benefit for fattening systems.

Most flocks are poorly-managed secondary enterprises and are used as a store of wealth rather than as a commercial business. Major constraints to improved sheep and goat productivity are: (1) poor nutrition because of the low productivity of the rangelands and non-availability of economic supplemental feeds, (2) disease and parasite problems because of limited veterinary coverage, (3) poor flock management, (4) poor credit, marketing and transportation infrastructure, (5) no range management or control on the common tribal rangelands, and (6) poor breeding selection and genetic potential. Suggestions for research and extension activities include: (1) introduction of perennial legumes, cool season grasses, and shrub reserves to rehabilitate the rangeland, (2) grazing studies on number and kinds of animals and appropriate seasons of use, (3) dryland fodder production combining new forage species, fertilizer, and water harvesting, (4) increasing the nutritive value of crop residues and the use of non-conventional feeds, (5) extension programs to facilitate farmers to vaccinate and dip their animals, (6) credit and infrastructural improvement, (7) increasing the genetic potential of the animals.

The objective of this study was to characterize near isogenic lines (NILs) contrasting in \{A1\} tolerance derived from Atlas 66 in the backgrounds of Al-sensitive cultivars Chisholm and Century using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR). A total of 200 \{AFLP\} and 88 \{SSR\} primer pairs were screened and 12 markers (11 \{AFLPs\} and one SSR) were associated with Al-tolerance in \{NILs\} of at least one recurrent parental background. Among them, nine were linked to \{A1\} tolerance in the Chisholm-derived NILs, seven were associated with Al-tolerance in the Century-derived NILs, and three \{AFLPs\} derived from the primer combinations of pAG/mGCAG, pCAG/mAGC and pGTG/mGCG, and one SSR, Xwmc331 on chromosome 4D, associated with \{A1\} tolerance in \{NILs\} of both recurrent parental backgrounds. Those common markers across two backgrounds may be the major marker loci associated with Al-tolerance in Atlas 66 and could be useful for marker-assisted breeding to improve \{A1\} tolerance in wheat. In addition, evaluation of \{A1\} tolerance among different genotypes using hematoxylin stain and relative root growth revealed that Atlas 66 was more tolerant to \{A1\} stress than the NILs, therefore suggested that the Al-tolerant \{NILs\} might not carry all Al-tolerance loci from Atlas 66 and inheritance of \{A1\} tolerance in Atlas 66 is more likely multigenic.

Moisture stresses of various intensities, at different growth stages of the plant, were limiting to durum wheat production in all the regions except Debre Markos. Terminal moisture stress was simulated in 7 out of 10 years in all locations except Debre Markos, whereas intermittent stress. was simulated in three locations in 2 out of 10 years. In Metahara rain-fed durum wheat production is not feasible without irrigation. Water use efficiency decreased with decreasing rainfall but the transpiration coefficient increased. The average simulated potential grain yields at all the locations were high (6600 kg ha−1) compared with the actual national average. Development of versatile and region-specific improvement strategies are emphasized to improve durum wheat production in the country. "

In experiment 1, 6 adult, dry, nonpregnant, rumen-fistulated Granadina goats (46.9 ± 2.15 kg of BW) were used and 3 trials were carried out. In each trial, 2 goats were randomly assigned to receive 600 g of alfalfa hay and 400 g of concentrate (diet AC), 600 g of alfalfa hay, 200 g of concentrate, and \{FB\} I (diet ACBI), or 600 g of alfalfa hay, 200 g of concentrate, and \{FB\} \{II\} (diet ACBII) with 6 replications per diet.

In experiment 2, 18 Granadina goats (39.6 ± 1.89 kg of BW) in the middle of the third lactation were used, and 3 trials were carried out by following a 3 × 3 Latin square experimental design. In every trial, 6 animals randomly received 1.0 kg of alfalfa hay supplemented with 1.0 kg of concentrate (diet AC) or 0.5 kg of concentrate and \{FB\} I and \{II\} (diets \{ACBI\} and ACBII) with 18 replications per diet. The \{FB\} were supplied ad libitum. The intakes of organic matter and fat were higher with the \{AC\} diet than with the \{FB\} diets. The intake of acid detergent fiber was higher for FB-containing diets than for the \{AC\} diet. The neutral detergent fiber digestibility of \{FB\} diets was higher than that of the \{AC\} diet. Energy intake was higher for diets \{AC\} and \{ACBII\} than for ACBI. Microbial N flow was affected by diet. Milk yield was higher in goats fed the \{AC\} diet than in those receiving the \{FB\} diets. Conjugated linoleic acid content was higher in milk from \{FB\} than in milk from \{AC\} goats. Our study suggests that \{FB\} type \{II\} based on local ingredients could be used advantageously to reduce half of the amount of concentrate without detrimental effects on nutrient utilization, N value of the diet, and milk composition. The decrease of milk yield with \{ACBII\} compared with that obtained with the \{AC\} diet could be compensated by better quality of milk, decreased cost of feeding, and environmental advantage derived of including by-products in FB.

Decreasing per-capita food production trends and 2–3% per-year population growth trends have convinced some to adopt a Malthusian perspective about the future of the WASAT. This paper evaluates the prospects of agricultural technologies and farm management practices that are currently proposed for the \{WASAT\} cereal farming system. The technologies are assessed with respect to their agronomic and economic feasibility, risk and their fit within the farming systems. They are ranked as to their feasibility of adoption by farmers in the short, intermediate and long run. The findings suggest that several agricultural technologies are feasible for use in the short run provided that they are used as a package. The complexity and initial high financial and human capital requirements, however, often prohibit farmers from adopting the total package simultaneously. A stepwise approach to adoption is difficult since separate adoption results in lower profitability and higher risk levels. Government policy intervention may be necessary to enable farmers to adopt single technologies en route to total package adoption. "

The patterns of grazing areas were classified into three main categories in the study area, namely, (1) harvested barley fields in summer, (2) a combination of both harvested barley fields and rangeland from summer to autumn, and (3) rangeland from autumn to spring. Changes in grazing area were regulated mainly by the time of barley harvesting, the scantiness and/or richness of feed resources in harvested barley fields and on rangeland, water pounds and cold weather in the rainy season, and governmental policy. The main feed resources were barley straw and stubble in summer, a combination of barley stubble and native plants on the rangeland from summer to autumn, native plants on the rangeland or cotton residue in autumn, supplementary feeding of barley grain and straw in winter, and native plants on the rangeland in spring. The subsistence systems of rangeland grazing and cultivation activities competed with each other for land use, but compensated for each other in feed supply for small ruminants throughout the year. From the viewpoint of grazing management throughout the year, integrated land use between rangeland and cultivated fields is an inevitable system in the study area. The contents of feed resources in the study area are still very simple, mainly because of the possibility of only barley cultivation by rainwater and the vast unarable mountainous rangeland. Information about the characteristics and the system analysis of the flock management in the study area could offer important information for sustainable land use planning in dry mountainous areas of northern Africa and western Asia.

Isolates from Lattakia and Suweida provinces formed very distinct clusters compared to the others. The 56 isolates were grouped into four pathotypes, namely, pathotype-1 (12 isolates), pathotype-2 (13 isolates), pathotype-3 (5 isolates) and pathotype-4 (26 isolates) with varying degrees of virulence on the chickpea genotypes. Our findings showed a clear genetic shift toward more virulence over time and space in the populations of D. rabiei in Syria. These results stress the need for chickpea breeding materials to be tested for resistance to the more virulent pathotypes. Also, concerted action should be taken to ensure the shipment of healthy seeds of international chickpea nurseries to avoid D. rabiei genotypes or pathotypes flow from Syria to other countries. "

abstract = "Rainfed and irrigated agricultural systems have supported livelihoods in the five Central Asian countries (CAC) for millennia, but concerns for sustainability and efficient use of land and water resources are long-standing. During the last 50 years, resource conserving technologies were introduced in large parts of the rainfed areas while the irrigated areas were expanded largely without considering resource conservation. In more recent years, the use of conservation agriculture (CA) practices has been reported for the different agricultural production (AP) zones in CAC, albeit centering on a single \{AP\} zone or on single factors such as crop yield, implements or selected soil properties. Moreover, conflicting information exists regarding whether the current practices that are referred to as ‘CA’ can indeed be defined as such. Overall information on an application of CA-based crop management in Central Asia is incomplete. This discussion paper evaluates experimental evidence on the performance of \{CA\} and other resource conserving technologies in the three main \{AP\} zones of CAC, provides an overview of farmer adoption of production practices related to CA, and outlines technical and non-technical challenges and opportunities for the future dissemination of \{CA\} practices in each zone. Agronomic (e.g. implements, crop yields, duration, and crop residues), institutional (e.g. land tenure) and economic (e.g. short vs. long-term profitability) perspectives are considered. At present, adoption of CA-based agronomic practices in the rainfed production zone is limited to partial crop residue retention on the soil surface or sporadically zero tillage for one crop out of the rotation, and hence the use of single \{CA\} components but not the full set of \{CA\} practices. In the irrigated \{AP\} zones, \{CA\} is not commonly practiced and many of the pre-conditions that typically encourage the rapid spread of \{CA\} practices appear to be absent or limiting. Further, our analysis suggests that given the diversity of institutional, socio-economic and agro-ecological contexts, a geographically differentiated approach to \{CA\} dissemination is required in the CAC. Immediate priorities should include a shift in research paradigms (e.g. towards more participatory approaches with farmers), development of commercially available reduced and no-till seeders suitable for smaller-scale farm enterprises, and advocacy so that decision makers understand how different policies may encourage or discourage innovations that lead towards more sustainable agricultural intensification in the CAC.

Use of the model allows more efficient targeting of parent material well adapted to winter-sowing, leading to higher yields than those from traditional spring-sown cultivars. The model suggests that photothermally-insensitive genotypes are poorly adapted to winter-sowing whereas photothermally-sensitive ones are potentially well adapted to these harsh, highland environments. This is compatible with field observations in which only the most photoperiod-sensitive genotype survived winter sowing in two years. "

Two-layered flat bread baking quality was rather more tolerant of small amounts of damaged kernels, but additions of 10% or more had a significant effect on bread quality, and the presence of 20% damaged kernels made it impossible to produce satisfactory two-layered flat bread. Dough-handling properties were affected to the extent that the dough could not be moulded or sheeted, and the bread burned during the short (45 s) baking time. "

Chickpea planted in spring had a significantly higher number of damaged leaflets than the winter-sown crop.

A study to assess gender roles in agro-biodiversity conservation and management, investigating the contribution of women was conducted within the West Asia Dryland Agro-biodiversity project implemented in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine and Syria. In 2004, households’ surveys were conducted in two target areas per country with, 147 farms in Syria, 138 in Lebanon, 145 in Jordan and 140 in the Palestinian Authority. Women and men of different ages contribute to agricultural activities and agro-biodiversity conservation. The traditional farming systems prevalent in the target areas are predominantly using landraces for various field crops and fruit trees. Women are involved mainly in weeding, harvesting and food processing and transformation, while men are responsible for land preparation and planting. Their knowledge of the quality attributes of landraces and of the uses of medicinal, herbal and aromatic plants is an important driving force which sustain the use of these species at the farm level and contribute therefore to the on-farm/in situ conservation of the dryland agro-biodiversity. Off-farm income is as important as agricultural activities in sustaining the livelihoods of rural communities in the target areas. More empowerment actions of women, through adding-value and alternative sources of income options are needed to enhance their role in the conservation and sustainable use of this agro-biodiversity of global significance.

The findings reveal that understanding who is considered a farmer, at household and community levels, is biased by gender norms. Women in the study villages play substantial roles in farming and are increasingly involved in agricultural management, but they are generally overlooked or under-valued as farmers by both men and women, at the household and community levels. Men typically are considered to be ‘the farmers’ and women to be only their helpers. However, the findings also reveal a more nuanced understanding of the contribution of women and men to farming as households pragmatically deal with their needs and possibilities in the actual conditions they encounter.

Initial contents of extractable soil P (P-Olsen) were low at all sites: in the range of 2–5 ppm. The response of wheat to direct application of P and of lentil to residual P were described by a modified Mitscherlich equation accounting for the effect of rainfall on potential yield (under rainfed conditions) and on the availability of P to the crop.

abstract = "Abstract Fertilizers have been largely responsible for the massive increases in world food production in the past half century that permitted accelerated global population growth to current unprecedented levels. Fertilizer use not only impacts crop yields but also affects animal production. While nitrogen (N) has been the main driver of such changes, phosphorus (P) also has a major role. Like N, the use of P fertilizers can have implications beyond the farmers’ fields, if excessive amounts are applied. The past four decades have witnessed overuse of P fertilizers as well as animal manures in the intensive agricultures of some European countries and North America. Yet ironically in many areas of the world, notably Africa, agricultural output is largely constrained by low soil P in combination with little or no P fertilizer application. Rock phosphate is the global source of the raw material for P fertilizer. However, resources are finite, and therefore efficient and wise use is of paramount importance. The vast West Asia and North Africa (WANA) region is one where agricultural output is beset with major environmental constraints. Yet fertilizer use in the region is still in the incipient to early development stage, ironically in view of the fact that major deposits of exploitable rock phosphate are found in the region, mainly in Morocco and Tunisia. With the predominantly calcareous soils of the region being inherently low in available P, the main focus in the past few decades has been on promoting P use and its efficient management in rainfed and irrigated agriculture. In the 1960s and 1970s, virtually no fertilizer was used in the region, with rapid increases in N and to a lesser extent P since then. The sharp transition from low-input traditional agriculture to conventional modern agriculture has particular implications for efficient P fertilizer use from the economic and environmental standpoints. This review seeks to present a broad overview of P in countries of the \{WANA\} region, which varies considerably with respect to economic development and the level of agricultural research, education and extension. It presents the background global considerations with respect to P supplies and use, as well the agricultural context for the region, including climate and cropping systems; it draws heavily on research on soils and soil-P chemistry from Spain, which though technically excluded from WANA, has much in common with the Mediterranean region, and highlights P research from Pakistan at the eastern fringes of WANA. It highlights the discrepancy in P use between developed and developing countries such as those of WANA. The review to some extent builds on extensive research carried out in Syria by the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), with secondary emphasis on countries of the region, many of which collaborate closely with ICARDA. The review covers the past three decades, highlighting progress in field trials on fertilizer use with the region's main crops in relation to rainfall, cropping systems, soil test levels, and efforts to identify P-efficient genotypes and enhance soil P fertility with mycorrhizae. Despite the many isolated, uncoordinated, and often-overlapping, and indeed conflicting, research efforts that have taken place in the region, we have attempted to show a gradual progression in knowledge of P in relation to soils and crops. Developments with regard to P, in the overall framework of agricultural research, have contributed to increased output in the \{WANA\} region. Much of the documented research has contributed to the global information on soils of arid and semi-arid regions. Despite achievements in applied research, poorly developed technology transfer systems and weak analytical facilities remain as stumbling blocks to the widespread dissemination of the accumulated knowledge on P use to farmers.

CropSyst was calibrated using the findings of field experiments of 2005/06 and 2006/07 and validated for the 2007/08 season. A relative root mean squared error of 11% proved the accuracy between simulated and observed aboveground biomass and grain yield in 2007/08. Scenario analyses showed that N-leaching was high and ranged from 63 to 106 kg ha−1 when irrigated between 749 and 869 mm during the first two cropping seasons. The simulated N-leaching was lowest and ranged from 7 to 15 kg ha−1 when irrigation was only 148–395 mm during 2007/08. The considerable N losses during leaching and high N-uptakes by wheat together resulted in a negative N-balance even during applications of 180 and 240 kg ha−1 of N-fertilizer. N scarcity in the N-balance was reduced with increasing N-fertilizer amounts and ranged from −29 to −153 kg N ha−1 in 2005/06 and 2006/07. Despite a common shallow groundwater table in the region during some time of the year, scenario analysis revealed that only full irrigation water (580 mm) and N supply according to crop demand (180 kg ha−1) guaranteed high grain yields, unless the water table is permanently shallow to overcome irrigation deficits. Limited irrigation and N application (40% and 55% of ‘optimal’, respectively) in combination with a groundwater table below 3 m resulted in a 55% yield decline. The CropSyst wheat model proved a robust tool for assessing the influence of water and N dynamics under conditions of varying irrigation and shallow groundwater tables. It thus has potential as a decision support not only in northwest Uzbekistan, but also in comparable regions of Central Asia. "

Although remarkable success has been achieved to date in developing widely adapted wheat cultivars, many resource poor farmers in marginal areas in developing world have not benefited. Participatory research could greatly enhance identifying cultivars according to the choice of the poor farmers. This study was conducted to examine how farmers’ selection criteria could assist breeders in identifying superior wheat cultivars, and determine if a new statistical analysis tool, \{GGE\} biplot, could be effectively used in selection of improved cultivar based on quantitative (grain yield) and qualitative data (farmers’ preference score). The field experiments were conducted in 3 years (2003–2005) in three mid-hill districts in the central Nepal involving resource poor wheat farmers. Sixteen wheat genotypes, including a long-term and a current commercial cultivar, were used in the study. Data were collected on agronomic traits considered important by the participating farmers. These included days to heading and maturity, plant height, effective tiller number, spike length, kernel per spike, 1000-kernel weight and grain yield. Farmers also qualitatively scored each genotype for multiple traits based on their preference. In general, the farmers used the same traits in selecting a superior cultivar that are used by breeders. However, relative importance of different traits differed, not necessarily following in line with the breeder preference. The cultivar superiority based on quantitative agronomic data (breeders’ criteria) and qualitative preference scores (farmers’ criteria) often showed synergies, however, there were differences as well. This indicates farmers’ ability to choose superior cultivars based on qualitative observation compared to tedious quantitative data recording in the on-station testing. In the first year, a greater number of farmers selected improved check as a better choice than recent advanced breeding lines. In the 2nd and 3rd years, the farmers preferred genotypes other than the checks. This underlines the importance of testing of advanced materials in farmers’ fields in multiple years. Principal component analysis using GGE-biplot was useful in identifying superior genotypes based on both quantitative and qualitative data recorded across environments. This approach could be useful in analyzing data from participatory agricultural research conducted under highly diverse farmers’ field conditions where it is easier to record observations on qualitative than quantitative scale. This technique can also be extended to on-farm participatory testing of other technologies. The findings bear implications for a broad range of participatory research and technology evaluation and verification. "

Therefore, this experiment aimed to evaluate the effect of daily and alternate day supplementation of Moringa leaf meal (MLM) or soybean meal (SBM) to sheep on intake and digestion and glucose, protein and urea in blood plasma. Twenty Barbarine male lambs (average initial body weight, 27.3±3.0 kg), were randomly divided into four groups of five lambs each. They were adapted for 22 days to dietary treatments before starting a 6-day total collection period. All animals consumed oat hay ad libitum supplemented with concentrates composed of barley grain only (C-BAR) or mixed with \{SBM\} (C-SBM), or \{MLM\} (C-MLM) as protein sources. Groups 1 and 2 received daily C-SBM and C-MLM, respectively. However, groups 3 and 4 had access to concentrates containing the protein sources (C-SBM and C-MLM) with alternate day that means they received for one day these concentrates and in the following day they received barley grain only (C-BAR). Soybean meal and \{MLM\} incorporation in concentrates had similar effects (P&gt;0.05) on water, hay, and digestible organic matter (OM) intakes and DM, organic matter (OM) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility. Daily substitution of \{SBM\} by \{MLM\} increased (P=0.024) crude protein (CP) intake and apparent total tract digestibility. However, the alternate day supplementation decreased apparent total tract \{CP\} digestibility but increased \{CP\} intake for \{SBM\} treatment. The concentration of ruminal ammonia nitrogen before feeding was higher (P=0.012) in groups 1 and 3 than in the other groups. The concentration of blood glucose was similar (P&gt;0.05) among treatments. However, lambs receiving C-SBM exhibited highest concentrations of protein (P=0.039) and urea (P=0.001) in the blood. It is concluded that \{MLM\} administered at two day-intervals had similar effects on feed intake, digestion and blood metabolites to \{SBM\} incorporated in concentrate distributed to sheep receiving oat hay.

Agro-ecology and economies of Central Asia are heterogenous and very little is known about the impact of climate change at the sub-national levels. The bio-economic farm model (BEFM) is used for ex ante assessment of climate change impacts at sub-national levels in Central Asia. The \{BEFM\} is calibrated to 10 farming systems in Central Asia based on the household survey and crop growth experiment data. The production uncertainties and the adaptation options of agricultural producers to changing environments are considered paramount in the simulations. Very large differences in climate change impacts across the studied farming systems are found. The positive income gains in large-scale commercial farms in the northern regions of Kazakhstan and negative impact in small-scale farms in arid zones of Tajikistan are likely to happen. Producers in Kyrgyzstan may expect higher revenues but also higher income volatilities in the future. Agricultural producers in Uzbekistan may benefit in the near future but may lose their income in the distant future. The negative impacts could be further aggravated in arid zones of Central Asia if irrigation water availability decline due to climate change and water demand increase in upstream regions. The scenario simulations show that market liberalization and improved commodity exchange between the countries have very good potential to cope with the negative consequences of climate change. "

The two drought treatments were obtained by applying irrigation water when the pre-dawn leaf water potential of the control treatments attained values of −0.4 and −0.7 MPa, respectively. This experiment led to the analysis of the effects of salinity, of drought, and of the drought–salinity interaction on the grain and straw yield of the two crops studied. Salinity affected the durum wheat by reducing the grain and straw yields when the soil salinity (ECe) was higher than 5.8 dS m−1. This reduction was due to the fact that there were fewer grains per ear. As for barley, the grain yield was not reduced if \{ECe\} ranged from 0.9 to 9.8 dS m−1, but the straw yield was affected. The results obtained for durum and barley are consistent with the observations reported in the literature. Drought affected the plant water status of both species during the ear formation and flowering stages. It reduced the grain (37%) and straw (18%) yields, on average, at the same rate for all salinity levels. These reductions were not related to the soil salinity levels. There were fewer ears per plant, explaining the decrease in crop productivity and water use efficiency in conditions of drought. Drought did not affect the relationship between soil salinity and relative yield. "

This review starts by discussing which viruses are important in the principal cool-season grain legume crops in different parts of the world, the losses they cause and their economic impacts in relation to control. It then describes the main types of control measures available: host resistance, phytosanitary measures, cultural measures, chemical control, and biological control. Examples are provided of successful deployment of the different types of measures to control virus epidemics in cool-season grain legume crops. Next it emphasizes the need for integrated approaches to control because single control measures used alone rarely suffice to adequately reduce virus-induced yield losses in these crops. Development of effective integrated disease management (IDM) strategies depends on an interdisciplinary team approach to (i) understand the ecological and climatic factors which lead to damaging virus epidemics and (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of individual control measures. In addition to using virus-resistant cultivars, other \{IDM\} components include sowing virus-tested seed stocks, selecting cultivars with low seed transmission rates, using diverse phytosanitary or cultural practices that minimize the virus source or reduce its spread, and using selective pesticides in an environmentally responsible way. The review finishes by briefly discussing the implications of climate change in increasing problems associated with control and the opportunities to control virus diseases more effectively through new technologies.

The aim of this study was to compare different methods for the assessment of tillage erosion rates in sloping olive fields. Two basic approaches for the assessment of tillage erosion can be used; either marking the soil matrix, or using aggregate-sized tracers. These two approaches were applied and compared in olive fields to determine a relation between slope and average soil displacement. Aluminium cubes were used to represent the coarse fraction (CFT) and a sodium chloride solution was used to measure the movement of the fine fraction (FFM). The field experiments included 35 strip plots containing 40 aluminium tracers, on 18 different slopes ranging from 2 to 43% and 15 strip plots marked with 10 l of aqueous sodium chloride solution on the same slopes. Two working directions, up–down and along the contour, were analysed and compared. After tilling the plots, the positions of the aluminium tracers were recorded and samples were taken from the \{FFM\} plots. \{FFM\} redistribution was determined by measuring electrical conductivity of extract solutions. A statistical analysis revealed that there were no significant differences between the two methods. Soil loss and accumulation were calculated for one of the trial sites. Maximum soil loss values for contour tillage, were almost nine times less than for up and down tillage. "

A stochastic production frontier and inefficiency model has been estimated to measure the farm level inefficiency in irrigation water use. The results show that in Syria, the typical wheat farm is 28% less efficient in irrigation water use than the best farmer. It is also found that on average, these farms can achieve the current level of yield with 9% less irrigation water only by replacing the traditional surface canal irrigation schemes with sprinklers. This shift however results in only 2% improvement in a measure that combines both cost and technical efficiencies of irrigation water – a possible reason for 43% of the farms to continue using the traditional system despite government support for the purchase of sprinklers. Even among sprinkler users, there is 25% inefficiency in irrigation water use that needs to be curbed. These results suggest that farmer education and the introduction of water user charges that will increase the cost efficiency of sprinklers relative to the traditional methods may enhance water conservation through wider adoption and more efficient use of sprinklers.

The effects of tree plantations established under either furrow or drip irrigation were studied four years following afforestation and two years after irrigation ceased. For comparative study we also sampled fallow land, land with 80 years of tree growth, natural forest, desert ecosystems, and paddy rice fields. Initial furrow irrigation showed to be most effective in improving soil fertility after four years of afforestation; the respective plantations of Populus euphratica and Ulmus pumila showed significant levels of reduced soil salinity and increased aggregate stability and improved \{SOC\} stocks. The comparison of the long-term afforested land with the short-term equivalent suggested a C sequestration rate of 0.09–0.15 t C ha−1 year−1. The \{SOC\} stocks of the long-term afforestation site exceeded those of the native forest.

Low sheep milk price and a shift to dairy cattle were among the reasons for this decline. The main objective of this study was to report on the impact of farmers organization, technology transfer and market on reversing the dramatic decline of this native dairy sheep breed to a promising livestock development model. Having at the grassroots a “pioneer” who chose to form the Sicilo-Sarde breed association in 2003 was a key ingredient in the process of saving this breed from disappearance. Quick steps were first taken: Selling milk through the association allowed doubling its price in one year. A new legislation benefiting dairy sheep was introduced. A trilogy principle was followed where breed owners, researchers and policy makers interacted together to find optimum solutions that fit expressed needs of breed owners. An applied multidisciplinary research program was established and tackled major constraints faced by the breed in nutrition, management, reproduction, health, breeding and product development. Encouraged by an unsatisfied market and good prices, small farmers with a few cows started shifting to dairy sheep and poor new ones managed to get loans to purchase dairy sheep breeding animals. Based on a total of 7937 lactations recorded during the period 1997–2002, average milk yield, days in milk and suckling period were 89 kg ± 47 kg, 139 d ± 47 d and 104 d ± 22 d, respectively. Given the low producing ability of the breed and the impossibility of importing proven rams for health considerations, frozen semen from 17 Sarda rams was imported from Italy and 1600 ewes from 12 flocks were inseminated by intrauterine in 2005–2006. Fertility, prolificacy, and mortality rates varied from 47% to 63%, 157% to 184% and 0 to 34%, respectively. The decline of the breed was stopped and reversed and members of the association and small farmers in the region will benefit from the produced offspring. While currently the association is accessed by more organized producers, it provides an opportunity for the integration of smaller, poorer producers to improve their livelihoods. This case has inspired another group of farmers of a native sheep meat breed to form their own association to promote their breed. "

abstract = "Abstract In addition to nine major nutrients, eight micronutrients [i.e., boron (B), chlorine (Cl), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn)] are also essential for healthy growth and reproduction of higher plants. Globally, crop production is largely dependent on chemical fertilizer use, especially in developed countries. While fertilizer use, particularly nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), has increased substantially in the past four decades in developing countries, such as Pakistan and India, fertilizer use is limited in many areas of the world where agriculture is constrained by harsh climatic conditions, especially low rainfall. The disparity between developed and developing countries is particularly acute with respect to micronutrient awareness and use. One area of the world that is characterized by major climatic and soil constraints, often exacerbated by unfavorable socioeconomic conditions, is the Middle East–West Asia region. This review provides a current perspective on that region of the world where crop yields are invariably low due to drought, with limited inputs and inherent soil nutrient deficiencies. With a high population, there is an urgent need to sustainably expand output. However, there is generally limited awareness of the potential significance of micronutrients in agriculture as factors in crop production, as well as limited research on micronutrients in most countries of the region. The long history of cultivated agriculture in the Middle East–West Asia region and the peculiar characteristics of its soils and climate predispose it toward problems of micronutrient deficiencies. Over three decades ago, a global study on micronutrients indicated widespread deficiencies of iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn), in contrast to copper (Cu) and manganese (Mn), but suggested the likelihood of excess levels of boron (B) in some countries of the region. This overview primarily addresses three focal points in the region, Pakistan in the east, Syria/Lebanon/Turkey in the center, and Spain on the western fringes, reflecting the zones of activity of the respective authors; the latter focal point is a developed region, where, because of soil and climatic similarities, the research is relevant to the whole Middle East–West Asia region. While providing some international context, this article brings together and summarizes published work in the areas of crop and soil micronutrient availability, their behavior in soils in relation to crop growth, and strategies to deal with either deficiency or toxicity, including crop selection for tolerance and subsequent genetic manipulation. Considerable strides have been made in elucidating the significance of both Zn and Fe in the region's mainly calcareous soils, through soil and plant analysis, with the resulting knowledge providing a sound basis for management interventions through validated field research. While B deficiency is common in some countries such as Pakistan, the problem of B toxicity (BT), where it exists, is only handled by crop adaptation. The review also highlights the implications of micronutrient constraints in the soil–plant–human–animal continuum. Intensification of agricultural production as a result of overall macronutrient use, expansion of irrigation, and introduction of new or “niche” crops is likely to accentuate micronutrient deficiencies in the region, but developments such as conservation agriculture may counteract this trend. As the trend for land-use intensification increases because of higher yields due to fertilizer use and irrigation and the introduction of new crops, and as other nutrient constraints are eliminated, micronutrients will inevitably assume greater significance in the future agriculture of the Middle East–West Asia region together with improvements in plant breeding and crop management.

To find out how this form of livestock husbandry relates to the other main farming sub-systems, cattle-keeping was compared with cassava and black pepper production. Data was collected from 37 cattle-keeping, mixed smallholdings, during 15 visits, at monthly intervals. The three sub-systems were studied in terms of productive efficiency of resource use, socio-economic contribution, and ecosystem-friendliness, using cash flow, non-market output and non-parametric rankings. Their relative performances in each domain were ranked and put on an \{AMOEBA\} diagram, “a general method of system description and assessment”. The markings connected across functions produced an outline of a polygon, reminding the shape of an amoeba. It was found that productive efficiency was lowest in cattle, benefit:cost ratio was highest in cassava, while return to labour was especially strong in black pepper production. The highest status, lowest production risk, highest liquidity and ease of sale, related to cattle. Cattle and pastures ranked worst in terms of biodiversity, damage to and pollution of water courses. Nutrient losses were highest in cassava, due to the large amount harvested. The differences in function meant that the three polygons occupied different segments of the circular diagram. Nevertheless, together they formed a well-rounded shape. The amoeboid nature of these polygons can be used to predict the effect of a shift of activity on the farm, making the diagram a useful illustrative tool for planning and teaching. "

The highest yields were achieved by recent varieties Kinaci-97 (5.48 t ha− 1), Cetinel-2000 (5.39 t ha− 1), Alpu-2001 (5.44 t ha− 1), Ahmetaga (5.35 t ha− 1), and Ekiz-2004 (5.42 t ha− 1) compared to older varieties Yektay-406 (4.17 t ha− 1) and Bezostaya-1 (4.27 t ha− 1) released in the 1960s. The progress reached in grain yield in 20 years was 1.16 t ha− 1 or 58 kg ha− 1 (1.37%) per year. This gain was mainly achieved through shorter plant height and increased harvest index. There was no clear tendency of changes in specific yield components demonstrating that new high-yielding varieties may have different ways to reach their yield potentials. The yield gains were accompanied by improved stripe rust and leaf rust resistances primarily based on adult plant resistance genes. The grain quality of the new varieties did not deteriorate over time although most of them were inferior to the bread-making quality check Bezostaya-1, a feature that may require attention in future breeding.

abstract = "Many smallholder breeding programs in developing countries failed because of neglecting basic conditions, particularly the no involvement of farmers in a participatory manner from design to the implementation phase of the programs. Inadequate centralized breeding plans to improve local breeds and various plans prescribing crossbreeding with European highly producing breeds, failed. Though some nucleus breeding programs were successful and attained some sustainability if the farmers’ participation was considered, they still are vulnerable once the funding provided ends. An evolving approach, emerging from participatory research experiences, involves community-based breeding programs for smallholder farmers in low-input systems. These are being implemented in pilot research sites with promising results and already rendering lessons learned that merit consideration in relation with the sustainability of a program. The paper discusses important factors for the success of these programs. Farmers’ participation along with main issues for program implementation are highlighted in relation to site selection, the communication processes, recording schemes, role of scientists, the institutionalisation of cooperation and the enabling environment. Finally, ongoing case studies of successful community-based breeding programs are mentioned. Shortcomings in farmers’ participation require attention and institutional strengthening for effective application of participatory tools and knowledge exchange between farmers and researchers. But participatory research alone is not the sole prescription for success. No matter how participatory the plans will be, they will always depend on technical support and institutional support for data collection, analysis and feedback. This is hindered because of the short-term projection of funding for research projects. An important issue relates to the out scaling of successful experiences at project level that benefits only a limited number of farmers. The only avenue to guarantee sustainability is that government priorities (local or national) emphasize community-based breeding as a viable alternative for smallholder improvement on a long-term basis, and development and appropriate policies provide the enabling environment for realization and adoption at a large scale. Under these conditions research will have an advisory and facilitating role whereas ownership of the program will go to the community-level. "

However wide differences exist in the costs of the different equipment deployed to measure vegetation indices (e.g. spectroradiometers versus conventional red/green/blue cameras) or canopy temperature (infrared thermometers versus thermal cameras). In this study we compared different methodological approaches measuring vegetation indices and canopy temperature in durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum (Desf.) Husn.) and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under different water conditions. These two categories of indices were correlated against grain yield during two consecutive years and with total biomass as well as water status (evaluated as carbon isotope composition, δ13C, and stomatal conductance) and nitrogen status (nitrogen and chlorophyll content) of the flag leaf during the first year. For the two crop species, and regardless of the device used, vegetation indices (the green area and the greener area) obtained with conventional cameras and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measured with a spectroradiometer were significantly correlated with grain yield, δ13C and stomatal conductance. Moreover, while canopy temperature measured with a thermal camera was better related to grain yield and δ13C than when measured with a low cost device such as an infrared thermometer, the latter approach still performs reasonably well when assessing yield and water status. This study highlights the usefulness of low-cost approaches to assess crop growth and water status in wheat under Mediterranean conditions. "

In this study, we examined the impacts of drought on three vegetation indices (NDVI, enhanced vegetation index, EVI, and land surface water index, LSWI) and \{CO2\} flux from three tallgrass prairie eddy flux tower sites in the U.S. Gross primary production (GPP) was also modeled using a satellite-based Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), and the modeled \{GPP\} (GPPVPM) was compared with the \{GPP\} (GPPEC) derived from eddy covariance measurements. Precipitation at two sites in Oklahoma was 30% below the historical mean in both years of the study period (2005–2006), while the site in Illinois did not experience drought in the 2005–2007 study period. The \{EVI\} explained the seasonal dynamics of \{GPP\} better than did NDVI. The \{LSWI\} dropped below zero during severe droughts in the growing season, showing its potential to track drought. The result shows that \{GPP\} was more sensitive to drought than were vegetation indices, and \{EVI\} and \{LSWI\} were more sensitive than NDVI. We developed a modified function (Wscalar), calculated as a function of LSWI, to account for the effect of severe droughts on \{GPP\} in VPM. The \{GPPVPM\} from the modified \{VPM\} accounted for the rapid reduction in \{GPP\} during severe droughts and the seasonal dynamics of \{GPPVPM\} agreed reasonably well with GPPEC. Our analysis shows that 8-day averaged values (temperature, vapor-pressure deficit) do not reflect the short-term extreme climate events well, suggesting that satellite-based models may need to be run at daily or hourly scales, especially under unfavorable climatic conditions.

The article presents the case study of \{EEZ\} in Cajamarca, Peru to analyse the \{LUP\} process in a situation of conflicting interests over future land and water use. Cajamarca is a department with rich gold deposits in the headwater catchment area upstream of the city of Cajamarca.

Therefore, the \{EEZ\} process became part of a controversy between a powerful pro-mining coalition led by the central government and a conservation coalition led by the regional government.

However, despite their proven advantages in small dataset tests, their performance is variable and less satisfactory while dealing with large datasets, particularly, for regional-scale mapping with high resolution data due to the complexity and diversity in landscapes and land cover patterns, and the unacceptably long processing time. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the comparatively highest performance of an operational approach based on integration of multisource information ensuring high mapping accuracy in large areas with acceptable processing time. The information used includes phenologically contrasted multiseasonal and multispectral bands, vegetation index, land surface temperature, and topographic features. The performance of different conventional and machine learning classifiers namely Malahanobis Distance (MD), Maximum Likelihood (ML), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Random Forests (RFs) was compared using the same datasets in the same \{IDL\} (Interactive Data Language) environment. An Eastern Mediterranean area with complex landscape and steep climate gradients was selected to test and develop the operational approach. The results showed that \{SVMs\} and \{RFs\} classifiers produced most accurate mapping at local-scale (up to 96.85% in Overall Accuracy), but were very time-consuming in whole-scene classification (more than five days per scene) whereas \{ML\} fulfilled the task rapidly (about 10 min per scene) with satisfying accuracy (94.2–96.4%). Thus, the approach composed of integration of seasonally contrasted multisource data and sampling at subclass level followed by a \{ML\} classification is a suitable candidate to become an operational and effective regional land cover mapping method.

Attempts since the 1960's to introduce this system to Mediterranean west Asia and north Africa (the native region of medic) have not lead to significant adoption; farmers in the region recognize medic, but as a weed and natural pasture plant. This first detailed economic evaluation of the rotational medic system was conducted using a whole-farm linear programming model based on the agricultural system of north-west Syria. The model represents in detail impacts of rotation on yields, labor requirements of alternative farm activities, availability of family and hired labor, subsistence income requirements, livestock feed sources and uses at different times and a choice of sheep stocking rates. Biological data for the analysis are based on a large six-year cropping and grazing experiment near Aleppo on terra-rossa soil with rainfall mainly in winter and averaging about 330 mm annually. The trial compared a dryland medic-wheat system and traditional two-year rotations of wheat with: fallow, watermelon, lentil and vetch. Results indicate that, given current prices and yields from the trial, medic is less profitable than traditional rotations. The model was used to investigate situations in which medic would be economically preferred. Selection of a medic rotation by the model was found to be particularly sensitive to the area of the farm and the price of labor. On small farms, labor availability per hectare is high, favouring the production of labor intensive crops such as lentil and watermelon. On larger farms, labor costs of these enterprises are substantial, increasing the relative profitability of medic, especially if labor prices increase. Interestingly, the relative desirability of medic is more sensitive to its impact on subsequent wheat crops than to the level of pasture production. We also found that modest increases in the prices of sheep products (especially milk) have a major impact on the economic performance of medic. These insights will allow improved focusing and targeting of future research and extension activities. "

The study aims to identify goat breeding objectives in three production systems of Ethiopia based on revealed and stated preference information. Market transaction surveys as well as choice experiments (CE) were conducted in three production systems of Ethiopia. Relationships between goats’ attributes and prices were estimated by hedonic modeling, while economic values of traits included in the \{CE\} were estimated by conditional logit (CL) model. Part worth value of a trait which indicates the relative importance of a trait was calculated based on the implicit prices farmers were willing to pay (WTP) for an improvement of a trait. The hedonic regression results showed that body weight was a consistent determinant of goat price in all observed markets. While, attributes such as body condition, age and season had heterogeneous effect on market prices of goats. The \{CL\} analysis indicated that farmers living in harsh environments valued functional traits such as disease resistance more than performance traits. Based on revealed preferences and choice models, alternative breeding options, which are in line with farmers’ trait preferences and market demands, were suggested. The suggested alternative trait combinations and their economic values could be used as an input for optimization of the breeding schemes after considering heritability, genetic and phenotypic correlations.

Alternate tillage and crop establishment practices are important management strategies for tackling the issues of soil health deterioration and over exploitation of underground water resources, particularly in rice based intensive crop rotations. The conservation agriculture (CA) based tillage and crop establishment practices such as zero tillage (ZT) and permanent raised beds (PB) hold potential to enhance soil organic carbon (SOC), physical and biological properties for sustainability of soil health. Therefore, a long term study was conducted to evaluate the twelve combinations of tillage practices (03) and irrigated intensive maize based crop rotations (04) on organic carbon, physical properties and microbial biomass and enzymatic activities of a sandy loam (Typic Haplustept) soil in north-western India. The tillage practices consisted of ZT, \{PB\} and conventional tillage (CT) in main plots and four diversified intensive maize based crop rotations (MWMb: Maize-Wheat-Mungbean, MCS: Maize-Chickpea-Sesbaina, MMuMb: Maize-Mustard-Mungbean, MMS: Maize-Maize-Sesbania) in sub plots. In this study we analysed the SOC, physical and biological properties of soil at various depths after 7 years of continuous ZT, \{PB\} and \{CT\} in diversified maize rotations. Compared to \{CT\} plots, the soil physical properties like water stable aggregates (WSA) &gt; 250 μm were 16.1-32.5% higher, and bulk density (BD) and penetration resistance (PR) showed significant (P &lt; 0.05) decline (11.0–14.3 and 11.2–12.0%) in \{ZT\} and \{PB\} plots at 0–15 and 15–30 cm soil layers. The soil organic carbon (SOC) increased by 34.6-35.3% at 0–15 cm, and 23.6-26.5% at 15–30 cm soil depths with conservation agriculture (ZT and PB) based crop establishment techniques over CT. Similarly, the soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) under \{CA\} based systems increased by 45–48.9% in 0–30 cm profile depth of a sandy loam (Typic Haplustept) soil. Significant (P &lt; 0.05) improvement in soil enzymatic activities i.e., Fluorescein diacetate, dehydrogenase, β Glucosidase and Alkaline phosphatase was also recorded in the \{CA\} based treatments. Significant (P &lt; 0.05) synergistic effects of summer legumes (mungbean and Sesbania) with winter legume/cereal in crop rotations were observed on SOC,WSA, BD, \{PR\} and Ksat at 0–15 and 15–30 cm depths. Interaction between tillage and crop rotations were significant (P &lt; 0.05) for soil organic carbon, physical properties and enzymatic activities. Thus our long-term study suggests that \{CA\} based crop management with selected diversified maize based rotations (MCS and MWMb) can be advocated as sustainable intensification strategy in light textured soils of north-western India and other similar agro-ecologies of South Asia.

Eight nomads agreed on improving fleece weight, body weight and down yield while reducing cashmere fibre diameter of white coated goats. Economic weights were calculated to define a breeding objective. Each nomad established a breeding nucleus selecting visually his best 40 does and two bucks from about 250 goats. Nomads used different systems to ensure separate mating of nucleus and general herd animals. Nomads were also able to identify the progeny of each buck. Nucleus progenies were recorded for weaning weight and fleece weight. Fleece samples were collected for analyses of down yield and down fibre diameter. General herd male progeny was castrated. Formal selection indices were used to select nucleus male replacements. To construct the indices phenotypic and genetic parameters were taken from project data and published figures. Accuracy of indices ranged 0.47 to 0.66 depending on the traits included. The inferior buck based on progeny index average was replaced by the best young buck available. Other high ranked young bucks were used in the general herd. The breeding program is in its fourth cycle and favourable selection differentials were confirmed for selected bucks in all traits of interests, in particular for down weight and down diameter, 62 g and −0.5 μm, respectively. The expected benefit of the program is about 4.0 \{USD\} accumulating per goat and per year. Fleece testing is an issue since the region lacks a fleece testing service. If fleece sampling is discontinued the expected benefit reduces to about 2.8 \{USD\} per goat and per year. Circular use of bucks to control inbreeding and participation of additional nomad families are planned for the future. This experience shows that a participatory breeding program can be successfully implemented under nomadic conditions through intensive collaboration of nomad herders, regional extension officers and scientists.

In this study, we investigated the diversity and patterns of wild landscapes in relation to ecological factors, human disturbances and land protection regime in the Mo river basin (Central Togo). First, we used geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing techniques to quantify and spatially explicit the major land cover types occurring in the area. We performed a supervised classification of Landsat 8 image from 2014. Next, we used vegetation ordination and classification methods to detect vegetation group types and their similarity level from forest inventory data collected at 75 sites. Data from soil samples at the 75 sites and DEM-based topographical indices were used as biophysical variables to analyze factors of current landscape structure. Both satellite image classification and the outputs from ordination methods indicated that three major vegetation types (forestlands, woodlands and savannahs/shrubs) occurred in protected (PA) and unprotected (UPA) areas. Image classification showed that savannahs/shrubs are the most widespread vegetation types (54.4%) while forestlands and woodlands cover 10.4% and 26.4% of the total area, respectively. \{UPA\} showed high rates of human disturbances that shaped the occurrence of a fourth vegetation type made up mainly by degraded savannahs and woodlands. Along the land protection gradient, the landscapes are driven by soil nutrients and moisture, in combination with the influence of topography and human disturbances. In both \{PA\} and UPA, and along protection gradient, majority of features exhibited significant differences among plant communities. The spatial analyses combined with the field data providing information on vegetation cover, species richness, and human footprint indices suggested that some areas outside protection still exhibit high potentials for land conservation. In multifunctional landscapes of Mo basin, conservation strategies could also be encouraged in the wild landscapes of community common lands to promote both biodiversity conservation and sustainable provision of ecosystem services.

In vitro anthelmintic effects of camel milk against Haemonchus contortus from sheep were ascertained by egg hatching and worm motility inhibitions in comparison to milks from cow, ewe and goat as well as a reference drug albendazole. Chemical composition revealed that camel milk has higher contents of protective protein (lactoferrin) and vitamin C than other species’ milk. It showed ovicidal activity at all tested concentrations and completely inhibited egg hatching at a concentration close to 100 mg/mL (inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 42.39 mg/mL). Camel milk revealed in vitro activity against adult parasites in terms of the paralysis and/or death of the worms at different hours post treatment. After 8 h of exposure, it induced 100% mortality at the highest tested concentration. There was 82.3% immobility of worms in albendazole 8 h post-exposition. No such effects were seen with the other species’ milks. Bioactive compounds such as lactoferrin and vitamin C may be involved in such an effect. To our knowledge, these results depict for the first time that camel milk possesses in vitro anthelmintic properties and further in vitro and in vivo trials against different parasite species and stages are required to make use of this milk for the control of gastrointestinal nematode parasites.

The results show that the new proposed Gaussian \{DYB\} model estimates daily solar radiation better than other \{DYB\} models. Furthermore, a seasonal analysis shows that the model has good performance in all seasons, including in the rainy season.

Its development coincides with the growing period of its main food plant, a tall reed grass (Phragmites australis), which represents the predominant vegetation in the delta and which cover vast areas of the former Aral Sea, which is desiccating since the 1960s. Current locust survey methods and control practices would tremendously benefit from accurate and timely spatially explicit information on the potential locust habitat distribution. To that aim, satellite observation from the \{MODIS\} Terra/Aqua satellites and in-situ observations were combined to monitor potential locust habitats according to their corresponding risk of infestations along the growing season. A Random Forest (RF) algorithm was applied for classifying time series of \{MODIS\} enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from 2003 to 2014 at an 8-day interval. Based on an independent ground truth data set, classification accuracies of reeds posing a medium or high risk of locust infestation exceeded 89% on average. For the 12-year period covered in this study, an average of 7504 km2 (28% of the observed area) was flagged as potential locust habitat and 5% represents a permanent high risk of locust infestation. Results are instrumental for predicting potential locust outbreaks and developing well-targeted management plans. The method offers positive perspectives for locust management and treatment of infested sites because it is able to deliver risk maps in near real time, with an accuracy of 80% in April-May which coincides with both locust hatching and the first control surveys. Such maps could help in rapid decision-making regarding control interventions against the initial locust congregations, and thus the efficiency of survey teams and the chemical treatments could be increased, thus potentially reducing environmental pollution while avoiding areas where treatments are most likely to cause environmental degradation.

The availability of genomic resources is limited in this crop species. The objective of this study was to develop polymorphic markers in lentil using publicly available curated expressed sequence tag information (ESTs). In this study, 9513 \{ESTs\} were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database to develop unigene-based simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The \{ESTs\} were assembled into 4053 unigenes and then analyzed to identify 374 \{SSRs\} using the \{MISA\} microsatellite identification tool. Among the 374 SSRs, 26 compound \{SSRs\} were observed. Primer pairs for these \{SSRs\} were designed using Primer3 version 1.14. To classify the functional annotation of \{ESTs\} and EST–SSRs, \{BLASTx\} searches (using E-value 1 × 10− 5) against the public UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/) and \{NCBI\} (http://www.ncbi.nlh.nih.gov/) databases were performed. Further functional annotation was performed using \{PLAZA\} (version 3.0) comparative genomics and \{GO\} annotation was summarized using the Plant \{GO\} slim category. Among the synthesized 312 primers, 219 successfully amplified Lens DNA. A diverse panel of 24 Lens genotypes was used to identify polymorphic markers. A polymorphic set of 57 markers successfully discriminated the test genotypes. This set of polymorphic markers with functional annotation data could be used as molecular tools in lentil breeding. "

This study compared in-situ chamber-based measures of soil CH4, N2O, and \{CO2\} fluxes for silt loam soil under corn and soybean cropping with conventional tile drainage (UTD) and controlled tile drainage (CTD). A semi-empirical model (NEMIS-NOE) was also used to predict soil \{N2O\} fluxes from soils using observed soil data. Observed \{N2O\} and \{CH4\} fluxes between \{UTD\} and \{CTD\} fields during the farming season were not significantly different at 0.05 level. Soils were primarily a sink for \{CH4\} but in some cases a source (sources were associated exclusively with CTD). The average \{N2O\} fluxes measured ranged between 0.003 and 0.028 kg N ha−1 day−1. There were some significantly higher (p ≤ 0.05) \{CO2\} fluxes associated with \{CTD\} relative to \{UTD\} during some years of study. Correlation analyses indicated that the shallower the water table, the greater the \{CO2\} fluxes. Higher corn plant C for \{CTD\} tended to offset estimated higher \{CTD\} \{CO2\} C losses via soil respiration by ∼100–300 kg C ha−1. There were good fits between observed and predicted (NEMIS–NOE) \{N2O\} fluxes for corn (R2 = 0.70) and soybean (R2 = 0.53). Predicted \{N2O\} fluxes were higher for \{CTD\} for approximately 70% of the paired-field study periods suggesting that soil physical factors, such as water-filled pore space, imposed by \{CTD\} have potentially strong impacts on net N fluxes. Model predictions of daily cumulative \{N2O\} fluxes for the agronomically-active study period for corn-CTD and corn-UTD, as a percentage of total N fertilizer applied, were 3.1% and 2.6%, respectively. For predicted \{N2O\} fluxes on basis of yield units, indices were 0.0005 and 0.0004 (kg N kg−1 crop grain yield) for \{CTD\} and \{UTD\} corn fields, respectively, and 0.0011 and 0.0005 for \{CTD\} and \{UTD\} soybean fields, respectively.

Considering the importance of better wastewater management at the local and national levels, there is a need for updated national data on wastewater generation, treatment, and use, which would also assist in regional and global wastewater assessments. While searching data and literature in published or electronic forms for 181 countries, we find that only 55 countries have data available on all three aspects of wastewater – generation, treatment, and use. The number of countries with one or two aspects of wastewater generation, treatment, and use is 69, while there is no information available from 57 countries. Of the available information, only 37% of the data could be categorized as recent (reported during 2008–2012). The available data suggest that high-income countries on average treat 70% of the generated wastewater, followed by upper-middle-income countries (38%), lower-middle-income countries (28%), and low-income countries, where only 8% of the wastewater generated is treated. The availability of current information on wastewater generation, treatment, and use is crucially important for policy makers, researchers, and practitioners, as well as public institutions, to develop national and local action plans aiming at safe and productive use of wastewater in agriculture, aquaculture, and agroforestry systems. The country level information aggregated at the regional and global levels would help in identifying the gaps in pertinent data availability and assessing the potential of wastewater in food, feed, and fish production at different scales.

The seasonal estimates of gs showed an apparent decline under high evaporative demand in all moisture regimes.

abstract = "Given current demographic trends and future growth projections, as much as 60% of the global population may suffer water scarcity by the year 2025. The water-use efficiency techniques used with conventional resources have been improved. However, water-scarce countries will have to rely more on the use of non-conventional water resources to partly alleviate water scarcity. Non-conventional water resources are either generated as a product of specialized processes such as desalination or need suitable pre-use treatment and/or appropriate soil–water–crop management strategies when used for irrigation. In water-scarce environments, such water resources are accessed through the desalination of seawater and highly brackish groundwater, the harvesting of rainwater, and the use of marginal-quality water resources for irrigation. The marginal-quality waters used for irrigation consist of wastewater, agricultural drainage water, and groundwater containing different types of salts. In many developing countries, a major part of the wastewater generated by domestic, commercial, and industrial sectors is used for crop production in an untreated or partly treated form. The protection of public health and the environment are the main concerns associated with uncontrolled wastewater irrigation. The use of saline and/or sodic drainage water and groundwater for agriculture is expected to increase. This warrants modifications in the existing soil, irrigation, and crop management practices used, in order to cope with the increases in salinity and sodicity that will occur. It is evident that water-scarce countries are not able to meet their food requirements using the conventional and non-conventional water resources available within their boundaries. Another option that may help to achieve food security in these countries is the ‘physical’ transportation of water and food items across basins, countries, and regions. Long-distance movement of surface freshwater or groundwater and transporting the water inland via large pipelines or across the sea in extremely large bags are examples of ‘physical’ transportation. Most interregional water transportation projects are still in their infancy, though the trade of food items between countries has been going on since international trade began. Although food is imported in the international food trade, the water used to produce the food that is imported into water-scarce countries is equivalent to large water savings for those countries: without the imports, almost the same amount of water would be needed to produce that food domestically. The term ‘virtual water’ has been used to illustrate the important role that water plays in the trade in food between countries with a water surplus and those with a water deficit, which must rely in part on importing food to ensure food security. Because the major food-exporting countries subsidize their agricultural production systems, food-importing countries need to consider both the policies and political situations of food-exporting countries, while simultaneously using food trade as a strategic instrument to overcome water scarcity and food deficits. This paper reviews the literature and issues associated with the use of non-conventional water resources and opportunities for achieving food security in water-scarce countries. "

abstract = "Precision agriculture relies on using advanced tools to map and subsequently manage the variability across the field. There is an emerging interest in mapping apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) as a surrogate spatial map for soil texture, providing the potential for \{ECa\} mapping as a practical tool to delineate soil-based management zones for variable rate application of agricultural inputs. Results from literature are mixed and inconsistent with the practical utility of \{ECa\} to map texture (or clay content) remaining elusive because of the complex interactions between \{ECa\} and soil transient properties. The objective of this study was to explore \{ECa\} relationships with soil properties and evaluate the usefulness of \{ECa\} mapping to infer soil texture as soil water content changed from one mapping date to the next. Measurements included multiple field-scale \{ECa\} mappings of a 110 ha dryland field of 12 alternating wheat and fallow strips from 2001 to 2003, complemented with extensive soil profile sampling (198 locations) and analysis. Soil \{ECa\} values changed across mapping dates and exhibited weak temporal associations. For instance, \{ECa\} values increased by three fold from 10 mS/m in September 2001 (after wheat harvest) to 30 mS/m in May 2003 (in the emerged wheat crop). Volumetric soil water content was the dominant factor affecting the spatial and temporal \{ECa\} variability, with other measured soil properties having nearly equal, but weak to moderate, correlations with ECa. For the dryland field examined herein and under relatively dry soil water contents, \{ECa\} maps represent overall soil variability with limited utility in providing zones of texture similarities for site-specific management.

Crop yield showed considerable variability among locations, years and genotypes. Path coefficient analysis indicated that rainfall and days to maturity have a large positive influence on yield. High level of micronutrients Mn2+ and S2− negatively affected yield. Path analysis revealed that Zn2+/P, days to maturity, yield and K+ were dominant variables affecting the response variable β-ODAP (β-N-oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid), the neuro-excitatory amino acid in grass pea seeds considered as the cause of neurolathyrism. Linear correlation analysis between β-ODAP and the 35 factors considered showed that β-ODAP level was positively correlated (r &gt; 0.70) with K+ and sunshine hours (ssh) and negatively correlated (r &lt; 0.70) with soil pH, days to maturity and yield. The strongest correlation of ssh with β-ODAP level was found during the phase of crop maturity.

It is important to evaluate the potential consequences of such a breeding strategy on herd dynamics. For this purpose, a dynamic, stochastic herd model was built. The model adopts a system dynamics methodology to study the effect of genetic improvement of body weight on herd dynamics and profitability. The length of the time horizon was 240 months (20 years). The first 120 months served as a baseline scenario, where the fattening of culled breeding rams was practiced. For the second 120 months genetic selection of body weight was introduced considering two scenarios: culled ram and lamb fattening. Results from the model showed a gradual decrease in sheep population size while body weight of the animals improved. The model keeps heavier animals in smaller flocks to match the herd dry matter demand with the available resources. The simulation also demonstrates that breeding for heavier body weight was considerably more profitable than the baseline scenario; and lamb fattening was more profitable than culled ram fattening, as the current practice. Furthermore, voluntary culling may be used to balance herd size with available feed resources. The introduction of a more intensive system that provides more feed resources by resourceful smallholders can be used to achieve higher income without reducing flock size. Further work is however needed to evaluate the model introduced here against field results. "

The herds were randomly chosen in the summer grazing area of nomads within 20 km of the city of Baft, province of Kerman, South of Iran, the main cashmere producing area in Iran. Cashmere yield (CY) was determined from the weight of dehaired cashmere to weight of shorn fiber. Cashmere fibers were analyzed using an \{OFDA\} instrument. A general mixed linear model including sex, age and sex by age interaction as fixed effects and herd as random effect was used to analyze the data and measure the relationships between different cashmere characteristics and fleece attributes. The overall means ± standard deviations were for fleece weights (FW) 507 ± 183 g, cashmere yield (CY) 56.5 ± 12.2%, mean fiber diameter (MFD) 19.7 ± 1.5 μm, fiber diameter standard deviation (FDSD) 4.5 ± 0.6 μm, fiber curvature (FC) 62.9 ± 8.5°/mm and staple length (SL) 54.2 ± 7.0 mm, respectively. Herd effect was significant for all traits except for \{SL\} and sex by age effect was only significant for MFD. One year old males and females had finer cashmere than older goats. \{FW\} and \{FDSD\} were higher in males and \{CY\} and \{FC\} was higher in young animals. Pearson correlation between \{MFD\} and FC, \{FDSD\} and MFD, \{MFD\} and \{FW\} was −0.647, 0.399 and 0.211 respectively.

Although it is a good source of plant nutrients, such sewage also increases the heavy metal load to soils, which may impact the food chain. Management options for sewage contaminated soils includes addition of nontoxic compounds such as lime, calcium sulfate and organic matter, which form insoluble metal complexes, thus reducing metal phytoavailability to plants. In this paper we review the variation in irrigation quality of sewage at different sites and its impact on the quality of soils and vegetables. Although quality of sewage was highly variable at source, yet the effluent from food industries was relatively safe for irrigation. In comparison effluent samples collected from textile, dyeing, calendaring, steel industry, hospitals and clinical laboratories, foundries and tanneries were hazardous with respect to soluble salts, sodium adsorption ratio and heavy metals like zinc, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, cobalt and cadmium. The sewage quality in main drains was better than that at the industry outlet, but was still not safe for irrigation. In general, higher accumulation of metals in fruits and vegetable roots was recorded compared to that in plant leaves. Edible parts of vegetables (fruits and/or leaves) accumulated metals more than the permissible limits despite the soils contained ammonium bicarbonate diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid extractable metals within a safe range. In either case further scientific investigations are needed to ensure safe management strategies. Cadmium appeared to be the most threatening metal especially in leafy vegetables. It is advisable to avoid leafy vegetables cultivation in sewage irrigated areas everywhere to restrict its entry into food chain. "

The imposed irrigation regime and the leaching of light sierosem soils led to the dissolution and subsequent leaching of inherent gypsum and organic matter from the soil profile. Further, the domination of bicarbonate in the irrigation water promoted weathering of the carbonate minerals present as calcite. The higher concentrations of Mg2+ in comparison to Ca2+ in the irrigation water resulted in the replacement of Na+ by Mg2+ on the cation exchange complex. In the lower part of the command area, shallow groundwater has contributed to the accumulation of Na+ and to a large extent of Mg2+ on the cation exchange sites. "

Phenotypic evaluations were performed at a dry (Breda) and wet (Tel Hadya) location in Syria. Genome wide association study was done with 816 markers comprised of 710 diversity array technology (DArT), 61 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and 45 microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Diversity analysis revealed 5 groups of germplasm, related to origin (Middle East, North Africa), structural information (two-rows), and domestication (wild versus domesticated). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) decayed after 3 cM with a few exceptions at 10 and 15 cM. Although a few \{QTLs\} were identified that differed between the dry and wet site, these \{QTLs\} explained low phenotypic variation and could not unequivocally be related to drought tolerance when compared to earlier linkage mapping based \{QTL\} analysis studies. Therefore, \{GWA\} analysis seems to be not very effective for identification of major \{QTLs\} for complex traits like drought tolerance in highly structured germplasm collections. "

In the difference method, an apparent recovery fraction (ARF) is calculated from the N uptake by fertilized and unfertilized crops, whereas in the isotope-dilution method a 15N recovery fraction (15SNRF) is calculated from isotope-ratio analysis and N uptake by fertilized crops. The recovery fractions calculated by the two methods are compared on the basis of simplified models for the distribution of 15N-labeled N over different N pools in the soil-crop system, considering plant uptake and mineralization-immobilization in soil. In N-deficient soils, ARF-values are likely to be higher than those of 15SNRF, due to pool substitution. Plant uptake and immobilization do not affect the relationship between \{ARF\} and 15SNRF, as these processes do not discriminate between 15N and 15N. However, immobilization reduces the range of values of \{ARF\} and 15NRF. Mineralization is the main factor causing the discrepancy between \{ARF\} and 15NRF. It results in dilution of the soil mineral N pool with soil-derived N and thus affects the 15N/15N ratio in the soil mineral N pool. The combined action of mineralization-immobilization and plant uptake increases the effect of dilution of the soil mineral N pool by (re)miner-alized soil N. The effects of plant uptake and mineralization-immobilization on the relationship between 15NRF and \{ARF\} are discussed and analytical expressions are derived for the relevant quantities considered in the model. The difference and the isotope-dilution method measure essentially different quantities and complementary information can be derived from recovery fractions calculated by the two methods, thus contributing to the understanding of fertilizer N-dynamics and transformations in soil.

In this study the ecophysiological performance of the ‘Nure’ (winter) × ‘Tremois’ (spring) barley mapping population (118 Doubled Haploids, DHs) was evaluated in a multi-environment trial of eighteen site–year combinations across the Mediterranean Basin during two consecutive harvest years (2004 and 2005). Mean grain yield of sites ranged from 0.07 to 5.43 t ha−1, clearly dependent upon both the total water input (rainfall plus irrigation) and the water stress index (WSI) accumulated during the growing season. All \{DHs\} were characterized for possessing molecular marker alleles tagging four genes that regulate barley cycle, i.e. Vrn-H1, Vrn-H2, Ppd-H2 and Eam6. Grain yield differences were initially interpreted in terms of mean differences between genotypes (G), environments (E), and for each combination of genotype and environment (GE) through a “full interaction” \{ANOVA\} model. Variance components estimates clearly showed the greater importance of \{GE\} over G, although both were much lower than E. Alternative linear and bilinear models of increasing complexity were used to describe GE. A linear model fitting allelic variation at the four genes explained genotype main effect and genotype × environment interaction much better than growth habit itself. Adaptation was primarily driven by the allelic constitution at three out of the four segregating major genes, i.e. Vrn-H1, Ppd-H2 and Eam6. In fact, the three genes together explained 47.2% of G and 26.3% of \{GE\} sum of squares. Grain yield performance was more determined by the number of grains per unit area than by the grain weight (phenotypic correlation across all genotypic values: r = 0.948 and 0.559, respectively). The inter-relationships among a series of characters defining grain yield and its components were also explored as a function of the length of the different barley developmental phases, i.e. vegetative, reproductive, and grain filling stages. In most environments, the best performing (adapted) genotypes were those with faster development until early occurrence of anthesis. This confirmed the crucial role of the period defining the number of grains per unit area in grain yield determination under Mediterranean environments. "

However, due to its complexity, the genetic mechanisms underlying the expression of drought tolerance in plants are poorly understood and this trait is difficult to characterize and quantify. This study assessed the importance of the wild progenitor of cultivated barley, Hordeum spontaneum C. Koch, in contributing developmental and yield-related traits associated with drought tolerance and therefore its usefulness in breeding for improved adaptation to drought stress conditions. Fifty-seven fixed barley lines derived from crosses with two H. spontaneum lines (41-1 and 41-5) were evaluated in Mediterranean low rainfall environments with 10 improved varieties and three landraces for grain yield, developmental and agronomic traits. The study was conducted for three years (2004–2006) in a total of nine environments (location–year combinations), eight in Syria and one in Jordan, which were eventually reduced to seven due to a large error variance in two of them. There was significant genetic variation among the genotypes for most of the traits measured, as well as differential responses of genotypes across environments. Traits such as peduncle length, peduncle extrusion and plant height were positively correlated with grain yield in the dry environments. Differences in phenology were small and not significantly correlated with differences in grain yield under stress. Performances at the three highest yielding environments were much more closely correlated than those at the four stress environments. The \{GGE\} biplot analysis allowed identification of genotypes consistently best adapted to the lowest yielding environments and confirmed the existence of unique environments for identifying better adapted genotypes in the low rainfall environments of Syria. The top yielding lines in the driest of the seven environments derived mostly from crosses with H. spontaneum 41-1, while most of the improved varieties showed a positive genotype by environment (GE) interaction with the highest yielding environments. The results of the field experiments indicated that there was variation for grain yield under drought stress among barley genotypes, and that some of the lines derived from H. spontaneum had consistently superior specific adaptation to the range of severe stress conditions used in this study. The usefulness of H. spontaneum in breeding programs for stress conditions is likely to increase in view of the predicted increase in the occurrence of high temperatures and droughts. "

The population breeding structure comprised eight genetic subpopulations (GSPs) using data derived from 97 evenly distributed \{SSR\} markers. The phenotypic structure was assessed: (i) from the mean values of six agronomic traits across environments (multivariate), and (ii) from data representing each trait in each environment (univariate). Mean daily maximum temperature from emergence to heading was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) and negatively associated to yield, accounting for 59% of yield variations. Significant but weak relationships were obtained between the genetic similarities among accessions and their overall agronomic performance (r = 0.15, P &lt; 0.001), plant height (r = 0.12, P &lt; 0.001), spike–peduncle length (r = 0.06, P &lt; 0.01) and thousand kernel weight (r = 0.03, P &lt; 0.05), suggesting a very low possibility of prediction of the agronomic performance based on random \{SSR\} markers. The percentage of variability (measured by sum of squares) explained by the environment varied between 76.3 and 98.5% depending on the trait, while that explained by genotypes ranged between 0.4 and 12.6%, and that explained by the \{GE\} interaction ranged from 1.1 to 12.5%. The clustering of the accessions based on multivariate phenotypic data offered the best explanation of genotypic differences, accounting for 30.3% (for yield) to 75.1% (for kernel weight) of the observed variation. The genotype × environment interaction was best explained by the phenotypic univariate clustering procedure, which explained from 28.5% (for kernel weight) to 74.9% (for days to heading) of variation. The only accessions that clustered both in the genetic dissimilarities tree and the tree obtained using Euclidean distances based on standardized phenotypic data across environments were those closely related to the \{CIMMYT\} hallmark founder ‘Altar 84’, the \{ICARDA\} accessions adapted to continental-dryland areas, and the landraces, suggesting that genetic proximity corresponded to agronomic performance in only a few cases.

To address the issue, crop growth and yield of 14 wheat varieties grown on 18 sites in key agro-ecological zones of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan in response to \{CC\} were assessed. Three future periods affected by the two projections on \{CC\} (SRES \{A1B\} and A2) were considered and compared against historic (1961–1990) figures. The impact on wheat was simulated with the CropSyst model distinguishing three levels of agronomic management. Averaged across the two emission scenarios, three future periods and management scenarios, wheat yields increased by 12% in response to the projected \{CC\} on 14 of the 18 sites. However, wheat response to \{CC\} varied between sites, soils, varieties, agronomic management and futures, highlighting the need to consider all these factors in \{CC\} impact studies. The increase in temperature in response to \{CC\} was the most important factor that led to earlier and faster crop growth, and higher biomass accumulation and yield. The moderate projected increase in precipitation had only an insignificant positive effect on crop yields under rainfed conditions, because of the increasing evaporative demand of the crop under future higher temperatures. However, in combination with improved transpiration use efficiency in response to elevated atmospheric \{CO2\} concentrations, irrigation water requirements of wheat did not increase. Simulations show that in areas under rainfed spring wheat in the north and for some irrigated winter wheat areas in the south of Central Asia, \{CC\} will involve hotter temperatures during flowering and thus an increased risk of flower sterility and reduction in grain yield. Shallow groundwater and saline soils already nowadays influence crop production in many irrigated areas of Central Asia, and could offset productivity gains in response to more beneficial winter and spring temperatures under CC. Adaptive changes in sowing dates, cultivar traits and inputs, on the other hand, might lead to further yield increases. "

abstract = "Sodicity‐induced soil degradation is a major environmental constraint with severe negative impacts on agricultural productivity and sustainability in arid and semiarid regions. As an important category of salt‐affected soils, sodic soils are characterized by excess levels of sodium ions (Na+) in the soil solution phase as well as on the cation exchange complex, exhibiting unique structural problems as a result of certain physical processes (slaking, swelling, and dispersion of clay) and specific conditions (surface crusting and hardsetting). Saline‐sodic soils, another category of salt‐affected soils, are generally grouped with sodic soils because of several common properties and management approaches. Sodic and saline‐sodic soils occur within the boundaries of at least 75 countries, and their extent has increased steadily in several major irrigation schemes throughout the world. The use of these soils for crop production is on the increase as they are a valuable resource that cannot be neglected, especially in areas where significant investments have already been made in irrigation infrastructure. It is imperative to find ways to improve sodic and saline‐sodic soils to ensure that they are able to support highly productive land‐use systems to meet the challenges of global food security. Nearly a century‐old record reveals amelioration of sodic soils through the provision of a readily available source of calcium (Ca2+) to replace excess Na+ on the cation exchange complex; the displaced Na+ subject to leaching from the root zone through the application of excess irrigation water in the presence of a drainage system. Many sodic soils do contain inherent or precipitated sources of Ca2+, that is calcite (CaCO3), at varying depths within the soil profile. However, due to its negligible solubility, natural dissolution of calcite does not provide sufficient quantities of Ca2+ to affect soil amelioration with routine management practices. Consequently, amelioration of these soils has been predominantly achieved through the application of chemical amendments. However, amendment costs have increased prohibitively over the past two decades due to competing demands from industry and reductions in government subsidies for their agricultural use in several developing countries. In parallel, scientific research and farmers’ feedback have demonstrated that sodic soils can be brought back to a highly productive state through a plant‐assisted approach generically termed “phytoremediation.” Typical plant‐based strategies for contaminated soils, such as those containing elevated levels of metals and metalloids, work through the cultivation of specific plant species capable of hyperaccumulating target ionic species in their shoots, thereby removing them from the soil. In contrast, phytoremediation of sodic soils is achieved by the ability of plant roots to increase the dissolution rate of calcite, thereby resulting in enhanced levels of Ca2+ in soil solution to effectively replace Na+ from the cation exchange complex. Phytoremediation has shown to be advantageous in several aspects: (1) no financial outlay to purchase chemical amendments, (2) accrued financial or other benefits from crops grown during amelioration, (3) promotion of soil‐aggregate stability and creation of macropores that improve soil hydraulic properties and root proliferation, (4) greater plant‐nutrient availability in soil after phytoremediation, (5) more uniform and greater zone of amelioration in terms of soil depth, and (6) environmental considerations in terms of carbon sequestration in the postamelioration soil. Phytoremediation is particularly effective when used on moderately saline‐sodic and sodic soils. It is a viable solution for resource‐poor farmers through community‐based management, which would help in strengthening the linkages among researchers, farm advisors, and farmers. These linkages will continue to be fostered as the use of sodic soils becomes more prevalent. The success of phytoremediation of sodic soils requires a greater understanding of the processes fostering phytoremediation, the potential of plant species to withstand ambient salinity and sodicity levels in soil and water, and also of the uses and markets for the agricultural products produced. Strategic research on such aspects would further elucidate the role of phytoremediation in the restoration of sodic soils for sustainable agriculture and conservation of environmental quality. "

The first plant organ sensing dehydration is the root. Aim of the present work was to clarify the potential impact of the phyto-oxylipins pathway on drought tolerance of chickpea (Cicer arietinum), the third important legume crop worldwide. Therefore, we measured the expression of key genes involved in oxylipins metabolism by qPCR on samples from stressed and non-stressed roots of a drought-tolerant and a drought-sensitive chickpea variety using commercially available TaqMan assays. We demonstrate that the drought tolerant variety reacts to drought with sustained and earlier activation of a specific lipoxygenase (Mt-LOX 1) gene, two hydroperoxide lyases (Mt-HPL 1 and Mt-HPL 2), an allene oxide synthase (Mt-AOS), and an oxo-phytodienoate reductase (Mt-OPR). We further show that gene over-expression positively correlates with the levels of major oxylipin metabolites from the \{AOS\} branch of the pathway, which finally leads to the synthesis of jasmonates. Higher levels of jasmonic acid (JA), its precursor 12-oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA) and the active form JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile) were especially detected in the root tissues of the tolerant variety, prompting us to assume a role of jasmonates in the early signalling of drought stress in chickpea and its involvement in the tolerance mechanism of the drought-tolerant variety.

However, the many changes that threaten the actual functioning of the systems and trigger many uncertainties concerning capacities to adapt to external shocks require new research approaches. In this paper, we explore the links between capital assets, risk perception, measure of income, and livestock adaptation using a typology value based on multiple factorial analyses. We examine the specific role of livestock in the processes of adaptation to a 15-year drought. The study is based on a farm survey of 182 Bedouin families in the Coastal Zone of Western Desert of Egypt in 2011. Our results show that livestock is still a core component of Bedouin society with a significant typology value. However, for Bedouin families located inland, livestock is mainly an economic safety net in the case of drought; whereas for family members who recently moved to town, livestock is a social safety net vis-à-vis the traditional society which enables them to cope with economic hardship and participate in social events. How livestock is managed during drought events and the role of livestock in the process of adapting to drought depends less on the size of the herd before the drought in the rain-fed zone and more on traditional social and official networks. Consequently, limiting the impact of drought in this zone requires paying more attention to the management of collective action, including livestock policies and feed subsidies. "

Thus, the study of the economic and environmental characteristics of ancient settlements may offer new perspectives on the long-term effects of continuous agriculture in a fragile agroecosystem. In this work, we present a methodological framework that uses archaeological information to understand long-term effects of the extensification of agriculture in present-time arid areas. Specifically, we have compared the main economic features of a Neolithic site of the middle Euphrates, Tell Halula (ca. 10th millennium BP), with present-day data from the surrounding region. Population, crop distribution, cereal yields and arable land requirements during the first millennia after the emergence of agriculture were estimated from archaeological data and compared with a compilation of present-time official statistics and data derived from a field survey. We observed a trend towards a cereal-based farming during the Neolithic, associated to a decrease in the diversity of wild florae. This was accompanied by a growth in population during the earliest phases of the settlement (8200-7000 cal BCE), followed by a decline in population in the late phases (7000-5400 cal BCE), probably as a consequence of exceeding the capacity of the agroecosystem. A comparable situation to that found in early phases of Tell Halula was observed in modern communities, showing similar growth rates and a strong focus on cereal crops. "

It is mainly cultivated in the semi-arid tropics of Asia and Oceania, Africa and America. In Malawi, it is grown as a source of food and income and for soil improvement in intercropping systems. However, varietal contamination due to natural outcrossing causes significant quality reduction and yield losses. In this study, 48 polymorphic \{SSR\} markers were used to assess the diversity among all pigeonpea varieties cultivated in Malawi to determine if a genetic fingerprint could be identified to distinguish the popular varieties. Results A total of 212 alleles were observed with an average of 5.58 alleles per marker and a maximum of 14 alleles produced by \{CCttc019\} (Marker 40). Polymorphic information content (PIC), ranged from 0.03 to 0.89 with an average of 0.30. A neighbor-joining tree produced 4 clusters. The most commonly cultivated varieties, which include released varieties and cultivated land races, were well-spread across all the clusters observed, indicating that they generally represented the genetic diversity available in Malawi, although substantial variation was evident that can still be exploited through further breeding. Conclusion Screening of the allelic data associated with the five most popular cultivated varieties, revealed 6 markers – CCB1, CCB7, Ccac035, CCttc003, Ccac026 and \{CCttc019\} – which displayed unique allelic profiles for each of the five varieties. This genetic fingerprint can potentially be applied for seed certification to confirm the genetic purity of seeds that are delivered to Malawi farmers. "

In vitro antioxidant activity of all extracts was carried out using free radical-scavenging activity by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethilenebenzotiazolin)-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical cation. In vitro anthelmintic activities were investigated on the egg and adult worms of Haemonchus contortus from sheep in comparison to albendazole. Total polyphenol content of R. ulmifolius was higher in more polar extract, ranging from 64.5 in aqueous extract to 1.57 mg gallic acid equivalents per gram of dry weight (GAE/g DW) in hexanic extract. Likewise, highest amounts of flavonoids and condensed tannins were found in aqueous extract (28.06 mg QE/g and 7.42 mg CE/g DW, respectively) compared to hexanic extract (0.71 mg QE/g and 0.29 mg CE/g DW, respectively) (p &lt; 0.05). Both \{DPPH\} and \{ABTS\} antioxidant assays showed that all tested extracts possess free radical scavenging activity, while the inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) range values were similar for both assays (2.13–45.54 μg/mL and 1.2–43.82 μg/mL, respectively). All plant extracts showed ovicidal activity at all tested concentrations. Fruit methanolic (IC50 = 2.76 mg/mL) and aqueous (IC50 = 2.08 mg/mL) extracts showed higher inhibitory effects than chloroformic (IC50 = 7.62 mg/mL) and hexanic (IC50 = 12.93 mg/mL) extracts on egg hatching (p &lt; 0.05).

Results show that the newly developed model performs best for all stations; models based on temperature, rainfall and air humidity performed better than models that used temperature data only. If only temperature data are available for estimation of global solar radiation, the Bristow and Campbell model had the best results.

The approach provides a generalized framework for estimating a range of key water management variables and provides a management tool for the sustainable operation of similar schemes globally. A focus on the use of satellite data allowed for the quantification of relationships across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Variables including actual and crop evapotranspiration, net and gross irrigation, net and gross groundwater use, groundwater recharge, net groundwater recharge, were estimated and then their interrelationships explored across the Hakra Canal command area. Spatially distributed remotely sensed estimates of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) rates were determined using the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model and evaluated against ground-based evaporation calculated from the advection-aridity method. Analysis of \{ETa\} simulations across two cropping season, referred to as Kharif and Rabi, yielded Pearson correlation (R) values of 0.69 and 0.84, Nash-Sutcliffe criterion (NSE) of 0.28 and 0.63, percentage bias of −3.85% and 10.6% and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 10.6 mm and 12.21 mm for each season, respectively. For the period of study between 2008 and 2014, it was estimated that an average of 0.63 mm day−1 water was supplied through canal irrigation against a crop water demand of 3.81 mm day−1. Approximately 1.86 mm day−1 groundwater abstraction was estimated in the region, which contributed to fulfil the gap between crop water demand and canal water supply. Importantly, the combined canal, groundwater and rainfall sources of water only met 70% of the crop water requirements. As such, the difference between recharge and discharge showed that groundwater depletion was around −115 mm year−1 during the six year study period. Analysis indicated that monthly changes in \{ETa\} were strongly correlated (R = 0.94) with groundwater abstraction and rainfall, with the strength of this relationship significantly (p &lt; 0.01 and 0.05) impacted by cropping seasons and land use practices. Similarly, the net groundwater recharge showed a good positive correlation (R) of 0.72 with rainfall during Kharif, and a correlation of 0.75 with canal irrigation during Rabi, at a significance level of p &lt; 0.01. Overall, the results provide insight into the interrelationships between key \{WRM\} components and the variation of these through time, offering information to improve the management and strategic planning of available water resources in this region.

abstract = "The volume of wastewater generated by domestic, industrial and commercial sources has increased with population, urbanization, improved living conditions, and economic development. The productive use of wastewater has also increased, as millions of small-scale farmers in urban and peri-urban areas of developing countries depend on wastewater or wastewater polluted water sources to irrigate high-value edible crops for urban markets, often as they have no alternative sources of irrigation water. Undesirable constituents in wastewater can harm human health and the environment. Hence, wastewater irrigation is an issue of concern to public agencies responsible for maintaining public health and environmental quality. For diverse reasons, many developing countries are still unable to implement comprehensive wastewater treatment programs. Therefore in the near term, risk management and interim solutions are needed to prevent adverse impacts from wastewater irrigation. A combination of source control, and farm-level and post-harvest measures can be used to protect farm workers and consumers. The \{WHO\} guidelines revised in 2006 for wastewater use suggest measures beyond the traditional recommendations of producing only industrial or non-edible crops, as in many situations it is impossible to enforce a change in the current cash crop pattern, or provide alternative vegetable supply to urban markets. There are several opportunities for improving wastewater management via improved policies, institutional dialogues and financial mechanisms, which would reduce the risks in agriculture. Effluent standards combined with incentives or enforcement can motivate improvements in water management by household and industrial sectors discharging wastewater from point sources. Segregation of chemical pollutants from urban wastewater facilitates treatment and reduces risk. Strengthening institutional capacity and establishing links between water delivery and sanitation sectors through inter-institutional coordination leads to more efficient management of wastewater and risk reduction.

We implemented a modified version of \{RWEQ\} that represents wind erosion as a transient process, using time steps of 6 h. Beside this a number of adaptations including estimation of mass flux over the field boundaries, and the routing of sediment have been done. Originally, \{RWEQ\} was created and calibrated for application at the scale in USA. Due to the adaptations imparted to the original \{RWEQ\} and the different environmental condition in Syria of application areas, an intensive calibration process was required before applying the model to estimate the net soil loss from the experimental fields. The results of this test showed that the modified version of \{RWEQ\} provided acceptable predictions for the average mass flux from the measurement plot with a linear regression coefficient of \{R2\} of 0.57 and 0.83 for the (d) test for the 20 wind events at the six tested plots.

Most of the affected families in this study had one neurolathyrism victim, being predominantly male and of younger age. The incidence among youngsters (boys and girls) was significantly correlated with the consumption of green unripe seeds (eshet), confirming this as a risk factor for developing neurolathyrism. The consumption of other popular grass pea preparations was not age related. Neurolathyrism patients did not attempt any medication as most people knew that neurolathyrism is incurable, but the consumption of grass pea was abandoned after developing the disease. The minority ‘Woito’ tribe was virtually unaffected. They were the only people reporting to consume fish which is rich in amino acids such as methionine and using metallic kitchen utensils in addition to clay pots. This observation points to the correlation between low neurolathyrism incidence and a better balanced diet as well as metallic kitchen utensils, suggesting a new approach for neurolathyrism prevention.

This document lists some of the main capabilities that have been recently developed, especially in the area of operational agroclimatology, for an efficient use of natural resources and a better management of climatic risks. Many countries, including the developing world, now benefit from well-trained staff in the use of climate data, physical and biological information and knowledge to reduce negative climate impacts. A significant volume of data and knowledge about climate–agriculture relationships is now available and used by students, scientists, technicians, agronomists, decision-makers and farmers alike, particularly in the areas of climate characterization, land suitability and agroecological zoning, seasonal climate forecasts, drought early warning systems and operational crop forecasting systems. Climate variability has been extensively modelled, capturing important features of the climate through applied statistical procedures, agroclimatic indices derived from raw climatic data and from remote sensing. Predictions of climate at seasonal to interannual timescales are helping decision-makers in the agricultural sector to deal more effectively with the effects of climate variability. Land suitability and agroclimatic zoning have been used in many countries for agricultural planning, thanks to the availability of new and comprehensive methodologies; developments in climate, soil and remote sensing data collection and analysis; and improved applications in geographic information systems (GIS). Drought early warning systems are available worldwide at both national and international levels. These systems are helping decision-makers and farmers to take appropriate decisions to adapt to short-term climatic risks. Also, operational crop forecasting systems are now becoming available at the regional and national levels. In some developed countries, several efficient and well tested tools are now available for optimizing on-farm decisions based on the combination of crop simulation models and seasonal forecasts. However, in developing countries few tools have been developed to efficiently manage crops at the farm level to cope with climate variability and climate risks. Climate change impacts on agriculture and food security have been assessed in international studies using specific and efficient methodologies and tools. Adaptation to climate change and variability can also be facilitated through effective planning and implementation of strategies at the political level. The role of technological progress, risk transfer mechanisms and financial instruments and their easy accessibility to rural people are critical elements of climate risk management. "

Phytoextraction has been proposed as an inexpensive, sustainable, in situ plant-based technology that makes use of natural hyperaccumulators as well as high biomass producing crops to help rehabilitate soils contaminated with heavy metals without destructive effects on soil properties. The success of phytoextraction is determined by the amount of biomass, concentration of heavy metals in plant, and bioavailable fraction of heavy metals in the rooting medium. In general, metal hyperaccumulators are low biomass, slow growing plant species that are highly metal specific. For some metals such as Pb, there are no hyperaccumulator plant species known to date. Although high biomass-yielding non-hyperaccumulator plants lack an inherent ability to accumulate unusual concentrations of Pb, soil application of chelating agents such as \{EDTA\} has been proposed to enhance the metal concentration in above-ground harvestable plant parts through enhancing the metal solubility and translocation from roots to shoots. Leaching of metals due to enhanced mobility during EDTA-assisted phytoextraction has been demonstrated as one of the potential hazards associated with this technology. Due to environmental persistence of \{EDTA\} in combination with its strong chelating abilities, the scientific community is moving away from the use of \{EDTA\} in phytoextraction and is turning to less aggressive alternative strategies such as the use of organic acids or more degradable \{APCAs\} (aminopolycarboxylic acids). We have therefore arrived at a point in phytoremediation research history in which we need to distance ourselves from \{EDTA\} as a proposed soil amendment within the context of phytoextraction. However, valuable lessons are to be learned from over a decade of EDTA-assisted phytoremediation research when considering the implementation of more degradable alternatives in assisted phytoextraction practices.

Seven to eight diverse genotypes from targeted species were used for sequence analysis at \{DREB2A\} locus identified/isolated. A maximum of eight \{SNPs\} were found in the common bean DREB2A, indicating two distinct haplotypes, three \{SNPs\} with five haplotypes were observed in barley whereas a single \{SNP\} was observed in rice, sorghum and chickpea.

Millions of people around the world have Se-deficient diets and biofortification may be an effective solution. The total Se concentration of lentils grown in six major lentil-producing countries were analysed to determine the potential for Se biofortification in these regions. The highest Se concentrations based on location means were found in lentils from Nepal (180 μg/kg) and southern Australia (148 μg/kg) while the lowest were those from Syria (22 μg/kg), Morocco (28 μg/kg), northwestern \{USA\} (26 μg/kg), and Turkey (47 μg/kg). Significant location effects within a country were observed for Nepal and Australia. All values were lower than previous published data for Saskatchewan grown lentils (425–672 μg/kg). Lentils originating from Australia, Nepal, or Canada could be considered good sources of Se, as consumption of 50 g would provide 13–61% of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA). Our findings indicate lentil may be appropriate as a target crop for Se biofortification and investigated as a food-based solution for populations with Se deficiencies. "

We used twelve selected morphometric variables that recorded on a total of 569 adult donkeys (289 jacks and 280 jennets) spanning over wide arrays of ecologies in Ethiopia. Mean pairwise multiple comparisons (MPMC) between traits and multivariate analysis were carried out separately for jacks, jennets and aggregated gender. The \{MPMC\} showed significant differences between donkey populations for most of the traits studied. Principal component analysis showed that three body heights (height at wither, back and rump) and body length alone account for about 87.5% the total variations (eigenvalue = 10.49) of the 12 measured morphometric variables. Mahalanobis as well as Euclidean distances were also found to be highly significant (P &lt; 0.01) for pairwise comparisons of all populations. Stepwise discriminant analysis showed that, except in the order of their occurrence, the first two traits that separate between jennets and jacks were similar showing that there are no explicit anatomical dissimilarities or sexual dimorphism between genders in donkeys. Percent assignment of discriminant function analysis showed that, on average 64.83% of individuals were classified within their respective populations implying that populations were distinct. This study also explicitly showed that morphological character system (body size and coat color patterns) varies according to ecological patterns and altitudinal gradients. Such morphological divergences in contrasting ecologies may reflect response and adaptation of a given population to the prevailing ecological variables and biophysical resources. "

We discuss the true wild horse that was involved in horse domestication processes in line with recent evidences that unraveled multi-geographic origins and multi-maternal lineages in the present day domestic horses.

The insecticidal activity of both leaves and flowers essential oils was assessed in terms of larvicidal effect appreciated by contact against third and fourth instars larvae of Orgyia trigotephras and was compared with a standard commercial chemical insecticide Delta-metrine “Decis”. Mean time of mortality (MMT) of third instar larvae obtained after treatment with a concentration of 0.5% of flower oil was 1.40 min, higher than, for leaf oil (MMT = 1.27 min; p &lt; 0.001). Mean time of mortality of the fourth instar larvae, obtained after treatment with flower oil at the same concentration was 42.53 min, higher than, that for leaf oil (MMT = 20.68 min; p &lt; 0.001). The \{MMT\} of the two instars larvae were shorter compared with the \{MMT\} of larvae treated with Decis (p&lt;0.001) while, ethanol induced no toxic effect on larvae. In vitro anthelmintic effects against Haemonchus contortus from sheep were ascertained by egg hatching and worm motility inhibitions compared with a reference drug albendazole. At all tested concentrations (0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/mL), both essential oils showed ovicidal activity. Leaves essential oil (inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 0.145 mg/mL) showed higher inhibitory effects on egg hatching than flowers essential oil (IC50 = 0.398 mg/mL). After 6 h and 8 h of exposure, the flowers essential oil at 1 mg/mL induced 33.3 and 87.5% inhibition motility, respectively. At the same concentration and exposure times, essential oil from leaves induced 29.1 and 75% inhibition motility respectively. Results highlight that 2-undecanone may be a potential antipathogenic constituent. The overall findings of the current study indicated that R. chalepensis essential oil has a potential insecticidal and anthelmintic benefit and further in vitro and in vivo trials against different species and stages are required to make use of this plant for the control of insect pests and gastrointestinal nematode parasites.

abstract = "Abstract During the past two centuries, the world has witnessed a remarkable increase in the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases (GHGs), namely carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), as a result of human activities after 1750 (preindustrial era). During 1750 the concentrations for these gases were 280 ppm, 715 ppb, and 270 ppb, respectively which increased to 379 ppm, 1774 ppb, and 319 ppb, respectively in 2005. It showed an increase of 0.23, 0.96, and 0.12% annually. The same has further increased to 385 ppm, 1797 ppb, and 322 ppb, respectively in 2008 representing 1.6, 1.2, and 0.9% increase, respectively from 2005 levels at an annual increase of 0.53, 0.43, and 0.31%, annually. Increase in atmospheric \{CO2\} promotes growth and productivity of plants with \{C3\} photosynthetic pathway but the increase in temperature, on the other hand, can reduce crop duration, increase crop respiration rates, affect the survival and distribution of pest populations, and may hasten nutrient mineralization in soils, decrease fertilizer-use efficiency, and increase evapotranspiration. The water resources which are already scarce may come under enhanced stress. Thus, the impact of climate change is likely to have a significant influence on agriculture and eventually on the food security and livelihoods of large sections of the urban and rural populations globally. The developing countries, particularly in South Asia and Latin America, with diverse agroclimatic regions, challenging geographies, growing economies, diverse agricultural production systems, and farm typologies are more vulnerable to the effect of climate change due to heavy dependence on agriculture for livelihood. These regions also are demonstrating poor coping mechanisms to adapt to these challenges, and as a result there is evidence of negative impacts on productivity of wheat, rice, and other crops to varying extent depending on agroecologies. Upscaling of modern technologies such as conservation and climate smart agriculture, judicious utilization of available water for agriculture through microirrigation and water saving technologies, developing multiple stress-tolerant crop cultivars and biotypes through biotechnological tools, restoration of degraded soils and waters, promoting carbon sequestration through alternate production technologies and land use, and conservation of biodiversity must be promoted at regional and country level to ensure durable food and nutritional security. Reliable early warning system of environmental changes, their spatial and temporal magnitude, coupled with policies to support the diffusion of this information, can help interpret these forecasts in terms of their agronomic and economic implications for the benefit of farmers and to provide agriculture-dependent industries and policymakers with more informed options to support farmers. These countries need to formulate both short-term and long-term policies for improvement, sustenance, and protection of natural resources. There is an urgent need for capacity building through international collaboration in order to develop databases and analysis systems for efficient weather forecasting as well as preparing contingency plans for vulnerable areas. The objectives of this paper are to summarize the available information on adaptation strategies and the mitigation options for climate change to meet the food security in South Asia and Latin America.

However, there is no comprehensive summary on the occurrence and distribution of the infection at national level. This systematic review provides pooled prevalence estimates and assesses potential predictors of the nematode infections in small ruminants, i.e. helpful in planning interventions or control strategies. The review used 50 animal level datasets retrieved from 24 manuscripts. The studies used data collected from 9407 sheep and 3478 goats. A meta-analytical approach was employed to analyze Effect size (ES). The reported \{GI\} nematodes represented eleven genera affecting sheep and goats including: Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus, Teladorsagia/Ostertagia, Strongyloides, Bunostomum, Nematodirus, Chabertia, Trichuris, Cooperia, Skrjabinema and Oesophagostomum. The \{GI\} nematodes pooled prevalence estimate in the random effect model was 75.8% (95% CI: 69.6, 80.8). The subgroup analysis revealed significant (p &lt; 0.05) differences in the prevalence between different regions and type of diagnostic methods used. ‘Postmortem technique’ and ‘eastern part of the country’ were associated with higher \{GI\} nematode prevalence and accounted for 68.1% of the between studies heterogeneity. In light of the high parasitic prevalence in all agro-ecologies, the need for strategic intervention is recommended. Meanwhile, data need to be generated for some of the regions where dependable survey reports are lacking. "

However, its inherent genetic variation and population structure is poorly understood. To investigate whether mammalian host species, geographic separation and resulting reproductive isolation, or a combination of these, define the genetic structure of R. appendiculatus, we analyzed multi-locus genotype data from 392 individuals from 10 geographic locations in Kenya generated in an earlier study. These ticks were associated with three types of mammalian host situations; (1) cattle grazing systems, (2) cattle and wildlife co-grazing systems (3) wildlife grazing systems without livestock. We also analyzed data from 460 individuals from 10 populations maintained as closed laboratory stocks and 117 individuals from five other species in the genus Rhipicephalus. The pattern of genotypes observed indicated low levels of genetic differentiation between the ten field populations (FST = 0.014 ± 0.002) and a lack of genetic divergence corresponding to the degree of separation of the geographic sampling locations. There was also no clear association of particular tick genotypes with specific host species. This is consistent with tick dispersal over large geographic ranges and lack of host specificity. In contrast, the 10 laboratory populations (FST = 0.248 ± 0.015) and the five other species of Rhipicephalus (FST = 0.368 ± 0.032) were strongly differentiated into distinct genetic groups. Some laboratory bred populations diverged markedly from their field counterparts in spite of originally being sampled from the same geographic locations. Our results demonstrate a lack of defined population genetic differentiation in field populations of the generalist R. appendiculatus in Kenya, which may be a result of the frequent anthropogenic movement of livestock and mobility of its several wildlife hosts between different locations.

Mean \{LMWC\} concentrations from each country varied widely: sorbitol, 1250–1824 mg/100 g; mannitol, 57–132 mg/100 g; galactinol, 46–89 mg/100 g; sucrose, 1750–2355 mg/100 g; raffinose + stachyose, 3314–4802 mg/100 g; verbascose, 1907–2453 mg/100 g; nystose, 8–450 mg/100 g; and kestose, from not detected to 244 mg/100 g. The concentrations of many of these \{LMWC\} varied with average temperature and precipitation of the region/country of origin. Significant genotype and genotype × location effects contributed to the variability in the concentrations of several LMWC, a feature that could prove useful in breeding lentils for novel agro-ecological environments and for consumer preference. The range of \{LMWC\} in lentil may contribute to its survival as a crop and its organoleptic and nutritional properties as a whole food. "

Linkage disequilibrium (LD) decayed rapidly (R2 ≈ 0.16 at 0 cM) due to germplasm peerless diversity. The mixed linear model resulted in ten marker-trait associations (MTAs) across all environments representing five QTL. The extensively short \{LD\} blocks required us to repeat the analysis with less diverse subset of 220 landraces in which \{R2\} decayed below 0.2 at 0.3 cM. The subset \{GWAS\} resulted in 36 \{MTAs\} clustered in nine QTL. The subset analysis validated three \{QTL\} previously detected in the full list analysis.

Botanic and molecular data suggest that the wild ancestor of this species has not yet been discovered or has become extinct. This fact makes ex situ collections more crucial for the present and future breeding activities of this crop, especially when the modernization of agriculture reduces genetic diversity. At the world level, more than 38,000 accession entries are included in at least 37 listed collections. The partial allogamous status of this crop makes maintenance activity of genotypes more expensive and difficult. In addition to the requirement of fixed genotypes to support new association genetics strategies, there is a need for more research on pollinators and maintenance of genetic diversity within populations. A large genetic variability has already been identified in V. faba in terms of floral biology, seed size and composition, and also tolerance to several biotic and abiotic stresses. More knowledge is needed on the interactions of V. faba with parasitic and pollinator insects, on traits related to environmental adaptation and impacts, on nitrogen fixation in interaction with soil Rhizobia and on bioenergy potential, which strengthens the demand for new and large phenotyping actions. Diversity analysis through genotyping is just beginning. The use of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers has allowed genetic resources to be distinguished according to their geographic origin and the structuring of collections. Conservation of gene sequences among legume species and the rapid discovery of genes (particularly in the model species Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus), together with robotic developments in molecular biology, offer new possibilities for the analysis of sequence diversity for V. faba genes and to evaluate their impact on phenotypic traits. Combined genotyping and phenotyping projects must continue on V. faba so that core collections can be defined; these will help in the discovery of genes and alleles of interest for breeders. "

Framed by the boundary organization model, and an understanding of the emergence of a new multi-scalar and polycentric style of governing, the modular mechanism consists of three modules: a Science-Policy Interface (SPI); an international self-governing and self-organizing Independent Non-Governmental Group of Scientists; and Regional Science and Technology Hubs in each \{UNCCD\} region. Now that the \{UNCCD\} has established the SPI, it is up to the worldwide scientific community to take the lead in establishing the other two modules. Science-policy communication in other \{UN\} environmental conventions could benefit from three generic principles corresponding to the innovations in the three modules—joint management of science-policy interfaces by policy makers and scientists; the production of synthetic assessments of scientific knowledge by autonomous and accountable groups of scientists; and multi-scalar and multi-directional synthesis and reporting of knowledge.

Several studies have been conducted over the years; however, these studies often had limited scope and coverage. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to collate the information so far available in order to provide a pooled prevalence estimate at national level and identify potential predictors. Published and grey literature written in English and Amharic in the period from, 1st of January 1990 to June 25, 2015 were searched from electronic databases and repositories of academic and research institutions. Relevant animal level data on 67,743 small ruminants was extracted from 23 published articles and one master’s thesis resulting altogether in 86 animal level reports that conformed to predefined criteria. The dataset was analyzed using a meta-analytical approach. The pooled prevalence estimate computed for metacestodes infection was 11.8% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 9.1, 15.4. The highest prevalence estimate 31.2% (95% CI: 23.1, 40.9) was found for Cysticercus tenuicollis (Taenia hydatigena) followed by cystic echinococcosis (Echinococcus granulosus) 8.8% (95% CI: 5.8, 13.1), Cysticercus ovis (Taenia ovis) 4.9% (95% CI: 2.9, 9.4) and Coenurus cerebralis (Taenia multiceps) 4.6% (95% CI: 1.6, 12.2). Among the predictors considered for heterogeneity analysis only sample size and metacestode type fitted the final multivariable meta-regression model and explained 26.3% of the explainable heterogeneity between studies (p&lt;0.05). The prevalence was noted to decrease with increasing sample size. No significant difference in prevalence was observed between sheep and goats (p&gt;0.05). In conclusion, this review showed a widespread occurrence of metacestodes in small ruminants in Ethiopia. Thus, a holistic approach to break the life cycle of these parasitic stages is suggested, including regulatory interventions that encourage dog owners to keep their dogs confined and prevent backyard slaughter and proper management of abattoir waste disposal.

Here we analyse the diversity of 146 CpCDV isolates characterised from pulses collected across the chickpea growing regions of Sudan. Although we find that seven of the twelve known CpCDV strains are present within the country, strain CpCDV-H alone accounted for ∼73% of the infections analysed. Additionally we identified four new strains (CpCDV-M, -N, -O and -P) and show that recombination has played a significant role in the diversification of CpCDV, at least in this region. Accounting for observed recombination events, we use the large amounts of data generated here to compare patterns of natural selection within protein coding regions of CpCDV and other dicot-infecting mastrevirus species.

abstract = "Abstract Restoration efforts in the Mediterranean Basin have been changing from a silvicultural to an ecological restoration approach. Yet, to what extent the projects are guided by ecological restoration principles remains largely unknown. To analyse this issue, we built an on-line survey addressed to restoration practitioners. We analysed 36 restoration projects, mostly from drylands (86%). The projects used mainly soil from local sources. The need to comply with legislation was more important as a restoration motive for European Union (EU) than for non-EU countries, while public opinion and health had a greater importance in the latter. Non-EU countries relied more on non-native plant species than \{EU\} countries, thus deviating from ecological restoration guidelines. Nursery-grown plants used were mostly of local or regional provenance, whilst seeds were mostly of national provenance. Unexpected restoration results (e.g. inadequate biodiversity) were reported for 50% of the projects and restoration success was never evaluated in 22%. Long term evaluation (&gt; 6 years) was only performed in 31% of cases, and based primarily on plant diversity and cover. The use of non-native species and species of exogenous provenances may: i) entail the loss of local genetic and functional trait diversity, critical to cope with drought, particularly under the predicted climate change scenarios, and ii) lead to unexpected competition with native species and/or negatively impact local biotic interactions. Absent or inappropriate monitoring may prevent the understanding of restoration trajectories, precluding adaptive management strategies, often crucial to create functional ecosystems able to provide ecosystem services. The overview of ecological restoration projects in the Mediterranean Basin revealed high variability among practices and highlighted the need for improved scientific assistance and information exchange, greater use of native species of local provenance, and more long-term monitoring and evaluation, including functional and ecosystem services' indicators, to improve and spread the practice of ecological restoration.

abstract = "Summary Gall-forming arthropods are highly specialized herbivores that, in combination with their hosts, produce extended phenotypes with unique morphologies [1]. Many are economically important, and others have improved our understanding of ecology and adaptive radiation [2]. However, the mechanisms that these arthropods use to induce plant galls are poorly understood. We sequenced the genome of the Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor; Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), a plant parasitic gall midge and a pest of wheat (Triticum spp.), with the aim of identifying genic modifications that contribute to its plant-parasitic lifestyle. Among several adaptive modifications, we discovered an expansive reservoir of potential effector proteins. Nearly 5% of the 20,163 predicted gene models matched putative effector gene transcripts present in the M. destructor larval salivary gland. Another 466 putative effectors were discovered among the genes that have no sequence similarities in other organisms. The largest known arthropod gene family (family SSGP-71) was also discovered within the effector reservoir. SSGP-71 proteins lack sequence homologies to other proteins, but their structures resemble both ubiquitin \{E3\} ligases in plants and E3-ligase-mimicking effectors in plant pathogenic bacteria. SSGP-71 proteins and wheat Skp proteins interact in vivo. Mutations in different SSGP-71 genes avoid the effector-triggered immunity that is directed by the wheat resistance genes \{H6\} and H9. Results point to effectors as the agents responsible for arthropod-induced plant gall formation. "

abstract = "Abstract A seamless vegetation type map of India (scale 1: 50,000) prepared using medium-resolution \{IRS\} LISS-III images is presented. The map was created using an on-screen visual interpretation technique and has an accuracy of 90%, as assessed using 15,565 ground control points. India has hitherto been using potential vegetation/forest type map prepared by Champion and Seth in 1968. We characterized and mapped further the vegetation type distribution in the country in terms of occurrence and distribution, area occupancy, percentage of protected area (PA) covered by each vegetation type, range of elevation, mean annual temperature and precipitation over the past 100 years. A remote sensing-amenable hierarchical classification scheme that accommodates natural and semi-natural systems was conceptualized, and the natural vegetation was classified into forests, scrub/shrub lands and grasslands on the basis of extent of vegetation cover. We discuss the distribution and potential utility of the vegetation type map in a broad range of ecological, climatic and conservation applications from global, national and local perspectives. We used 15,565 ground control points to assess the accuracy of products available globally (i.e., GlobCover, Holdridge’s life zone map and potential natural vegetation (PNV) maps). Hence we recommend that the map prepared herein be used widely. This vegetation type map is the most comprehensive one developed for India so far. It was prepared using 23.5 m seasonal satellite remote sensing data, field samples and information relating to the biogeography, climate and soil. The digital map is now available through a web portal (http://bis.iirs.gov.in). "
