Twelve of the stabilates were inoculated into individual Boran (Bos indicus) calves and characterised for their sensitivity, in turn, to diminazene aceturate (Berenil®), isometamidium chloride (Samorin®) and homidium chloride (Novidium®). All 12 stabilates produced infections which were shown to be Trypanosoma congolense and resistant to treatment with diminazene aceturate at a dose of 7.0 mg kg−1 body weight (b.w.). Eleven of the infections were also resistant to isometamidium chloride at a dose of 0.5 mg kg−1 b.w. and homidium chloride at a dose of 1.0 mg kg−1 b.w. The drug-sensitivity phenotypes of three of the same isolates were also determined in goats which were each treated with only one of the three trypanocides: all expressed the same phenotypes as the populations expressed in the aforementioned Boran calves. Five clones were derived from one of the isolates which expressed a high level of resistance to all three trypanocides; each clone expressed high levels of resistance to all three trypanocides when characterised in mice. Thus, the multi-resistance phenotype of the parental isolate was associated with expression of multi-resistance by individual trypanosomes. Finally, molecular karyotypes and electrophoretic variants of six enzymes were determined for seven and eight of the isolates, respectively. Six different karyotypes were observed and all eight of the latter isolates belonged to different zymodemes, indicating that the multi-resistance phenotype at Ghibe was associated with many genetically distinct populations.

The tsetse challenge to cattle at two sites in the area was estimated as the product of tsetse relative density and the trypanosome infection rate in flies. The proportion of feeds taken by tsetse from cattle was also considered. Three tsetse species were detected in the area, Glossina pallidipes, G. fuscipes and G. morsitans submorsitans. A significant correlation (r=0.60, P&lt;0.001) was observed between the mean monthly estimates of tsetse challenge due to G. pallidipes and the prevalence of trypanosome infections in cattle the following month at one site, whilst at the other, no significant relationship was observed (P=0.08). The tsetse density at both sites showed seasonal changes which were related to the monthly rainfall. Finally, variations in tsetse density appeared to be the main factor responsible for variation in tsetse challenge and thus trypanosome prevalence in cattle. "

abstract = "Certain indigenous taurine breeds of cattle, namely N'Dama and West African Shorthorn, in West and Central Africa aare significantly more resistant to trypanosomiasis than Bos indicus breeds. This trait, termed trypanotolerance, is an innate characteristic. Despite their small size, trypanotolerant breeds are at least as productive as other indigenous breeds. Genetic differences in resistance to trypanosomiasis have also been found in some B. indicus types of cattle, although to date the level demonstrated is much less than that of the trypanotolerant breeds. Trypanotolerance can be reduced by a variety of stress factors including high levels of tsetse challenge or it can be supplemented by previous exposure. Trypanotolerance would appear to be related to the ability to control parasitaemia, a capacity which, at least in mice infected with Trypanosoma brucei, is associated with the rate of parasite differentiation from the rapidly dividing slender form to the non-dividing stumpy (the form which is responsible for the induction of the immune response). Parasite differentiation in the mouse can also be regulated by immunostimulants such as Corynebacterium parvum, creating the possibility of altering host resistance by non-specific means. Low maintenance requirements, the ability to conserve water, the capacity to tolerate heat and increased resistance to other important infectious diseases are also characteristics attributed to trypanotolerant breeds. When all these factors are considered, it would appear that the N'Dama and the West African Shorthorn, through a rigorous process of selection over several thousand years, now provide a ‘package’ for survival and production in the tsetse-infested savanna areas of West and Central Africa.

Approximately half the animals were found to be infected for an average of five of the 14 times that they were examined: 38% with Trypanosoma congolense, 13% with Trypanosoma vivax and 49% with a mixed infection. Trypanosoma congolense infections had significant deleterious effects on animal growth, while T. vivax infections did not. Animals found on several occasions to be infected with T. congolense had significantly lower \{PCV\} values than those demonstrated to be infected on fewer occasions. No relationship was found between mean optical density (OD) values in antigen \{ELISA\} and \{PCV\} values. Animals capable of maintaining \{PCV\} values, even when antigen \{ELISA\} positive on a high number of occasions, grew at the same rate as uninfected animals. Animals that could not maintain \{PCV\} values when infected had poorer growth. Antigen \{ELISA\} has the potential to increase the efficiency of selection of trypanotolerant N'Dama cattle under tsetse challenge in the field, in three main ways. (1) Accurate identification of trypanosome species, especially in mixed species infections, clarifies relations between infection, anaemia and animal performance. (2) Detection of animals antigenaemic without patent parasitaemia could allow individuals with superior ability to control trypanosome infection to be identified. (3) More accurate measurement of the proportion of time an animal is infected allows more accurate evaluation of its anaemia control capability. "

The assays are based on monoclonal antibodies which recognise trypanosome antigens specific for each of the three species and animals were termed ‘antigenaemic’ when found positive by this technique but not found parasitaemic by the buffy coat technique. 148 one-year-old animals were exposed to a medium natural tsetse challenge and an average of 6 assays per animal were carried out over a 92-day period. Blood samples were routinely examined 11 times over this period and 28% of animals were detected as parasitaemic by the buffy coat technique. 90% of these were antigen-ELISA positive. More importantly, 40% of the animals with negative parasitological findings were also found to be antigenaemic. Parasitaemic animals with above-average packed-red-cell volume percent (PCV) values had 32% higher daily weight gains than those with below average, while antigenaemic animals showed no significant linkage between \{PCV\} values and weight gain. Thus only the 28% of animals with detectable parasitaemias could have been used for selection decisions based on \{PCV\} values. Antigenaemic animals grew at the same rate as negative animals and had 22% superior growth rates to parasitaemic animals. When antigenaemic animals were classified as having more ability to control parasite growth than parasitaemic animals, a significant sire effect suggested some possibility of a degree of genetic control being involved. Thus the \{ELISA\} could offer a practical possibility for selection of trypanotolerant animals based on infection criteria. "

In some clusters almost all antibodies cross-reacted (CD2, CD8), in others almost none cross-reacted (CD4, CD5) and in cluster CD6, mAbs only reacted with buffalo but not waterbuck. Double staining experiments were performed on buffalo \{PBM\} with the cross-reacting antibodies, to confirm that they detected similar cell populations as in bovine PBM. This was shown with reagents against CD2, CD4, CD6, CD8, CD11, WC1, \{WC3\} and Ig. The molecular weights of the buffalo antigens correlated well with those of the homologous cattle antigens. In the \{CD5\} cluster, only one mAb reacted with the two wild species, and defined an unusual CD2+ CD5− cell population in buffalo. Also mAbs cross-reacting with buffalo \{MHC\} class \{II\} detected unusual expression on resting T cells. From the results presented, it is clear that the workshop panel contains mAbs against the most important T and B cell antigens of buffalo and probably waterbuck, which will allow us to compare functional lymphocyte populations in cattle and wild ruminants.

The mandate of the Laboratory is to develop safe, effective and economically feasible control measures for livestock diseases which seriously limit world food production. At present \{ILRAD\} is concentrating on trypanosomiasis and theileriosis, two intractable disease complexes of major economic importance in many developing countries, using immunological approaches. The programme on each disease complex includes epidemiological studies, basic laboratory research and training activities. In the case of theileriosis, the epidemiological project encompasses the collection and typing Theileria parva isolates, production of sporozoites from selected stocks with appropriate immunogenic properties, and their use in pilot infection and drug treatment immunisation experiments in field locations. Laboratory studies are also in progress aimed at the improvement of immunisation procedures using various modified Theileria sporozoite and schizont antigens. With regard to trypanosomiasis, epidemiological research embraces detailed analysis of the components of trypanosomiasis challenge in a restricted field location, participation in training and supervision of personnel concerned with entomological and animal health aspects of the \{ILCA\} trypanotolerant livestock network and investigations associated with an Ndama cattle production project in West Africa. In the laboratory, work is broadly divided into two projects. The first includes all activities such as parasite culture, typing, metabolism and molecular biology, related to the use of trypanosomes or trypanosomal products to achieve immunisation of livestock. The second embraces studies on comparative immunology and genetic resistance, including trypanotolerance, which could lead to increased immunity through manipulation of host responses. Both the trypanosomiasis and theileriosis programmes include strong training components to improve the capacity of technicians and scientists from affected countries to apply existing and future control measures effectively. \{ILRAD\} also collaborates closely with other national and international organisations engaged in research on the laboratory's two target diseases and disseminates information and research results widely through pamphlets, periodic research reports and scientific publications in English and French.

The bile acids reduced parasite cholesteryl ester uptake by acting directly on the trypanosomes and did not either influence parasite protein synthesis or disrupt lipoprotein particles at the concentrations used.

To assess this possibility, two model systems were employed; one in which actively dividing Trypanosoma brucei brucei bloodstream forms differentiate to non-dividing forms, and the second in which non-dividing metacyclic forms of T. congolense differentiate to actively dividing bloodstream forms. In the technique herein, mRNA from each differentiated form was reverse transcribed into cDNA which was then used as the template in the PCR. The resultant products were examined by agarose-gel electrophoresis. As few as 103 trypanosomes were sufficient for the generation of a \{RAPD\} print after first amplifying the total cDNA through exploitation of the fixed 3′ and 5′ ends of trypanosome nuclear mRNAs. Differences in \{RAPD\} patterns between the differentiated forms examined were mainly due to differences in gene expression. The technique can rapidly identify genes expressed at very low levels and which are up- or down-regulated in the different forms examined. \{PCR\} products of interest are easily purified from the agarose gels for direct cloning and complete sequence determination due to their relatively small size (0.1–1 kb).

Trypanosomes were detected in the lymph 4 days after infection, which was 2 days prior to the appearance of the local skin reaction or the presence of parasites in the blood. Once the animal became parasitaemic, trypanosomes were found to recirculate in the lymphatic system, appearing in the lymph of the contralateral lymph node 11 days after infection. In goats infected with T. congolense and superinfected 12 or 13 days later with a different tsetse-transmitted T. congolense serodeme, parasites belonging to the second serodeme were apparently delayed in their development in the skin and appeared up to 7 days later in the efferent lymph when compared to control animals. This delay in development might have implications for field situations where superinfections frequently occur: it might result in limiting the number of serodemes of T. congolense an animal can be infected with at any one time.

The infection rates of the drug-resistant stocks of T. congolense in G.m. centralis, when goats were used as reservoir hosts, were as high (range, 22.3–56.3%) as of the drug sensitive stock (49.5%).

The herding period was longest (&gt;10.5 h) in the transition from dry to wet season and shortest (&lt; 7h) in the late wet season. The peaks in grazing activity observed in free-ranging herbivores were not evident in the herded cattle, whose grazing activity remained at a high level throughout the herding day. Resting, including ruminating, accounted for only 5% of herding time. Other studies of restricted grazing by African cattle revealed a reduction in animal production only if forage was scarce or of low quality. The Fulani herds had access to a variety of grazing resources throughout the year. Any possible limitation in animal production due to restricted grazing time must be seen in the wider context of the land-use system, in which the Fulani herding practices permit an integration of cropping and livestock husbandry.

Specifically, the paper addresses the issue of whether livestock enterprises can be an income stabilizing agent in a traditional mixed crop and livestock farming system representative of important parts of the Ethiopian highlands. The analysis is based on the application of a stochastic farm-firm linear programming model. Farm income is the stochastic variable of the model. Technological and resource constraint sets which approximate those of representative smallholders in the Debre Berhan area are incorporated into the empirical framework. The data inputs to the model have been collected in field surveys conducted by \{ILCA\} (International Livestock Centre for Africa) covering the period 1979–1983. Linear programming solutions are obtained for three situations: 1. (1) A set of solutions where traditional farm technologies apply. 2. (2) A set of solutions where farmers can use one ox, rather than the traditional pair, for cultivation. 3. (3) A set of solutions where farmers can keep a relatively high-yielding crossbred cow for milk production to raise cash incomes. The main empirical results are: 1. (1) In the traditional farming system, increasing sheep flock sizes reduces income variation. 2. (2) The single ox-traction technology offsets income variation by increasing mean income as a result of its higher efficiency as compared to the oxen-pair traction technology. 3. (3) The adoption of the crossbred technology results in a lower income coefficient of variation. This is mainly due to its high mean income. However, due to the labour-intensive nature of the crossbred cow enterprise, labour becomes expensive. As a result, a tendency for crop specialization arises. "

Ticks were removed 2–3 times weekly by hand from 16 animals, counted and the species determined. Tick load was low in the dry season (2–5 ticks per animal per week), increased after the onset of the first scattered rains, reached a peak (40 ticks per animal per week) 1 month after the beginning of the heavy rains, and declined thereafter. The dominant tick species was Amblyomma variegatum; other species found were Boophilus spp., Rhipicephalus spp. and Hyalomma spp. The low level of tick load compared with data from literature and from crossbred (Friesian-Bunaji) cattle kept in the study area suggests high tick resistance in Bunaji cattle. A biologically feasible method of controlling ticks in indigenous cattle would be twice weekly spraying with acaricide during only 2 months of the year in the early wet season to break the pronounced peak in the tick load. However, hand spraying offers no advantage over hand removal of ticks in terms of saving labour. The main advantage of strategic spraying lies in more thorough removal of ticks and possibly prevention of dermatophilosis at a lower cost than year-round use of acaricide. Knowledge of the seasonal pattern of tick load is also valuable for planning the introduction of selected stock with higher genetic potential, but higher susceptibility to tickborne diseases than exhibited by Bunaji cattle.

The cows were arranged in a balanced crossover design, and each cow was superovulated 3 consecutive times, which resulted in a total of 72 superovulations. Superovulatory treatment started on Day 10±1 of the estrous cycle, and cows were treated for 5 consecutive days. Estrus was induced with PGF2α (2 ml, im) at 72 h after initiation of treatment. Cows were inseminated at 12 and 24 h after the onset of estrus using 2 doses of semen each from a Friesian bull. Daily blood samples were collected from the beginning of superovulatory treatment to the onset of estrus for determination of progesterone concentrations. The mean (±SEM) estrus response interval after PGF2α and estrus duration were 33.1±4.1 and 9.3±0.5 h, respectively, and did not vary between treatment groups. Similarly, the mean numbers of palpable corpora lutea and follicular cysts were 7.8±0.7 and 3.0±0.4, with no treatment effect. The number of superovulations which yielded embryos/ova was 50 (69.4%) and was higher (P&gt;0.05) in cows treated with Pergovet (75%) than with Pluset (63.9%). The mean number of embryos/ova recovered per superovulation was not affected by treatment and averaged 4.0±0.4, with a range from 3.2±0.9 to 4.6±1.0 in the 4 treatment groups. There was no treatment effect on the mean number of transferable embryos per superovulation, which averaged 3.1±0.3. The mean numbers of embryos/ova and transferable embryos per embryo yielding superovulation were 5.6±0.4 and 4.3±0.4, respectively. Return to natural estrus after the induced estrus averaged 43.3±6.1 d (range 37.2±11.8 to 56.4±12.2 d), with no apparent treatment effect. The mean numbers of embryos/ova, transferable embryos and interval to return to natural estrus did not vary between consecutive superovulations. Mean plasma progesterone concentrations dropped from 7.6±0.3 ng/ml on the first day of superovulatory treatment to 1.3±0.1 ng/ml on the day of induced estrus and did not differ between treatment groups and between cows which yielded different numbers of embryos/ova. Progesterone concentration on the day of estrus was negatively correlated with the number of embryos/ova (−0.29) and the number of transferable embryos (−0.26), suggesting that progesterone concentration on the day of induced estrus can help to predict embryo yield and quality in Boran cows. It was concluded that both Pergovet and Pluset can be used to superovulate Boran cows with no residual effect of repeated treatment on embryo yield and return to natural estrus. However, treatment with Pergovet tended to increase the proportion of cows which yielded embryos. Moreover, Pergovet given at 1050 \{IU\} and Pluset at 1000 \{IU\} resulted in the production of 19.4 and 39.0% more number of transferable embryos than at 1350 and 500 IU, respectively. "

In this study, cluster analysis was used to classify crop-livestock producers in three villages in western Niger into recommendation domains using a combination of production and marketing variables. Four recommendation domains were identified. Discriminant analysis was used to profile the characteristics of the obtained groups. Cluster and discriminant analysis results were used to suggest appropriate research and policy interventions for each group. The approach utilized represents a logical and systematic method of classification which is deemed appropriate for determining the factors which affect livestock productivity and hence identifying research and policy interventions to meet producers' needs.

abstract = "The generally observed lukewarm attitude of farmers in most parts of sub-Saharan Africa towards the adoption of animal traction for crop cultivation (ANTRAC) raises the crucial question of whether \{ANTRAC\} investment is profitable at farm level. Financial analysis based on farm management data from northern Ghana revealed that \{ANTRAC\} investment over short (5-year)- and medium (10-year)-term periods was profitable. The analysis produced internal rates of return (IRR) of 46% and 54% for short- and medium-term periods, respectively, with equity financing and 79% and 90% with debt financing. Further, it provided moderate increases in average annual income over hoe farming, 10% for the short- and 17% for the medium-term period. However, sensitivity analyses showed that the investment, particularly over the short-term period, was highly vulnerable to variations in the value of production, and also, the early years of \{ANTRAC\} use represent a substantial financial burden on the farmer. These, coupled with the risk involved in rainfed agriculture, may inhibit the adoption of \{ANTRAC\} by farmers in the region. "

abstract = "Adoption of animal traction in Sub-Saharan Africa has historically been slow and stagnant. This is despite considerable efforts by researchers and development planners to introduce the technique among smallholder semi-subsistence farmers in a large number of countries. Based on a simulation model, this study uses a capital budgeting approach to investigate the profitability of animal traction relative to manual cultivation in two semi-arid regions of Sub-Saharan Africa. Data from a number of cropping systems in western Niger and northern Nigeria are used to calculate present values of incremental returns together with internal rates of return on capital invested. The results show that animal traction is not profitable under many smallholders' actual conditions. For a millet-only farmer in Niger, ox traction yields insufficient returns and donkey traction is attractive only when sufficient amounts of capital are available to include a cart in the investment package. Similarly, in a millet-cowpea system, both ox traction and donkey traction yield acceptable returns only with a cart. In northern Nigeria, where relatively few donkeys are used for work, ox traction investments are profitable only with subsidised credit. However, profitability of animal traction investments in both Niger and Nigeria depends critically on the availability of fallow land. When a closed or nearly closed land frontier effectively limits the scope for area increases, returns on animal traction investments generally fall below critical levels. Adoption of animal traction technologies is likely to be increased by the development and dissemination of cheaper implements in Niger and a cheaper cart in Nigeria. "

The cows were fed a basal diet consisting of ad libitum native hay, mineral lick and water. Tagasaste forage was used to replace, on a dry matter (DM) weight-for-weight basis, 0, 33, 66 and 100% of 4.5 kg of an air-dry concentrate mix based on noug (Guizotia abyssinica) cake and wheat middlings that was used to supplement the basal diet. The rumen degradation of nitrogen tagasaste forage was intermediate between that of hay and wilted sesbania (Sesbania sesban) forage. Contents of tannic compounds were low—lower in tagasaste than in sesbania forage. The cows were healthy throughout the 84 day experiment. However, they refused to eat all the tagasaste forage at the higher levels of replacement (66 and 100%), resulting in significantly (P &lt; 0.001) lower total \{DM\} and crude protein intakes. It was concluded that poor palatability might be the main reason for low intake of tagasaste. Decline in nutrient intakes resulted in a simultaneous linear decrease (P &lt; 0.01 − 0.05) in milk yield and milk protein content. Replacing concentrate with tagasaste did not have a significant effect on the apparent total tract digestion of dietary \{DM\} of organic matter, but it decreased the crude protein digestion (P &lt; 0.05) and increased (P &lt; 0.01) cell wall digestion linearly. It also had clear and statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01 − 0.05) linear effects on rumen fluid parameters. pH and acetic acid increased, while propionic and butyric acids and ammonia decreased, in the rumen fluid. Metabolizable energy supply, calculated from the intake of digestible organic matter, was sufficient on all the diets to maintain the milk production level recorded with 0 or 33% replacement (average 5.2 kg day−1), but the supply of crude protein was insufficient to support this production level when 56 or 100% of the concentrate was replaced by tagasaste. It was concluded that tagasaste forage could not be used to replace concentrate as a supplementary feed for crossbred dairy cows without decreasing feed intake and milk yield.

In Experiment 1, feed samples were incubated in three different rumen environments (ecologies) created by feeding sheep the following: teff straw, teff straw + 174 g dry matter (DM) of sesbania and teff straw + 167 g \{DM\} of leucaena.

Gas production constants were estimated following the equation: \{GP\} = B(1 − e−Ct) where \{GP\} is gas produced at time t, B is potential gas production and C is the rate of gas production at time t. Rumen fluid was sampled at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h after feeding in Experiment 2 and pH, NH3-N, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and minerals determined. Plasma urea nitrogen (PUN) concentrations were estimated in blood taken from the sheep at 3, 6, 9 and 12 h. Drying relatively increased the neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF) and NDF-nitrogen concentrations in all foliages except in leucaena. Dry sesbania, tagasaste and vernonia had lower nitrogen concentrations than the fresh ones but the opposite trend was observed for leucaena. Dry matter disappearance (DD) at incubation times of 3–48 h and degradation constants differed among the four foliages (P&lt;0.05).

All the animals were fed a basal diet of low quality native hay, mineral lick and water ad libitum.

Nitrogen content of sesbania forage was clearly lower than that of concentrate, but rumen degradation constants indicated that for both the concentrate and the wilted sesbania forage, a major part of the nitrogen was instantly degraded. Increasing sesbania forage on offer in the diet caused a slight, but statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01) linear decline in total feed intake, because all sesbania was not consumed. The simultaneous very clear linear decrease in daily milk yield was also statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01). Dietary crude protein digestibility decreased (P &lt; 0.05) with increasing sesbania supplementation, because the proportion of easily or potentially degradable protein was smaller in sesbania than in the concentrate.

Extrusa samples from oesophageally fistulated goats collected at various intervals of grazing were used to determine the selectivity index, botanical composition, nutritive quality of diet and dry matter disappearance from nylon bags incubated in the rumen of cattle after 48 h. Results indicated that in both trials goats selected more stylo than grass. The proportion of stylo in the diet increased with increase in stocking rate for the researcher-managed trial while the relationship was quadratic for the farmer-managed trial. In addition, rumen-degraded extrusa dry matter had a quadratic relationship with time and stocking rate. Dietary neutral detergent fibre content was not significantly influenced by time of grazing or stocking rate. Crude protein content decreased with increase in grazing time. The effect of stocking rate on dietary crude protein content was not significant despite differences between treatments.

In desmodium, inoculation had no significant effect (P &gt; 0.05) on nodule weight, but application of P was found to be necessary for nodulation as plants did not nodulate without P fertilizer. Both inoculation and P significantly increased plant \{DM\} and N yields. Inoculation had no significant effect on nodulation, plant \{DM\} or N yields of sesbania in any soil. Probably because of previous P applications, P had no significant effect on sesbania plants grown on the Vertisol. On the Alfisol and Ultisol, sesbania responded differently to P applied in the nursery or field. On the Alfisol, P applied in the nursery increased nodule, root and shoot \{DM\} and root and shoot N yields, but P applied in the field increased only nodule DM. The reverse occurred on an Ultisol, where P applied in the nursery had no effect on sesbania, but P applied in the field increased nodule, root and shoot DM, root N yield, and root and shoot P yields. Drainage of the Vertisol increased shoot \{DM\} and N yields. It is apparent that P deficiency is an important limiting factor to the use of inoculation technology to increase legume productivity in the Ethiopian highlands. "

Maize stover used in this experiment was high in lignocellulosic cell-wall constituents and very low in CP. S. guianensis hay contained higher \{CP\} and lower NDF, ADF, and lignin contents than D. intortum and M. axillare hays. According to animal responses, under the conditions of this experiment, S. guianensis was superior to the other two legumes in improving the feeding value to sheep of maize stover based diets. M. axillare was found to be inferior. In general, 250 g of S. guianensis and 350 g of D. intortum hays per day per sheep (18.2 kg Lwt ± 1.2) were found to be optimum levels of supplementation to maize stover.

This paper evaluates, in a comparative cross-country context, the objectives and instruments of livestock pricing policy in five sub-Saharan African countries: Ivory Coast, Mali, Nigeria, Sudan and Zimbabwe during the period 1970–1986. It assesses the extent to which pricing policy objectives have been attained, and also estimates the effects of price interventions on output, consumption, trade and government revenues in order to draw out lessons for the future. The empirical results indicate that in comparison with real border prices, a certain degree of success was achieved in stabilising real domestic producer prices in the study countries. The results also show that since the early 1980s, there has been a gradual shift away from taxation of producers. However, consumers still appear to gain as much as producers in three of the study countries, with negative consequences for foreign exchange earnings and government revenues. The analysis reveals the importance of domestic inflation and exchange rates as key variables for livestock pricing policies and highlights the need to address the macroeconomic imbalances that cause exchange rate distortions and high domestic inflation at the same time that direct price distortions are being tackled.

A two year trial (1987–1988) was conducted to assess the effect of improved drainage and supplementary irrigation on sequential wheatchickpea cropping on Vertisol. Wheat was grown during the main rainy season on broadbeds and furrows (BBF), made with an animal drawn implement (broadbed maker, BBM) to drain off the excess water. The wheat harvest was followed by planting of chickpea (Cicer arientinum, Desi type) in the beginning of the dry season. Through the furrows of the BBF-system four irrigation treatments were applied: no irrigation; irrigation at planting; irrigation at planting and at vegetative stage; irrigation at planting, vegetative stage and at 50% flowering. The results showed that if the rain stop after planting the second crop, chickpea, will not emerge without irrigation. This happened in one of the two years of experimentation. In that particular year (1987), the soil moisture in the seed zone (0–10 cm layer) was 26% and soil-water tension was 16.87 kPa (168.7 cm H2O).

Under trypanosome prevalences of 25, 31 and 9%, respectively, ability to control the development of anaemia had a very major effect on daily weight gain, four times that of the ability to control parasitaemia, while previous exposure to trypanosome infection from birth to one year had no effect. Anaemia control, measured by average packed red cell volume percent (PCV) over the test period or by lowest \{PCV\} reached, was more closely associated with animal performance than when measured by average \{PCV\} when detected as parasitaemic. Above average \{PCV\} values in the first two measures resulted in a 44% to 48% superior daily weight gain over below average \{PCV\} values. \{PCV\} post-test recovery was shown to be rapid following a single trypanocidal drug treatment. In practice, it appeared that a suitable field test would be where natural infection could be effected as early in the test as possible and anaemia control measurements carried out over 6 weeks of detected parasitaemia. A field test would become even more feasible if satisfactory correlation could be obtained between the results of natural infection and those of an experimental alternative. "

Average packed red cell volume percent (PCV) and lowest \{PCV\} reached during the period were evaluated as measures of ability to control the development of anaemia. Attempts were made to systematically control other possible causes of anaemia. In animals detected as parasitaemic, those with above average average \{PCV\} values or above average lowest \{PCV\} reached had 34% and 35% respectively higher daily weight gains than those with below average. Even when not detected as parasitaemic, those with above average average \{PCV\} values or above average lowest \{PCV\} reached had 14% and 12% respectively higher gain indicating that a proportion of these animals actually were parasitaemic. When all environmental and parasitaemia information was taken into account, the heritability of growth, average \{PCV\} and lowest \{PCV\} reached was 0.39±0.31, 0.64±0.33 and 0.50±0.32 respectively. The genetic correlation between average \{PCV\} and growth was 0.70±0.42 and between lowest \{PCV\} reached and growth was 0.28±0.55. While the standard errors are large, the higher heritabilities of \{PCV\} measures compared to animal growth and the positive genetic correlations between \{PCV\} and growth do indicate an opportunity for selection on \{PCV\} when animals can be detected as parasitaemic. All heritabilities and genetic correlations increased in size when parasitaemia information was utilized in the analysis. Thus more sensitive field tests for trypanosome detection, and early onset of parasitaemia through very high natural infection or an acceptable experimental alternative, could speed up selection for ability to control the development of anaemia.

It was found that in contrast to epimastigote forms, which were metabolically almost identical to procyclic forms, metacyclic forms showed characteristics of, and seemed preadapted to, differentiation into the bloodstream stage. While mitochondrial NAD+ diaphorase activity and an electrochemical potential were detected in all life cycle stages, metacyclic metabolism was glucose-based and terminal oxidase activity was primarily dependent upon the trypanosome alternative oxidase with the contribution of cyanide-sensitive respiration accounting for only 20–30% of the total respiratory capacity.

While 1 × 102 cells resulted in sub-patent infection with development of immunity to challenge with sporozoites, larger doses of cells gave rise to patent infections of increasing severity. Thus, doses of 1 × 105 and 1 × 106 cells sometimes produced lethal infections and with 1 × 107 and 1 × 108 the outcome was invariably lethal. Based on the previous observation that induction of immunity by allogeneic cells requires transfer of infection into the recipient-host cells, a comparison of the infections produced by autologous and allogeneic cells indicated that the transfer of infection from allogeneic cells occurs at a frequency of maximally 1 × 10−5. Two pairs of cattle were identified as being mutually non-reactive in the mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR). Doses of 1 × 106 and 1 × 107 cells of cell lines derived from 1 animal of each pair were inoculated into the autologous host, the non-reactive partner and an animal which was shown to be strongly reactive to the donor in the MLR.

If the mechanisms underlying these factors are identified it might be possible by immunisation, by specific drug treatment or by transfection of appropriate genes to produce highly productive cattle resistant to trypanosomiasis.

Lymph from these nodes was collected through polyethylene cannulae inserted into the efferent lymphatics, and examined for trypanosomes, cells and antibody content. Within 6–9 days after infected tsetse fly bite, trypanosomes were detected in the efferent lymph; this preceded their appearance in the blood by 3–6 days, indicating that the lymphatic system acted as a major route for the passage of trypanosomes from the skin into the bloodstream. Responses induced in the draining lymph node as a result of trypanosome migration included a 2—fold increase in the volume of lymph and up to a 10-fold increase in lymphocyte output, including blast lymphocytes and plasma cells. Neutralising antibodies to metacyclic trypanosomes were detected in lymph and serum by Day 14 after infection, although in 2 out of 4 animals investigated, they were not demonstrated in serum until Day 18. Trypanosomes were also found in small numbers in efferent lymph of the prefemoral lymph node on the flank contralateral to the infected tsetse bites after development of parasitaemia. Increases in lymph flow and cellular output occurred about the same time in the ipsilateral and the contralateral efferent lymphatics, but were significantly less in the latter. Homologous challenge of immunised calves with tsetse-transmitted parasites revealed that trypanosomes were eliminated at the level of the skin or within the draining lymph node, as no parasites were detected in efferent lymph.

A total of 52 immunized cattle and 33 susceptible controls of different group sizes were exposed to field challenge by ticks for periods of 42–90 days at three field sites where \{ECF\} is endemic on the Kenyan coast. All immunized cattle survived \{ECF\} challenge, but 87% of the controls died of the disease. The cattle exposed at one site had been immunized 1 year earlier and maintained tick-free in the intervening period. The level of immunity in these cattle was similar to that of cattle which had been immunized 1 or 2 months prior to exposure. Thus, immunity had not waned over the 1-year period. A study at another site showed that acaricidal treatment of immunized cattle could be safely extended from twice a week to once every three weeks, whereas in susceptible cattle even twice weekly spraying did not control ECF. The isolates made from infected controls during the trials indicated the presence of three T. p. parva stocks as defined by \{MAb\} profiles. Of the two stocks used for immunization, T. p. parva Marikebuni induced broader protection. In view of the apparent limited antigenic diversity of T. p. parva strains within the Coast Province it is suggested that the Marikebuni stock might represent a key stock for vaccination in this area.

In the second part, an outline is given of the effector mechanisms involved in immunity of cattle to the protozoan parasite Theileria parva. Parasites are antigenically complex organisms which often have distinct developmental stages, sometimes with different predilection sites within the host. Antigenic polymorphism between strains is a common feature of parasites and sometimes results in strain-specific immunity. Certain parasites have also evolved mechanisms of modulating surface antigens which allow them to escape host effector mechanism. Effector mechanisms which control parasitic infections may operate by preventing establishment of the parasites, by eliminating the parasites once they have established or by affecting growth or fecundity of the parasites. In addition to specific antibody and cell-mediated immune responses, inflammatory or physiological responses play an important role in the control of some parasites. Current evidence suggests that effector mechanisms against T. parva parasites operate at two levels. First, antibodies produced against the infective stage of the parasite, the sporozoite, can, by neutralising infectivity, reduce the numbers of organisms which establish in the host. Second, cytotoxic T cells directed against parasitised lymphoblasts cause destruction of parasites following their establishment in the host. Moreover, in situations where immunity is parasite strain-specific, the cytotoxic T cell responses have also been found to be strain-specific. The elucidation of these effector mechanisms has indicated potential new strategies of immunisation against T.parva. "

Autologous and allogeneic erythrocytes and mouse lymphocytes similarly incubated with sporozoites failed to infect cattle. The supernatant from bovine lymphocyte suspensions incubated with sporozoites for 1 h produced lethal infections whereas after 24 h of incubation the supernatant was non-infective. All cattle which did not develop detectable infection were fully susceptible to subsequent challenge with a stabilate of sporozoites. By inoculating cattle with graded doses of autologous blood leukocytes which had been incubated for 24 h with sporozoites, it was found that as few as 2 × 103 cells gave rise to infection.

It was possible to transmit this parasite amongst rabbits, rats, mice and goats. Whereas goats and mice succumbed to the disease very rapidly, rats and rabbits showed scant and transient parasitaemia and frequently suppressed the infection. A trypanosome challenge using single infected tsetse showed that goats became infected much more readily than mice. The infected vector can transmit the infection throughout its life but not at every feed. "

To this end, the culture medium was titrated on suboptimally stimulated murine thymocytes. A low residual release by normal monocytes was noted which usually remained below the detection limit of the assay. These cells could be induced to secrete high titres following activation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide. When harvested from animals infected with Trypanosoma congolense, the cells released high titres spontaneously. This increase in co-stimulatory cytokine secretion was noted in both peripheral blood monocytes and splenic macrophages and was amplified by addition of indomethacin. The activation was transient, and the titres had dropped to pre-infection values at the end of the experiment. At that time, the monocytes were, however, still able to respond to external stimuli. Addition of neutralizing anti-transforming growth factor β antibodies did not influence the thymocyte co-stimulatory activity of the supernatants. High levels of co-stimulatory cytokine secretion were noted with monocytes from both the susceptible Boran breed and the tolerant N'Dama breed. Early in infection, at Day 10 post infection, the production by the N'Dama monocytes was 16 times higher than the production by the Boran monocytes. Later in the infection, the titres were similar in both breeds. "

Little alteration was observed in the output of the CD2+ T cells in the lymph, and within this population the CD4:CD8 ratio remained relatively constant. By contrast, a marked decrease was observed in the output of γδ T cells over the first 7 days following infection. The number of B cells increased between 2 and 6 days post-infection, and thereafter returned to pre-infection values. Little change was observed within the afferent lymph veiled cell population. Examination of activation markers on the lymphocyte fraction of afferent lymph revealed a decrease in the number of cells expressing the Interleukin-2 receptor α-chain from Day 5 post-infection. At this time the expression of \{ACT\} 1, another early activation marker, was seen to increase. Afferent lymph cells collected pre-infection and on the first 4 days post-infection proliferated in response to stimulation with Concanavalin A in vitro. This response to mitogenic stimulation was completely abrogated from day five post-infection. However, these cells were not capable of suppressing the capacity of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells to respond to mitogenic stimulus in co-culture assays. These studies suggest that although a degree of lymphocyte activation occurs in the afferent lymph following tsetse-transmitted infection with T. congolense, this may be sub-optimal owing to the immunosuppression which appears to operate at the level of the skin and the lymph nodes.

abstract = "Publisher Summary Recent biological investigations of the African trypanosomes have been moving away from their previous preoccupation with the phenomenon of antigenic variation. The feeling has arisen that antigenic variation, as demonstrated by the Trypanozoon and Nannomonas subgenera of trypanosomes, is too extensive, the number of serodemes too large, and the coexistence of different species in many areas too complicated, to allow any immunoprophylaxis based on antibodies to variable antigens. However, in the case of T. vivax, more information is required concerning antigenic variation and coat structure in this organism before these avenues of investigation are discarded. The ways of improving the yield of mature metacyclic trypanosomes in vitro must be found, so that the contribution of metacyclic variable antigens to the induction of immunity in T. vivax infection can be elucidated. The number of bloodstream variable antigen types (VATs) must be determined, as there is evidence both for \{VAT\} exhaustion contributing to the self-cure of infected hosts and for a possible limit to the number of \{VATs\} that can be expressed in infections in Africa. It is probable that new \{DNA\} probes will have to be prepared to ensure the identification of all the members of this geographically dispersed species of protozoan parasite. "

Tsetse flies infest approximately 10 million km2 of the continent affecting 38 countries. It is considered that 7 million km2 of this area would otherwise be suitable for livestock and or mixed agricultural development. About 30% of the 147 million cattle in countries affected by tsetse are exposed to the disease. The situation with regard to sheep, goats, pigs, horses, donkeys and camels is probably similar but is less well documented. The annual losses in livestock production due to trypanosomiasis are estimated at $5 billion. Data available at present indicate that the overall situation is deteriorating. Since the 1950's the areas of savanna tsetse infestation have continued to increase. As a result there is increasing pressure on tsetse-free pasturages. In order to control trypanosomiasis more effectively, Governments, Bilateral and International Agencies have undertaken new initiatives in training, in evaluating the impact of trypanosomiasis on productivity, in the development of better diagnostic techniques and new drugs, in improving techniques of tsetse trapping and control and in research into the basis of antigenic variation and trypanotolerance.

abstract = "Control of animal trypanosomiasis is at present largely achieved through insecticide application and/or the administration of chemoprophylactic or chemotherapeutic drugs. There is no alternative at the moment to the use of insecticides in large scale tsetse-control programmes. An increasing knowledge of tsetse ecology and improved application techniques have resulted in more effective application of insecticides at lower doses so substantially reducing potential environmental damage. The development of synthetic pyrethroid insecticides represents a further advance in this respect with their high toxicity for Glossina spp., good aerosol persistence and minimal environmental impact. More emphasis is now also being placed on the use of traps and insecticide impregnated screens as simple, economic and effective means of controlling certain tsetse species. The incorporation of chemosterilants into such traps or screens together with identification of attractants, such as those present in ox breath, would enhance the efficacy of these control measures. Chemotherapeutic control of animal trypanosomiasis relies only on five compounds, the homidium, diminazene, pyrithidium and isometamidium salts together with suramin but drug resistance is a major problem. Although no new drugs for the treatment of trypanosomiasis have appeared on the market for the last 25 years, the prospects of new drug availability seem somewhat better now than in past years. The development of in vitro culture systems for the bloodstream forms of major pathogenic species of trypanosomes will facilitate the screening of new compounds. Already a new quinapyramine compound and some organic arsenicals are showing promise. The use of appropriate combinations of existing drugs and detoxifying agents are also being investigated. The possibility of developing economic and effective vaccines against animal trypanosomiasis is currently being investigated. Results to date show that while it is possible to immunise animals against cyclical challenge with single serodemes of T. brucei and T. congolense, this method is unlikely to be useful in the field due to the multiplicity of serodemes present in each trypanosome species. No common protective antigen has yet been found. Another approach to the control of trypanosomiasis of domestic ruminants is the identification and exploitation of trypanoresistant cattle, sheep and goats. Current research focusses on identifying the mechanisms, innate or acquired, which allow animals to better resist the pathogenic effects of trypanosome infections, and defining genetic markers which correlate with this trait.

abstract = "In considering the life cycle of T. parva in its mammalian host, there are 2 potential levels at which immunity against infection could be induced, namely the sporozoite and the macroschizont-infected cell. Ideally the prevention of infection at the stage when the host first encounters the parasite would be most desirable. Recent studies have demonstrated that the sera of some immune cattle contain antibodies which neutralise sporozoite infectivity. However, since entry of sporozoites into host cells occures very rapidly, it is still unclear whether such antibodies can be effective in vivo. Indeed, currently used experimental methods of immunisation appear to be dependent on the establishment of active infection and development of the parasite to the macroschizont stage in recipient animals. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that during immunisation, cell-mediated cytotoxic responses are generated against the macroschizont-infected cell. The activity of these cytotoxic cells is genetically restricted, in that they only recognise parasitised cells of their own genotype. In recent experiments we have been able to immunise cattle with cell membrane fractions prepared from autologous Theileria-infected cell lines. Such immunity could not be induced with cell membranes from allogeneic infected cell lines. These findings suggest that the parasite induces antigenic changes on the surface of infected host cells and that cell-mediated immune responses against cell surface antigens are important in the acquisition of protective immunity.

On the other hand, cattle subjected to a cyclical challenge with heterologous clones were completely susceptible as demonstrated by the development of chancres. Immunity to homologous challenge was achieved irrespective of the bloodstream variable antigenic types used to infect the tsetse. It was concluded that for a given serodeme the variable antigen composition of the metacyclic population which develops in the tsetse is constant and characteristic. Immunity to cyclical challenge was also obtained with uncloned stocks, providing the same stock was used for challenge. On the other hand, cattle immune to homologous cyclical challenge with cloned material were not always immune to cyclical challenge with parent stock, indicating that certain stocks consist of more than one serodeme. On the basis of these findings, it may be possible to use the chancre as a marker for serodeme analysis. "

The number of infected cells reached a maximum around Day 14, when 60–65% of efferent lymphocytes were parasitized. A severe reduction in the total cell output ocurred after Day 14, at the time when widespread lymphocytolysis was observed in the parent lymph node. A similar pattern of cellular kinetics was observed in the thoracic duct and in lymph efferent from lymph nodes distant from the site of challenge, although in the latter, the parasitosis reached only 10% of total cells. There was no selective depletion of parasitized cells from central lymph during the third week of infection, although the comparative parasitosis between lymph and lymph node cells indicated that infected cells entered central lymph less readily during this period. Macroschizonts appeared in cultures of lymphatic lymphocytes sampled between 5–9 days after challenge. These results, together with the failure of ablation of the regional lymph node 2, 3 or 5 days after challenge to delay the onset of the disease, indicated that dissemination of the infection from the site of challenge occurred within the first 2–3 days after the inoculation T. parva.

All of the second group, which received no treatment, became parasitaernic. The third group of goats received the same dose of drug as the first group but three days after all of them were first detected parasitaemie; trypanosomes reappeared in all the five goats. When this third group was treated, the frequency of trypanosomes resistant to the drug dosage was estimated to be less than 1 in 103. The parasites which reappeared after the treatment of these animals were used to infect two additional groups of five goats intravenously. The goats in one group were treated with the same dose of drug as before, within 10 seconds of infection and were all cured. In contrast, the five goats in the second, untreated, group became parasitaemic. Finally, when the goats in which the infections had relapsed were retreated with diminazene aceturate at the same dose rate, the level of parasitaemia temporarily decreased by at least 103 trypanosomes ml−1.

At intervals of 1, 4, 8, 12 or 19 days following infection, each group of five animals was treated intramuscularly with diminazene aceturate at a dose of 7.0 mg kg−1 body weight (b.w.). While treatment on Day 1 eliminated infections in all five goats, treatment on Day 19 did not cure any of the animals; in groups treated 4, 8 or 12 days following infection, two of five goats in each group were cured. Since the alteration in apparent resistance of T. congolense \{IL\} 3274 Day 1 and Day 19 could have been due to alteration in expression of drug resistance by trypanosomes as the population expanded, the experiment was repeated using trypanosomes that reappeared in the animals that had been treated with diminazene aceturate on Day 19. On Day 36, when all five animals were parasitaemic, five groups of teneral G. m. centralis, each containing 160 files, were fed on one occasion on each of the five goats (one group of testse flies per goat). Thereafter, each group of tsetse flies was maintained on clean rabbits. When infective, five flies from each group were allowed to feed on two naive goats each (i.e. two goats per group of tsetse flies). One animal in each pair was treated 24 h after infection with diminazene aceturate at a dose of 7.0 mg kg−1 b.w., the other was treated on Day 19, when parasitaemic, with the same drug dosage. As before, treatment 24 h following infection eliminated infections in all animals, but when treatment was delayed until Day 19, trypanosomes in all animals were refractory to treatment. Thus, although tsetse flies were infected with trypanosomes that had arisen in infected goats following treatment with diminazene aceturate at a dose of 7.0 mg kg−1 b.w., when the same flies were allowed to feed on clean goats, the resultant infections were sensitive to treatment with the same drug dosage when administered 24 h following infection. These data therefore indicate that there is a significant alteration in diminazene sensitivity of \{IL\} 3274 between Day 1 and Day 19 and that this is associated with an alteration in the resistance phenotype of the trypanosomes.

In this review, a summary is given of each of the drugs currently available for treatment and prophylaxis of trypanomosis and the tick-borne diseases theileriosis, babesiosis, anaplasmosis and cowdriosis. In contrast to the situation with the drugs used for tick-borne diseases, drug resistance appears to be becoming an increasing problem associated with the compounds used for trypanomosis. The literature that has been reviewed, therefore, is what which relates to the methods used to identify and quantify drug resistance in trypanosome populations, reports of resistance to trypanocides, and cross-resistance between trypanocides. The possible reason(s) for the apparent lack of development of resistance to the compounds used for treatment of tick-borne diseases is also discussed. Local toxicity at the site of injection is a problem that is particularly associated with many of the trypanocides when used on a long-term basis in individual animals. Various alternative preparations of the currently used trypanocides therefore have been evaluated in an attempt to reduce this toxicity, and are summarised. Finally, future developments in haemoparasitic chemotherapy are considered and, for trypanosomosis, highlight the importance of integrating chemotherapeutic and chemoprophylactic programmes with control of the vector when drug resistance becomes a significant constraint.

The main conclusion from the present study is thatT. parvasporozoite entry is dependent on a functional host cell actin cytoskeleton and is not driven by the parasite. Treating lymphocytes with cytochalasin D resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the levels of host cell infection. However, the primary effect was to block sporozoite binding and only at the highest concentration (20 μM) was sporozoite internalization significantly reduced. In fact at lower concentrations (1–10 μM) cytochalasin treatment lead to a relative increase in sporozoite internalization. The results are consistant with sporozoite entry being primarily a passive process and with a functional host cell actin cytoskeleton that is required only to maintain the molecular integrity of the surface membrane. ThusT. parvasporozoite entry differs from the process in other apicomplexans, although the results are consistent with a number of features of sporozoite biology. Treatment of lymphocytes with either the microtubule-destabilizing agent, nocodazole, or taxol, which induces microtubule polymerization, had no significant effect on sporozoite binding or entry. As both reagents had the expected effects on the lymphocyte microtubule system, it is unlikely that host cell microtubules are essential for successful sporozoite invasion or establishment. "

A concentrate mixture providing 2.5 Mcal/kg dry matter (DM) metabolizable energy and 15.2 g/kg \{DM\} digestible protein was used. Improved nutrition increased lamb postweaning average daily weight gain up to puberty by 6 to 26 g/day and the conception rate to first estrus by 9 to 16% while it reduced the mortality rate by 24 to 31% and age at first lambing by 2 to 5 months. Lambs reached puberty (age at first estrus) at 16.9±0.1 kg (±SEM) or 60% of mature body weight and 350±12 days of age. The onset of puberty was advanced by weaning weight (P&lt;0.05), itself being well correlated with birth weight (r = 0.51, P&lt;0.001), and by level of nutrition (high=299±19, medium=301±18, low=383±23 and poor=454±31 days, P&lt;0.001) through enhanced growth rate (r = −0.82, P&lt;0.001). No independent effect of drenching for endoparasites on pubertal development was observed (P&gt;0.05), but its interaction with season-of-birth improved the growth of lambs born during the period of short rains (P&lt;0.05). Overall mean litter size at first lambing was 1.07; the twinning rate was 6.5% and the birth weight was 1.9±0.1 kg. Up to 13.4% of newborn lambs, averaging 1.3±0.6 kg, died on the day of parturition. The results indicate that improved growth rate and body weight, resulting from better postweaning nutrition, affects the attainment of puberty in Menz ewe lambs. Mitigation of nutrition stress and endoparasitic infection depending on season-of-birth would thus increase the annual reproductive rate of breeding ewes and flock productivity. "

Litter size (prolificacy) is 1.12 but can be increased by 10–40% through premating ewe nutrition management or treatment with gonadotropins.

The animals were maintained on poor (n=28), low (n=29), medium (n=29) or high (n=28) levels of nutrition through grazing and supplementation.

Scrotal circumference increased linearly and was strongly correlated with age, body weight, wither height, and heart girth (r = 0.83 to 0.85, P&lt;0.001), and lamb weight could be predicted by the equation: 6.35 + 0.53 scrotal circumference (R2 = 0.73).

The overall level of oestrus synchrony was low (27%), but was higher for animals previously isolated (38 vs. 17%). The mean interval from ram introduction to oestrus was 12.2 (SD = 7.3) days, but this was significantly shorter for isolated ewes (9.4 ± 1.2 vs. 14.8 ± 1.7 days, P &lt; 0.05). Animals previously better fed were heavier at mating (P &lt; 0.01), but this had no relationship to the response to ram stimulation (P &gt; 0.05). Oestrus after ram introduction included two peaks (at 6 and 13 days) which were influenced by the behaviour of previously isolated animals. Conception rates to first and second service of 86% and 14%, respectively, were confirmed by plasma progesterone determinations. Subsequent lambing rate was only 72%, suggesting high prenatal reproductive wastage. Lambing was compacted, except for ewes conceiving at their second oestrus. There were as many twins born to isolated ewes as to exposed ewes but substantially more to ewes that were heavier at mating. These data suggest that, although ram introduction after a period of isolation will not increase ovulation and twinning rate in isolated Menz sheep as judged by litter size, it is a natural tool that could be useful to match events of the reproductive cycle of tropical sheep with feed and other management resources.

Use of woody legumes provides N-rich mulch and green manure to maintain soil fertility and enhance crop production, and protein-rich fodder for livestock. The success of alley farming depends on a number of technical factors—choice of suitable woody species, successful establishment of the hedgerows, and appropriate management of the hedgerows. The alley farming technique being a scale-neutral system is flexible enough for use both by smallholder farmers and in mechanized farming. It has the potential for providing the linkage between the extensive traditional farming practice and intensive farming. Alley farming allows for longer cropping period with increased land use intensity, rapid and effective soil fertility regeneration by inclusion of selective MPTs, and more intensive cropping with reduced requirements for external inputs.

In the study with 18-month-old goats given the same dose rates as those recommended for sheep, the reduction percentages were 73% for injectable ivermectin, 25% for fenbendazole, and 78% for levamisole. Another group of 14-month-old goats was treated with dose rates 1.5 times those recommended for sheep and the reduction percentages were 93% for levamisole, 92% for injectable ivermectin, and 97% for a combination of levamisole and ivermectin. In all experiments with sheep and goats the gastrointestinal nematode parasites identified by larval cultures were Haemonchus contortus, Trichostrongylus spp. and Oesophagostomum spp. The gastrointestinal nematodes of both sheep and goats on this farm are resistant to ivermectin and fenbendazole, whereas levamisole is still effective in sheep, but not in goats. The results are discussed in relation to the farm as a source of breeding stock to smallholder farmers and its potential to spread anthelmintic resistance. "

Four hundred and fifty-eight calf/dam pairs were also available where the calf had been reared to weaning, both had monthly matching records and each cow had weaned at least two calves. Evaluations were carried out on effects of, and linkages between, enviromental and stress factors, number and species of trypanosome infections, curative drug treatments given, anaemia measured by packed red cell volume (PCV), and performance measured by calf weaning weight, cow calving rate and cow weight change over the lactation period. Major findings were that over the period from calf birth to weaning, while calves and their dams grazing together had similar numbers of trypanosome infections detected, the Trypanosoma vivax: T. congolense ratios were very different: 1:0.7 in calves; 1:2.8 in cows. This indicated that some ability to control the development of parasitaemia following T. vivax infection might be being acquired, from weaning onwards. In cows, relationships between lowest \{PCV\} recorded and curative drug treatments given suggested that between 20 and 32% of trypanosome-infected cows were not being identified by the buffy coat parasitological diagnostic technique. The high level of curative treatment given (to 13.7% of cows over the calendar year, and to 40% of calves from birth to weaning) will have tended to reduce the variance and linkages between aspects of infection and \{PCV\} values, especially in calves. In calves, the influence of trypanosome infections, in both calf and dam, on their respective \{PCV\} values and hence on calf weaning weight was apparent. There was a 0.91 ± 0.40 kg increase in calf weaning weight for each 1% increase in calf average PCV, and a 0.95 ± 0.39 kg increase for each 1% increase in cow average PCV. In cows, there was a similar pathway of influence of T. congolense infection through the \{PCV\} values to calving rate — not significant with T. vivax infection. There was a 3.3 ± 0.65% increase in calving rate for each 1% increase in average PCV. Repeatabilities of performance traits were in the normal range. Repeatabilities of numbers of trypanosome infections detected by the buffy coat technique were too low to have any practical significance. Repeatability of average \{PCV\} at 0.40 ± 0.03 could allow \{PCV\} when infected to be used as one criterion of trypanotolerance. "

In trophozoites a connecting channel was observed between the parasite's cytostome and its intracytoplasmic food vacuole. In some cases the limiting membrane of the food vacuole was seen to be continuous with a close-meshed network of membrane-bounded, anastomosing tubules. This labyrinthine structure, which has not been described previously, may function as a digestive organelle in theilerial trophozoites. Electron micrographs also revealed the mode of intra-erythrocytic multiplication of these parasites in vivo. Prior to division, electron-dense cisternae and rhoptries appeared beneath the parasite's plasmalemmal membrane, marking the sites of merozoite formation. From a single parasite, a maximum of four merozoites were formed by schizogonous division and subsequently separated from a residual body by constriction at the base of each merozoite. In addition, observations on two double-membraned organelles seen in trophozoites and the intra-erythrocytic crystalline structures associated with Theileria sp. in waterbuck are reported. "

The trypanosomes were incubated at 35°C for 48 h with various drug concentrations (0.5 ng-50 μg/ml) and then transferred to cultures containing bovine endothelial-cell monolayers, to assess their viability over the following 5 days as compared to control trypanosomes that had been incubated without drug. The sensitivity to each drug was expressed as the minimum effective drug concentration which killed 100% of the trypanosomes in a given population within the 5 days. Using this assay, population \{IL\} 1180, characterised as being highly sensitive to all three drugs in vivo, required 10 ng/ml isometamidium chloride, 50 ng/ml homidium bromide or chloride and 5000 ng/ml diminazene aceturate to kill the entire population in vitro. In contrast, two derivatives of \{IL\} 1180 in which resistance to isometamidium had been induced in mice, \{IL\} 3343 and \{IL\} 3344, required isometamidium chloride at a concentration of 1000 ng/ml and 2000 ng/ml, respectively, to eliminate the populations. The in vitro results showed that the increase in level of resistance to isometamidium in these populations was associated with at least a 200-fold increase in resistance in both populations to homidium, but no increase in resistance to diminazene. \{KE\} 2887 and \{CP\} 81, two isolates expressing high levels of resistance to both isometamidium and homidium in mice and cattle, were both resistant in vitro to isometamidium chloride and homidium salts at 100 ng/ml.

All 5 cattle and 17 untreated cattle challenged on the same day became parasitaemic by day 16 post challenge, indicating that prophylaxis did not extend to 28 days post treatment. The cattle were then treated with isometamidium chloride at one of the following doses and by different routes of administration; 1.0 or 2.0 mg kg−1 intramuscularly, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 or 1.0 mg kg−1 intravenously. Infections relapsed in all cattle at an interval of 12–21 days following treatment, with the exception of those treated with 2.0 mg kg−1 intramuscularly in which the development of relapse infections was delayed. Similar studies were also conducted with a highly sensitive clone of T. congolense, \{IL\} 1180. Infections in cattle with this clone were eliminated by intravenous treatment with 0.25 mg kg−1 isometamidium chloride or intramuscular treatment with 0.5 mg kg−1 isometamidium chloride.

Fertilizer N application rates of 112 kg ha−1 were generally sufficient to produce maximum yields, to attain the highest fertilizer N uptake efficiency and for the grain sorghum cultivars to achieve the highest percentage partitioning of N, P and K into grain. Quadratic relationships best described the relationship between fertilizer N application rate and the amounts of N, P and K taken up by grain and forage sorghum cultivars. A strong interdependence between fertilizer N application rate and stover return on nutrient cycling appeared to be developing in the cropping system under study. Stover removal adversely affected yields, nutrient uptake and partitioning during the last 2 study years. The interactive effects of sorghum genotype, fertilizer N and stover removal on yields and soil productivity need to be assessed over a longer term if stover removal is to be developed into an environmentally sound and sustainable production strategy.

One other dietary treatment was oats straw supplemented with lablab. Sheep on the hay-lablab diet, compared with the straw-lablab diet, had higher intake (774 vs. 711 g day−1; P &lt; 0.01), growth rate (28 vs. 18 g day−1; P &lt; 0.1), digestibilities of \{DM\} (576 vs. 531 g kg−1; P &lt; 0.05), \{OM\} (608 vs. 557 g kg−1; P &lt; 0.05) and microbial N supply (6.0 vs. 4.2 g day−1; P &lt; 0.05), but both diets had similar N retentions. Intake of oats hay tended to be depressed by supplementation, but the depression was more pronounced with lablab and tagasaste.

The results were discussed in relation to, and supported, the hypothesis that variation in the performance of animals given leguminous supplements may partly be ascribed to how quickly the supplement disappears from the rumen.

These cows were allocated to 1 of 4 treatment groups: Group SPNW, supplement-nonworking; Group SPW, supplement-working; Group NSNW, nonsupplement-nonworking; and Group NSW, nonsupplement-working. After calving, working cows pulled sledges with a load of 300 to 450 Newtons(N); 4 hours per day 4 days per week, for a total of 100 days over a 1-year period. All cows were fed natural grass hay ad libitum while the supplemented cows were fed 3 kg of concentrate per head per day. The proportion of cows which showed behavioral estrus by 1 year post partum was 100, 100, 60 and 20% for Group SPNW, SPW, \{NSNW\} and \{NSW\} cows, respectively. Based on plasma progesterone concentrations, ovulation started 62 days earlier than onset of behavioral estrus. A total of 73 ovulations occurred by 1 year post partum. Forty-nine (67.1%) and 26 (32.9%) ovulations occurred in the supplemented and nonsupplemented cows while 33 (45.2%) and 40 (54.8%) ovulations occurred in the working and nonworking cows, respectively. Of the total ovulations, 26 (35.6%) were not associated with behavioral signs of estrus and occurred in 13 (32.5%) cows. The incidence of ovulation without estrus was higher (P&lt;0.05) in working (42.4%) than in nonworking (30%) cows and in nonsupplemented (41.7%) than in supplemented (32.7%) cows. Short luteal phases occurred in 32.5% of the cows before the establishment of normal estrous cycles. In working cows, diet supplementation off-set the negative effect of work on the onset of estrus and conception. However, a relatively higher number of cows in Group \{SPW\} had ovulations without estrus before a normal estrous cycle was established. The incidence of short luteal phases or ovulations without estrus did not influence the pregnancy rate in subsequent normal estrus periods. In conclusion, in the supplemented cows, work did not influence the proportion of cows showing estrus and conceiving, but it significantly delayed the postpartum anestrus interval. In the nonsupplemented cows, reproductive activity was impaired in both working and nonworking cows, but was pronounced in working cows. However, once pregnancy was established there was no effect of work on the maintenance of pregnancy. Our study shows that with appropriate feeding regimens lactating crossbred cows could be used for draught purposes without any detrimental effects on fertility, but calving intervals would be extended. Finally, the physiological mechanisms involved in anestrus and ovulations without estrus and the significance of such phenomena in affecting postpartum reproductive performance and fertility in working cows require further investigation.

abstract = "The incidence of short luteal phases and ovulations without oestrus was investigated in 42 primiparous Borana cows. Based on calving body weight, cows were allocated to either a control group with grass hay only or to a supplement group with a concentrate ration. Within nutritional groups, cows were further assigned to either milked or partially suckled groups. Cows were under continuous observation and vasectomised teaser bulls used in oestrus detection. Blood samples were collected twice weekly commencing on Day 30 postpartum until pregnancy for determination of plasma progesterone levels. A progesterone concentration of above 1 ng ml−1 was taken as a cut-off value between luteal and non-luteal phases and oestrous cycles of 17 days or less were considered as short. By 150 days postpartum, ovarian cyclic activity had commenced in 64.3% of the cows while 35.7% remained anoestrous. The mean (±SEM) postpartum anoestrous interval for the cyclic cows was 104 ± 19 days. Progesterone profiles revealed that up to the first detected oestrus, 97 ovulations occurred and 72% were not accompanied by behavioural signs of oestrus, indicating that an average of 2.6 oestrous periods per cow were silent. Differences in intervals between calving to onset of first oestrus based on visual detection and progesterone concentrations ranged from 5 to 21 days in 22.2%, 24–43 days in 44.4%, 44–63 days in 11.2% and 83–166 days in 22.2% of the cows. Short luteal phases with a mean duration of 10 ± 2 days and a range of 7–14 days were detected in 55.6% of the cows. There were no nutritional and suckling influences on the incidence of ovulation without oestrus and short luteal phases. Progesterone concentrations, however, were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) lower in short than in normal oestrous cycles. It was concluded that although short luteal phases occurred in a relatively larger proportion of cows, it was not an exclusive prerequisite for the establishment of normal oestrous cycles. The commencement of ovarian cyclic activity in 78% of the cows before Day 63 postpartum also suggests that ovulations without oestrus rather than postpartum anoestrus could be more responsible for extended calving intervals in Zebu cattle. The physiological basis and significance of ovulations without oestrus and short luteal phases in the fertility of Zebu cattle thus need further investigation. "

The data were used to compare the pattern of infection in very young animals and in their dams, and to evaluate how the pattern evolved in calves from birth to maturity, and thereafter in the different age groups represented by their dams. Five hundred and fourteen calves were evaluated at 3 week intervals for an average of 26 months each, over varying periods between birth and 42 months of age. Two hundred and sixty nine dams had matching records from parturition to calf weaning at 10 months. One month after weaning, animals were equally infected with Trypanosoma vivax and Trypanosoma congolense. From then until 42 months, the proportion of time an animal was infected with T. vivax relative to T. congolense gradually decreased. In the dams this trend continued from 4 years to at least 8 years of age by which time T. vivax infection was only one-third that of T. congolense infection. This finding is regarded as strong evidence of the ability of N'Dama cattle, in this region of Africa, to acquire significant control of the development of parasitaemia following T. vivax infection but apparently not following T. congolense infection. Pre-weaner calves, grazing with their dams, appeared to have considerable protection from, or be more resistant to, both T. vivax and T. congolense infections compared with their dams and to their own immediate post-weaning situations. More sensitive diagnostic techniques such as antibody and antigen-detection enzyme immuno-assays may help differentiate between pre-weaners that may not be infected and those that may be capable of controlling the development of detectable parasitaemia.

Four parameters that are regarded as possible indicators of trypanotolerance, species of trypanosomes detected, length of time parasitaemic, intensity of parasitaemia (parasitaemia score), and anaemic condition as estimated by packed cell volume (PCV) values, were measured and the relative effects of changes in these parameters on trypanocidal drug requirements and growth were assessed. The effects of species of trypanosome on drug requirements and growth were directly measurable. In the case of the other three indicators, the effects on drug requirements and growth that would be brought about by a change of one standard deviation in each were calculated. This allowed comparison of similar sized changes in these three indicators that are of necessity recorded in dissimilar units. Trypanosoma vivax and Trypanosoma congolense infections had equal effects on the number of trypanocidal drug treatments required, an average of 0.61 treatments being administered to each infected post-weaner. A reduction of one standard deviation (SD) in length of time infected reduced the number of treatments required by 0.23 or 36% and an increase of 1 \{SD\} in \{PCV\} reduced the number required by 0.27 or 43%. Changes in parasitaemia score were not important. In the case of growth, a T. congolense infection reduced growth by 12.4 g day−1 or 8% more than a T. vivax infection. A reduction of 1 \{SD\} in length of time infected increased growth by 9.8 g day−1 or 6.5%, a reduction of 1 \{SD\} in parasitaemia score increased growth by 9.0 g day−1 or 6.0%, and an increase of 1 \{SD\} in average \{PCV\} increased growth by 8.4 g day−1 or 5.6%. The necessity to simultaneously measure the four criteria is clearly indicated by their approximately equal effects on the final performance trait of daily liveweight gain. Thus, absence of information on any of these criteria would significantly affect the accuracy of the estimate of an animal's overall trypanotolerance phenotype in this central African situation and reduce the progress possible in production projects involving N'Dama cattle.

abstract = "East Coast fever (ECF), caused by Theileria parva, is the most important tick-borne disease of cattle in much of eastern, central and southern Africa. In Kenya, immunization against \{ECF\} has been performed in many field trials using the infection and treatment method. The main targets for immunization are the Taurine and Taurine-cross cattle, due to their high susceptibility. However, indigenous Zebu cattle may also be targets for immunization where endemic instability to this parasite exists. For both cattle types, it is important to know the prevalence of other tick-borne diseases if the frequency of acaricide application is to be reduced following \{ECF\} immunization. In the Coast Province of Kenya there are four distinct agroecological zones (AEZs), classified on agroclimatic factors. The environmental conditions in these \{AEZs\} vary in their suitability for Rhipicephalus appendiculatus the main field vector of ECF. The abundance of this tick has a direct impact on the degree of endemic stability to T. parva and is hence the justification for immunization in the predominantly Zebu cattle population of the Province. A serological study was conducted on 316 Zebu calves on 30 farms in three of the four agroecological zones, and prevalence rates to Theileria parva, T. mutans, Babesia bigemina, Anaplasma marginale and Cowdria ruminantium were determined. Antibody prevalence rates to T. parva differed across \{AEZs\} (ranging from 22 to 85%) whereas to the other tick-borne diseases they were uniformly high (73–94%). It is concluded that the justification for immunization of Zebu cattle against \{ECF\} varies with AEZ, and that any reduction in acaricide usage following immunization is unlikely to be accompanied by an increased incidence of other tick-borne diseases. The sampling methodolohy used in the study was evaluated for its precision, and recommendations for sampling strategy in future studies of tick-borne disease prevalence are made. "

The cloned gene is tandemly repeated, with a monomeric unit length of 900 bp, in the genomes of all T. vivax isolates from diverse geographic locations in Africa and South America. The gene is differentially expressed, since both the transcript and antigen are present in bloodstream-stage parasites, but not in the epimastigotes of T. vivax. Although the gene is found in all T. vivax isolates so far tested, it either exists in low copy number or in a divergent form in one isolate from Kilifi at the Kenya Coast. Sequence translation revealed a remarkable degree of bias in codon usage with preference for G and C (82%) in the wobble position. Using the deduced amino acid sequence to search the databases for any structurally related peptides, revealed no significant identity with any known proteins. The function of the species-specific antigen of T. vivax is thus unknown. Nevertheless the identification and characterization of proteins released into the circulation of protozoan parasite-infected animals is important and should allow the determination of what role such molecules may play in the modulation of disease pathology.

The chancres developed much faster and were more pronounced when ten infected tsetse were allowed to feed on a spot as compared to only one fly per spot. The initial host cellular reaction in the chancre was predominantly polymorphonuclear, followed at the peak of development of the chancre by a predominantly lymphoblastic and plasmacytic reaction. Trypanosomes were found in various stages of division as well as degeneration in chancre biopsies taken at various days post-infection (p.i.). Most of the trypanosomes recovered from the chancre tissue fluid were found to bear the same variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) epitopes as the corresponding metacyclics for as long as 13 days p.i., as revealed by indirect immunofluorescence using mouse anti-metacyclic \{VSG\} hyperimmune sera and monoclonal antibodies. Immunization of goats with metacyclic trypanosomes, by exposure to infected tsetse bites followed by treatment of the infected goats on day 13 p.i., gave rise to the development of protection to homologous tsetse-transmitted challenge, whilst immunization by intravenous inoculation of the metacyclics did not induce such protection. Chancre formation would thus appear to be vital for the induction of comprehensive immune recognition of the metacyclic variable antigen repertoire deposited in the skin by infected tsetse, and hence development of protective immunity.

In early pregnancy when an egg was present in the uterus, morphometric parameters of the nucleus, the cytoplasm and its organelles were markedly low coincident with low physiological activity in the gland cells. This is the period when a proportion of the assimilated amino acids from the digested blood meals are converted to triglyceride in the fat body and stored. During the second half of pregnancy, when a larva was present in the uterus, there was a striking increase of the cytoplasmic and organelle volumes as well as of the surface areas of rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum. There was also a marked augmentation of triglyceride-like inclusions, and later of secretory vesicles which released their content into enlarging extracellular reservoirs. This indicated a markedly high activity in the gland cells concomittant with the period of rapid synthesis of large amounts of proteins and lipoproteins destined for the growing intra-uterine larva. Mitochondrial parameters also increased, probably to generate adequate energy for synthesis, transport and secretion of nutriments for the larva. After larviposition, a marked reduction of cellular parameters was measured, and the volume density of lysosome-like structures had increased, indicating that larviposition is followed by degradation of large amounts of cellular organelles involved in biosynthetic processes. Morphometrical investigation of the uterine gland cells demonstrated a temporal correlation of the cellular dynamics with physiological events involved in producing a fully developed third-instar larva at the end of a pregnancy cycle.

abstract = "A soluble 80-kDa endopeptidase has been isolated from Trypanosoma brucei brucei. The enzyme, which has a pI 5.1, is optimally active at about pH 8.2 and has apparent pKa values of 6.0 and ⩾10. It is inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor diisopropylfluorophosphate and by the serine protease mechanism-based inhibitor 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin. Unexpectedly, the enzyme is inhibited by the cysteine protease inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-LeuLysCHN2 but not by the related diazomethane, butoxycarbonyl-ValLeuGlyLysCHN2, nor by other cysteine protease specific compounds. Specificity studies with a variety of amidomethylcoumaryl (AMC) derivatives of small peptides show that the enzyme has a highly restricted trypsin-like specificity. The best substrate, based on the magnitude of kcatKm, was benzyloxycarbonyl-ArgArgAMC; other good substrates were benzyloxycarbonyl-PheArgAMC, benzoyl-ArgAMC, and compounds with Arg at \{P1\} and Ala or Gly at P2. The hydrolysis of most substrates obeyed classical Michaelis—Menton kinetics but several exhibited pronounced substrate inhibition. The enzyme did not activate plasminogen nor decrease blood clotting time; it was inhibited by aprotinin but not by chicken ovomucoid. We conclude that the enzyme is a trypsin-like serine endopeptidase with unusually restricted subsite specificities. "

The metacyclic trypanosomes used in the assay were obtained from cultures initiated directly from either the blood of cattle with low levels of parasitaemia or from guts of infected tsetse flies. Sensitivities to isometamidium chloride, diminazene aceturate and homidium salts were assessed at various drug concentrations (0.5 ng-50 μg/ml). The results were compared with those obtained with two characterised laboratory populations. In spite of the fact that isometamidium chloride had not been widely used at Nguruman, two of the stocks (KE 3302 and \{KE\} 3303) expressed high levels of resistance to this drug (resistant to 100 ng/ml and 1000 ng/ml, respectively). In contrast, all of the populations examined were as sensitive, or more so, to diminazene aceturate than the sensitive laboratory clone \{IL\} 1180; two stocks (KE 3305 and \{KE\} 3306) were more sensitive (resistant to 0.5 μg/ml, sensitive to 1 μg/ml) and three stocks expressed the same level of sensitivity as \{IL\} 1180 (resistant to 1 μg/ml, sensitive to 5 μg/ml). Since the results of the in vitro assay correlated well with field observations it was concluded that the assay would be a useful tool in epidemiological studies to determine the resistance phenotypes of trypanosome populations in the field, thereby enabling development of appropriate control measures for particular areas.

Ewes either only grazed (C) or, in addition, received 400 g per head day-1 of a concentrate feed providing 175 g \{CP\} per kg \{DM\} and 10.5 \{MJ\} \{MEr\} per kg \{DM\} only during the first (S1), second (S2) or third (S3) trimester of pregnancy. The twinning rate increased from zero in ewes weighing 15 kg or less at mating to 31% at 30 kg or more. Six percent of ewes lost weight during pregnancy, 31% gained less than 3.5 kg (the mean birth and placenta weight) but 63% gained more. Perinatal mortality (the percentage of lambs dead during the first 4 days relative to those born alive) was 19.3% (n=62321); the rate of survival rising sharply from 37% below 1 kg birth weight, to 69% between 1 and 2 kg and 98% at 2–3 kg with no losses above 3 kg. Single lambs were born heavier than twins (2.0–0.6 and 1.7±0.5 kg) but litter size had no effect on survival above that on birth weight. Birth weight was related to lamb rectal temperature and viability at birth (r=0.42 and 0.68, respectively) and increased with dam gestational live weight gain, placental weight and number of cotyledons (r=0.39−0.55, respectively, P&lt;0.001). There was no advantage in supplementing ewes in the first trimester but extra feed in the second and third trimester increased dam weight gain P&lt;0.001). In particular, \{S3\} dams produced heavier lambs with better survival and were themselves heavier postpartum. The overall relationship between probability of survival (P) and birth weight (BWt) was given as: logit(P)=3.292×BWt-4.057. We concluded that grazing Menz sheep need to be managed to mate at 25 kg or greater for increased twinning, and require extra feed in the third trimester to produce lambs of at least 2 kg birth weight with a perinatal death risk of less than 10%. The reduced reproductive wastage will help to improve current flock production efficiency. "

The impact of the drought on livestock in both systems was determined through a post-drought survey of farmers and ranchers. Off-take rates were measured for cattle, sheep and goats. The impact of the drought on livestock in the intensive system in southern Machakos was much smaller than in the more extensive system in Kajiado. The results indicate that replacing extensive agropastoral systems with more intensive crop-livestock systems could lead to more sustainable livestock production. "

These include three mAb (P8, IL-A22 and IL-A24) that recognize the majority of monocytes and granulocytes in peripheral blood; two of these mAb were also shown to react with 30–40% of cells in bone marrow, including both monocytic and granulocytic cells, and with variable percentages of tissue macrophages. Thus these mAb can act as markers for myeloid cells in haemopoietic tissues and for monocytes in cell populations devoid of granulocytes. A further two mAb (IL-A23 and IL-A25) recognize monocytes and/or macrophages. The reactivity of one of these mAb (IL-A25) appears to be mainly restricted to pulmonary macrophages. The other mAb reacts with a variable proportion of blood monocytes and generally with a higher percentage of tissue macrophages, suggesting that its expression may relate to activation or maturation of monocytes. In order to study the functional properties of peripheral blood monocytes, techniques were developed for obtaining populations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) depleted of monocytes to less than 0.2% and monocyte populations of greater than 97% purity. Removal of monocytes from \{PBM\} abrogated the capacity of the cells to proliferate in response to Con A and PBS, although addition of 2-mercaptoethanol to the cultures restored proliferation. In both allogeneic and autologous mixed leukocyte cultures (MLC), monocytes were required in the stimulator cell populations for induction of the proliferative responess, and both responses could be elicited with purified monocytes. However, proliferation in the autologous \{MLC\} occurred only with responder cell populations that were depleted of monocytes. Moreover, it was shown that addition of more than 5% unirradiated monocytes to the autologous \{MLC\} suppressed proliferation. These findings indicate that monocytes play an important role in the induction and regulation of cellular immune responses in cattle. Two of the mAb that react with monocytes and granulocytes were tested for their capacity to inhibit proliferative responses of \{PBM\} to mitogens, alloantigens or the soluble antigen, KLH. One antibody (IL-A24) inhibited proliferation to \{KLH\} by over 80% but had no effect on the other responses. The results indicated that the inhibition was due to an effect of the mAb on processing and/or presentation of the antigen by monocytes. "

The local skin reactions that developed in the Zebu were large and severe while those that occurred in the other breeds were smaller and less severe or mild. The timing of appearance of parasitaemia and the height of the first peaks were similar in all the animals, but the Zebu were less able to control subsequent waves of parasitaemia. Possibly reflecting these events, it was only in the Zebu that significant anaemia developed. Neutralizing antibody against homologous metacyclic trypanosomes developed between 14 to 18 days after infection in all breeds of cattle; however, marked differences were found when antibody to trypanosomes derived from first peak parasitaemias were tested in the Zebu and Baoule. Neutralizing antibody against these parasites appeared in the Baoule on day 24 but were not detected in Zebu until day 51. Furthermore, the antibody titres were 3 log2 higher in the Baoule. It was concluded that the trypanotolerance exhibited by the West African taurine cattle might be related to a) their ability to control trypanosome numbers in the skin and in the bloodstream, an outcome that was possibly brought about by the earlier and superior immune response and b) failure to develop anaemia which might be associated with their capacity to control parasitaemia.

A comparative study of compounds which inhibit the respiration of the infective form of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei brucei, such as salicylhydroxamic acid, other substituted benzhydroxamic acids, esters of 2,3- and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid and structurally related compounds, showed that they have a remarkable degree of selectivity for the trypanosome as compared to rat liver mitochondria even though they are putative CoQ analogues and both respiratory systems are dependent on CoQ. 2. 2. The minimal inhibition of mammalian mitochondrial function could not be assigned to inhibition of ubiquinone function in these mitochondria. 3. 3. CoQ-reducing mitochondrial dehydrogenases from rat liver, trypanosomes and skunk cabbage (Symplocarpus foetidus) were insensitive to these inhibitors. 4. 4. The alternative oxidase of skunk cabbage mitochondria was sensitive to a spectrum of trypanosome respiration inhibitors suggesting a similarity to the oxidase of the trypanosome although differing degrees of sensitivity and differing responses to alterations in the molecular structure of the inhibitors indicate that the milieu of the active sites are dissimilar.

Sixty-nine (89·6%) of 77 parasitologically confirmed cases examined at the Daloa clinic had antigens in serum; 35 (45·5%) had antigens in \{CSF\} and, in 4 of these, the antigens were detected in \{CSF\} only. Taking the serum and \{CSF\} results together, 73 (94·8%) of the 77 patients were positive in the assay. In the Kinshasa series, 168 (89·4%) of 188 parasitologically confirmed cases were positive by antigen elisa. The controls, who included 165 blood donors and 40 patients with malaria, 2 with hydatidosis and 12 with leishmaniasis, were negative by antigen elisa. Analysis of \{CSF\} results for 35 patients who had antigens in \{CSF\} revealed that 34 (97·1%) had elevated \{CSF\} white cell counts, 29 (82·9%) had elevated protein levels, and 23 (65·7%) had trypanosomes in their CSF. Moreover, analysis of results for 34 patients whose \{CSF\} had been shown to harbour trypanosomes by the double centrifugation technique showed that 24 (70·6%) had antigens in CSF, 28 (82·6%) had elevated protein levels, and 33 (97·1%) had elevated \{CSF\} white cell counts. Antigens were rapidly cleared from peripheral circulation following institution of treatment. Antigen clearance was accompanied by a rapid fall in \{CSF\} protein levels and white cell counts. These results demonstrate the potential of antigen elisa, not only as a tool for diagnosis, but also for clinical staging and treatment follow-up of patients with T. b. gambiense sleeping sickness.

Isometamidium concentrations in the sera of these cattle were measured using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay over the first 105 days following treatment. All cattle challenged with \{IL\} 3893 or \{IL\} 3889 developed infection following the first challenge, at which time the mean serum drug concentration in all treated cattle was 6 ng/ml. Cattle challenged with \{IL\} 1180 became infected following 6 to 8 monthly challenges. The mean serum drug concentration in these cattle at the time of their third monthly challenge with \{IL\} 1180 was 0.75 ng/ml. Trypanosome populations \{IL\} 3893 and \{IL\} 3889 were considered to be highly resistant to isometamidium, while \{IL\} 1180, relatively sensitive. It was therefore concluded that T. congolense persisting at serum isometamidium concentrations greater than 0.75 ng/ml can be considered moderately resistant, while those persisting at concentrations greater than 6 ng/ml can be considered markedly resistant. These results will be most valuable in the investigation of isometamidium resistance of T. congolense in the field. "

Differences in drug susceptibility were also detected regarding infectivity to mice and changes in trypanosome cell volume. The results demonstrated that less than 1 min exposure to diminazene aceturate at concentrations as seen in bovine plasma at the initial peak after diminazene aceturate treatment is enough to irreversibly damage drug-sensitive trypanosomes. However, these concentrations were not sufficient to completely eliminate drug-resistant trypanosomes after exposure for 1–6 h; trypanosomes continued to grow for 48 h before the majority of them died and only a few organisms survived to revive the cultures. When drug-sensitive trypanosomes were exposed in vitro for 24 h to diminazene aceturate at the level of concentrations found in cattle after treatment with 3.5 mg/kg, most of the trypanosomes died and none of the surviving parasites could be propagated in vitro in the absence of drug for more than 2 days. However, a small population of drug-resistant trypanosomes was not irreversibly damaged and a few surviving trypanosomes were able to establish growing cultures.

Because monoclonal antibodies to bovine lymphoid-specific surface antigens have only recently become available, these cells have not been previously characterized in regard to subpopulations. Furthermore, it was not known how expression of lymphoid differentiation antigens and subset proportionalities might change following different modes of activation of LNC. Therefore, the distribution of cell-surface differentation antigens in unstimulated \{LNC\} as well as in \{LNC\} incubated with the mitogen concanavalin A (Con A) or the phorbol ester, phorbol dibutyrate (PDBU), was measured using a series of leukocyte-specific monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry. Unstimulated \{LNC\} were found to have similar proportions of T cells, B cells (sIgM positive), and \{MHC\} Class \{II\} positive cells similar to bovine peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (reviewed by Baldwin et al., 1988a). Treatment of the \{LNC\} with \{PDBU\} or mitogenic doses of Con A induced changes in the expression of surface antigens consistent with the changes observed with human and mouse cells after similar activation. However, these two compounds did not cause identical effects. After treatment with PDBU, the percentage of cells expressing \{CD4\} as well as the density of surface expression decreased. An increase in the percentage of cells expressing and/or density of surface expression of the pan T cell antigens CD2, CD5, CD6, \{MHC\} Class \{II\} and J5, a T cell activation antigen, also occurred. \{PDBU\} treatment also increased the percentage of \{CD8\} positive cells. The change in \{CD6\} following \{PDBU\} treatment has not been reported previously. Con A treatment led to a significant increase in the percentage of cells bearing CD8, CD6, \{MHC\} Class \{II\} and J5, but it had no effect on the percentages of cells positive for the other T cell markers CD5, CD4, or CD2. Because Con A is a complete mitogen and \{PDBU\} is not, the changes observed following Con A stimulation probably reflected an expansion of a particular subpopulation. In contrast, \{PDBU\} most likely modifies surface antigen expression directly. Neither treatment affected the B cell subpopulation. "
