abstract = "Summary This study analyzes how long-run macroeconomic fluctuations have affected timber production levels in five tropical oil-producing countries: Gabon, Cameroon, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Venezuela, and Ecuador. The core hypothesis is that oil booms, foreign borrowing and other major foreign exchange inflows slow down timber harvesting. These inflows cause “Dutch Disease,” depressing the price competitiveness of timber exports and other trade-exposed sectors. A qualitative examination of long-run trends in the five countries is combined with simple econometrics. The findings confirm a strong impact of competitiveness on logging. Substantial real currency devaluation can greatly accelerate timber exports. Yet, in middle-income countries with strongly expanding domestic timber markets (Ecuador, Cameroon, Venezuela), home-market demand also rises much with urban incomes and population. When full or partial import protection occurs, this translates into rising domestic production. The relative weight of these two potentially significant factors varies widely, so policies to influence extraction levels need to be tailored accordingly. "

Microimpacts of rising poverty can increase or slow forest loss. At the macrolevel, poverty also has an ambiguous effect, but it is probable that higher income stimulates forest loss by raising demand for agricultural land. The second question is what potential forest-led development has to alleviate a country's poverty, in terms of producer benefits, consumer benefits and economy-wide employment. Natural forests widely serve as “safety nets” for the rural poor, but it proves difficult to raise producer benefits significantly. Urban consumer benefits from forest, an important target for pro-poor agricultural innovation, are limited and seldom favor the poor. Absorption of (poor) unskilled labor is low in forestry, which tends to be capital-intensive. Natural forests may thus lack comparative advantage for poverty alleviation. There are few “win–win” synergies between natural forests and national poverty reduction, which may help to explain why the loss of tropical forests is ongoing. This may have important implications for our understanding of “sustainable forest development” and for the design of both conservation and poverty-alleviation strategies. "

Our main findings can be summarized as follows: there is a statistically significant positive relationship between tree cover and dietary diversity; fruit and vegetable consumption increases with tree cover until a peak of 45% tree cover and then declines; and there is no relationship between animal source food consumption and tree cover. Overall our findings suggest that children in Africa who live in areas with more tree cover have more diverse and nutritious diets. "

Land reform tends to promote land redistribution through regularization of smallholder land invasions of large-scale landholdings, and by redistribution of public lands to smallholders in existing colonization frontiers. The implications of state-led land reform on deforestation are heterogeneous. I argue that impacts of agrarian reform are strongly related to the pre-existing social and economic configuration of the frontiers where it takes place. While it leads to lower rates of deforestation in landscapes dominated by smallholders with diversified land use, its impact on forest conversion is higher in landscapes where extensive land use, mainly prompted by large-scale cattle ranching, tends to dominate. I provide an assessment for the whole Brazilian Amazon, and examine two research sites in the state of Pará, namely Uruará and Redenção. The study is based on informant interviews, secondary information, agricultural census data, and remote sensing data. "

Many broader, empiricist definitions fail to distinguish \{PES\} from the larger generic family of positive environmental incentives, thus eroding their meaning by excessive vagueness. Arguably, \{PES\} definitions should focus on describing a functional tool, rather than normatively integrating desirable \{PES\} outcomes. A modified narrow \{PES\} definition is proposed, outlining conditionality as the single defining feature, avoiding the buyer-seller terms, and linking \{PES\} to offsite externalities. Extensive explanatory guidelines address many valid conceptual concerns raised in the recent \{PES\} literature. "

Despite the broad growing trend of pasture expansion for adoption of cattle ranching as the main land use associated with frontier expansion, some differences persist across actor types. In relative terms, medium- and large-scale landholders place most of their cleared forestland under pasture, and in absolute terms, largeholders have deforested more than smallholders because they hold larger tracts of land. Recently, however, deforestation activity has been increasing in frontiers occupied by smallholders who tend to convert a greater proportion of the forestland in their landholdings to agricultural land uses than larger-scale landholders, mainly to expand cattle ranching operations. Furthermore, smallholders tend to maintain higher cattle stocking rates than medium- and large-scale landholders, which tend to adopt extensive systems of cattle production. Both economic and human development indices in each frontier type vary according to actor type. While in absolute terms, higher per capita agricultural income levels are found in frontiers where largeholders predominate, the corresponding incomes are higher in smallholder frontiers when prorated by unit of land under crops and pasture. In addition, the Human Development Index is higher in frontiers with greater presence of large-scale landholdings. "

We then consider possible strategies for improving their effectiveness. The review results indicate that first, Indonesia has enacted a number of regulations and established various institutions to tackle forest and other wildfires, but these have proved ineffective. Second, under future climate change scenarios and current fire management practices, Indonesia's tropical rain forests could be more susceptible to fire. Third, effectiveness could be improved by addressing the underlying causes of fires, involving a wide range of stakeholders in formulating the regulations and enhancing law enforcement. "

The extraction of timber and economically important \{NTFPs\} such as Brazil nuts (from the emergent forest tree Bertholletia excelsa) is occurring in the same forests and provides a clear opportunity to integrate management decisions and planning. Bolivia’s forestry legislation allows, in principle, the management of multiple forest resources. However, there is little evidence that the opportunity has led to greater integration of management decisions and practice. Actually, management of each resource is typically carried out by different stakeholders with resident families responsible for Brazil nut gathering while logging companies carry out the timber harvest. This paper analyzes community forest management plans in Northern Bolivia to examine whether community residents participated in the development and implementation of the timber management plans, and the extent to which proponents of timber management plans attempted to integrate Brazil nut management into timber harvesting. The research draws on analysis of approved timber management plans for community forests and focus group interviews with residents in selected forest communities. Based on observations, the paper concludes that multiple-use management in these forests could be improved by strengthening community level institutions by confirming their authority over timber management operations and by building capacity to oversee and monitor the extraction activities of loggers working on their land.

We assess whether recent radical changes in forestry laws in Peru will result in significant improvements in logging practices. We adapt North's conceptual framework of institutional change to analyze the impact of governance on loggers' norms and argue that improvements in logging practices will require changes in both laws and norms. The analysis uses survey and field evaluation data on logging practices in Peru, as well as secondary sources. Results show that bringing about radical changes in logging practices is particularly difficult in countries with a history of governance failures in the timber sector. In Peru, governance failures that have promoted norms inconsistent with good management are government's perceived lack of interest in long-term timber management, inconsistent forestry laws, perceived discrimination against the timber sector, and ineffective law enforcement. As a result of decades of these governance failures, loggers developed a short-term perspective on timber extraction and felt entitled to violate government's laws. Poor logging practices continued under the new law because of governance failures. The Peruvian experience shows that changing laws radically is often easier than avoiding governance failures in implementation. While some governance failures were partially rectified, others assumed added significance under the provisions of the new law. Decentralization also exacerbated existing and new governance problems. These failures reinforced existing norms and may, in addition, lead to norms condoning corruption. Modifications need to occur both in norms and in logging laws to reduce the inconsistency between the two. Notable improvements in governance will be required to bring about changes in norms. Changes in the logging system are therefore likely to be far less revolutionary, and to take far longer, than envisioned. "

This paper demonstrates that: (1) Congo Basin forests are needed for adaptation because they can help to decrease human vulnerability to climate change; and (2) Congo Basin forest management practices need to be adapted to accommodate climate change because these forests are vulnerable to climate change. A framework for facilitating adaptation in forestry is discussed and a review of adaptive actions presented. The paper recommends the adoption of sustainable forest management approach that includes a climate change focus. Such management should not only avoid any adverse effects on the forest resources and conservation of biodiversity, but also provides opportunities for greater, more sustainable rural development and poverty alleviation through income generation and employment opportunities.

This study quantified and compared total harvested and damaged trees after logging operations carried out in East Kalimantan, Indonesia under two types of arrangements: 20-year commercial selective logging concessions, known as Hak Pengusahaan Hutan (HPH) and 1-year harvest permits intended for local communities, known as Ijin Pemungutan dan Pemanfaatan Kayu (IPPK). Sample plots of 20 ha were established in areas previously harvested by \{HPH\} and IPPK. Harvest levels were lower than those documented in other logging studies in Borneo, although it is possible that missing and therefore uncounted stumps of harvested trees in cleared areas (i.e. log landings and roads) and larger plots size may have underestimated harvest levels. Significant differences were found between \{HPH\} selective logging and \{IPPK\} permit holders (1 trees ha−1 and 4 trees ha−1, respectively). It was found that \{IPPK\} permit holders harvested a larger percentage of trees below 50 cm dbh than did \{HPH\} logging (&gt;25% as compared to 3%, respectively). \{IPPK\} permit holders operations also damaged twice as many residual trees below 50 cm dbh per unit area as did \{HPH\} harvests. However, \{HPH\} produced higher levels of damage per unit volume and number trees harvested, in terms of skid trail length, number of trees damaged, and canopy opening. The sum of the harvested and damaged trees, which may be lost from future harvest due to rot and mortality after harvesting, was significantly different under short-term permit holders and selective logging concessionaires (28 trees ha−1 versus 9 trees ha−1 in primary forest; 39 trees ha−1 versus 28 trees ha−1 in logged-over forest). Future harvest potential of the forest may be significantly lower with the influence of \{IPPK\} logging system, in terms of harvesting practices and logging damaged to the forest stands. "

Since Nigeria's return to civilian rule in 1999, in a bid to modernize its ailing agricultural economy, most of its defunct plantations were privatized and large new areas of land were allocated to ‘high-capacity’ agricultural investors. This paper explores the local tensions associated with this policy shift in Cross River State, which, due to its favorable agro-ecological conditions and investment climate, has become one of Nigeria's premier agricultural investment destinations. It shows how the state's increasing reliance on the private sector as an impetus for rural transformation is, paradoxically, crowding out smallholder production systems and creating new avenues for rent capture by political and customary elites. Moreover, as Nigeria's most biodiverse and forested state, the rapid expansion of the agricultural frontier into forest buffer zones is threatening to undermine many of the state's conservation initiatives and valuable common pool resources. The paper goes on to explain why and how private sector interests in Cross River State are increasingly being prioritized over natural resource protection, indigenous rights over the commons, and smallholder production systems.

More recently, global needs for energy and food have increased pressure on forest land. The REDD+ mechanism is designed to reverse this situation and create opportunities for necessary reforms both inside and outside the forestry sector. In this paper, we take a political economy perspective to analyze Indonesia's policies on the allocation of forest land (kawasan hutan) and, related to this, assess the changes in forest land allocation that are needed to enable REDD+ to compete with other sectors. This paper shows that there are numerous challenges to create a “space” for REDD+, many of which are rooted in the political economy of forests that shapes the nature and process of the land allocation system. The questions of where, on which type of forest land, at what scale and based on which procedures remain key for REDD+ and its capability to compete with other objectives within the current forest land allocation framework.

In land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities through afforestation and reforestation projects, known as A/R CDM, the deliverables that demonstrate sustainable development remain unclear. While the methods to convincingly demonstrate carbon benefits are fine-tuned, there is growing concern on a lack of socio-economic benefits of the projects. With the criteria for sustainable development left with the national approval process, \{CDM\} projects in a medium-income country with transparent criteria may be more supportive to the socio-economic targets of \{CDM\} than in a low-income country without further specifications. At national scale, priority areas can be identified on the basis of publicly available data on land cover and the human development index (HDI). In a case study for Indonesia we found that population density between a lower and upper limit, and risks of fire incidence are socio-economic indicators which could further guide choices within the domain of technically eligible lands (without forest cover in 1990). Within the 302 districts across Indonesia covering a land area of around 193 million ha, the eligibility criteria based on the Marrakesh Accord (later called “hard” criteria) identified 47 million ha of land. With additional (later called “soft”) criteria of a population density between 10 and 100 persons km−2 and a below-average HDI, 17.3 million ha of eligible lands distributed over 53 districts were prioritized. Differences in fire risk lead to a further stratification of clusters of similarity within this priority domain, with \{CDM\} possible at high as well as low fire risk, but requiring different types of project. By grouping districts in clusters of overall similarity of land cover, three main clusters with 7.9, 0.7 and 3.7 Mha of prioritized eligible lands were identified where pilot activities for \{CDM\} may be implemented with higher probability of development benefits and extrapolation potential.

Sufficient capacity of government at all levels is crucial to guide the policy processes, benefit sharing, and technical support. Uncertainties around tenure issues and property rights may generate new problems that undermine the interests of society at large.

We stress how designs of linked conservation interventions should be based on theories of change that recognize the complexity of issues at stake across the hierarchy of actors and re-contextualize the processes so as to direct them towards emission-reductions and other desired outcomes.

The former Lake Faguibine in northern Mali has experienced drastic ecological, social, and economic changes. Forests have emerged on the former lake and have become important for local livelihoods. This paper analyses the coping and adapting strategies of forest- and livestock-based livelihoods facing ecological changes. Results from field research at different levels indicate that most local strategies are based on diversification including migration within the livestock production system or in complement to it, with differences according to gender, age, and ethnicity. Political discourses, cultural identities, and past experiences influence and shape adaptation strategies at the local level. The sustainability of the observed strategies depends on the access to natural resources and the sustainable management of these resources, which in turn depends on institutions at local and national levels. Many local strategies are reactive to external events but would need strategic support from higher levels to move from coping to adapting. Examples are the development of institutions and technical actions for natural resource management, as well as development actions supporting local strategies and sustainable investments. Researchers, practitioners and development planners will need simple methods and tools for understanding and analysing local adaptation perceptions and actions to achieve an effective support of sustainable and gender-equitable local adaptation and to avoid mismatches between strategies proposed by local and by sub national and national actors.

A Geographic Information System containing ecological and economic variables was used in combination with remote sensing data to define the net commercial value of standing timber in the East province. Taking account of the potential commercial value of standing timber improves our understanding of the spatial determinants of logging activities and of the resulting forest-cover modifications. The occurrence of logging-induced forest-cover modifications increases with the value of forest rent. In one of the study sites, half of the very high rent areas have already been logged. In that site, therefore, it is mostly the low rent or marginal forest areas that remain unlogged.

Among the key forms of change are those which demonstrate a degree of adaptation to resource decline: decreased participation in fishing; greater reliance of fishing households on nonfishing income; increased dependence on remittances of nonhousehold children; increased participation of women in nonhousehold labor; and dramatic growth in the number of fishing organizations involved in resource management.

What is the potential of these community forestry models to deliver livelihood improvements to participants? This is an important question for two reasons. First, some donors are placing high hopes on community forestry to support poverty alleviation in the Mekong Region. Second, community forestry has generally under-performed in poverty alleviation worldwide. Existing and planned models must be examined to understand to what extent they can fulfill their goals and how they can be improved. Among various theoretical preconditions for successful poverty alleviation through community forestry, this article focuses on two: (1) the degree to which poverty alleviation is a guiding force in the establishment and implementation of community forestry; and (2) the compatibility of government commitment to poverty alleviation through community forestry with other goals being pursued by the government. How do the three case study countries perform with respect to these preconditions? With respect to the first precondition, it is found that although all three country programs now espouse poverty alleviation as a key goal, other state goals (e.g., compliance with donor organization recommendations, decentralization, devolution, resource conservation) were the guiding motivations in the establishment and early implementation of the programs. With respect to the second precondition, programs in all three countries are at least partly undermined by a tendency to favor government, the military, and concessionaires in the appropriation of timber rents, and to exclude people living in or near forests from access to these rents. However in each country there are factors that potentially enable a turn toward poverty alleviation through community forestry. In Cambodia there is less central government control than in Laos or Vietnam. Laos has a high level of forest resources per capita. Vietnam has an exceptionally strong record in poverty alleviation that can be linked to its emerging community forestry program. The article recommends three core policies to fully realize the potential of poverty alleviation through community forestry: (1) control illegal logging and forest sector corruption; (2) locate community forestry sites where there are abundant forests; and (3) boost forest income through improved access rights, tenure, and benefit sharing, and removal of anti-poor regulations.

This is evidenced by insecurity in intergenerational access to forest resources and financial benefits relating to the latter, on the one hand, and by a deep iniquity at the intra-generational level, on the other hand. The following paper highlights, as a moral, social and policy dilemma, how stakeholders and generations, ‘self-interested’, mark out access to forest resources and to financial benefits relating to the latter. Through intensive participatory research, quantitative data collection, participant observation, future scenarios and some International Forestry Research's social science methods and interactive games (SSM &amp; IG) based on the evaluation of the sustainability of forest management systems, field research conducted in the forest zone of Cameroon on access to forest resources has generated two central results. Firstly, future generations will be confronted—in a dramatic way—to quantitative and qualitative scarcity of forest resources, following their over exploitation by present generations. Secondly, as concerns the intra-generational access benefits generated by commercial exploitation of forests and the assessment of the circulation of forestry fees, there is much inequity, in as much as those benefits are more profitable to a ‘forestry elite’—‘a self-interested block’—than to local communities, who strongly claim to have historical rights over these forests. As a contribution of social science to public knowledge and to policy development, this article is nourishing ‘rational choice’ and ‘rational egoism’ theory and is targeting decision-making processes in the ever first attempt of forest management decentralization and ‘legal’ benefits sharing in Central Africa (the second largest forest of the World). The article recommends the shortening of the distance between decision-making and beneficiaries, downwardly accountability, ‘bottom-up’ mechanisms of public dialogue in forest management and a collaborative infrastructure in the circulation and the distribution of forest benefits.

Households with medium to high asset holdings and higher market orientation were more likely to clear forest than the poorest and market-isolated households, questioning popular policy narratives about poverty-driven forest clearing.

We find negative associations between enforcement and smallholder forest income for state-owned and community forests, and positive associations for privately owned forests. Where user rights are limited to formal owners we find negative associations for state-owned forests. Overlapping user rights are positively associated with forest income for community forests. Our findings suggest that policy reforms emphasizing enforcement and reducing overlapping claims to forest resources should consider possible negative implications for smallholder forest income. "

Water quality, quantity and seasonal flow have thus also become environmental services with potential monetary value. Yet, currently the region's pioneer \{PES\} schemes are not paying for measured environmental services, but for proxy land uses thought to provide the(se) service(s). Hydrological modeling makes explicit the tacit causal relationships and tests underlying assumptions. Ideally, when combined with an economic analysis of land-use alternatives, this could inform decision makers on how much to pay for different interventions in different spatial locations. This paper focuses on two Andean watersheds: Moyobamba (Peru) and Pimampiro (Ecuador). In the first case, a municipal water company is preparing a payment for environmental services (PES) scheme to reduce upstream sediment loads. In the second, a similar conservation-oriented municipal \{PES\} scheme has operated since 2000, but the hydrological linkages have never been tested. Applying the Soil &amp; Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), we identify in both watersheds biophysically critical areas for service delivery, and compare services for current land uses with change scenarios: deforestation, reforestation, live barriers, and agroforestry. We then use the \{ECOSAUT\} optimization model to predict net economic benefits for service providers. In Moyobamba, switching to shade-grown coffee would halve sediment yields, and increase significantly farmers’ economic benefits. This requires high up-front investment, but the willingness to pay of water users in Moyobamba town may suffice to cover the upfront costs. In Pimampiro, resumed deforestation would increase sediments by &gt;50% and reduce dry-season flow by 0.5%, thus reinforcing the rationale of the existing \{PES\} scheme, focused on conserving native forests and grasslands.

A refinement of their scope and a careful use of terms might facilitate communication among stakeholders and policy-makers. This article thus answers the research question: “How are \{MBIs\} for ecosystem services defined, reflected and assessed?”. We analyse a sample of 106 peer-reviewed articles, which is representative of the scientific literature. The sample is distributed in the categories of a published typology to map existing instruments; yet their multidimensionality is challenging. We further find that a great diversity of research methods and evaluation criteria, as well as terms, is used in the literature. It is also observed that a large number of articles does not use scientific methods with new data, but resort to mere advocacy instead. This lack of a common theoretical and empirical framework, as well as consensus or comparative studies that would strengthen their conclusions, makes it difficult for practitioners to draw robust policy-relevant results. Interestingly, the articles presenting positive, negative, and mixed results were in almost similar proportions in our review. Therefore the application of harmonized assessment methods to better defined categories of \{MBIs\} with key shared characteristics might support evidence-based policies. For instance funding, incentive and allocation instruments should be more consistently differentiated. "

The first period began in the early 1970s when a conservative forest policy was adopted privileging commercial logging companies, and thus fueling land conflicts in particular with indigenous people, allowing a minority to accumulate considerable wealth, and marking the onset of forest degradation. From the mid-1990s, innovative policies were implemented to promote sustainable forest management, enhance the collection of forest royalties, improve the sector access to international timber markets, and include a wide range of social actors in the forest sector. While the adopted policy led to initial improvements in forest management practices, it failed to tackle inherent institutional weaknesses and increase the economic benefits from forest use to local forest users, which stimulated informal logging expansion. A third period emerged when the Morales administration came to office in 2006, questioning the underlying principles of the previous policy reform, and adopting a discourse in favor of a more equitable income distribution. Main answers to promote better income distribution are found in the distribution of public lands, but with a lack of actions to leveling the playing field among different forest users. Ironically, these policies could strengthen the bargaining position of timber companies, and foster short-term decision making in forest use, and thus illegal logging in a context of weak state control and persistence of elite capture.

The link between research and policy is often diffuse, and direct linkages between research and policy change are rare. To simply assume that conducting research on policies relating to forests and disseminating the findings will lead to changes in the policies themselves is unrealistically naive and grossly overestimates the role of knowledge acquisition in policy change processes.

This demand-driven initiative alongside the importance of European markets for timber exports have prompted Cameroon to sign a Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade Voluntary Partnership Agreement (FLEGT/VPA) with the European Union. This paper reviews the impacts of this policy. Firstly, the institutional arrangement for timber production is presented with special focus on various legal forms of forest exploitation. Secondly, the estimated costs for the required development and control of various types of forest management are presented. Finally the impacts of the FLEGT/VPA on forest governance, forest management, timber trade and socio-economic and development issues is explored. The positive impact of the agreement will be especially felt by industrial forest concession holders that harvest timber products for exports to international markets, but it will hardly be the case of community forests. However, the implementation of the agreement will engender huge financial costs for forest managers and national governments. Also, the livelihoods of small-scale loggers (who are the main suppliers of national markets) may be adversely affected by the procurement policies. "

This system became mandatory for large-scale forestry enterprises on 1 January 2013, while small-scale operators had until 1 January 2014 to comply. While the progress with \{SVLK\} certification among large-scale timber enterprises has been considerable, timber legality verification in the small-scale sector lags behind. There continues to be a significant degree of illegality in small-scale forestry operations and stakeholders' understanding of \{SVLK\} and the \{VPA\} is limited. Many small-scale timber businesses are reluctant to pursue certification and formalize their operations because of concerns about additional costs and uncertainty about the benefits. Achieving timber legality compliance in the Indonesian forestry sector will not be easy. However, by applying a phased approach, providing more information to stakeholders, expanding verification bodies' capacity, simplifying the \{SVLK\} process and making it more financially attractive it is possible to make progress.

Three months after planting, the soil's organic content were 25% lower on tracks compared to control plots that had not been affected by crawler tractors, while microbial indices of N and P availability were about 50% lower.

To answer these questions data is used from two sources: (1) a detailed household survey conducted with 1.433 households in Bolivia, Kenya, Mexico, and Uganda and (2) a more aggregated dataset from forest associations investigated by the International Forestry Resources and Institutions (IFRI) program in 10 countries. The analyses suggest that women's participation is likely when institutions exist that are less exclusionary, when households have more education, and when there is small economic inequality in general and across genders in particular. A history of women's participation, especially when women are seated on forest councils or attain leadership positions, is highly correlated with less disruptive conflict. "

This study aggregates benefit estimates from specific technologies, and sets such against total investments in the \{CGIAR\} centers, so as to derive estimates for five different aggregate benefit–cost scenarios. Impact assessment has been pursued in a largely decentralized manner by individual research centers, and, as a result, methods and approaches differ among studies. Consequently, a critical review process was necessary for determining the reliability of individual impact estimates. A framework including two overarching principles for evaluating study reliability – (1) transparency and (2) demonstration of causality, as well as accordant criteria and indicators, was developed to assess individual estimates of economic impact before inclusion in scenarios of aggregate benefits. Against an aggregate investment of 7120 million 1990 \{US\} dollars, resultant benefit–cost ratios for research to date range from 1.9 to 17.3, depending on scenario.

A growing number of cases highlight commercial trades in wild flora and fauna that have been undocumented in official data. Here we present the first in-depth study of the trade of wild-collected ornamental plants in continental Southeast Asia, focusing on the four largest wildlife markets in Thailand. Botanical surveys revealed a massive, previously undocumented commercial trade in wild, protected ornamental plants involving Thailand, Lao \{PDR\} and Myanmar, focusing primarily on the Orchidaceae. The results indicate that illegal trade threatens not only charismatic Southeast Asian mammals, reptiles and amphibians, but also hundreds of tropical plant species. Trade surveys identified 347 orchid species in 93 genera, including many listed as threatened. The observed cross-border trade moves plants at a rate orders of magnitude larger than government-reported statistics, and directly conflicts with official policy statement. Harvester interviews strongly indicated that wild collection was negatively affecting the majority of species they traded. Despite three decades of broad restrictions on the international trade of all wild orchids, these results highlight a major conservation challenge that has been almost completely overlooked. There is urgent need to improve botanical trade monitoring, to operationalize existing conservation commitments, and as part of a broader, multifaceted response to illegal trade. We call for increased attention to botanical trade and conservation in Southeast Asia, and argue that efforts to tackle illegal wildlife trade must ensure they include flora. "

During each of six successive years, we measured tree diameters and counted woody fruit capsule segments that fell below the crowns of 82 mahogany trees in natural forest in central Quintana Roo, Mexico. Sample trees ranged from &lt;20 cm to more than 100 cm DBH. Fruit production increased with diameter, and trees ≥75 cm produced significantly more fruits each year than did trees of smaller diameters. Large trees could produce more than 700 fruits/year. Trees ≥75 cm \{DBH\} were also more consistent producers: while up to 27% of trees &lt;75 cm \{DBH\} produced &lt;1 fruit/year in any year, at least 93% of larger trees produced fruit every year. Over the 6 years, individual trees ≥75 cm produced a total of 367 ± 34 fruits, as compared to 91 ± 8 fruits among trees &lt;75 cm (an average of 61 ± 7 and 15 ± 2 fruits/year, respectively). However, the number of fruit produced per unit crown volume was not significantly different between the two size categories. Fruit production varied among years, with the highest production in 1998 and the lowest in 1999 and 2000. The population of sampled mahogany trees produced approximately three times more fruit, and individual trees produced up to five times more fruit, in the year of highest production, as compared to the lowest. Mahogany does not exhibit the fruit production patterns found in mast fruiting species. Inter-annual variability in size of fruit crops at both the population and individual-tree levels are lower than in masting species, and the synchronocity among trees was low. Basal area growth averaged 76.5 ± 18.6 cm2/year for trees ≥75 cm and 29.9 ± 1.7 cm2/year for trees &lt;75 cm DBH, and varied significantly among years. Years of high fruit production were also years of good growth, implying “resource matching” rather than the “resource switching” associated with masting. To ensure seed production for the regeneration of mahogany it is important to retain mahogany trees ≥75 cm \{DBH\} as seed sources. This presents a challenge, since currently mahogany trees in this region are harvested down to a minimum diameter as low as 55 cm. "

Liberation thinning involved manual elimination (either by cutting or stem girdling) of the adjacent `ring' of competitors in order to release future crop trees (median diameter: 8 cm DBH), selected on the basis of stem and crown form. The application of liberation thinning significantly increased diameter growth of future crop trees with respect to unmanipulated counterparts. Young stands in the region may be attractive systems for simple silvicultural manipulations due to rapid growth responsiveness, facilitated by manageable tree size. Detailed observations on stand development and patterns of crown stratification in coexisting tree species in other dense secondary stands in the area seems warranted in order to refine silvicultural options aimed at increasing tree diameter growth.

One of the consequences of these reforms is a reconfiguration of the patterns of interactions between multiple governance actors, which may create friction as actors with different interests shift positions within the governance structure. These shifts may imply important differences with regards to access to power, information, and flows of benefits from forest resources. In this paper, we explore how forestry decentralization affects the propensity for forest-related conflict among forest governance actors. We draw on qualitative field research from the North Atlantic Autonomous Region of Nicaragua to develop a set of hypotheses about the effect of decentralization on conflict. We argue that decentralization generates conflict and that lack of transparency and accountability in reform processes further contributes to more conflict. We hypothesize that over time, under effective decentralization reforms, increases in both transparency and accountability will lead to a decline in conflict. We then test these hypotheses with empirical data from interviews with local governance actors in Bolivia and Peru, two countries with contrasting degrees of forestry sector decentralization. The quantitative analysis finds that there is no clear relationship between decentralization, transparency or accountability and the prevalence of conflict. These findings lead us to conclude that the prevalence of conflict alone is not a particularly instructive indicator of forest governance performance and suggest that future research should pursue a better understanding of how decentralization may alter the nature of conflicts.

While this mechanism would compensate for missing markets in forest environmental services, it could also enable industrialized countries to avoid reducing energy use. This paper assesses whether such projects could contribute to improved logging practices in the tropics. Results from studies primarily in Asia and Latin America are analyzed in the context of the modalities of the Kyoto Protocol. Results show that the opportunity cost of shifting from conventional logging to improved practices may have been underestimated. At the same time the long-term carbon and biodiversity benefits of improved forest management may have been underestimated. These results follow primarily from the fact that most previous studies assume that a permanent forest estate is maintained under conventional logging and that cutting cycles are as long as 30–60 years. A more realistic scenario, however, consists of repeated harvesting at short intervals during the first few decades, resulting in the degradation of the forest into shrub and grassland. The implications of these results are that forest management projects may be less cost-effective than previously assumed. Therefore, expectations about their potential contribution to improved management should be scaled down. At the same time, the extent to which such projects will enable industrialized countries to avoid reducing industrial pollution is also unlikely to be significant. Cost-effectiveness is likely to be highest where timber volumes in the first few decades after initial logging are comparable under conventional and improved logging. This is likely where topography is relatively flat, biodiversity values are low, wastage of felled timber is high and the policy environment is favorable. A number of proactive measures are suggested to expand the niche for forest management carbon projects. These measures are justified because the incremental carbon and biodiversity benefits in the long run may be higher than previous studies have indicated. "

Over 4 years, the vegetative and demographic responses to experimental mechanical damage were monitored in naturally-growing saplings of four coexisting tree species, under comparable overhead illumination conditions, in a lowland moist forest in Central Panama. Inflicted damage mimicked both crown loss and stem breakage (`snapped') and stem pinning by fallen debris (`bent') in individuals (1.0–2.5 m tall) of Alseis blackiana (Rubiaceae), Protium panamense, P. tenuifolium, and Tetragastris panamensis (all Burseraceae). For all species combined, 4-year percent mortality was significantly different between bent (21%), snapped (13%), and undamaged controls (6%). Species differed in their capacity to survive damage. Saplings of A. blackiana showed the highest resilience, expressed as a high ability to regain pre-damage height in snapped individuals, production of adventitious roots in bent individuals, and very high survival. A previous classification of the study species fit them into a large `generalist' guild, after no illumination preferences were obvious for their juvenile growth and survival at the study site. In contrast, this study suggests that tree vegetative behavior should be incorporated in future tropical forest research that attempts to detect species differentiation in regeneration potential at the sapling phase.

One to three months later, and again after an additional 12 months, twenty 4-month-old mahogany seedlings were planted in the center of each clearing, and, simultaneously, nearby, under the forest canopy. One year after the first planting and again 7 months later, vines and competing vegetation were cleaned from around the seedlings on one of each type of clearing in each location. Fifty-eight months later, only 5% of mahogany seedlings survived under the canopy, as compared to 32% on felled clearings and 50% on burned or machine-made clearings. Average annual growth of seedlings planted the year clearings were opened was approximately double that of seedlings planted a year later, after natural regeneration of other species had become established. At 58 months uncleaned trees averaged 352 cm in height (and the tallest 600 cm) on burned clearings, 324 cm on machine-made clearings, and 195 cm on felled clearings. Surviving seedlings planted under the forest canopy had grown less than 30 cm during the same period. On burned and machine-made clearings the effect of cleaning on growth was not statistically significant, but on felled clearings cleaning increased growth by 120%, to rates similar to those on burned clearings. Attack by the Hypsipyla grandella shootborer was significantly affected by cleaning. After 58 months, only 12% of seedlings on uncleaned plots had been attacked, compared to 44% of seedlings on cleaned plots. Cleaning also significantly increased vines, particularly on seedlings planted the year after clearings were created: 36% of all seedlings on cleaned plots had vines, as compared to 19% of uncleaned seedlings. In summary, planting mahogany seedlings under the forest canopy cannot be expected to regenerate mahogany trees. However, mahogany seedlings survive and grow well on clearings, with no subsequent interventions, if planted shortly after these are opened by machine or burning. This approach to regeneration could be expected to yield densities of 100 commercial-sized mahogany trees/ha among a matrix of 400 naturally regenerated trees/ha of other species. At this rate, regenerating mahogany on clearings equivalent to 3% of the annual cutting area intervened at each harvest, could provide for replacement of mahogany trees harvested from the permanent forest reserves in the region.

This paper analyses the challenges of designing a governance structure for a REDD+ strategy in Cameroon. Theoretically, the paper builds on the literature on governance structures for resource management, focusing analytically on the interactions between actor constellations (state and non-state) and institutions (formal and informal) to produce policy outcomes. The paper draws on documentation of REDD+ policy events, policy texts and 23 in-depth interviews with members from government, civil society, research organizations, development partners and the private sector. It argues that although the actors involved in REDD+ are, to an extent, polarized around different issues and priorities, they are nonetheless increasingly distributing roles and responsibilities among themselves. The institutional arrangements within the policy process include: (1) rule-making systems for engagement; (2) expanding existing coordination mechanisms; (3) national safeguard standards; and (4) building on existing forest governance initiatives. The paper concludes that the multiple benefits promised by REDD+, such as poverty alleviation, biodiversity conservation and economic development, are critical for the legitimacy of the mechanism. "

We report on logging damage to Brazil nut trees in three certified timber concessions in Northern Bolivia from which timber is harvested using reduced-impact logging (RIL) guidelines and nuts are gathered yearly from the ground by local people. Observed frequencies of logging damage to Brazil nut trees were low, likely mirroring the low intensity of timber harvesting (∼0.5 trees/ha and ∼5 m3/ha) being currently applied across the study area. Of the trees ≥10 cm in diameter at breast height about 0.1 Brazil nut trees and 0.4 timber species per hectare suffered some degree of logging damage. Crown loss was the predominant damage type for Brazil nut trees accounting for 50% of all damage. In spite of the observed low rates of tree damage, we further recommend that \{RIL\} guidelines be amended to include the pre-harvest marking of pre-reproductive Brazil nut trees along with the future crop trees of commercial timber species.

Although financial and human resources for \{UTGS\} may be constrained in developing world contexts, there is no knowledge of the extent to which local authorities engage in appropriate and timely planning, management and monitoring. Here we examine the \{UTGS\} resourcing, planning, maintenance and integration across 28 local municipalities in the two poorest provinces in South Africa. It was revealed that most local municipalities were not managing their \{UTGS\} in a planned or systematic manner due to constraining factors such as insufficient funds, insufficient personnel, lack of equipment and lack of political support. Only 7% of the surveyed municipalities had an urban tree management plan and an estimate of the urban tree stock; 32% had tree policies; 21% had tree planting schedules; 11% had tree maintenance schedules. Over 65% claimed to engage other stakeholders in tree planting, but much was passive receipt of trees for planting rather than citizen engagement around species, places and values. Generally, the prevalence of most planning and maintenance elements increased with increasing size of the municipality and the presence of personnel specifically for \{UTGS\} management. It is likely that the prevalence of planning and maintenance functions will increase with greater political support from municipal councillors which may also decrease funding challenges. "

We find a convergence of conclusions of reduced degradation of natural forests associated with the expansion of timber plantations, but also potential increased deforestation due to either lower market value of natural forests in the absence of logging, or displacement effects. Yet, a main limitation of studies is the lack of consideration of the role of policies and institutions beyond market drivers, especially in econometric studies. We conclude on the need for integrated policy approaches applied simultaneously to both natural forests and plantations to maximize the potential benefit. "

These studies commonly categorize households based on observed income in cross-section data, presenting a snap-shot reflecting both inter-household and inter-annual income variation. In this paper we introduce a new approach to categorize households based on a combination of the observed one-year income and predicted income by an augmented asset approach. Applying this approach on household data from Tanzania, we find forest reliance to be high among structurally poor households (low observed income and assets). The highest forest reliance is found among the stochastically non-poor households (high income and low assets), and this group also has the highest absolute forest income. "

We pooled gas samples –analogously to soil pooling – to overcome this challenge. Our sample pooling technique collects a composite gas sample from several chambers instead of the conventional practise of analyzing samples from chambers individually, thus reducing numbers of gas samples. The method was verified to be reasonably accurate in forest, grassland and agricultural fields over a four week measurement campaign. Pooling technique results differed by 2–8% for \{CO2\} and by 3–4% for \{N2O\} when compared to individual chamber means. That shows pooling of gas samples across individual static chambers is an acceptable approach to integrate spatial heterogeneity. "

There are still considerable uncertainties about carbon stocks in tropical rain forest, coming essentially from poor knowledge of the quantity and spatial distribution of forest biomass at the landscape level. We evaluate the influence of site and topography on forest structure, biomass and carbon stock over a forested landscape in Sumatra. Sixteen sites were selected across a landscape of ca. 1000 km2, and within each site, a network of small 0.1 ha plots was laid down perpendicular to the major topographical gradient. Structural parameters for trees with diameter bigger or equal to 10 cm and major life forms were recorded for each plot. The total sampled area was 70.2 ha. The above-ground biomass (AGBM) in the 16 sites ranged from 271 ± 19 to 478 ± 38 Mg ha−1, with a mean of 361 ± 7 Mg ha−1. This value is similar to the global ‘tropical wet forest’ estimate of Keith et al. (2009), but 23% higher than the biome default value given in the \{IPCC\} (2006) guidelines. Plots on acid tuff were the most distinctive in having fewer and smaller trees, with a resulting low AGBM. The number of stems was low, but the average tree diameter was larger on the nutrient-rich young volcanic andesitic soils. Landscape-scale variability of forest structure and dynamics was considerable. Within sites, there was little variation of mean height or mean diameter of the trees, but significant differences in stem density, basal area and \{AGBM\} between land facets. Both topography and geology appeared to affect the dynamics and the biomass of the forest. At the same time, our findings confirm the need for caution in extrapolating data from small plots to larger spatial scales when estimating carbon stocks for a given forest type or a region. Our results for C stock values for Sumatra lowland and hill dipterocarp forests (135–240 Mg ha−1, with a mean of 180 Mg ha−1) showed higher variability in C stock values at landscape level than generally reported in the literature. Based on our results, stratified sampling is recommended for biomass and carbon estimation. Within an error range of 6–8% of the AGBM, a minimum area of 4–6 ha should be sufficient to estimate biomass with satisfactory accuracy at the landscape scale. Networks of several small plots across landscape are preferable to fewer larger plots, providing that the sampling is representative of the land facets in the area. "

It contributes to the debate on the alleged effectiveness of such economic incentives to actually change decisions among land users. Building on the standard \{PES\} theory of change, one would assume that farmers respond to payments and change their land use decisions accordingly for the delivery of environmental services. However, at the project level the impacts of economic incentives depend on how the signal is transmitted to decision-makers. An extensive household survey was undertaken among 270 participating farmers in order to investigate these assumptions. Results indicate that farmers join the scheme for intrinsic motivations rather than because of economic incentives. Besides, the scheme does not target farmers whose decisions could be changed for the sake of service provision. Finally, farmer group leaders display disproportionate power of decision while individual farmers have a low level of understanding of the \{PES\} programme. As a consequence, land use patterns might not depend on the economic incentive only; rather they are likely to be determined by the local social context, traditions and economic dependency on forests. This in turn casts some doubts on the strong (yet contested) economic assumptions that underlie the emergence of \{PES\} schemes and on their modus operandi in developing countries. "

It analyzes how opportunities and challenges, resulted from different regulatory frameworks, affect the competitiveness of smallholder forestry practices. In this paper, regulatory frameworks are defined as not only regulations issued by public administrators at the domestic (local and national) level, but also cover the emerging market-based regulatory frameworks, i.e. voluntary certification of sustainable forestry and mandatory timber legality verification.

A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis in combination with an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to accomplish this task. Overall, results showed distinct differences in perceptions among stakeholder groups both within and among countries in pursuing multiple-use forestry strategies. Although many stakeholder groups held positive perceptions about multiple use of Brazil nuts and timber, several limitations were associated with implementation of this model. For instance, policy barriers and high management costs were considered the main weaknesses throughout the region. In Madre de Dios and Pando, logging damage to Brazil nut stands was the dominant threat, whereas in Acre, the main threat was reinvestment of forestry income into cattle. Our work shows that despite the high potential for and positive views of many stakeholders in pursuing integrated management of Brazil nut and timber, specific policy, economic, and technical limitations must first be addressed. To this end, we provide recommendations for promoting this multi-use forestry model in the future. "

We then applied meta-analysis to test the hypothesis that afforestation or the use of trees in agriculture increases infiltration capacity. After assessing titles and abstracts, on the basis of specified selection and quality criteria, four references remained, comprising 14 comparative experiments. The overall result of the meta-analysis was that infiltration capacity increased on average approximately three-fold after afforestation or planting trees in agricultural fields (95% confidence interval: 2.4–4.7). For the meta-analysis, the most common problems resulting in exclusion of otherwise relevant experiments were issues with the experimental design, and the absence of statistics (variances and replicates). Even considering the studies that were excluded in the meta analysis (a total of six), the low number of studies examining the effects of afforestation is a severe problem with respect to modelling and examining the underlying processes associated with the full range of different edaphic situations, different species and different methods of establishment.

Addressing this issue is relevant, especially when combined with other challenges such as preserving biodiversity. The present study assessed tree diversity (Shannon–Wiener’s index) and carbon stocks of different land uses in Balé and Ziro sites in Sudanian zone of Burkina Faso. Aboveground carbon stock was evaluated using generalized equation. Belowground carbon was assessed by excavating plant parts in samples of soil in each plot. Regarding soil sampling for C-content assessment, four locations were selected in each plot and soil was sampled at the depths of 0–20 cm and 20–50 cm, using an auger. The four soil samples from each depth were pooled, thoroughly mixed and a composite soil sample taken to the laboratory for carbon content measurement using the Black and Walkley method. The C-content was then used for calculating SOC. In Balé and Ziro, 85 and 106 species, 63 and 82 genera, 29 and 35 families were identified, respectively, with the Leguminosae family as most dominant. Natural vegetation stands (NV) and fallows showed high richness and diversity compared to parklands. Soil was found the most important carbon pool. Highest values of aboveground, belowground and soil C-stocks in Ziro (13.9, 14.71 and 67.1 Mg/ha) were recorded in community managed forests (CMF) logged 12 years ago, while equivalent values for Balé (25.76, 14.96 and 53.02 Mg/ha) were recorded in the dense NV. However, irrespective of C pool, the difference between \{CMFs\} and the 100 trees/ha Vitellaria parkland was not significant. Correlations were found between species richness and above and belowground C-stocks (R2 = 0.22, p &lt; 0.0001; \{R2\} = 0.33, p &lt; 0.0001). Overall, dense Vitellaria parklands, apart from allowing tree-crop integration, have real potentials for C sequestration.

While our findings confirm considerable economic scope for compensation-based schemes for avoided degradation and deforestation, the pre-existence of legal use right limitations in combination with the distribution of forest cover among \{LRS\} means that less than half of settlements – poorer – will be able to derive economic gains.

The runoff plots were set up in two catchments in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, where conventional logging and Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) took place. Runoff plots were set up in forest areas with different levels of logging disturbances, i.e. harvesting areas (four plots), skid trails (six plots), and undisturbed/control areas (four plots). The magnitude of runoff and soil loss from skid trail plots were found to be the highest, followed by control plots and harvest plots. Canopy cover, sapling density, litter depth and woody debris appeared to be important ecological factors that determine the magnitude of soil loss. Tree canopy determines the size and erosive power of the raindrops. Sapling, litter layer, and woody debris protected soil surface, thus preventing soil detachment, and provided surface roughness that minimised soil particle movement down the slope. The roles of these ecological factors were less significant compared to rainfall in determining the magnitude of runoff. Canopy cover, sapling density, litter depth and woody debris can be measured quantitatively or qualitatively without complicated equipment and methods. Furthermore, they are sensitive to logging disturbance which make them suitable verifiers of soil erosion. Forest managers need to limit disturbance to these factors in order to minimise soil erosion in their logging operation areas. Monitoring of soil loss using runoff plots was cost-effective and provided valuable information about soil erosion risks caused by logging operations. Runoff plots clearly demonstrated site disturbances where the plots are located. Monitoring allowed more direct linkages to be made between management practices and their impacts on runoff and soil erosion, thereby enabling forest managers to identify problems and take appropriate preventive measures to improve their management practices.

Local participation was assessed quantitatively in six study villages, in combination with more qualitative surveys on planning practices and influences on livelihoods and land uses. The analysis reveals that local participation increased only slightly from early planning initiatives until pilot implementation of the revised programme, known as Participatory Land Use Planning. It also shows that (participation in) planning had very limited influence on local land use patterns. Drawing on these findings, the paper explores ways to better translate plans into concrete actions and to effect tangible change in local practices. "

There is often a failure to negotiate with all concerned stakeholders and to recognize and resolve trade-offs.

Security of tenure and use rights is an important but often neglected requirement for achieving sustainability. Remnant patches of natural vegetation, even when degraded, are often valuable sources of local biodiversity in restoration schemes. The spatial patterns of different types of forest and of non-forest land are important determinants of environmental values. Biodiversity conservation requires maintaining or re-establishing habitat strips to connect natural forest blocks and protect ecological gradients. However, even monoculture plantations often have significant biodiversity value.

abstract = "Most biodiversity assessment methods tend to sample isolated areas of land cover such as closed forest or local land use mosaics. Contemporary methods of assessing biodiversity are briefly reviewed and focus on the relative roles of the Linnean species and plant functional types (PFTs). Recent case studies from central Sumatra and northern Thailand indicate how the range distributions of many plant and animal species and functional types frequently extend along regional gradients of light, water and nutrient availability and corresponding land use intensity. We show that extending the sampling context to include a broader array of environmental determinants of biodiversity results in a more interpretable pattern of biodiversity. Our results indicate sampling within a limited environmental context has the potential to generate highly truncated range distributions and thus misleading information for land managers and for conservation. In an intensive, multi-taxa survey in lowland Sumatra, vegetational data were collected along a land use intensity gradient using a proforma specifically designed for rapid survey. Each vegetation sample plot was a focal point for faunal survey. Whereas biodiversity pattern from samples within closed canopy rain forest was difficult to interpret, extending the sample base to include a wider variety of land cover and land use greatly improved interpretation of plant and animal distribution. Apart from providing an improved theoretical and practical basis for forecasting land use impact on biodiversity, results illustrate how specific combinations of plant-based variables might be used to predict impacts on specific animal taxa, functional types and above-ground carbon. Implications for regional assessment and monitoring of biodiversity and in improving understanding of the landscape dynamics are briefly discussed. "

Illegal logging and forest degradation are currently increasing, and logging bans are ineffective in reducing forest degradation. At the same time interest in forest plantations and concern about poverty problems of neighboring people whose livelihoods depend on forest services and products continue to increase rapidly. Governments have identified the development of small forest plantations as an opportunity to provide wood supplies to forest industries and to reduce poverty. However, the development of small plantations is very slow due to an imbalance of power and suspicion between communities and large companies. This paper proposes a framework for linking social, economic and biophysical dynamics to create multi-agent simulations and explore scenarios of collaboration for plantations. Multi-agent simulation is a branch of artificial intelligence that offers a promising approach to dealing with multi-stakeholder management systems, such as common pool resources. It provides a framework which allows analysis of stakeholders’ (or agents’) interactions and decision making. Each stakeholder has explicit communication capacities, behaviors and rationales from which emerge specific actions. The purpose of this modeling is to create a common dynamic representation to facilitate negotiations for growing trees. A system of governance involving multi-stakeholders, especially local communities and wood based industries appearing to offer the most promising pathway to accelerating plantation development, local community poverty alleviation and forest landscape improvement.

Proportionally more small trees (74% of trees &gt;2 m tall but &lt;5 cm dbh) were killed than large trees (27% of 10–40 cm, 16% of trees ≥40 cm dbh), and mortality varied with species. Basal cambial damage was found on 30–40% of living trees ≥10 cm dbh. About 75% of liana stems (1–8 cm dbh) were killed; 15% of the dead liana stems resprouted from the base. In lianas, basal resprouting of killed stems was independent of diameter class, whereas in trees smaller stems were more likely to resprout than larger stems. The proliferation of herbaceous vines plus lianas &lt;1 cm dbh (mean density 21 000 ha-1) in the burned forest may impede tree regeneration and supply fine fuels capable of supporting frequent fires. Although anthropogenic and natural fires have probably played important roles in the development of tropical subhumid forests, the amount of damage and mortality observed in this study suggest that, in forests managed for timber production, fire-protection practices are warranted to reduce forest susceptibility to wildfire.

We argue that setting aside protection areas in managed forests as a way to preserve ecological processes may not be sufficient to ensure sustainable levels of tree regeneration, and that a thorough understanding and application of tree seed ecology can help to refine management prescriptions. We review relevant aspects of tree reproductive biology, seed production and dispersal, spatial and temporal constraints on seed availability, disperser behavior, and the potential consequences of hunting and forest fragmentation on tree regeneration, and discuss their implications for biological sustainability in managed forests. Tree seed production can be influenced by the selective removal of neighbors of the same species (due to insufficient pollen transfer), flowering asynchrony, and attributes of the species' sexual system. The extent to which an area is supplied by seed can be affected by dispersal mechanism, spatio-temporal limitations to seed dispersal, and tree size-dependent levels of seed production at the species level. Studies of vertebrate-disperser behavior and tree seed deposition in logged forests are scarce and warrant further attention in order to refine our understanding of the dependency of sustained timber production on vertebrate fauna. Although much remains to be learned about tree seed ecology in neotropical logged forests, the baseline information presented here may offer a starting point for developing ecological criteria for seed tree retention. Furthermore, it may contribute in improving ecologically-based management prescriptions in order to enhance or at least maintain sufficient levels of natural regeneration without the need to rely on artificial regeneration.

We used this classification to identify a management system appropriate for the commercial species and to evaluate the compatibility of the system with the regeneration requirements of tree species that produce important food for mammalian wildlife. About half of the tree species in the site are commercially valuable for their timber and a similar proportion are considered of value as food for wildlife. A tree species rating for vulnerability to disturbance appeared to be independent of both timber and wildlife values. A silvicultural system that includes even-aged groups of trees within an uneven-aged matrix appears more suitable to the multiple goals of management in this forest than either an even-aged or uneven-aged (single tree selection) management system.

With large greenhouse gases emissions due to deforestation, a systematic assessment and comparison of the models available in Indonesia is crucial for accurate assessments of forest carbon stocks and implementing REDD+ projects. In the present study, we compared the ability of two regional and two generic (pantropical) allometric models to estimate biomass at both tree and plot levels. We showed that regional models had lower performance in estimating tree biomass, with greater bias (−31–8%) and higher \{AIC\} (177–204), compared to generic models (bias: −2–2%; AIC: 57–67). At the plot level, the regional models underestimated biomass stocks by 0–40% compared to the best generic model. The error in plot biomass stocks associated to models relying solely upon \{DBH\} ranged between −5 and +15%. The integration of tree height estimated regionally resulted in an overestimate of 5–10% in unmanaged forests. Despite the difficulty to accurately assess tree heights in tropical forests, integrating all or part of them in biomass assessment can reduce uncertainties. "

Kenya to elucidate the mechanisms associated with long-term carbon storage. Specifically, we looked at a top-down model (macro-aggregates form around organic matter particles and micro-aggregates form within the macro-aggregates) and a bottom-up model (micro-aggregates form independently and are incorporated into macro-aggregates) of soil aggregate formation. Soil samples were collected from experiments on improved tree fallows using different species and two tillage treatments; water-stable aggregates were extracted and sorted into three size classes: macro-aggregates (&gt; 212 μm), meso-aggregates (53–212 μm) and micro-aggregates (20–53 μm). Organic matter characterization of each fraction was based on 13C isotope abundance, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and the abundance of polysaccharides. Improved fallows increased soil C by 0.28 and 0.26 kg m­2 in the top 20 cm of the soil profile in Luero and Teso, respectively. Tillage altered the distribution of aggregates among size classes. Changes in the δ13C signature in each fraction indicated that more of the new carbon was found in the macro-aggregates (35–70%) and meso-aggregates (18–49%) in Luero and less (9–17%) was found in the micro-aggregates. In Teso, about 40–80% of the new aggregate C was found in the meso-aggregates, 14–45% was found in the micro-aggregates and only 4–26% was found in the macro-aggregates. The meso-aggregates and macro-aggregates to a lesser extent, in both sites, were enriched in carboxylic-C and aromatic-C, indicating the importance of \{OM\} decomposition and plant-derived C in the stabilization of larger aggregates, supporting the top-down model of aggregate formation. Microbially derived polysaccharides play a leading role in the formation of stable micro-aggregates and carboxylic-C promotes stabilization through surface occlusion. This bottom-up process is essential to promote long-term carbon sequestration in soils. Additionally, the micro-aggregates at both sites were enriched in polysaccharides and had elevated ratios of galactose + mannose:arabinose + xylose than the other aggregate fractions, indicating the importance of microbial processes in the formation of stable micro-aggregates and supporting the bottom-up model.

With its food security depending almost entirely on irrigated agriculture, Central Asia is one of the arid regions highly vulnerable to water scarcity. Previous research of land and water use in the region has focused on improving water-use efficiency, soil management and identifying technical, institutional and agricultural innovations. However, vulnerability to climate change has rarely been considered, in spite of the imminent risks due to a higher-than-average warming perspective and the predicted melting of glaciers, which will greatly affect the availability of irrigation water. Using the Khorezm region in the irrigated lowlands of northwest Uzbekistan as an example, we identify the local patterns of vulnerability to climate variability and extremes. We look at on-going environmental degradation, water-use inefficiency, and barriers to climate change adaptation and mitigation, and based on an extensive review of research evidence from the region, we present concrete examples of initiatives for building resilience and improving climate risk management. These include improving water use efficiency and changing the cropping patterns that have a high potential to decrease the exposure and sensitivity of rural communities to climate risks. In addition, changes in land use such as the afforestation of degraded croplands, and introducing resource-smart cultivation practices such as conservation agriculture, may strengthen the capacity of farmers and institutions to respond to climate challenges. As these can be out-scaled to similar environments, i.e. the irrigated cotton and wheat growing lowland regions in Central Asia and the Caucasus, these findings may be relevant for regions beyond the immediate geographic area from which it draws its examples.

abstract = "Abstract There is a growing interest to take into account dry forests in planning sustainable development in arid and semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa. A mixed quantitative and qualitative research design involving various data collection tools was employed to examine the significance of dry forest income and associated conditioning factors in the context of pastoral and agro-pastoral production systems of southeastern Ethiopia. Income from livestock and dry forests were the first and second most important components of the total household income. Dry forest income accounts 34.8% and 35.2% of the total household income and 38% and 46% of the total household cash income in the Liben and Afdher Administrative Zones of Somali National Regional State, respectively. It was the largest income compared to all other incomes added together for 45% of the respondents. Most notably, for very poor households, dry forest income contributes up to 63% of their total income. Dry forest income levels varied significantly with occupation (P &lt; 0.05), pastoralists generating more income than agro-pastoralists. Dry forest income enables 24% of households to remain above the poverty line, and it reduces income disparity by 13.7%. Moreover, dry forest income has become increasingly important for households' ex-ante risk and ex-post drought coping strategies. The number of youths per household (P &lt; 0.001), access to extension services (P &lt; 0.001), and being member of a cooperative (P &lt; 0.05) significantly affected dry forest income levels in both Zones. Findings of this study could apply to similar dryland eco-regions in the Horn of Africa and contribute to enhance promotion of sustainable management of dry forests for integrated livelihood adaptation, biodiversity conservation and combating desertification. Further research is needed to quantify the contribution dry forests make to livelihoods through livestock production and to develop options that will guide policy making process to generate additional economic incentives for communities and countries to be engaged in sustainable management and use of dry forests.

It assesses the effects that two models of economic development have had on prompting agricultural expansion, and hence deforestation in lowland Bolivia. The first model, of economic diversification and import substitution, initiated in the early 1950s, stimulated the occupation of forestlands for agricultural expansion through colonization, and incentives to developing a medium and large-scale agriculture. The second model of development, initiated in the mid-1980s, prompted by structural adjustment policies, led to an intense process of agrarian change in the lowlands, mainly by connecting the agricultural frontier to the international market of commodities, particularly soybeans. The move from an import substitution industrialization model to another based on economic liberalization, even though it had positive implications on stimulating agricultural growth, has led to accelerate the pace of deforestation in lowland Bolivia, which has a larger contribution of medium and large-scale agriculture. This paper moves forward the debate about deforestation in Bolivia by making explicit connections between some analytical assessments on land-use/cover change and empirical evidences about forest removal in a five-decades period.

abstract = "Abstract Governance of tropical forests at both the international and the national level is more and more fragmented because of the large constellation of actors, ideas and interests influencing forestland policies for their conservation or change. In public policy area, fragmentation is to some extent the result of competing interests and objectives that lead to a power play in policy-making between actor groups (both public and private), i.e., state bureaucracies, Intergovernmental organisations, nongovernmental organisations and private companies. In this power relationship for the control of tropical forestlands, the hegemony of state bureaucracies in forest governance processes is increasingly contested because of the growing influence of external actor groups in forest governance. Our findings show that the fragmentation of forest governance, which might be considered specific to pluralistic systems, became banal even in tropical countries with a state-centred system like Cameroon where the state claims hegemonic ownership of forestlands. This fragmentation is particularly reinforced in limited statehood where state bureaucracies are attracted to/dependent on external resources for dealing with weak institutional capacity and to face the government's lack of ability to supply public goods and services. But despite the governance fragmentation constraints, this article reveals that some governments and sectoral bureaucracies in limited statehood are capable of using cunning behaviours to secure their own interests in domestic forestland policies and avoid pressure from external actors. In the case of Cameroon for example, the strategy being used relies on a wait-and-see game, uncertainty and recourse to sudden, ambiguous decisions; this is what we call “gecko politics”. Broadly, this article seeks to understand how a government or state bureaucracy in limited statehood with a state-centred system can try to impose its own interests in the context of forest governance fragmentation?

However, most attempts fail because they are not based upon understanding of system complexity, they assume “win-win” situations, they fail to plan for the impacts of society-wide changes happening beyond the project landscapes, and they use top-down – planning – approaches. In this paper we explore the use of system dynamics modelling for investigating trade-offs and synergies in landscape-scale approaches to conservation and development. We advocate the use of ‘scoping models’ because of their ability to incorporate complexity and promote social-learning in a participatory environment, while increasing the capacity of local actors to manage social-ecological complexity. We discuss their role in facilitating change in policies and practice in three landscapes in the tropics. Models do not provide a magic bullet solution and should not be used in isolation. They must be deployed along side other participatory and technical tools appropriate to local conditions. "

We investigated current cotton growing patterns in Khorezm, one representative cotton production region in Uzbekistan utilizing time series of 250-m \{MODIS\} satellite data. A Random Forest model was established using reference data of 2004–2007 to generate annual crop maps in 2000–2009. A linear model was applied to assess the spatial distribution of the longest observed cotton sequence within the ten-year observation period. All cotton-growing sequences were compared to the national crop rotation recommendations. The classification achieved an overall accuracy of 82%. We found that cotton remains the major crop in the region. It was cultivated for more than five out of the ten years on 46.5% of the cropland. But “Soviet cropping conditions” on less than 20% and officially recommended cotton sequences on more than 50% of the cropland challenge the notion that cotton mono-crop dominates Central Asia. Statistical analysis revealed that long cotton sequences preferably occur on fields far from settlements and under reduced soil suitability for irrigation. The results enable decision makers to better explain unfavourable cotton cultivation practices and to stimulate improvements. "

The scenarios are based on data collected in different regions in Costa Rica, representing different site conditions, offering a variety of possible management options for high-quality teak yield. Three competition indices were used for modeling the competition and for the definition of intensities and the plantation age at thinning. The maximum site occupation (MSO) and the Reineke density index (RDI) provide conservative stand density management limits, resulting in the need to execute several thinning frequently. The competition factor (CF) matches the field observations and seems to be more appropriate for the growth characteristics of the species. Final stand densities varied between 120 and 447 trees ha−1, with mean diameter at breast height (dbh) of 24.9–47.8 cm, and mean total heights between 23.0 and 32.4 m, depending on rotation length and site quality. The mean annual increment of total volume (MAIVol) at the end of the rotation varied from 11.3 to 24.9 m3 ha−1 year−1, accumulating a total volume over rotation of 268–524 m3 ha−1. The most suitable scenario for teak plantations for high-quality sites is the 30-year-rotation scenario with five thinnings of intensities between 20 and 50% (of the standing trees) at the ages of 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 years. After the sectioning of the merchantable stem in 4-m length logs, the merchantable volume varied between 145 and 386 m3 ha−1, with an estimated heartwood volume of 45–195 m3 ha−1, both depending on rotation length and site quality.

Diverse perspectives in the social sciences have been brought to bear on this question, but most efforts suffer from theoretical or methodological biases which undermine their utility for answering questions of interest to forest managers and policy-makers. We argue that research on silviculture practice can better serve the needs of policy-makers if it is approached more holistically and with the intention of answering clear questions about why particular users have, or have not adopted desired practices in particular situations. To illustrate this approach, we present three case studies of research on tropical silviculture practice from each of Philippines, Brazilian Amazon and Mexico. Findings from these studies indicate that a variety of factors may influence whether or not silvicultural practices are adopted. These range from characteristics of the local environment and individual users (knowledge, motivation, etc.) to wider geographical, economic and political influences. Forest researchers and policy-makers will better identify key constraints and opportunities for the adoption of silvicultural practices in particular contexts if they approach research with clear questions and an interdisciplinary approach.

The purpose of this study was to assess the status and development of national monitoring capacities between 2005 and 2010 in tropical non-Annex I countries. Different global data sources were integrated for the comparative analysis of 99 countries. Indicators were derived for four main categories: national engagement in the REDD+ process, existing monitoring capacities, challenges with respect to REDD+ monitoring under particular national circumstances and technical challenges for the use of remote sensing. Very large capacity gaps were observed in forty nine countries, mostly in Africa, while only four countries had a very small capacity gap. These four countries show a net increase in forest area with 2513 ha × 1000 ha, while all other countries together have a forest loss of 8299 ha × 1000 ha in total. Modest improvements were observed over the last five years, especially with regard to carbon pool reporting. Based on the different circumstances and current capacities of each country, general recommendations are made for the design and planning of a national REDD+ forest monitoring system and for capacity development investments. The four countries with good capacities for both monitoring of forest area change and for performing regular forest inventories could have an important role in South-South capacity development. "

In this paper we briefly explore the major land-uses in the Congo Basin and their actual or potential for multiple-use. We then focus on the most extant production system (industrial logging concessions) and analyze the existing issues and options for managing actively both timber and biodiversity with a special emphasis on wildlife and the role of certification. A few promising but yet ‘unfinished’ examples do exist in the region and we review these cases to draw lessons and recommendations. We contend however that true multiple-use could only be realized by expanding beyond boundaries of formal management units through new innovative land-use units, allowing a spatial cohabitation of the interests of local people, of conservation proponents and of extractive industries in the same management unit.

This has stimulated efforts to augment the value of \{SF\} to farmers to induce them to increase the area in SF. The objective of this paper was to document the regeneration of \{SF\} in slash-and-burn agriculture and to develop policy and technological recommendations for conserving forest cover on small farms and improve farmer welfare. The dynamics of \{SF\} in slash-and-burn farming were studied by investigating changes in the role of \{SF\} with frontier development. Farm survey data from a colonist settlement area in the Peruvian Amazon were analyzed by using a recursive econometric model. Results confirmed that substantial areas of \{SF\} exist on slash-and-burn farms during the first few decades after settlement. As a result, over a third of the farm area is under forest cover. This implies that deforestation in slash-and-burn farming may be less than previously believed. Soil recuperation is the most important reason for the existence of \{SF\} in slash-and-burn agriculture. During the relatively early stages of frontier development studied in this paper, fallow periods increased over time as site productivity declined, giving rise to secondary forests. Pastures lowered forested areas on farms and appear to impede the regeneration of SF. Commercial exploitation of \{SF\} products was minimal and declines with frontier development. The conclusions show that improved short-rotation fallows may recuperate the soil at the expense of forest cover, particularly in areas where most of the forest cover consists of SF. This conflict could be resolved by technologies that enrich \{SF\} and reinforce its multiple functions, including soil recuperation. Reduction of extensive cattle ranching may be a more effective way to conserve forest cover in slash-and-burn farming than technologies for shortening fallow periods. A ‘quantum leap’ in the benefits of forested land will be required if increases in forest cover are to be compatible with farmer welfare. This is likely to require innovative approaches, such as commercialization of the environmental services of forests. The results of this research could potentially shift efforts to control deforestation away from slash-and-burn farmers, thus reducing the perceived conflict between forest conservation and the livelihood of poor people.

The debate on these issues has identified a number of causes including expansion of arable land, demand for fuelwood and construction poles, and urban expansion. This paper examined how some policies aimed at improving agricultural production may be contributing to deforestation of woodlands in the communal and resettlement areas of Zimbabwe. Consideration was given to maize (Zea mays L.), cotton (Gosspium hirsutum L.) and sunflower (Helianthus anuus L.); crops with appreciable land area in 1980–90. Regression analysis indicated that policies which improved marketing of grains, provision of credit (largely in form of farm inputs) and extension services, encouraged expansion of land under maize and less so under cotton. High nominal prices encouraged expansion of area under maize while decreasing real prices of cotton, if not reversed, had potential for reducing land under cotton. Increased fertilizer prices, through removal of subsidies as required by structural adjustment policies, had potential for reducing land under maize and sunflower. The driving force for sunflower and cotton production was partly based on the desire, by farmers, for non-declining revenues in successive years. During the same period, real producer prices for these crops were declining and demand for cash was increasing rapidly. The evaluated agricultural policies appeared to have been responsible for moderate expansion of land area under maize but more significant expansion of land under cotton and sunflower. These policies could have encouraged modest deforestation of woodlands in the Zimbabwean communal and resettlement areas in the period 1980–1995. "

The analysis focuses on four identified vulnerable sectors — food (NTFPs), energy (fuelwood), health (medicinal plants) and water (freshwater) through a multi-stakeholder dialog at national and regional levels. We use a vulnerability assessment framework by combining the elements of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to conceptualize vulnerability in these sectors. The identified sectors in relation to the forest ecosystem are discussed in view of providing an understanding of the sector's potential adaptive capacities for policy intervention. Our analysis presents the possible implications of the vulnerability of these sectors for planning local and national adaptation strategies. Local and national adaptive capacities to respond to climate impacts in the forest sectors includes: reducing poverty, enhancing food security, water availability, combating land degradation and reducing loss of biological diversity.

Impact assessments of past \{LUP\} have revealed weaknesses of local institutions in the effective implementation of land policies. In order to avoid the blind trust placed in delusive \{LUP\} success stories, methods for monitoring community participation and understanding of \{LUP\} activities have been developed in order to assess the quality of the process. Expanding on this perspective, this article proposes a method to assess the quality of \{LUP\} outputs and to visualize the gap between planning objectives and their actual achievements. This method, based on a refined analysis of past and present land zoning practices in Lao PDR, gives full prominence to the complexity of landscape mosaics and the way local populations actually use the land. Furthermore, this approach, developed and tested under real planning conditions, can also be seen as a safeguard and support for inexperienced implementers in their land-use planning practices, as a diagnostic instrument for quality assessment, i.e. level of accuracy of a land-use plan, and may finally pave the way toward becoming a tool for land-use planning certification.

However, implementation has been disappointing, which led scientists at the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) to consider a scenario exercise as a way to mitigate the risk of unwanted outcomes. The study had a characteristic that it shares with many other studies: close interaction of larger-scale processes and trends (global markets, national policy) with smaller-scale systems (regional and local policy, farmer livelihoods). The authors therefore felt than an explicitly multi-scale approach was called for. To keep close to the well-known practice, we made a modest extension to a conventional scenario logic approach, and introduced a nested, and multi-scale scenario logic. While modest, we believe that the modification is useful, and the method could be used in other studies, in particular climate adaptation studies. We applied the method during two scenario workshops held to explore the use of smallholder tree plantations in efforts to improve rural livelihoods; each workshop considered two different localities. While the scenario frameworks resulting from the workshops were similar between the localities, we believe that the nested scenario framework served to structure the process and revealed meaningful contextual differences. From these experiences, we discuss and critique the method. "

The ‘certification’ assures the consumer that the products have been produced with practices that meet fundamental ecological and social standards. For ecological certification systems to be viable and deliver products to the market over the long term, the relationships among key components must evolve economically and institutionally.

The \{EU\} requires that national \{VPA\} negotiations include participation by the relevant stakeholders. Based on primary data, we compare the \{VPA\} negotiations in Cameroon (2006–2009) with three different ‘ideal’ models of participatory policy-making: the rationalist, the communicative incremental and the mixed model, which we expect have different implications for legitimacy. We conclude that the Cameroonian process is closest to a rationalist model with elements of the mixed model, and that this has increased legitimacy and support only to a limited extent. For future processes in other countries, we recommend stronger elements of the mixed model, and more careful considerations about stakeholder identification processes; how to adapt policy-process to specific contexts; and how to strengthen communication and information flows. Considerations about these elements could also strengthen the applicability of the ideal models. "

abstract = "Abstract Shifting, or swidden, cultivation remains an important land use across Southeast Asia and other parts of the tropics, albeit under pressures from other land uses. The swidden cycle of cultivation and regrowth creates mosaic landscapes with regrowing fallows of various age interspersed with active fields and patches of mature forest. Quantifying tree biomass in these landscapes is limited by the availability of reliable allometric models, hindering accurate carbon stock estimation and thus quantification of \{GHG\} emission associated with land use transitions. We therefore developed new allometric models for the prediction of both above- and below-ground woody biomass in swidden systems based on a destructive harvest of 150 trees in Luang Prabang Province, Laos People’s Democratic Republic (PDR). This study is the first to develop allometric models of root biomass for swidden landscapes in this region, which we hypothesised would be a major carbon pool given that resprouting, and associated high root biomass, is a common physiological/morphological trait in regularly disturbed ecosystems. We found that a general model including tree diameter (DBH, cm) and height (H, m) was best for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB, kg) for both resprouts and trees growing from seed (AGB = 1.09 + 0.027D2H) though the inclusion of H only resulted in a marginal increase in model performance meaning a DBH-only model is acceptable to use in the absence of height data (AGB = 0.1286DBH2.134). Tree height was less important for estimating root biomass, with models including only \{DBH\} performing best. Re-sprouting trees exhibited greater root biomass (BGB = 0.355DBH1.732) compared to those growing from seed (0.016DBH2.597) meaning different root allometric models were developed for each tree type. Thus, we suggest that field efforts should be directed towards checking resprouting status over the estimation of tree height. We also found that models fit using non-linear regression provided equally good fits to the data compared to the traditional approach of log-transforming the data. Our models were subsequently applied to 12 nearby plots spanning a chronosequence of fallows to examine the impact of re-sprouting allometry on biomass estimation. Root biomass stocks were on average 58% higher after accounting for the allometry of resprouting trees, resulting in an average 9% increase in total biomass stocks, highlighting the importance of choosing root allometrics based on growth form in swidden fallows. If re-sprouting status is unknown, a stand-level root:shoot ratio of 0.32 can be applied. Our analysis suggests that using our models will substantially improve the accuracy of estimates of tree biomass and its distribution among different pools in swidden fallows. This information is crucial in better quantifying carbon stock changes resulting from the conversion of swidden land to other land uses. "

This role is becoming increasingly apparent as transnational market-based forest governance efforts begin to threaten military administration of protected areas. As a consequence, the multi-dimensional nature of security – both defensive in the classic military sense, but also increasingly economic and complex – is coming to light through uses of what we describe as the security exception: the invocation of national security, in this case by military actors, to manage the reach and efficacy of emerging forest governance efforts. Projects to reduce climate-related emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) have been especially prone to trigger the security exception due to their focus on forest measurement and change over time, and are examined here in two cases from protected areas in western and southern Laos. We suggest that even as conflicts over forest management may be interpreted through the lens of foreign domination and the loss of domestic sovereignty – indeed the security exception feeds on such interpretations – these conflicts are better understood as struggles within the Lao state and society over the how to manage and use forest resources in a context of economic uncertainty and persistent underdevelopment. In such a context, the role of conservation \{NGOs\} and Western donors as gatekeepers to ongoing transnational governance efforts is nonetheless highly significant. "

Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) intends to compensate local stakeholders for demonstrated carbon emission reduction and increased removals accounted for internationally, while promoting social and environmental benefits locally. Thus, monitoring REDD+ inherently requires the use of interdisciplinary data at different scales. Forest carbon monitoring, central to REDD+, is considerably advanced, yet the progress on social and environmental monitoring systems is uneven. We argue that scalar and interdisciplinary integration of REDD+ monitoring is crucial to uncover and understand trade-offs and synergies on which effectiveness, efficiency and equity of REDD+ may depend. We review previous efforts in integrating environmental and social monitoring, as well as efforts specific to REDD+, and discuss how old and new knowledge can contribute towards integrated monitoring. We observe that there are many challenges, but strong advantages, in an integrated monitoring approach. The current emergence of diverging standards and methodologies with narrow focus can inform future integrative efforts but could, in the long run, hinder coherence in national processes. We conclude that recent technological advances open new opportunities to integrate information across scale and disciplines, leveraging and combining existing data with targeted additional measures. The application of mixed methods in data collection can foster integration, in particular from the local level upwards. However, this requires greater coordination at higher levels to efficiently upscale multiple data streams. The unequal standpoint of carbon, social and environmental monitoring efforts provide a timely opportunity to promote integration, learn from advances in carbon monitoring, and build on existing and emerging platforms and tools that are locally to globally relevant.

Some of the challenges faced by smallholders include high certification costs, insufficient institutional capacity, inadequate financial and social incentives, poor group organization and lack of external support.

Yet, this information is critical for enhancing management capability and engaging in international initiatives such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD +). The use of multi-source inventories (i.e., remote-sensing, field, and other data) in integrated models has shown increasing promise for accurately estimating forest attributes at lower costs. In this study, we compared the use of Landsat 8 \{OLI\} versus RapidEye satellite imagery in four modeling approaches (generalized linear model (GLM), generalized additive model (GAM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Random Forests), with and without auxiliary information (e.g., soils characteristics, distance to roads, etc.) to estimate percent canopy cover by pixel for an ~ 1,000,000 ha area in Zambia. We derived plot-level canopy cover as the dependent variable, using field-measured data collected according to current National Forest Inventory (NFI) protocol. Using cross-validation statistics, Landsat 8 \{OLI\} exhibited better results than RapidEye across modeling approaches likely due to the additional short-wave infrared bands which consistently improved model performance (average root mean squared prediction error = 10.1% versus 11.0%). The \{GAM\} approach was more precise, though more challenging to fit. For both remote sensing data sources and all modeling approaches, other auxiliary information improved the model; soil variables were commonly selected for inclusion using a Genetic Algorithm. Using a binomial \{GAM\} with Landsat 8 \{OLI\} and soil variables, and by applying the current \{FAO\} forest/non-forest definition (i.e., canopy cover &gt; 10% for a 0.5 ha area), we estimated the total forest area as 758,100 ha (95% bootstrapped confidence interval of ± 3,953 ha). Overall, our research indicates that sufficiently accurate forest area estimates for Zambia can be obtained using canopy cover \{GAM\} models that incorporate \{NFI\} data and freely-available remote sensing imagery and soil information.

Based on a review of literature and secondary data and interviews with key informants, this article examines the gap between these national ambitions and the reality on the ground, with particular attention to the challenges of multi-scalar environmental governance. It first introduces the green economy concept and discusses the main green growth policies and initiatives at the national level. The article then examines green growth ambitions at the provincial level in East Kalimantan province. Our findings suggest that existing plans to further expand oil palm plantations are at odds with provincial efforts to reduce emissions. This highlights a key paradox we identify at the heart of the green economy concept as it is developing in Indonesia: between a development trajectory based on resource extraction and agro-industrial development, and ‘green’ aspirations linked to environmental protection and greenhouse gas emissions reductions. We conclude that the main challenges to address these contradictions are related to the lack of coordination between different governance scales and a political economy that is not conducive to reforms in the land-based sector. There is a need to align investment, planning, and green growth policies, based on a strong political commitment and an awareness of social and environmental trade-offs. On a more general level the article shows that the green economy concept refers to a form of environmental governance in which authorities and interests may overlap and come into conflict at different scales. Hence, differing priorities may lead the material expression of the green economy to diverge significantly from policy as it is initially laid out. "

We examine how the Bolivian state economic policies implemented during the 20th century affected the Tsimane' ancestral lands, and how – over the late-20th century – the Bolivian state accommodated Tsimane' claims to lands in between multiple interests. We show how national policies led to the reconfiguration of Tsimane' territoriality and to a fragmented institutional representation.

In light of the current international efforts to reduce deforestation associated to REDD+, effective and efficient country-specific policy options need to be identified to make progress on the ground. Taking lowland Bolivia as an example, we propose a systematic approach to identify and discuss such policy options; this systematic approach can be applied to other tropical contexts with ongoing conversion of forests to agricultural uses. We begin with the distinction of three land use categories associated with the main proximate causes of deforestation in lowland Bolivia, viz. mechanized agriculture, small-scale agriculture and cattle ranching, each of them linked to typical agents. Based on a systematic analysis of spatial and socioeconomic criteria, we then estimate the potential of land use expansion and the likely costs of deforestation reduction in order to formulate suitable policy options for each of the three proximate causes of deforestation. Although mechanized agriculture caused more than half of deforestation in lowland Bolivia, we argue that cattle ranching activities, which contributed to 27% of deforestation between 1992 and 2004, should be targeted as a priority since its expansion threatens forests in many different locations and improvements could be achieved at relatively low costs. In this light, enforcing land use legislation, accompanied by strengthening institutions on national and local levels, constitute tasks of utmost importance. "

abstract = "Abstract Deforestation in Burkina Faso is estimated to be between 0.91–1.03% per annum and displacement by croplands or rangeland expansion is identified as its main drivers. The climate and geography of the country causes its north and central regions to be exposed to drought and desertification, which act as stimuli for rural migration to southern Burkina Faso which lies in the South-Sudanian climatic zone. This zone has better conditions to support rain-fed agricultural production, wood energy supply and fodder for livestock but it also experiences the highest rate of deforestation in the country. This study analyses the drivers of deforestation in Ziro province of Southern Burkina Faso. For data collection and analysis, the area of forest cleared annually was used as the dependent variable, whereas household characteristics and local institutions (tenure and property rights) were considered independent variables. Data were collected through focus group discussions (FGD), participant observation, interviews with key informants and from 200 farm households. Tobit regression results reveal that land tenure insecurity and low agricultural production expressed in the sizes (areas) and ages of farms led to increased deforestation. In addition, the significance of tenure insecurity as a driver of deforestation indicated that migrants contributed more to deforestation than the indigenous groups. Greater rights and improved legal status might reduce the rights to limited use granted to migrants. Furthermore, supports from government to increase local community's capacity to monitor protected forests are likely to reduce field expansion. "

Results from a pilot assessment of the Forestry Modules in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, are presented, showing that the Forestry Modules perform well in extracting the expected information: mean per capita forest and wild product income shifts according to the geographical “forest gradient”. Significantly, in the forest-rich upstream village, mean forest and wild product income and mean forest-related wage and business incomes exceeds current mean agricultural income statistics for West Kalimantan and mean non-agricultural rural household incomes in the lowest bracket. Consumption of forest products and importance as a coping strategy was higher in the most upstream village, where sale of forest products in times of shock was more marked in the most downstream village (where forest coping strategies were also least important).

The permanent raised-bed/furrow system, a water-wise conservation agriculture-based practice, is gaining importance for row- and high value-crops in irrigated agriculture. However, because of additional surface exposure and elevation, raised beds may be more prone to salt accumulation especially under shallow water table conditions. A field study was carried out in 2008 and 2009 in the Khorezm region, Central Asia, to investigate the effect of three furrow irrigation methods on salt dynamics of the soil and the performance of the cotton crop on the raised bed-furrow system. The irrigation methods compared included (i) Conventional furrow irrigation wherein every furrow was irrigated (EFI) at each irrigation event; (ii) Alternate skip furrow irrigation (ASFI where one of two neighbouring furrows were alternately irrigated during consecutive irrigations events; and (iii) Permanent skip furrow irrigation (PSFI) during which irrigation was permanently skipped in one of the two neighbouring furrows during all irrigation events. For salinity management with \{PSFI\} a ‘managed salt accumulation and effective leaching’ approach was pursued. The \{EFI\} method increased salt accumulation on the top of the raised beds. In contrast, the \{PSFI\} method allowed an effective salt leaching from the top of the raised beds. After leaching, salinity on top of the beds under \{PSFI\} was reduced to &lt;3 dS m−1 compared to 5–6 dS m−1 under \{ASFI\} and \{EFI\} indicating an effective leaching with the \{PSFI\} method. Raw cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L., cv. Khorezm 127) yield was higher under the \{PSFI\} (2003 kg ha−1) method having yield increases of 984 kg ha−1 (96% higher) and 787 kg ha−1 (64% higher) than under \{EFI\} (1216 kg ha−1) and \{ASFI\} (1019 kg ha−1) methods, respectively. Better crop performance with \{PSFI\} was linked with the lesser salinization of the raised beds and a larger salt free root zone before the leaching events. In addition, the \{PSFI\} method reduced irrigation water demand contributed thus to minimizing secondary soil salinization. Thus, \{PSFI\} could be an effective method to manage the salt under raised beds in salt-affected irrigated arid regions. "

Laos, like many other developing countries dependent on agriculture and natural resources for the subsistence of a mostly rural population, has used land use planning (LUP) as a core policy instrument to achieve sustainable development. However, previous reviews of \{LUP\} implementation showed large discrepancies between policies and practices and between the intended goals and actual outcomes. There is a need for increased participation, improved integration of scales, harmonization of superimposed plans, and enhanced coordination between implementing agencies and other stakeholders. Consequently, former normative approaches to \{LUP\} have been gradually replaced (at least on paper) by a new paradigm. Participatory land use planning (PLUP) has recently become a central element of donor-supported programs in developing countries. However, despite the good intentions of \{PLUP\} principles, implementation remains entangled with confused practical issues that compromise effective participation. As an alternative to complex, technologically sophisticated \{LUP\} models that local stakeholders cannot use or replicate, a communication platform supporting negotiations among multiple stakeholder groups was tested in a village cluster in Luang Prabang Province in northern Laos. This innovative approach, based on a combination of role-playing games, participatory 3D modeling, GIS, and socioeconomic and environmental impact assessment, allows stakeholders to collectively explore the consequences of land use decisions and choose between alternative future landscapes.

It highlighted the evolution of the household and its land-use over three periods related to the key macroeconomic periods, and corresponding to the dates of acquisition of the remote sensing data.

The results show that the annual rate of deforestation increased after the economic crisis as compared to the previous period. The household survey information enables identification of the causal relationships and the processes of land-use and land-cover changes. Observations reveal that the beginning of the economic crisis (1986) is associated in time with a strong increase of the deforestation rate related to population growth, increased marketing of food crops, modification of farming systems, and colonization of new agricultural areas in remote forest zones.

The key driver of \{FT\} in South Korea was the government-led reforestation policy. The comprehensive reforestation plans, started in 1973, not only provided economic incentives to the general public by establishing clear quantifiable goals, they also promoted inter-agency cooperation and coordination, especially between the energy and forest sectors, to replace firewood with fossil fuels. These government-led efforts, accompanied by rural–urban migration, brought an increase in stocked forest area and a complementary rising average growing stock level. The case of South Korea shows that \{FTs\} can be cultivated in a relatively short period of time by a central authority, even with imperfect governance and low economic development. "

We analyzed the temporal patterns of land-use change inside and outside four PAs, with one located in each of Laos, Indonesia, Madagascar and Cameroon. In Laos, in the Viengkham landscape, the rates of conversion of natural forest increased after the designation of the \{PA\} and were higher than the spatial baseline predicted. In the three other landscapes, the policies associated with the implementation of \{PAs\} increased the conversion rate immediately outside the boundary of the PAs. In Indonesia, in the Bungo landscape, forms of land-use associated with multifunctional agroforestry activities involving rubber trees land-use became the target for conversion to oil palm and monoculture rubber tree crops when the rules on the protection of the remaining natural forest were tightened. We tested a new metric for the degree of integration of forest in multifunctional landscapes which recognizes the surrounding matrix, both as surrogate habitat and as a corridor for tree species. Two important findings were: (i) a ‘leakage’ zone of influence of at least 10 km around a \{PA\} needs to be included for quantification of the deforestation and degradation changes that may be due to forest protection inside the \{PA\} and (ii) agroforest and other mixed tree cover can maintain or increase the degree of integration of forest in the multifunctional landscape for biodiversity maintenance and conservation, while providing a source of livelihood for the local people.

Economic incentives, such as payments for environmental services could promote conservation, but deforestation often occurs on land without crucial tenure-security prerequisites. Improving the enforcement of existing regulatory disincentives thus represents an important element of Brazil's anti-deforestation action plan. However, conservation law enforcement costs and benefits have been much less studied than for conditional payments. We develop a conceptual framework and a spatially explicit model to analyze field-based regulatory enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon. We validate our model, based on historical deforestation and enforcement mission data from 2003 to 2008. By simulating the current conservation law enforcement practice, we analyze the costs of liability establishment and legal coercion for alternative conservation targets, and evaluate corresponding income impacts. Our findings suggest that spatial patterns of both deforestation and inspection costs markedly influence enforcement patterns and their income effects. Field-based enforcement is a highly cost-effective forest conservation instrument from a regulator's point of view, but comes at high opportunity costs for land users. Payments for environmental services could compensate costs, but will increase budget outlays vis-à-vis a command-and-control dominated strategy. Both legal and institutional challenges have to be overcome to make conservation payments work at a larger scale. Decision-makers may have to innovatively combine incentive and disincentive-based policy instruments in order to make tropical forest conservation both financially viable and socially compatible. "

In Bolivia's Los Negros valley (Department of Santa Cruz), bordering the Amboró National Park, 46 farmers are currently paid to protect 2774 ha of a watershed containing the threatened cloud-forest habitat of 11 species of migratory birds. In this payment for environmental services (PES) scheme, annual contracts prohibit tree cutting, hunting and forest clearing on enrolled lands. Farmer–landowners as service providers submit to independent yearly monitoring, and are sanctioned for non-compliance. Facilitated by a local NGO, Fundación Natura Bolivia, one service buyer is an international conservation donor (the \{US\} Fish and Wildlife Service) interested in biodiversity conservation. The second service users are downstream irrigators who likely benefit from stabilized dry-season water flows if upstream cloud forests are successfully protected. Individual irrigators have been reluctant to pay, but the Los Negros municipal government has on their behalf contributed ~ US$4500 to the scheme. The negotiated payment mode is annual quid pro quo in-kind compensations in return for forest protection. Predominantly, payments are made as “contingent project implementation”, transferring beehives supplemented by apicultural training. With regard to service provision, environment committees and education programs have increased awareness in downstream communities of the probable water-supply reduction effect of continued upstream deforestation. External donors have funded subsequent studies providing basic economic, hydrological and biodiversity data, and covered \{PES\} start-up (~ US$40,000) and running transaction costs (~ US$3000 per year over the last three years).

We analyze a stratified sample of 20 community forests to assess the conditions that may enable communities to capture value from their forests and the effects of the external support they have received. While communities seem to be benefiting financially from the forest, their capacity to do so is limited by their inability to capture value added in the market chain. This is due to a lack of technical skills, excessive distance to markets, competition from industrial loggers who access the newly opened logging areas, and the intensity of external help they receive. The result is a sub-optimal contribution of community forests to local development. "

This paper reviews evidence that indicates that this ‘conservation through commercialisation’ thesis needs to be revised. In practice, the selective nature of market demand, and the uneven distribution of resources of use value within forests, mean that with \{NTFP\} harvesting the resource can become altered and degraded. The pressures that market forces can place on local control mechanisms, and the conflicting interests of those using forest resources for subsistence and income generation, can also result in poorer users becoming disadvantaged as \{NTFP\} commercialisation is intensified.

Although REDD+ in Indonesia has strong rhetorical presidential backing, analysis of the political system suggests that such support may not be sufficient without the engagement and ownership of key players such as the parliament and the bureaucracy. Not only is the president's official power curtailed by the formal political system, but the nature of coalition politics in Indonesia further weakens his ability to implement reforms. Securing the support of a coalition of parties within parliament and the bureaucracy at both national and decentralised levels may be crucial to ensuring implementation. Politicisation of the bureaucracy and increasing business–government relationships are important features of the parliamentary dynamic at the national level and are reportedly intensifying at the local level. Although public support has proved influential for other reforms in Indonesia, the public is less informed or motivated by the issues related to REDD+. In addition, the REDD+ debate is tainted by concerns about sovereignty and lack of national ownership. Building domestic constituencies for the reforms and associated institutions is therefore a key challenge. REDD+ reforms will require a stronger consensus among political elites and the broader public over the implications of a transition to a ‘low carbon’ economy in Indonesia. "

Specifically, the recognition of rights by central governments leads to political contestations over both territory and authority as communities and indigenous political leaders vie for different configurations of both lands and new territorial authorities. That is, the process of constituting large collective territories is intimately related to the constitution of authority, as it involves not only the negotiation of physical boundaries but also the recognition of an existing authority structure – or the creation of a new entity – to represent the beneficiaries. In Nicaragua's North Atlantic Autonomous Region, then, the decision over ‘which configuration of territory’ is ultimately a political negotiation over which ‘authority’ will have the right to control and enforce access to which rights and benefits from land and natural resources.

This performance-based incentive mechanism requires accurate quantification of carbon stock and emissions. However, currently there are limited existing local or regional equations for estimating aboveground biomass in peat swamp forests. The main objective of this study was to define the most accurate models for aboveground biomass estimation in Indonesian peat swamp forests. We found that the pan-tropical equations performed better in estimating biomass of peat swamp forests than did existing local equations. We developed new equations, based on 148 trees from 24 families with diameter at breast height in the range of 2–167 cm collected from peat swamp forests in the western part of Indonesia. Statistical indicators showed that the best model form was the common linear one using log-transformed data. Estimated biomass values needs to be back-transformed applying correction factors. The ratio estimator correction factor which derives from the ratio between the average of measured biomass and the average of predicted biomass, was found to provide the lowest mean deviation. The existing pan-tropical equations performed similarly to our mixed species and dipterocarp models but they systematically under- or over-estimated the biomass of certain species groups, especially non-dipterocarp trees. We also found that grouping by family (dipterocarp vs. non-dipterocarp) and wood density class (hardwood vs. softwood) significantly improved the accuracy of biomass estimation. In the absence of wood density values, wood density-class specific equations, instead of mixed-species equations improved the accuracy of biomass estimates. "

Preventing and mitigating the negative impacts of fire in the Amazon require a comprehensive understanding not only of what the drivers of fire activity are, but also how these drivers interact and vary across scales. Here, we combine multi-scalar data on land use, climate, and landowner residency to disentangle the drivers of fire activity over 10 years (2001–2010) on individual landholdings in a fire-prone region of the Peruvian Amazon. We examined the relative importance of and interactions between climate variability (drought intensity), land occupation (in particular, landowner absenteeism), and land cover variables (cover of fallow and pasture) for predicting both fire occurrence (whether or not fire was detected on a farm in a given year) and fire size. Drought intensity was the most important predictor of fire occurrence, but land-cover type and degree of landowner absenteeism increased fire probability when conditions were dry enough. On the other hand, drought intensity did not stand out relative to other significant predictors in the fire size model, where degree of landowner absenteeism in a village and percent cover of fallow in a village were also strongly associated with fire size. We also investigated to what extent these variables measured at the individual landholding versus the village scale influenced fire activity. While the predictors measured at the landholding and village scales were approximately of equal importance for modeling fire occurrence, only village scale predictors were important in the model of fire size. These results demonstrate that the relative importance of various drivers of fire activity can vary depending on the scale at which they are measured and the scale of analysis. Additionally, we highlight how a full understanding of the drivers of fire activity should go beyond fire occurrence to consider other metrics of fire activity such as fire size, as implications for fire prevention and mitigation can be different depending on the model considered. Drought early warning systems may be most effective for preventing fire in dry years, but management to address the impacts of landowner absenteeism, such as bolstering community fire control efforts in high-risk areas, could help minimize the size of fires when they do occur. Thus, interventions should focus on minimizing fire size as well as preventing fires altogether, especially because fire is an inexpensive and effective management tool that has been in use for millennia.

We establish a set of economic and institutional preconditions for \{PES\} to become a feasible and cost-effective conservation mechanism. We proceed with a macro-scale spatial analysis and overlay of opportunity costs, deforestation patterns, carbon services, and land tenure, in order to assess where these conditions hold. We then screen how the benefits of potential \{PES\} schemes might be distributed across different socioeconomic groups of service providers in different land tenure categories. Our economic–quantitative analysis, though sensitive to documented assumptions, suggests that under current carbon prices the economic preconditions are in place to pay for avoided deforestation in over half of threatened forests over the next decade. Unfortunately, the same optimism does not apply to institutional preconditions. Land grabbing, insecure tenure, overlapping claims, and lacking information on private tenure constitute real medium-term impediments to PES. If payments were to accrue to current landholders regardless of current tenure insecurities, large landowners who account for about 80% of all deforestation would reap the highest benefits, though per-capita benefits other tenure categories are also high. Schemes that closely align payments with opportunity costs are preferable for cost-effectiveness, and not necessarily more inequitable in outcomes. Essentially, \{PES\} systems cannot substitute command-and-control measures: the former depend on the latter for basic governance systems to secure effective rights of exclusion, which land stewards essentially need in order to become reliable service providers.

In a plantation of relatively slower growing species, measurements taken at 68 months of age resulted in Samanea saman (Jacq.)

Stakeholder involvement, consensus building and the integration of comprehensive and reliable information represent crucial, yet challenging, pillars for successful outcomes. The spatially-explicit multi-criteria decision support framework “targetCSA” presented here aims to aid the targeting of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) at the national level. This framework integrates quantitative, spatially-explicit information such as vulnerability indicators (e.g. soil organic matter, literacy rate and market access) and proxies for \{CSA\} practices (e.g. soil fertility improvement, water harvesting and agroforestry) as well as qualitative opinions on these targeting criteria from a broad range of stakeholders. The analytic hierarchy process and a goal optimization approach are utilized to quantify collective, consensus-oriented stakeholder preferences on vulnerability indicators and \{CSA\} practices. Spatially-explicit vulnerability and \{CSA\} data are aggregated and coupled with stakeholder preferences deriving vulnerability and \{CSA\} suitability indices. Based on these indices, relevant regions with the potential to implement \{CSA\} practices are identified. “targetCSA” was exemplarily applied in Kenya exploring group-specific and overall consensus-based solutions of stakeholder opinions on vulnerability and \{CSA\} under different consensus scenarios. In this example, 32 experts from four stakeholder groups who participated in two surveys were included. The subsequent analyses not only revealed consistently regions with high \{CSA\} potential but also highlighted different high potential areas depending on the applied consensus scenario. Thus, this framework allows stakeholders to explore the consequences of scenarios that reflect opinions of the majority and minority or are based on a balance between them. “targetCSA” and the application example contribute valuable insights to the development of policy and planning tools to consensually target and implement CSA.

However, it is a key challenge to distinguish degradation and deforestation from temporal vegetation dynamics inherent to swiddening. In this article we present an approach for spatial delineation of swidden systems based on landscape mosaics. Furthermore we introduce a classification for change processes based on the change matrix of these landscape mosaics. Our approach is illustrated by a case study in Viengkham district in northern Laos. Over a 30-year time period the swidden landscapes have increased in extent and they have degraded, shifting from long crop–fallow cycles to short cycles. From 2007 to 2009 degradation within the swidden system accounted for half of all the landscape mosaics change processes. Pioneering shifting cultivation did not prevail. The landscape mosaics approach could be used in a swidden compatible monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system of a future REDD+ framework. "

Biophysical stressors external to a \{PES\} site, such as forest fires, pollution, sea level rise, and ocean acidification, may undermine ecosystem stability and sustained ecosystem service provision, yet their threats and impacts are difficult to account for within \{PES\} scheme design. We present a typology of external biophysical stressors, characterizing them in terms of stressor origin, spatial domain and temporal scale. We further analyse how external stressors can potentially impinge on key \{PES\} parameters, as they (1) threaten ecosystem service provision, additionality and permanence, (2) add challenges to the identification of \{PES\} providers and beneficiaries, and (3) add complexity and costs to \{PES\} mechanism design. Effective \{PES\} implementation under external stressors requires greater emphasis on the evaluation and mitigation of external stressors, and further instruments that can accommodate associated risks and uncertainties. A greater understanding of external stressors will increase our capacity to design multi-scale instruments to conserve important ecosystems in times of environmental change. "

Stem growth of two Mediterranean oaks was predicted using nonlinear multiplicative models as a function of precipitation and minimum temperature of the hydrological year fitted to dendrochronological data. The growth of both species increased nonlinearly with accumulated precipitation before reaching an asymptote, but the species with a warmer niche (Q. ilex, an evergreen species) required lower levels of precipitation to achieve high relative growth. The species-specific relationship between growth and minimum temperature exhibited an optimum for the two species. Trees were negatively affected by high minimum temperatures whereas they responded negatively (Q. ilex) or neutrally (Q. pyrenaica, a deciduous species) to low temperatures along the climatic gradient analyzed. Growth would decrease rapidly when minimum temperatures rose above approximately 7 °C for Q. pyrenaica and 9 °C for Q. ilex. Most growth projections suggest a likely future decrease in productivity along the species range for Q. pyrenaica and particularly at species-specific warm, dry locations pointed to a future drastic reduction in productivity as a result of the increase in temperatures without a paired increase in precipitation forecasted by the different climate scenarios considered. In agreement with results from studies modeling future distribution of species this suggests that Q. pyrenaica could be threatened by climate change at the species local dry edge where, in addition, stands often present a lack of seed regeneration. More drought tolerant Q. ilex might profit from warming temperatures at cold northern locations but would also reduce productivity at warm, dry locations. Stem growth was successfully modeled using biologically meaningful species-specific responses to climate which provided key ecological information to understand the functional response of the two species. The models used have much potential to be applied with dendroecological data to study the response of forests to climate change. "

As a result many of the latter were sharply scaled back. Additional information and analysis that has become available since the 1980s support the view that there is no need for large scale interventions devoted just to provision of fuelwood. However, declining access to supplies or markets can raise significant problems in some areas, and for particular categories of user. Growing urban demand for charcoal can also cause local problems, in particular in Africa. The potentials for appropriate forms of intervention are discussed. "

Main objectives in management combine two main commercial productions, timber and pine nuts with other social aspects: soil protection, recreational use and biodiversity conservation. Multifunctional management, together with the occurrence of successive events affecting regeneration have oriented managers to propose a management schedule based on the establishment and preservation of a low-stocking multi-aged complex structure on favourable locations. Despite the recent effort on modelling growth and yield on even-aged stands of stone pine, no studies focusing on modelling dynamics for uneven-aged stands have yet been developed up to present. In this study, a proposal is presented for adapting and calibrating an existing tree-level model, originally developed for even-aged stands of stone pine (model PINEA2), to multi-aged complex stands. Data from four multi-aged trials and 61 plots from the National Forest Inventory were used to adapt the whole set of functions included in the original model. In our study, four different methods have been proposed to adapt the original equations: (1) direct validation and re-parameterization; (2) size class modelling; (3) refit of functions after removing typical even-aged covariates; and (4) multilevel calibration. Adaptation is based on assuming that a multi-aged stand of stone pine can be seen as the sum of independent, smaller, even-aged groups. The low densities of the stands, the early liberation of the most vigorous trees in all size classes and the major importance of root-level competition for water in Mediterranean forests are the main factors explaining these particular dynamics. Results show the suitability of the proposed method, attaining unbiased estimates with a degree of accuracy similar to that achieved in applying the original model to even-aged stands. The adapted model (PINEA_IRR) constitutes a flexible tool for the management and maintenance of stone pine stands, covering a wide range of within stand structural complexity, including forests in transition.

Eleven biparametric nonlinear height–diameter equations were evaluated to find a local model, which only includes the dimensions of the tree as explanatory variables. After selecting the local model, a regional or generalized model was studied. The following stand variables were tested for inclusion in the model as fixed effects: stand density, quadratic mean diameter, arithmetic mean diameter, dominant diameter, arithmetic mean height, dominant height and basal area. Dominant height and basal area of the stand were found to produce the most satisfactory fits in the stand model. Interregional variability was studied by including strata effects as dummy categorical variables and was analysed using the non-linear extra sum of squares method and the Lakkis–Jones test. Height–diameter models were found to be similar for the six biogeoclimatic strata. Finally, a mixed nonlinear model technique was applied to fit the definitive model. By calibrating the model it is possible to predict random components of definitive model from height measurements previously taken from a subsample of trees. The different alternatives tested reveal that only two or three trees are necessary to calibrate the model. "

After the treatment, microspores at the responsive developmental stage of vacuolate microspore switched towards proliferation and the embryogenesis pathway to further produce haploid plantlets. Ultrastructural and immunocytochemical analysis revealed changes in cell organisation after induction at different developmental stages, the cellular features displayed being in relation to the activation of proliferative activity and the beginning of differentiation in young and late proembryos. Immunogold labelling with \{JIM5\} and \{JIM7\} antibodies showed a different presence of pectin and level of its esterification in cell walls at different developmental stages. Non-esterified pectins were found in higher proportions in cells of late proembryos, suggesting that pectin de-esterification could be related to the beginning of differentiation. The presence and subcellular distribution of Erk 1/2 \{MAPK\} homologues have been investigated by immunoblottting, immunofluorescence and immunogold labelling. The results showed an increase in the expression of these proteins with a high presence in the nucleus, during early microspore proembryos development. The reported changes during early microspore embryogenesis are modulated in relation to proliferation and differentiation events. These findings provided new evidences for a role of \{MAPK\} signalling pathways in early microspore embryogenesis, specifically in proliferation, and would confer information for the cell fate and the direction of the cell development.

Its importance is evidenced in the international reporting requirements, which include the need for countries to detail their deadwood stock as an important indicator of sustainable development. In recent years, deadwood stocks have been included within the variables reported in the Spanish National Forest Inventories (SNFI), showing average values for total deadwood stocks of 8 and 10.5 m3 ha−1 for the \{SNFI3\} and SNFI4, respectively. However, \{SNFI\} are undertaken approximately every ten years, making it difficult their use for accomplishing international reporting requirements annually or every five years. In this context, the objective of the present study was to attempt to model deadwood occurrence, stocks and dynamics using stand, topographic and climatic variables. The models developed considered different forest types, deadwood categories (standing dead trees; downed dead trees; standing saplings; downed saplings/small dead trees; downed coarse wood pieces/downed branches; stumps; coppice stumps) and decay classes. The data set comprises plots from the \{SNFI3\} (3236 plots) and the \{SNFI4\} (1066 plots) from the Basque Country region. Due to the differing characteristics of deadwood stocks in managed forests, where a large number of plots have no deadwood (from 34% to 98% depending on the deadwood category considered), zero-inflated models were chosen as the modelling technique. From the different zero-inflated models analysed, zero-inflated Poisson model was the one that showed better results. Despite the natural variability inherent in deadwood in the analysed forests, good results were achieved for total deadwood stock models as a function of forest types as well as for deadwood dynamics models. These models provide a promising approach for deadwood estimation in the period between the NFI’s and they can also be employed by private forest owners in forest management practices, particularly in the case of forest certification.

For both villages smallholder capacity for future \{REDD\} + project adoption was found to require reinforcement to guarantee local feasibility of \{REDD\} + projects.

Artisanal miners in Cameroon and the Central African Republic (CAR) commonly make sacrifices to their god of diamonds, to improve fortunes. This study looks into ‘the other forces’; institutions that play a role in shaping the sector and its outcomes. These institutions comprise formal and informal institutions at a local, national, regional and international level. Although artisanal miners in \{TNS\} benefit by gaining cash income, this activity also carries risks as income is highly disparate and environmental impacts in this priority forest conservation area are expected to increase due to the growing competition over land use. It was concluded from a literature review, interviews and site visits that informal arrangements dominate the sector, especially in Cameroon, leading to poor relations between officials and miners and meaning that miners have few rights and no voice. The current institutional setup is inadequate to deal with current and anticipated social and environmental issues. Future interventions need to take into account the existing (local) types of organization, vulnerable groups, the interests of multiple actors and the fact that most miners are experienced but combine mining with other activities, such as agriculture, fishing and harvesting forest products. African initiatives concerning \{ASM\} offer opportunities to Cameroon and \{CAR\} to collaborate with other countries to combat similar issues. A regional integrated approach of both the forest and mining sector would be especially relevant for trans-boundary agreements, such as concerning the TNS, to reinforce positive outcomes for the landscape and the area's population.

Using data from Indonesia, we show that the choice of a forest definition can have a large impact on estimates of deforestation and forest degradation areas, on assessment of drivers of deforestation and on the development of a REL. The total area of deforestation between 2000 and 2009 was 4.9 million ha when using the \{FAO\} definition, 18% higher when using a ‘natural forest definition’ and 27% higher when using the national definition. Using the national and natural forest definitions, large areas (&gt;50%) were classified as shrubland after deforestation. We used regression models to predict future deforestation. Deforestation was much better predicted than degradation (R2 of 0.81 vs. 0.52), with the natural forest definition giving the best prediction. Apart from historical deforestation and initial forest cover, gross domestic product and human population were important predictors of future deforestation in Indonesia. Degradation processes were less well modeled and predictions relied on estimates of historical degradation and forest cover. "

Both kinds of schemes aim to achieve similar conservation outcomes, however, and generally function in analogous social, political and economic environments. Given the relative novelty of PES, what lessons can be learnt and applied from earlier initiatives? In this paper, we describe the evolution over the first 12 years (1989–2001) of Zimbabwe's Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE), a community-based natural resource management programme in which Rural District Councils, on behalf of communities on communal land, are granted the authority to market access to wildlife in their district to safari operators. These in turn sell hunting and photographic safaris to mostly foreign sport hunters and eco-tourists. The District Councils pay the communities a dividend according to an agreed formula. In practice, there have been some underpayments and frequent delays. During 1989–2001, \{CAMPFIRE\} generated over US$20 million of transfers to the participating communities, 89% of which came from sport hunting. The scale of benefits varied greatly across districts, wards and households. Twelve of the 37 districts with authority to market wildlife produced 97% of all \{CAMPFIRE\} revenues, reflecting the variability in wildlife resources and local institutional arrangements. The programme has been widely emulated in southern and eastern Africa. We suggest five main lessons for emerging \{PES\} schemes: community-level commercial transactions can seldom be pursued in isolation; non-differentiated payments weaken incentives; start-up costs can be high and may need to be underwritten; competitive bidding can allow service providers to hold on to rents; and schemes must be flexible and adaptive.

Our conclusions remain preliminary due to the relative paucity of published studies and lessons learned on what has worked and what has not in the context of integrated management for timber and NTFPs. We propose at least three ways where further research is merited. One, in improving ‘opportunistic’ situations driven by selective timber harvesting that also enhance \{NTFP\} values. Two, to explicitly enhance both timber and \{NTFP\} values through targeted management interventions. Three, to explicitly assess biophysical, social, regulatory and institutional aspects so that combined benefits are maximized. Interventions for enhancing the compatibility of timber and \{NTFP\} extraction must be scaled in relation to the size of the area being managed, applied timber harvesting intensities, and the dynamics of multi-actor, forest partnerships (e.g., between the private sector and local communities). In addition, training and education issues may have to be re-crafted with multiple-use management approaches inserted into tropical forestry curricula. "

Whether conservation strategies aimed at protecting carbon hotspots can provide co-benefits for biodiversity protection, and vice versa, highly depends on the extent to which carbon and biodiversity co-occur at the landscape level. We used field measurements and easily accessible explanatory variables to model aboveground carbon density, soil carbon density and tree alpha diversity (response variables) over a mostly forested area of northern Borneo. We assessed the spatial relationships between response variables and the spatial congruence of their hotspots. We found a significant positive relationship between aboveground carbon density and tree alpha diversity, and an above-than-expected-by-chance spatial congruence of their hotspots. Consequently, the protection of areas of high aboveground carbon density through financial mechanisms such as \{REDD\} + is expected to benefit tree diversity conservation in the study area. On the other hand, relationships between soil carbon density and both aboveground carbon density and tree alpha diversity were negative and spatial congruences null. Hotspots of soil carbon density, mostly located in peatlands, therefore need specific conservation regulations, which the current moratorium on peat conversion in Indonesia is a first step toward. "

Farmers located in the tail end of the irrigation system could lose an even greater share of their revenues. A more conservative increase in temperature could increase farmer income by as much as 46% with a 2.2° temperature increase and only 8% decline in irrigation water since some crops benefit from extended vegetation periods.

However, a fully reliable method to estimate carbon fixation capacity has yet to be established. In this study, net carbon fixation of a representative mangrove tree in South-East Asia, Rhizophora apiculata, was estimated. It was calculated with two different procedures; the gas exchange analysis and the growth curve analysis methods. The gas exchange analysis method is based on calculated carbon values of the difference between photosynthetic absorption and respiratory emission. These two parameters were calculated by using photosynthetic rates of single-leaves in response to light and temperature and respiratory rates of trunk and branch in response to temperature. These monthly values were adjusted with monthly average measurements of light intensity and temperature to improve estimation accuracy. The value of annual net carbon fixation for 3, 4, 5 and 9 year-old forests was estimated to be 2.5–30.5 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. The values with the temperature modification increased by 9.3–21.3%, compared to those of 2.2–25.2 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 without the temperature modification. However, it was found that these estimated values were significantly higher than the results produced by the growth curve analysis method, which produced 1.1–35.2 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. Results of this study show that further work is required to improve the estimation accuracy for both the gas exchange analysis and growth curve analysis methods. There is a particular need to take into account the respiratory carbon emissions from the plant root for the former method and determination of the maximum biomass at the mature tree phase for the latter method.

However, due to lack of legal alternatives, \{CSM\} is largely an informal activity. We rely on the theory of access to understand the mechanisms of access to timber resources, and to the income derived from their use, implemented by local actors to participate in the growth of this informal sector. Among eight common access mechanisms, two have played a particularly important role in the development of \{CSM\} for the benefit of rural economies. On the one hand, the growth of \{CSM\} was built on the customary tenure system, by valuing traditional knowledge and abiding by the traditional rules of access to trees. On the other hand, domestic timber markets remained accessible to independent operators in Cameroon, in Central African Republic and in Gabon, but the situation is less true in Republic of Congo and in Democratic Republic of Congo. Even if the financial impacts of \{CSM\} are substantial for rural economies in Central Africa, the application of the theory of access cannot conclude that this activity supports a decentralized, democratic and sustainable management of timber resources. Two elements lack in this analysis, the accountability of resource managers and the ecological sustainability of the harvest. These issues could be better addressed through a fine-tuned formalization of the \{CSM\} sector that would not compromise its present positive impact on rural people's livelihoods. "

This paper argues that certain international forest policies, although aiming at fostering well-intentioned reforms, may cause further expansion and power concentration of the already dominant large concession groupings and simultaneous marginalization and fragmentation of smaller forestry enterprises in the Congo Basin. We explore this argument through twenty-four semi-structured interviews with large and small scale enterprises to better understand how they think they may benefit (or not) from the changes foreseen by \{VPA\} implementation. The perceived benefits include the elimination of illegal players, a reduction in corruption and poverty, the promotion of business opportunities, and the valorization of investments. The way in which some of these benefits are expected to materialize may suggest a lack of congruence between the aims of Cameroon's \{VPA\} and private sector expectations. Not only may this lead to disappointment and a sense of demotivation among some of the main stakeholders, it also may lead to further fragmentation in the forest sector. The results therefore indicate that the success of \{VPA\} implementation in Cameroon depends on its ability to go beyond the timber legality verification for European markets argument and uphold its stated socioeconomic development objectives.

abstract = "Abstract Increasing oil palm (OP) plantation establishment on tropical peatlands over the last few decades has major implications for the global carbon (C) budget. This study quantified total and heterotrophic soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in an industrial \{OP\} plantation (7 year old, 149 trees ha− 1) on peat located in the eastern coast of the Sumatra Island (Jambi district), Indonesia, after two doses of nitrogen (N) fertilizer application at rates typical of local practice. The first dose applied in March 2012 (first Fertilization event FE) consisted of 0.5 kg urea per palm (equivalent to 371 kg N ha− 1 at the base of the palm which when extrapolated across the plantation was 35 kg N ha− 1) and the second dose applied in February 2013 (second FE) amounted to 1 kg urea per palm. Soil \{CO2\} fluxes were measured using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) in dark closed chambers. The measurements were made daily from 1 day before to 7 days after fertilizer application. Soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh) and total soil respiration (Rs) were measured in trenched plots (where root respiration was excluded) and non-trenched plots, respectively. Concomitant with \{CO2\} flux measurements, air and soil temperatures, rainfall and the water table level were measured. To estimate the fertilizer effect during the different times of the day, \{CO2\} fluxes were monitored every 3 h during a 24 h period on days 2 and 3 after fertilizer application during the second FE. Shortly after fertilizer application, substantial pulses of \{CO2\} were detected in the \{IRGA\} chambers where the fertilizer was applied. Even though the fertilized area represents 9.4% of the plantation area only, the impact of fertilizer application at the plantation scale on \{CO2\} fluxes was noteworthy when compared to non-fertilized control treatments. The Rs was 36.9 kg CO2–C ha− 1 (7 days)− 1 greater in the fertilized than in the non-fertilized plots after the first \{FE\} but no enhancement was observed after the second \{FE\} (− 72.2 kg CO2–C ha− 1 7 days− 1). The Rh was 340.5 and 98.9 kg CO2–C ha− 1 (7 days)− 1 greater in the fertilized than in the non-fertilized plots after the first and second FE, respectively. The larger \{CO2\} flux enhancement in Rh as compared to Rs may be the result of fertilizer uptake by the palm roots in the un-trenched plots, while in the trenched ones where roots were absent, microorganisms used the fertilizer to accelerate soil organic matter mineralization. Although the response of Rh to N addition and the priming effect were high as compared to results in the literature, the impacts were short-term only and may not have implications on the annual C budget of the plantation.

While the implementation of \{SVLK\} complies with the FLEGT-VPA, it has not dissolved pre-existing national systems for forest management and timber trade. Implementing \{SVLK\} standards amid multiple forest regimes causes redundancy of administrative procedures in forest management and timber trade in Indonesia. This redundancy, in turn, leads to decrease in cost efficiency, weak legitimation, and low effectiveness of the system, especially in community forests. "

However, lack of spatial differentiation in the targeting mechanism may lead to efficiency losses. Addressing this challenge, we construct an applied site selection tool, which takes into account three variables that vary in space: environmental services provided, risks of losing those services, and participation costs. Using data from Costa Rica's Nicoya Peninsula, we empirically test the tool's potential to increase the financial efficiency of the forest-focused \{PES\} program in place. Results show that, given a fixed budget, efficiency increases radically if per hectare payments are aligned to landowners' heterogeneity in participation costs, involving opportunity, transaction and direct costs of protection, respectively. Selecting sites based on environmental service potential also moderately increases efficiency. Overall additionality could in the best case be doubled, but remains generally limited due to current low deforestation risks prevailing in Costa Rica. To take advantage of the high efficiency potentials of flexible payments, we propose inverse auction systems as a cost-effective approach for the determination of micro-level participation costs. "

The study site was located in the south-Sudanese zone of Burkina Faso. Microbial respiration was measured as \{CO2\} evolution from soil samples incubated under laboratory conditions. Two microbial growth peaks were observed after addition of C plus P to the soil samples. When P was added together with C, the initial increase in the microbial respiration rate was higher than when N and C were added, and the maximum respiration rate was also reached earlier. We conclude that P limited the initial rate of respiration. Under the tree canopy the P and N availability, was higher under both F. albida and V. paradoxa trees, than in areas beyond their canopies. \{NPK\} fertilization in the field resulted in higher soil reserves of N and P, but these nutrients had low availability in the short term.

However, with an expected increase of tucumã plantations, the future of tucumã extractivism will depend on its capacity to produce fruits not only of sufficient quantity but also of consistently high quality. We studied the productivity and fruit quality of an extractively used population of tucumã palms in an area of 9 ha within a 25 ha shifting cultivation landscape composed of crop fields, homegardens, fallows and secondary forests in the proximity of Manaus during a 24-month period. The average density of tucumã palms was 30.4 ha−1, with highest values in secondary forests (43 ha−1) and lowest values in homegardens (19 ha−1). In contrast, the percentage of productive palms was higher in fields (93%) and homegardens (88%) than in fallows (66%) and secondary forests (50%), apparently as a combined effect of previous management and delayed reproduction under shade. Fruit yield per productive palm was significantly higher in homegardens (47 kg) than in fallows (16 kg) and secondary forests (15 kg), with intermediate values in the fields (27 kg). The most productive palms produced fruits of intermediate quality as measured through a taste index, while few palms producing high-quality fruits were also high yielding. A management plan was developed that allows maximization of fruit yields while progressively improving the quality characteristics of the extractively used population in an in situ domestication process. Being a low-cost and low-risk strategy, “improved extractivism” can be an appropriate way of growing the arboreal weed, tucumã, and can contribute to increased farm income while increasing the economic value of disturbed areas in the central Amazon.

This paper investigates the vulnerability of local settlements in the Cameroon mangrove forest zone to flooding, and improves understanding of perceptions and responses to past and current coastal flooding. Six communities in the coastal mangrove forest zone of the extreme SouthWest of Cameroon were investigated. A questionnaire was administered to a total of 200 individuals supplemented by other participatory rapid appraisal tools. The ground positions of the sampled sites as well as their altitudes were recorded for subsequent geospatial analysis.Statistical analysis was performed to show trends. The coordinates of the study sites were superimposed on base topographic maps of 1965, to investigate coastal changes over a period of 43 years. Results show that: (1) changes in coastal area have occurred in the past 43 years either through inland retreat or seaward shifts and accordingly, settlements are differentially vulnerable; (2) settlement submergence, house damage, and landscape deformation are the key impacts of flooding; (3) coastal flooding promotes the deforestation of mangrove forest for fuel wood; (4) current adaptive measures include retreat of settlement, abandonment, and house design modifications; and (5) most adaptive strategies are reactive individual actions which are likely inefficient and unsustainable from a longer term perspective given their limited scope of implementation. The paper recommends external support to improve adaptive capacity in mangrove settlements, review and improvement of existing policies, and development of integrated coastal management strategy for the region.

It comprises 69 management options and sub-options that are delivered primarily through the competitive ‘Rural Priorities scheme’. Understanding the spatial determinants of uptake and expenditure would assist policy-makers in guiding future policy targeting efforts for the rural environment. This study is unique in examining the spatial dependency and determinants of Scotland's agri-environmental measures and categorised options uptake and payments at the parish level. Spatial econometrics is applied to test the influence of 40 explanatory variables on farming characteristics, land capability, designated sites, accessibility and population. Results identified spatial dependency for each of the dependent variables, which supported the use of spatially-explicit models. The goodness of fit of the spatial models was better than for the aspatial regression models. There was also notable improvement in the models for participation compared with the models for expenditure. Furthermore a range of expected explanatory variables were found to be significant and varied according to the dependent variable used. The majority of models for both payment and uptake showed a significant positive relationship with \{SSSI\} (Sites of Special Scientific Interest), which are designated sites prioritised in Scottish policy. These results indicate that environmental targeting efforts by the government for \{AEP\} uptake in designated sites can be effective. However habitats outside of SSSI, termed here the ‘wider countryside’ may not be sufficiently competitive to receive funding in the current policy system. "

However, the interactions between soil respiration (Rs) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and their spatio-temporal dependence on environmental conditions and land management at field scale is not well understood. We performed repeated C flux measurement at 21 sites during the 2013 growing season in a temperate upland grassland in Germany, which was fertilized and cut three times according to the agricultural practice typical of the region. Repeated measurements included determination of NEE, Rs, leaf area index (LAI), meteorological conditions as well as physical and chemical soil properties. Temporal variability of Rs was controlled by air temperature, while \{LAI\} influenced the temporal variability of NEE. The three grass cuts reduced \{LAI\} and affected \{NEE\} markedly. More than 50% of \{NEE\} variability was explained by defoliation at field scale. Additionally, soil heterogeneity affected NEE, but to a lower extent (&gt;30%), while Rs remained unaffected. We conclude that grassland management (i.e., repeated defoliation) and soil heterogeneity affects the spatio-temporal variability of \{NEE\} at field scale. "

We carried out a factorial experiment with two levels to examine the effects of grazing, fire and selective tree cutting on herbaceous species richness, abundance and diversity on two sites in the Sudanian savanna-woodlands of Burkina Faso for 10 years (1994–2003). The results showed significant inter-annual variation in species richness, abundance and diversity at both sites (p&lt;0.001), while main or combined effects of fire, grazing and selective cutting were very limited and varied between life forms and sites. Grazing tended to favour the diversity of perennial grasses; fire tended to influence the richness of annual grasses and abundance and diversity of perennial grasses while selective tree cutting had no effect on any of the vegetation attributes assessed. The combined effect of grazing, fire and selective cutting tended to increase the diversity of forbs. In many cases, the responses of herbaceous species to treatments were clearer on the site with deeper soils than the one with shallow soils. Depending on the site and treatments, the inter-annual variation in vegetation attributes was partly related to amount and/or frequency of rainfall and partly to inter-annual variation in grazing or fire intensity. It can be concluded that both disturbances and climatic condition influence the structure and diversity of herbaceous flora in the Sudanian savanna-woodland ecosystem. The responses were site-specific, which accentuates the importance of landscape-scale approaches to understand the impacts of disturbances on composition, structure and diversity of savanna ecosystems.

The Ranomafana forest area provides a variety of benefits that contribute considerably to local inhabitants' livelihoods and well-being. Changes in ecosystem service flows alter the provision of many important ecosystem services at the local level, which is likely to affect local livelihoods negatively and increase local vulnerability and inequality. The findings indicate the presence of trade-offs between types of ecosystem services and between different societal goals, namely conservation and development. Benefit trade-offs also occur within and between beneficiary groups and across spatial and temporal scales. Although conservation might prove beneficial for local people in the long run, its immediate local costs are high. The findings reveal the importance of integrating local perceptions of ecosystem services into conservation planning. In addition, there is a need for further negotiations of the trade-offs between ecosystem services, conservation and development in Ranomafana. "

Using satellite image analyses together with historical information, population census data and interviews with local informants, we analysed the drivers of forest cover change in three periods between 1973 and 2009 on Mt Elgon, Uganda. More than 25% of the forest cover of the Mt Elgon Forest Reserve/National Park was lost in 35 years. In periods when law enforcement was weaker, forest clearing was greatest in areas combining a dense population and people who had become relatively wealthy from coffee production. Once stronger law enforcement was re-established forest recovered in most places. Collaborative management agreements between communities and the park authorities were associated with better forest recovery, but deforestation continued in other areas with persistent conflicts about park boundaries. These conflicts were associated with profitability of annual crops and political interference. The interplay of factors originating at larger scales (government policy, market demand, political agendas and community engagement) resulted in a “back-and-forth” of clearing and regrowth. Our study reveals that the context (e.g. law enforcement, collaborative management, political interference) under which drivers such as population, wealth, market access and commodity prices operate, rather than the drivers per se, determines impacts on forest cover. Conservation and development interventions need to recognize and address local factors within the context and conditionalities generated by larger scale external influences. "

All trees &gt;25 cm were monitored in 25.4 ha plots of each treatment, each with a subplot of 5.25 ha for trees &gt;10 cm dbh. The commercial timber volumes in felled trees were 38.9 and 37.4 m3 ha−1 in the \{RIL\} and \{CL\} plots, respectively, but the extracted volumes were 38.6 and 29.7 m3 ha−1, respectively. Immediately after logging, plots subjected to \{RIL\} and \{CL\} lost 17% and 26% of their above-ground biomass, respectively. Over the 16 years after logging, the average annual increments in above-ground biomass (recruitment plus residual tree growth minus mortality) were 2.8 Mg ha−1 year−1 in the \{RIL\} plot but only 0.5 Mg ha−1 year−1 in the \{CL\} plot. By 16 years post-logging, the \{RIL\} plot recovered 100% of its original above-ground biomass while the \{CL\} plot recovered only 77%; over the same period, biomass in the control plot maintained 96% of its initial stock. These findings reinforce the claim that conversion from \{CL\} to \{RIL\} would represent an efficient forest-based strategy to mitigate climate change under the REDD+ and would be an important step towards sustainable forest management.

We assessed basal area (BA), stem density, diameter at breast height (dbh) and indicators of human activity in 343 plots in four study sites, on transects running inwards from the boundary of the park. Mt Elgon hosts the only remaining natural forest in a densely populated region (150–1000 p/km2). All study sites suffered past encroachment for agriculture and were in various stages of recovery or renewed-clearing at the time of the study. Areas recovering from encroachment had lower mean \{BA\} (BA = 3–11 m2/ha), dbh and often also lower stem densities than forest that had never been cleared (BA = 21–43 m2/ha), even 35 years after abandonment and with restoration planting. Human impacts were found beyond 2 km into the park. Although most activities decreased with distance inside the boundary, their prevalence varied among sites. High coefficients of variation in \{BA\} (Cv = 0.8–1.1) and stem density (Cv = 1.0–2.2) within sites, together with the evidence of sustained human activities, suggest that forest use histories strongly influenced local forest structure. Mean \{BA\} increased with distance inside the boundary in all sites, but stem densities reflected more complex patterns. Large trees (dbh ⩾ 20 cm) were most affected by former clearing for agriculture. The collection of stems used as crop-supports reduced regeneration and the density of smaller stems at one site. In another site, charcoal making was associated with the smallest mean \{BA\} and marked variability in forest structure. Grazed forest consisted of large trees with very little regeneration. On forest margins in two sites grazing, generally together with fire and tree-cutting, had eroded the forest edge and prevented regeneration. Human impacts as well as natural gradients had major impacts on species richness patterns. Several areas in intermediate states of disturbance showed higher tree species richness than either old-growth forest or more severely degraded areas. This study illustrates the fine scale variation due to local impacts within one forest. "

abstract = "Payments for environmental services (PES) have attracted increasing interest as a mechanism to translate external, non-market values of the environment into real financial incentives for local actors to provide environmental services (ES). In this introductory paper, we set the stage for the rest of this Special Issue of Ecological Economics by reviewing the main issues arising in \{PES\} design and implementation and discussing these in the light of environmental economics. We start with a discussion of \{PES\} definition and scope. We proceed to review some of the principal dimensions and design characteristics of \{PES\} programs and then analyze how \{PES\} compares to alternative policy instruments. Finally, we examine in detail two important aspects of \{PES\} programs: their effectiveness and their distributional implications. \{PES\} is not a silver bullet that can be used to address any environmental problem, but a tool tailored to address a specific set of problems: those in which ecosystems are mismanaged because many of their benefits are externalities from the perspective of ecosystem managers. \{PES\} is based on the beneficiary-pays rather than the polluter-pays principle, and as such is attractive in settings where \{ES\} providers are poor, marginalized landholders or powerful groups of actors. An important distinction within \{PES\} is between user-financed \{PES\} in which the buyers are the users of the ES, and government-financed \{PES\} in which the buyers are others (typically the government) acting on behalf of \{ES\} users. In practice, \{PES\} programs differ in the type and scale of \{ES\} demand, the payment source, the type of activity paid for, the performance measure used, as well as the payment mode and amount. The effectiveness and efficiency of \{PES\} depends crucially on program design. "

To date, however, few efforts have been made to systematically compare \{PES\} experiences. Drawing on the wealth of case studies in this Special Issue, we synthesize the information presented, according to case characteristics with respect to design, costs, environmental effectiveness, and other outcomes. \{PES\} programs often differ substantially one from the other. Some of the differences reflect adaptation of the basic concept to very different ecological, socioeconomic, or institutional conditions; others reflect poor design, due either to mistakes or to the need to accommodate political pressures. We find significant differences between user-financed \{PES\} programs, in which funding comes from the users of the \{ES\} being provided, and government-financed programs, in which funding comes from a third party. The user-financed programs in our sample were better targeted, more closely tailored to local conditions and needs, had better monitoring and a greater willingness to enforce conditionality, and had far fewer confounding side objectives than government-financed programs. We finish by outlining some perspectives on how both user- and government-financed \{PES\} programs could be made more effective and cost-efficient. "

abstract = "In West Africa policies for prescribed early fire and livestock grazing in the savanna woodlands are rarely based on long-term experimental studies. The inherently different management characteristics and their effects on the vegetation dynamics make landscape degradation a contentious issue. The effects of grazing intensity were investigated by a comparison of non-grazed areas, lightly grazed areas, moderately grazed areas, heavily grazed areas and very heavily grazed areas that received one of two fire treatments: early burning and fire protection in a long-term 12-year study. The parameters assessed reflected changes in herbaceous plant cover, biomass as well as soil physical and hydrological properties. The main findings were by and large specific for the grazing level. This supports the argument for devolution of management responsibility to the local level where there is indigenous site-specific knowledge but at the same time insufficient management capacity. A comparison of composite soil samples taken at a depth of 0–10 cm did not differentiate significantly between treatments. This is probably because the composite soil sampling procedure hid the properties of the top first few centimeters. Grazing pressure had a tendency to reduce total above ground biomass (p = 0.081). This was related to increased biomass removal and the trampling pressure (static load) exerted by the animals. The infiltration measurements indicated that the deleterious impact of cattle trampling increased as stocking rate increased. Livestock grazing significantly (p = 0.038) lowered the infiltrability. Prescribed early fire had a tendency (p = 0.073) to reduce the soil water infiltration rate. The subplots subjected to prescribed burning had a lower steady state infiltration rate compared to unburnt areas (means of 49.2 ± 27.5 mm h−1 versus 78 ± 70.5 mm h−1 for burnt and unburnt subplots, respectively). A partial least squares projection to latent structures showed that 34% of the steady state infiltrability was explained by the stocking rate and soil organic matter. Also all soil characteristics were significantly connected to steady state infiltrability suggesting that they are related to the soil hydrological response to trampling. From a management perspective, adoption of a short duration grazing system should avoid high stocking rates because they may adversely affect soil infiltrability, increase susceptibility to erosion in the savannas and decrease biomass productivity.

Hampering this is the fact that the full scope of the threats faced by specific mangrove forests is not yet well documented. Amongst some uncertainties is the nature of the relationship/interaction of mangroves with climate driven perturbations prevalent in their habitat such as coastal floods. We investigated the relationship between coastal flooding and mangrove forest stabilization, identify perceptions of flood risk and responses to offset identified effects. Random household surveys were carried out within four communities purposively sampled within the Cap Cameroon. Coastal changes were investigated over a period of 43 years (1965–2008). Seasonal flooding improved access to mangrove forests and hence promoted their exploitation for non-timber forest products (NTFPs) such as fuel wood and mangrove poles. 989 ha of mangrove forests were estimated to be lost over a period of 43 years in Cap Cameroon with implications on forest resources base, ecosystem stability, and livelihoods. Alternative livelihood activities were found to be carried out to moderate interruptions in fishing, with associated implications for mangrove forest dynamics. Respondents were of the opinion that risks associated with floods and mangrove deforestation will pose a major challenge for sustainable management of mangroves. These locally relevant perceptions and responses should however enable the identification of pertinent needs, challenges and opportunities to inform and orient effective decision-making, and to facilitate the development and participation in adaptive management strategies.

Further research for understanding institutional arrangements that derive from local governance in favor of tropical forest conservation is recommended. "

But soil erosion (one component of land degradation) jeopardizes the sustainable delivery of these services worldwide, and particularly in the humid tropics where erosion potential is high due to heavy rainfall. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment pointed out the role of poor land-use and management choices in increasing land degradation. We hypothesized that land use has a limited influence on soil erosion provided vegetation cover is developed enough or good management practices are implemented. We systematically reviewed the literature to study how soil and vegetation management influence soil erosion control in the humid tropics. More than 3600 measurements of soil loss from 55 references covering 21 countries were compiled. Quantitative analysis of the collected data revealed that soil erosion in the humid tropics is dramatically concentrated in space (over landscape elements of bare soil) and time (e.g. during crop rotation). No land use is erosion-prone per se, but creation of bare soil elements in the landscape through particular land uses and other human activities (e.g. skid trails and logging roads) should be avoided as much as possible. Implementation of sound practices of soil and vegetation management (e.g. contour planting, no-till farming and use of vegetative buffer strips) can reduce erosion by up to 99%. With limited financial and technical means, natural resource managers and policy makers can therefore help decrease soil loss at a large scale by promoting wise management of highly erosion-prone landscape elements and enhancing the use of low-erosion-inducing practices.

However, there is a lack of knowledge on optimum spacing and on thinning regimes, in contrast to high expectations of final mean diameter at breast height (DBH) between 35 and 40 cm and stand volumes between 200 and 300 m3 ha−1. The aim of this study was to establish guidelines for plantation management in terms of appropriate intensity and timing of the first thinning (from approximately 4 thinnings recommended in 20–25-year-old rotation management systems). A thinning trial was established in a 4-year-old T. grandis plantation that was originally established with initial spacing of 1600 trees ha−1. The experimental design consisted of randomized complete blocks, with eight treatments and three replicates. Each treatment consisted of 80 trees in square blocks of 500 m2. The treatments were of different thinning intensities (from 25% to 60% removal of standing trees, and the unthinned control) applied at two timings (at the ages of 4 and 6 years, and one treatment applied at the ages of 4 and 5 years) and an unthinned control in each replicate. The trees in each treatment were measured annually between age 4 and 8 years. At the age of 8 years, the average \{DBH\} for all treatments was 17.5 cm (15.2–20.1 cm) and the total height averaged 18.8 m (17.7–19.5 m). The total volume (Vo) varied from 90 to 200 m3 ha−1, at corresponding \{BA\} between 12 and 28 m2 ha−1.The 60% thinning intensity applied at the age of 4 years, and the two consecutive 25% thinnings at the ages of 4 and 5 years gave the highest individual tree growth, while the control was the lowest. The current annual increment (CAI) of \{DBH\} was highest in the 40 and 60% thinned treatments. The \{CAI\} of \{DBH\} and \{BA\} decreased rapidly with increasing age in every treatment. The values of \{CAI\} of Vo varied between 9 and 39 m3 ha−1 year−1. The high values of \{CAI\} of Vo were obtained at \{BA\} between 18 and 20 m2 ha−1. At \{BA\} of 18 m2 ha−1, Vo was between 120 and 150 m3 ha−1 on a stand conformed by trees with an average \{DBH\} between 17 and 20 cm. The recovery of \{BA\} and Vo was faster in the treatments carried out at the age of 4 years than at 6 years, when measured 2 years after the thinning. In terms of the remaining stand volume (after thinning), tree size and rate of recovery, the best thinning was at the age of 4 years removing 40–60% of the trees, or consecutively at the ages of 4 and 5 years removing 25% of standing trees in each year. Results of this thinning trial indicate that T. grandis plantations can be managed towards the production of high individual tree growth or towards the production of high stand growth, by means of varying the intensity and timing of the thinning interventions through rotation.

This paper estimates willingness to pay (WTP) higher fees from hydrological-service buyers in an ongoing \{PES\} initiative in an Andean watershed in Colombia, where small, flat user payments have been introduced. \{ES\} users fall into two highly heterogeneous categories: smallholder peasants and recreational-house owners. We perform a contingent valuation analysis in a representative sample of 218 households. For improved water services, \{ES\} buyers on average are willing to pay monthly about US$1 premium over current flat \{PES\} rate. Users’ heterogeneity, however, affects significantly this outcome: while recreational-house owners are willing to pay monthly on average US$1.61 more than the current fee, smallholders only US$0.41. Spatial variables, such as distance to the water distribution point and to the town center, importantly influence WTP. Results may help designing user-driven \{PES\} schemes in line with efficiency and equity objectives. "

We investigated subsistence hunting patterns across a highly heterogeneous landscape mosaic in the Brazilian Amazon, where hunters from three villages had access to primary forest, active and fallow agricultural fields, and active and fallow Eucalyptus plantations. Landscape composition and the areas used by hunters were defined using a remote-sensing approach combined with mapping. We quantified hunting effort accounting for the availability and spatial distribution of each habitat. Overall, 71% of the kills were sourced in primary forest, but hunting in primary forest, which was often combined with other extractive activities (such as Brazil nut harvesting), yielded the lowest catch-per-unit-effort of all habitats. Hunting effort per unit area was highest in fallow fields, followed by primary forest, and both of these habitats were over-represented within village hunting catchments when compared to the composition of the available landscape. Active and fallow fields sourced a limited number of species known to be resilient to hunting, but hunting had additional benefits through crop-raider control. In contrast, hunting pressure in active and fallow plantations was low, despite a high catch-per-unit-effort, presumably because there were limited additional benefits from visiting these habitats. These results indicate that large-scale tree plantation and forest regeneration schemes have limited conservation potential for large vertebrates, as they support few forest specialists and fail to attract hunters away from primary forest.

Administrative capacity examines development of administrative competence to implement MRV. Good governance examines whether countries espouses norms of good governance in their \{MRV\} systems. We apply these dimensions to assess and compare progress in 13 REDD+ countries, based on a review of national and international documents. Findings show that REDD+ countries have high to very high ownership of technical methods. However, majority ranks only low to moderate on administrative capacity and good governance.

In Nepal, community based ecosystem management has been widely adopted as a way to secure local management and empowerment, but local knowledge, perceptions and values of ecosystem change and services are often ignored, and perhaps inadequately understood, in decision-making processes at district or national level. Our objective therefore was to develop a multi-method approach to support mapping of ecosystem services and assessing their local values. Local perceptions of ecosystem use, change and values were identified using participatory mapping, key informant and focus group discussions, and an extensive household survey carried out in the upstream Koshi River basin. Results were cross-validated with scientific literature, statistics and remote sensing data. Key ecosystem services identified are water, agricultural produce, and various forest products, most of which show a declining trend. We demonstrate that the use of different methods and levels of input results in different and complementary types of insights and detail needed for balanced and informed decision-making regarding sustainable management of \{ESs\} to secure current and future livelihoods and ecosystem functioning.

We propose a conceptual framework linking tenure with REDD+ effectiveness, taking into account that tenure security equally protects the right to reduce and to increase emissions. Survey-based research, at five emerging REDD+ sites in Indonesia in 2010, revealed that tenure is ambiguous and contested, thus insecure. Low dependence on forest-based livelihoods suggests limited interest in reducing emissions. Securing community tenure does not necessarily lead to REDD+ effectiveness unless it can compete with other economic interests that emit GHGs. "

We find that both schemes have been relatively effective in reaching their environmental objectives, in terms of having probably high additionality levels and low leakage effects.

Although neither scheme has targeted poverty alleviation or other side objectives, both are likely to have improved \{PES\} recipients' welfare, mostly through higher incomes.

There was a positive and significant correlation between the proportion of trees damaged by felling and the density of trees felled. Logging intensity ranged from 1 to 17 trees ha−1(9–247 m3 ha−1) and averaged 9 trees ha−1 (86.9 m3 ha−1). The study has shown that with \{RIL\} techniques, logging damage on the original stand can be significantly reduced by 50% compared with conventional logging. However, this 50% reduction in logging damage, was dependent on the felling intensity. With a felling intensity of 8 stems ha−1 or less, \{RIL\} techniques only damaged 25% of the original tree population whereas 48% were damaged with conventional techniques. Above this felling intensity (i.e. 8 stems ha−1), the effectiveness of \{RIL\} in limiting forest damage was significantly reduced, mainly because of the increasing felling damage. Moreover, the removal of all harvestable timber trees, leaving only few potential crop trees, will result in a seriously depleted residual stand. Because of the high damage involved by high felling intensity, leaving few potential crop trees, and the yield capacity of the remaining stand, acceptable harvesting volume will not be reached within the felling rotation of 35 years. It is concluded that silvicultural system based on diameter limit alone, as is the Indonesian system (TPTI), cannot be compatible with sustainability and more sophisticated harvested-selection rules are needed.

abstract = "AbstractEthnopharmacological relevance After almost 50 years of international trade in wild harvested medicinal bark from Africa and Madagascar, the example of Prunus africana holds several lessons for both policy and practice in the fields of forestry, conservation and rural development. Due to recent \{CITES\} restrictions on P. africana exports from Burundi, Kenya and Madagascar, coupled with the lifting of the 2007 European Union (EU) ban in 2011, Cameroon's share of the global P. africana bark trade has risen from an average of 38% between 1995 and 2004, to 72.6% (658.6 metric tons) in 2012. Cameroon is therefore at the center of this international policy arena. Methods and materials This paper draws upon several approaches, combining knowledge in working with P. africana over a 30-year period with a thorough literature review and updated trade data with “ground-truthing” in the field in 2013 and 2014. This enabled the construction of a good perspective on trade volumes (1991–2012), bark prices (and value-chain data) and the gaps between research reports and practice. Two approaches provided excellent lenses for a deeper understanding of policy failure and the “knowing-doing gap” in the P. africana case. A similar approach to Médard's (1992) analyses of power, politics and African development was taken and secondly, studies of commodity chains that assess the power relations that coalesce around different commodities (Ribot, 1998; Ribot and Peluso, 2003). Results Despite the need to conserve genetically and chemically diverse P. africana, wild populations are vulnerable, even in several “protected areas” in Burundi, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo and in the forest reserves of Madagascar. Secondly, hopes of decentralized governance of this forest product are misplaced due to elite capture, market monopolies and subsidized management regimes. At the current European price, for P. africana bark (US$6 per kg) for example, the 2012 bark quota (658.675 t) from Cameroon alone was worth over US$3.9 million, with the majority of this accruing to a single company. In contrast to lucrative bark exports, the livelihood benefits and financial returns to local harvesters from wild harvest are extremely low. For example, in 2012, the 48 active harvesters working within Mount Cameroon National Park (MCNP) received less than 1US$ per day from bark harvests, due to a net bark price of 0.33 US$ per kg (or 43% of the farm gate price for wild harvested bark). In addition, the costs of inventory, monitoring and managing sustainable wild harvests are far greater than the benefits to harvesters. Conclusion Without the current substantial international donor subsidies, sustainable harvest cannot be sustained. What is required to supply the current and future market is to develop separate, traceable P. africana bark supply chains based on cultivated stocks. On-farm production would benefit thousands of small-scale farmers cultivating P. africana, including local women, for whom wild harvesting is too onerous. This change requires \{CITES\} and \{EU\} support and would catalyze P. africana cultivation in across several montane African countries and Madagascar, increasing farm-gate prices to harvesters compared to economic returns from wild harvest.

The neotropical palm Acrocomia aculeata is currently being promoted as a novel sustainable biomass feedstock, particularly for bioenergy, but only little is known about the palm’s ecological requirements. Based on a comprehensive literature and database search for recorded occurrences of A. aculeata in Latin America, we computed an ecological niche modeling to determine the palm’s potential distribution area based on climatic and soil variables. We subsequently considered current land cover and predicted future climate change scenarios to discuss the cultivation potential of A. aculeata within its possible distribution area. The results revealed a large potential to cultivate A. aculeata in Latin America under current abiotic environmental conditions. The two core distribution regions identified were (1) Central America including the Caribbean, northern Colombia and Venezuela, and (2) southern Brazil and eastern Paraguay. A considerable proportion of the medium to highly suitable growing areas were found to be currently used for agricultural production or covered by land types with high conservation and carbon sequestration value. Applying the model under the IPCC’s \{A2A\} ‘business as usual’ emission scenario suggested that by 2080 the vast majority of suitable growing areas severely decline in extent or disappear entirely. Our ecological niche modeling thus shows that despite the palm’s high cultivation potential, a sustainable deployment of A. aculeata requires a precautious, evidence-based approach. "

The review of 126, mainly production-oriented, farm household models, showed that integrated analyses of food security at the farm household level are scarce. Some models deal with elements of food security, but the models covered in this review are weak on decision-making theory and risk analyses. These aspects need urgent attention for dealing with more complex adaptation and mitigation questions, in the face of climatic change. Approaches that make use of decision making theory and combine the strengths of (dynamic) mathematical programming and expert systems decision models seem promising in this respect. They could support the robust evaluation of climate change impacts and adaptive management options on smallholder systems. "

Both pre-treatments lead to increased yields in the saccharification of Eucalyptus globulus; but results have been better with steam pre-treatments, despite the more accessible surface of exploded samples. The reason for this finding could be enzymatic inhibition: steam explosion causes a more extensive extraction of hemicelluloses and releases a greater amount of degradation products which can inhibit enzymatic action. Enzymatic inhibition is also dependent on the amount and chemical structure of lignin, which was also a contributing factor to the lower enzymatic yields obtained with the most severe pre-treatment. Thus, the highest yields (46.7% glucose and 73.4% xylose yields) were obtained after two cycle of steam treatment, of 5 and 3 min, at 183 °C. "

In the present paper, we present a geostatistical approach for the prediction of diameter distributions. The advantage of the proposed method over traditional prediction systems is that it is possible to estimate the diameter distribution at locations, where no secondary variables are measured. The Weibull and the Chaudhry–Ahmad probability density functions were fitted by maximum likelihood to the diameter distribution of 176 plots of pure, even aged stands of Pinus pinaster Ait. located in the province of Segovia of central Spain. Data were taken from the Second National Forest Inventory of Spain. The spatial “behaviour” of the parameters of the density functions was studied by variogram analysis and the results showed that all parameters were spatially correlated to some extent. Kriging was used for the interpolation of parameters of the diameter distributions over the study area. Cross-validation was performed separately for every parameter. Results showed that the Weibull function gave smaller relative bias in the prediction of the diameter sum. Additionally, the likelihood ratio was used to compare the fit of the density functions. This ratio was computed twice: firstly when parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood and secondly, when parameters were predicted by kriging-cross-validation. The Chaudhry–Ahmad function fitted better the actual diameter distributions when maximum-likelihood was used for parameter estimation. Nevertheless, the fit of the Weibull was much better when kriging was used for parameter prediction. The prediction of the diameter distribution was made using data from the National Forest Inventory, therefore predictions should be used for regional planning and estimation of forest resources at this spatial scale (national). For forest management purposes at a local scale, data sources taken at fine spatial scales should be preferred. The spatial discontinuities that the forest compartments introduce during kriging interpolation are finally discussed and some solutions are proposed. "

Using data on agro-pastoral households from northern Kenya, we explore whether migration of household members enhances adoption of agricultural innovations that aim to provide protection against weather shocks. Specifically, we seek to test whether migration and adaptation are complementary mechanisms to protect the household against adverse shocks, or whether they are substitutes. Do remittances relax capital constraints and facilitate the uptake of adaptive measures, or do they render adaptation superfluous? Our data provide suggestive evidence that remittances from migrant household members may relax capital constraints, and that remittances are an important mechanism linking migration to adoption, enabling the uptake of new technologies that involve change in activities or high costs. Specifically, migrant households adopt more adaptive measures (promoting self-protection), and we document some support for the hypothesis that this is especially the case for high-cost adaptations such as the purchasing of drought tolerant livestock. These findings suggest that migration and local innovation are complementary rather than substitutive mechanisms of self-protection for pastoral households in the semi-arid lands of northern Kenya. Households who have at least one member who has migrated are able to overcome barriers to employ high-cost agricultural innovations–through using remittances received—thus enhancing their self-protection against climate change related shocks.

In this study, we examine the extent to which exotic gene flow from conspecific plantations of mesic origin impacts pre- and post-dispersal fitness, seedling phenotype, and quantitative genetic variation of the relict southernmost native population of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris var. nevadensis Christ). For this purpose, we conducted controlled pollinations to obtain native, exotic and intraspecific hybrid progenies for testing seed viability and seedling performance under experimental common-garden conditions mimicking the severe summer drought in the native population's environment. Proportion of aborted seeds was markedly higher in exotic (&gt; 60%) than in intraspecific hybrid (~ 24%) and native (18%) progenies. Seed germination time and rate were similar across genetic crosses. Hybrid and exotic seedlings died on average 1.2 and 0.8 days earlier than local progenies when exposed to the drought treatment. Cumulative mortality rate was positively associated to biomass allocation in needles, suggesting that higher investment in needles is maladaptive in dry environments for P. sylvestris, probably because of increased total transpiration. Native progenies harbored higher genetic variation than exotic progenies, but similar to hybrids for most phenotypic traits, suggesting low impact of exotic gene flow on the levels of heritable genetic variation of the relict population. To the extent that our results held in natural conditions, they suggest that natural selection in the relict's dry natural environment could potentially hamper the effective establishment of exotic genes via seed and pollen dispersal from the plantations, and that exotic hybridization would not significantly affect the potential of early recruits in response to selection.

abstract = "Abstract Vulnerability analysis is essential for targeting adaptation options to impacts of climate variability and change, particularly in diverse systems with limited resources such as smallholder farms in sub-Saharan Africa. To investigate the nature and sources of vulnerability of smallholder farmers to climate variability and change, we analysed long term climate data and interviewed farmers individually and in groups in Makoni and Hwedza districts in eastern Zimbabwe. Farmers’ perceptions of changes in climate characteristics matched the recorded data. Total seasonal rainfall has not changed, but variability in the rainfall distribution within seasons has increased. The mean daily minimum temperature increased by 0.2 °C per decade in both Makoni and Hwedza. The mean daily maximum temperature increased by 0.5 °C per decade in Hwedza. The number of days with temperatures &gt;30 °C also increased in Hwedza. Farmers indicated that livestock production was sensitive to drought due to lack of feed, affecting resource-endowed farmers, who own relatively large herds of cattle. Crop production was more sensitive to increased rainfall variability, largely affecting farmers with intermediate resource endowment. Availability of wild fruits and social safety nets were affected directly and indirectly by extreme temperatures and increased rainfall variability, impacting on the livelihoods of resource-constrained farmers. There was no evidence of a simple one-to-one relationship between vulnerability and farmer resource endowment, suggesting that vulnerability to climate variability and change is complex and not simply related to assets. Alongside climate variability and change, farmers were also faced with biophysical and socioeconomic challenges such as lack of fertilizers, and these problems had strong interactions with adaptation options to climate change. Diversifying crops and cultivars, staggering planting date and managing soil fertility were identified as the major adaptation options to stabilize yields against increased rainfall variability. There is need to evaluate the identified adaptation options on farm and with the participation of farmers to provide empirical evidence on the best options for different households. "

The objective of this study was to evaluate emergence, yield and financial benefits of maize, finger millet and sorghum, planted at different dates and managed with variable soil nutrient inputs in order to develop adaptation options for stabilizing food production and income for smallholder households in the face of climate change and variability. Field experiments with maize, finger millet and sorghum were conducted in farmers’ fields in Makoni and Hwedza districts in eastern Zimbabwe for three seasons: 2009/10, 2010/11 and 2011/12. Three fertilization rates: high (90 kg N ha−1, 26 kg P ha−1, 7 t ha−1 manure), low (35 kg N ha−1, 14 kg P ha−1, 3 t ha−1 manure) and a control (zero fertilization); and three planting dates: early, normal and late, were compared. Crop emergence for the unfertilized finger millet and sorghum was &lt;15% compared with &gt;70% for the fertilized treatments. In contrast, the emergence for maize (a medium-maturity hybrid cultivar, SC635), was &gt;80% regardless of the amount of fertilizer applied. Maize yield was greater than that of finger millet and sorghum, also in the season (2010/11) which had poor rainfall distribution. Maize yielded 5.4 t ha−1 compared with 3.1 t ha−1 for finger millet and 3.3 t ha−1 for sorghum for the early plantings in the 2009/10 rainfall season in Makoni, a site with relatively fertile soils. In the poorer 2010/11 season, early planted maize yielded 2.4 t ha−1, against 1.6 t ha−1 for finger millet and 0.4 t ha−1 for sorghum in Makoni. Similar yield trends were observed on the nutrient-depleted soils in Hwedza, although yields were less than those observed in Makoni. All crops yielded significantly more with increasing rates of fertilization when planting was done early or in what farmers considered the ‘normal window’. Crops planted early or during the normal planting window gave comparable yields that were greater than yields of late-planted crops. Water productivity for each crop planted early or during the normal window increased with increase in the amount of fertilizer applied, but differed between crop type. Maize had the highest water productivity (8.0 kg dry matter mm−1 ha−1) followed by sorghum (4.9 kg mm−1 ha−1) and then finger millet (4.6 kg mm−1 ha−1) when a high fertilizer rate was applied to the early-planted crop. Marginal rates of return for maize production were greater for the high fertilization rate (&gt;50%) than for the low rate (&lt;50%). However, the financial returns for finger millet were more attractive for the low fertilization rate (&gt;100%) than for the high rate (&lt;100%). Although maize yield was greater compared with finger millet, the latter had a higher content of calcium and can be stored for up to five years. The superiority of maize, in terms of yields, over finger millet and sorghum, suggests that the recommendation to substitute maize with small grains may not be a robust option for adaptation to increased temperatures and more frequent droughts likely to be experienced in Zimbabwe and other parts of southern Africa.

Especially in the tropics where forests are declining at a rapid rate, national forest monitoring systems capable of reliably estimating forest cover, forest cover change and carbon stock change are of vital importance. As a large number of tropical countries had limited capacity in the past to implement such a system, capacity building efforts are now ongoing to strengthen the technical and political skillsets necessary to implement national forest monitoring at institutional levels. This paper assesses the current status and recent changes in national forest monitoring and reporting capacities in 99 tropical countries, using the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) 2015 data, complemented with \{FRA\} 2010 and \{FRA\} 2005 data. Three indicators “Forest area change monitoring and remote sensing capacities”, “Forest inventory capacities” and “Carbon pool reporting capacities” were used to assess the countries’ capacities for the years 2005, 2010 and 2015 and the change in capacities between 2005–2010 and 2010–2015. Forest area change monitoring and remote sensing capacities improved considerably between 2005 and 2015. The total tropical forest area that is monitored with good to very good forest area change monitoring and remote sensing capacities increased from 69% in 2005 to 83% in 2015. This corresponds to 1435 million ha in 2005 and 1699 million ha in 2015. This effect is related to more free and open remote sensing data and availability of techniques to improve forest area change monitoring. The total tropical forest area that is monitored with good to very good forest inventory capacities increased from 38% in 2005 to 66% in 2015. This corresponds to 785 million ha in 2005 and 1350 million ha in 2015. Carbon pool reporting capacities did not show as much improvement and the majority of countries still report at Tier 1 level. This indicates the need for greater emphasis on producing accurate emission factors at Tier 2 or Tier 3 level and improved greenhouse gases reporting. It is further shown that there was a positive adjustment in the net change in forest area where countries with lower capacities in the past had the tendency to overestimate the area of forest loss. The results emphasized the effectiveness of capacity building programmes (such as those by \{FAO\} and REDD+ readiness) but also the need for continued capacity development efforts. It is important for countries to maintain their forest monitoring system and update their inventories on a regular basis. This will further improve accuracy and reliability of data and information on forest resources and will provide countries with the necessary input to refine policies and decisions and to further improve forest management.

But mitigation cost assessments have featured opportunity costs, neglecting policy implementation costs. Here we use official data to identify the Brazilian federal government's operational and institutional budgets related to forest conservation policies implemented from 2000 to 2014. We distinguish the allocated and executed budgets of these policies, and provide scenario-based estimates of their cost-effectiveness. On average, Brazil spent US$ 1 billion/year on forest conservation policies at the federal level. Brazil's substantial reduction in annual forest loss after 2004 was accompanied by a higher operational budget execution of disincentive-based policy instruments, and an absolute increase in both allocated and executed institutional budgets. The post-2004 successful mitigation effort represented additional implementation costs to the Brazilian federal government of US$ 308–923/ha of avoided deforestation, or US$ 0.87–2.60/tCO2 of avoided emissions. Factoring in also approximate municipal and state expenditures, these costs increase to US$ 385–1153/ha or US$ 1.09–3.25/tCO2. We conclude that implementations costs are non-trivial in size, including compared to estimates of land users' opportunity costs. This has important implications for \{REDD\} + policy design, in the sense that implementation costs need to be adequately considered. "

Tropical deforestation and other land use changes contributed about 20 percent of the global anthropogenic \{CO2\} emissions during the 1990s. The main focus of the article is on the driving forces of deforestation. The starting point is to investigate which factors make deforestation the most attractive option to farmers, private companies and governments—the immediate causes of deforestation. These include high agricultural prices, easy access to forests, and lack of alternative employment. The effects of other factors such as agricultural technologies, poverty, and property rights appear to be more context specific. These factors are determined by broader forces, the underlying causes of deforestation, but the links are complex making global generalizations difficult. In fact, the empirical foundation for much of the conventional wisdom on the underlying causes is surprisingly weak. The article also underscores the political economy dimension of tropical deforestation. Different groups have unequal access to the forest and policies are often designed to benefit elite interests.

In this village, studies on tree and forest management were conducted through surveys, participative observation and unstructured interviews with farmers. Farmers in the floodplain rely on a mixed portfolio of agricultural production, including tree and forest management. Fields in which tree or forest management occurs are of two types: forest gardens in which a large number of species are being produced, and fields in which annual crops are combined with one or several tree species. Within each of these two categories distinctive tree or forest management strategies are recognized. In forest gardens, tree production is the main economic activity. On agricultural fields especially in the lower elevations that have the more fertile soils, trees may be grown in addition to annual or semi-perennial crops. Two species, Cedrela odorata and Calycophyllum spruceanum are prominently managed in the latter field types. It appears, however, that the specific tree composition of fields is closely related to the alternative options of crop-production on those fields. These alternative options are largely related to the biophysical conditions of these fields. Tree and forest management appears to be an appropriate option as part of floodplain agriculture, but options have to be adjusted to the specific circumstances that different sites offer. "

These forests are treasured for their high biodiversity, a result of the country's unique geographic positioning, but also as an economically important natural resource. Although the early decades of accelerated timber exploitation in Indonesia demonstrated little concern for the sustainability of forest resources, recently a shift to genuine conservationist forest policies can be observed. These new policies, however, mainly relate to the forestry sector and much less to the ongoing conflicts between the state and forest-dependent people. It is still a commonly held belief that swidden agriculturists are responsible for about half of Indonesia's annual deforestation. In order to solve this problem the country has defined a number of measures that attempt to convert swidden agriculturists into sedentary cultivators. In this paper these measures are discussed, and they are juxtaposed to new insights on the nature of the dynamics of swidden agriculture and the role that forest management plays in this agricultural method. The official schemes only propose some sort of plantation development, which significantly reduces biodiversity in the agricultural landscape. With an example of swidden agriculture from West Kalimantan, including it's important forest management component, this paper demonstrates that developing such existing agriculture-forest management holds the potential to bring economic development to the region, while biodiversity is conserved.

Within a more realistic—particularly for the long term effects—market approach, well-intentioned policies such as agricultural intensification programmes may boost deforestation. Many forest frontier contexts are also characterized by forest clearing giving farmers land rights. Deforestation becomes an investment to the farmer and a title establishment strategy. Land titling and credit programmes may therefore increase deforestation. "

Bolivia adopted wide-reaching forest, land and democratic regulatory changes since the mid-1990s that were partly intended to reduce illegal logging and related practices. The new forest regulations, in turn, led to new illegal practices because implementation and sanctioning were poor, but also because new forest and land regulations were inadequate and often contradictory. In response, the government and various forest agencies adopted new measures to address the new illegal practices. These forest regulatory and forest policy renovations and modifications of the last two decades are, for instance, reflected in the domestic timber market of the northern Bolivian Amazon, a region that relies heavily on the forest sector. The paper analyzes Bolivia’s regulatory changes that were relevant for legality in the forest sector and the multiple modifications that were made to address shortcomings of these reforms. It also analyses legality in the domestic timber value chain in northern Bolivia. The new actors involved in especially the domestic timber value chain have moved away from formal and legal mechanisms to benefit from timber that grows on their land and forests to practices that were not considered or actually shunned in the law and that appear difficult to regulate. Unless these new practices are recognized adequately in a new forestry law, some of the production and trade of the timber value chain will likely continue to operate at the margin of legality. "

abstract = "Abstract The goal of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and the roles of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries (REDD +) under \{UNFCCC\} has triggered a new discussion on forest resource assessments in these countries. The international process on measurement, reporting and verification of \{REDD\} + outcomes (REDD + MRV) expands the scope of forest inventories to include quantification of forest carbon stocks and their changes for results-based \{REDD\} + payments. \{UNFCCC\} decisions also specify methods to be used, and actors to be involved. Although forest management in developing countries has clearly been influenced by international processes in the past, exactly how and to what extent \{REDD\} + \{MRV\} has affected institutional arrangements for forest assessments in developing countries remains unknown. Using as a theoretical framework Discursive-Institutionalism, a concept derived from political science, this paper examines (1) the historical evolution of institutional arrangements for forest inventories in Peru; and (2) how and to what extent their development has been shaped by international processes on forests, and, more recently, specifically by \{REDD\} + MRV. The findings show that the international \{REDD\} + \{MRV\} discussion has expanded the objectives of forest assessments in Peru, inspired the mobilization of new actors and resources, and spawned the development of new protocols for forest assessments. However, the ‘depth’ of these changes is not yet extensive, since the new rules for forest inventories have not yet been formally adopted, and the institutes envisaged to implement forest inventories, including measurement of carbon stocks and their changes, have not been established.

It has been widely discussed in many fields of social study, in particular as it relates inter-individual conflicts. However, this is not the case for natural resource management (NRM). This paper addresses two major questions: (1) what are the stages of conflict manifestation in NRM? and (2) is it possible to identify escalation patterns of \{NRM\} conflicts? The analysis is based on a review of 118 conflict cases and qualitative content analysis. To identify escalation patterns a Markov Chain approach is used. Eight escalation stages are identified. Furthermore, although it is possible to identify escalation patterns of \{NRM\} conflicts, there is no single “generic” pattern that fits all \{NRM\} cases. Escalation in \{NRM\} is more complex compared to inter-individual conflicts. It is argued that this complexity might be due to the fact that most \{NRM\} conflicts are about multi-actors conflicts, involving wide range of issues and management strategies. Further investigation on escalation is necessary by narrowing the scope and focus of analysis in order to increase our knowledge on the subject. In turn this knowledge will contribute to achieving constructive conflict management in NRM. "

On mitigation, the forests have enormous opportunities to contribute to the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) mechanism. But the forest itself and its multiple dependent societies and sectors need to adapt to potential climate risks. Hence, actors are debating the design of climate change policy in the forest sector. Theoretically, we combine the agency-focus of frame analysis and discourse theory to analyze how different agents hold frames on climate change adaptation and mitigation policies in the region. This paper draws upon interviews with 103 different actors from government, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, research institutions and private sector in three countries: Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR) and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Three discourses were found on policy response to climate change in the forest sector: mitigation policy only, separated policy on adaptation and mitigation, and an integrated policy on adaptation and mitigation. The various frames articulated around each discourse by the coalitions include elements of: costs and benefits, scale of operation, effectiveness, financial resources and implementation mechanisms. Overall, the mitigation discourse, through its mix of actors, resources and interests seems to be stronger than the adaptation discourse. The paper finally outlines a number of implications of the discourses for policy design. "

The woodfuel trade generally commenced informally, little controlled by legal or bureaucratic means. Developing formal institutions is often considered as a way of managing charcoal production more sustainably. However, formalisation can have adverse effects for charcoal producers and traders when this hinders their capacity to access the resource or markets. In order to assess the relations between the formalisation of charcoal institutions and socio-economic outcomes for those involved, this study combines a value chain and livelihoods perspective. A review of case studies and empirical data show that (1) West African countries, with a longer history of dealing with woodfuel issues, have more formal mechanisms in place to deal with charcoal management and these are more embedded into cross-sectorial energy and environmental policies; (2) Despite regulatory mechanisms dealing with woodfuel in all countries, institutions are mainly embedded in informal institutions and based upon customary rules, which allows large numbers of actors to be involved, but also leads to substantial unsustainable and unofficial production, corrupt practises and loss of tax revenues; (3) Formal mechanisms can have negative consequences, such as: conflicts of interests over tax revenues, difficulties in avoiding ‘free riders’ from sustainable management initiatives, and disproportional benefits reaped by more powerful urban-based actors. Comparing the West African countries with Central African countries where attention is relatively new, indicates that conditions for successful charcoal institutions are: devolving power and responsibilities for woodfuel management to a local level, monitoring woodfuel trade, (tax) incentives for sustainably produced charcoal and reinvesting taxes in social and environmental aims.

We find that local households are willing to pay \{CFA\} 1,139.4 (€1.74) per month to prevent \{EFE\} extinction. This totals \{CFA\} 753.9 million (€1.15 million) per year for all inhabitants. Indigenousness positively influences the \{WTP\} for \{EFE\} conservation. Spatial data suggest that local communities prefer that elephants remain far from their crops. The existence of human-elephant conflicts has a neutral effect on preferences for \{EFE\} conservation. Therefore, our study suggests that local communities would engage in biodiversity preservation when the public benefits of conservation are accompanied by private benefits, such as human-elephant conflict avoidance.

More recently, coalitions of public and private actors have designed market-based and/or demand-led policy instruments to influence land use—e.g., eco-certification, geographical indications, commodity roundtables, moratoria, and payments for environmental services. These innovative instruments fall along a continuum of state involvement and interact with traditional public forms of land use regulation, leading to “hybrid” interventions. This article reviews emerging evidence on the effectiveness of the main instruments used to promote sustainable land use, and explores interactions between the new demand-led interventions and formal regulatory public policies. Although there are still insufficient rigorous studies evaluating the effectiveness of hybrid instruments, available evidence suggests some positive direct and indirect benefits. Hybrid instruments combine elements from both private and public regulatory systems, in innovative and effective ways. We propose a typology to characterize potential interactions between instruments that regulate land use. It links various types of interactions—i.e., complementarity, substitution, and antagonism—to the various stages of regulatory processes—i.e., agenda setting, implementation, and monitoring and enforcement. We give examples of governments endorsing certifications or using certification to support their own policies; governments creating enabling conditions for hybrid instruments to mature, allowing for wider adoption; and private instruments reinforcing public regulations or substituting for missing or weak governance. In some cases, governments, \{NGOs\} and corporations compete and may hinder each other's actions. With favourable institutional and governance contexts, well-designed hybrid public-private instruments can be effective. More systematic evaluation could boost the effectiveness of instruments and enhance synergistic interaction with traditional public land-use policy instruments to achieve incremental benefits as well as longer-term transformative outcomes in land-use protection.

The impacts of fuelwood extraction in humid forests are rarely studied, yet the extraction of wood for fuel can impact forest structure, function and biodiversity. We assessed the effects of fuelwood collection on the forest of Mt Elgon National Park (Uganda). We interviewed 192 households about fuelwood use and surveyed dead wood in 81 plots inside the park. Forest was the most important source of fuelwood. People collected on average between 1.1 and 2.0 m3 of fuelwood per capita per year. Other activities involving wood fuel extraction from the forest included illegal commercial fuelwood harvesting and charcoal making. Quantities of dead wood were affected by fuelwood collection up to at least 1000 m inside the boundary of the park. Depletion of dead wood inside the park was greater in the sites where the population was most dense. Nevertheless, people who planted more trees on their own land perceived land outside the park to be important and valued old growth forest less as a source of fuelwood. Highly-preferred tree species were most depleted, particularly when they were also valued timber trees, such as Prunus africana, Popocarpus milianjianus, Allophylus abyssinicus and Olea spp. Locally dominant species were less affected. Impacts varied among sites depending on the history of agricultural encroachment and locally-specific forest uses, e.g. harvesting of trees for poles or use of the forest land for grazing. Allowing the collection of dead wood in forests is double-edged as it creates opportunities for other activities that are more damaging. Demand for wood fuel from tropical forests is still likely to grow in the foreseeable future. Our results indicate that the forest may become more degraded as a result, with negative consequences for the people who depend on the forest and for conservation. Research into local ecological and cultural contexts and perceptions concerning costs and benefits can help devise more sustainable management options, including alternative sources of fuel. "

The loss of forests greatly affects biodiversity and ecosystem services. This paper assesses the economic return from increasing tree cover in agricultural landscapes in two tropical locations, West Java, Indonesia and eastern Bangladesh. Agroforestry systems are compared with subsistence seasonal food-crop-based agricultural systems. Data were collected through rapid rural appraisal, field observation, focus groups and semi-structured interviews of farm households. The inclusion of agroforestry tree crops in seasonal agriculture improved the systems’ overall economic performance (net present value), even when it reduced understorey crop production. However, seasonal agriculture has higher income per unit of land area used for crop cultivation compared with the tree establishment and development phase of agroforestry farms. Thus, there is a trade-off between short-term loss of agricultural income and longer-term economic gain from planting trees in farmland. For resource-poor farmers to implement this change, institutional support is needed to improve their knowledge and skills with this unfamiliar form of land management, sufficient capital for the initial investment, and an increase in the security of land tenure.

Individual species, however, seem to have a specific requirement for the type and dosage of smoke treatments. In the present study, six different concentrations of smoke solution were tested on 13 herbaceous species by soaking the seeds for 24 h. The germination of a forb species, Borreria scabra, was significantly stimulated (p&lt;0.05) by the smoke treatment while that of the annual grass species, Euclasta condylotricha, was significantly inhibited (p&lt;0.05) by 100% smoke solution treatment. Contrary to our expectation that another fire-related cue, heat shock, would break the physical dormancy of the species tested, it was not promotive. For non-dormant seeds of B. scabra and Borreria radiata, high temperatures were lethal while low temperature induced physiological dormancy that was overcome in the former species within 30 days of the germination trial. For some species, responses to smoke did not corroborate with the field-observed response to fire, making ecological interpretation challenging. For responsive species, the smoke treatment could be a simple approach for promoting their re-establishment in areas where it is needed. More investigations are needed to assess the spread of response to smoke. "

The results were compared with the spatial pattern analysis based on the second moment measure, and with the analysis of the structure of the tree number semivariogram. The three methods give a very similar scale of the pattern for most of the plots. The mature plot with more intensive silviculture showed a regular pattern at scales below 6 m. The mature plot in which the silviculture was less intensive showed a cluster pattern at scales around 10 m, and clustering at similar scales was detected during regeneration. Cluster patterns at scales around 5 m were found at the upper limit of the altitudinal range of Scots pine as well as at the lower limit, where Pyrenean oak stands merge with the pinewood. The method proposed allows the scale of the pattern of the canopy to be determined from hemispherical photographs, and can be easily implemented in forest inventories. "

This paper investigates the impacts of rattan harvesting on tree and understorey vegetation structure, species richness and diversity. Tree and understorey vegetation characteristics and soil and topographic variables were recorded in forest plots. Interviews with rattan harvesters recorded information on harvesting techniques and locations. The relationships between tree and understorey vegetation characteristics and soils, topography and rattan harvesting techniques were assessed with the multivariate ordination technique of Redundancy Analysis (RDA). Analysis of the relationships with rattan harvesting proximity and forest designation zone used Multivariate Analyses of Covariance (MANCOVA). Tree species richness and diversity are primarily affected by slope gradient and altitude, while tree size is affected mainly by soil chemical factors. Only a small part of the variation in tree structure measures can be attributed to the impacts of rattan cane harvesting. Stronger adverse effects on understorey vegetation density, including tree saplings and seedlings, were found. This is thought to be a case of rattan harvesting exacerbating the effects of competition between rattan plants and other understorey vegetation. Longer term monitoring of forest characteristics could provide stronger understanding of the impacts. However, rattan harvesting appears to have little effect on forest structure and diversity in Lambusango Forest, suggesting that relatively small scale \{NTFP\} extraction does not necessarily conflict with forest conservation.

The approach includes both the effect of the spatial distribution of the foliage elements as well as the slope of the terrain. Two chronosequences consisting of 11 plots were established in two Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forests in the Central Mountain Range of Spain. 12 hemispherical photographs were taken in each plot and variables related to the stage of development, density, relative spacing and site index were calculated. The gap frequency Poisson model was used to estimate the leaf area index. A new function is proposed to assess the effect of the foliage inclination on light transmittance for Scots pine, based on the assumption that the foliage elements show circular horizontal cross-sections. A new model was also developed to restrict the clumping effect on the vertical component in the Poisson model. The effect of the slope on \{LAI\} estimates was determined and included in the model. The results indicate that both the clumping effect correction and the slope correction improve the fitting of the Poisson model to the gap frequency experimental curves, and that the function proposed for the inclination angle correction may provide an acceptable approach for some coniferous species. The relationship between the parameters of the gap fraction model (the foliage inclination angle and the clumping coefficient) and stand level variables, that is, the stage of development, density, spacing of the stand and the site index, is analysed.

The stand has a site index of 29 m at the age of 100 years, according to the site curves given by Rojo and Montero [El pino silvestre en la Sierra de Guadarrama. MAPA, Madrid, 1996, p. 293]. The experiment began in 1972, when the stand was 41 years old. It is now 66 years old. The statistical design of the experiment was a randomised complete block with three blocks and three treatments. Low thinning was carried out with varying intensities in a 10-year rotation (1972, 1982, 1992). The treatments were control, light and moderate thinning. The thinning intensity was measured by using the residual basal area (%) as parameter. Since the first inventory (1972) we have made four more. Effects of these treatments on stand yield, mean tree and stand structure are studied. Results showed that with the heaviest thinning the total yield of the stand was a bit lower than in control treatment. According to these results the heaviest treatment of the trial is near the lower density limit for this species (critical basal area of Assmann). On the other hand, mean tree and stand structure characteristics become more suitable for crop stability increment when thinning were heavier. The greater the intensity of thinning, the lesser the h/d ratio and the larger the square mean diameter too. As conclusion, we recommend low heavy thinning in early ages, reducing the intensity with age. Specially in stands of middle and high quality, the first thinning should be early, at 20–25 years old, despite the lack of economic profit at this stage. "

Effective methods are needed to sustain or increase mahogany yields by increasing regeneration. This study evaluates the effects of three treatments (slash, fell and burn; slash, fell and leave; and uprooting and pushing away trees using machines) used to open 0.5 ha clearings, plus a control under the forest canopy, and two sowing methods (surface-sown seed and buried seed) on the germination, establishment, survival, and early growth of mahogany. After 10 months, significantly more buried seeds yielded established seedlings (20%) than surface-sown seeds (9%), but there were no significant differences among clearing treatments. Establishment on controls averaged 18%. The percentage of seedlings that survived from 10 to 49 months varied significantly among treatments, from 53 to 54%, respectively, on the slash and burn and machine-cleared treatments to 16% on the fell and leave treatment and 26% on controls. Both slash and burn and machine-clearing reduced sprouting as compared to the fell and leave treatment, which had abundant sprouting from stumps of other species and the lowest establishment and survival of mahogany. Low survival on controls was probably due to low light levels. Forty-nine months after sowing, an average of 12% of the seeds buried in the slash and burn and machine-cleared treatments were represented by live seedlings, a rate substantially higher than on the fell and leave treatment (3%) and the control (6%). Yield from buried seeds averaged 9% as compared to 4% from surface-sown seeds. Seedling height at 49 months (average=66 cm) did not differ significantly among the clearing treatments or sowing methods, but on control plots average height of the few surviving seedlings was only 27 cm. The traditional slash and burn practice used for agricultural clearing seems to be a good way to prepare sites for seeding with mahogany and could be used as a silvicultural technique to facilitate regeneration. Consideration should be given to integrating these systems into forest management to help assure continued production of mahogany. "

Damage was evaluated using pre- and post-harvesting assessments in 24 one-hectare sample plots. \{RIL\} techniques nearly halved the number of trees destroyed (36 vs 60 trees/ha). RIL’s main benefit was in the reduction of skidding damage (9.5% of the original tree population in \{RIL\} vs 25% in CNV). Before logging, mean canopy openness in \{CNV\} (three plots only) and \{RIL\} (9 plots) was similar (3.6 and 3.1%) and not significantly different (χ2=2.73, P=0.254). After logging, the mean canopy openness was 19.2% in \{CNV\} (n=9 plots) and 13.3% in \{RIL\} (n=8 plots), and the distributions of the canopy class in \{RIL\} and \{CNV\} significantly different (χ2=43.56, P&lt;0.001). \{CNV\} plots showed a higher proportion of measurements in the most open class ≥30% than in RIL. At a larger scale, the area of skidtrail per unit timber volume extracted was halved in the \{RIL\} compartment (15 m2 vs 27 m2 m−3 for CNV). However, under high felling intensity (&gt;8 trees/ha), both stand damage and canopy disturbance in \{RIL\} approached those recorded in \{CNV\} under low or moderate felling regime. Over this felling intensity threshold the effectiveness of \{RIL\} in reducing tree damage is limited. In mixed dipterocarp forest where harvestable timber density generally exceeds 10 trees/ha, a minimum diameter felling limit is clearly insufficient to keep extraction rates below 8 trees/ha. Based on these new results and previous studies in Borneo, we suggest three silvicultural rules: (1) to keep a minimum distance between stumps of ca. 40 m, (2) to ensure only single tree gaps using directional felling, (3) to harvest only stems with 60–100 cm dbh. Foresters, policy makers and certifiers should consider these as criteria for sustainable forest management. We emphasise the need to expand harvesting studies to look at impacts and trade-offs across larger forest landscapes, to expand \{RIL\} beyond silvicultural concepts and to include the maintenance of other forest goods and services.

To test the hypothesis of a climate change related decrease in productivity at warmer sites, we discuss the effect of historical management on the growth of forest stands and the spatio-temporal variability of growth in response to climate, analyzing departures from linearity in that relationship. We reconstructed stand history and investigated past growth trends using tree-rings. Then we used a dendroecological approach to study the regional, local and age-dependent response to climate, analyzing the relationship between precipitation and tree growth using non-linear mixed models. Tree rings reflected the origin of the studied landscape, mainly a simplification of an original closed forest and progressive canopy opening for agrosilvopastoral purposes after the mid 1800s. As expected, trees were principally responding to water availability, and regional growth (as expressed by the first principal component from the matrix of chronologies) was highly responsive to hydrological year precipitation (r = 0.7). In this water limited ecosystem, the response of growth to precipitation was asymptotic and independent of age, but variable in time. Maximum growth was variable at the different sites and the non-linear function of growth saturated (i.e. reached an asymptote) at temperature dependent site specific precipitation levels within the range considered in the region to lead a shift towards deciduous species dominated woodlands (around 600 mm, variable with mean temperature). Only trees at warmer sites showed symptoms of growth decline, most likely explained by water stress increase in the last decades affecting the highly transformed open (i.e. low competition) tree structure. Stands at colder locations did not show any negative growth trend and may benefit from the current increase in winter temperatures. Coinciding with the decrease in productivity, trees at warmer sites responded more to moisture availability, exhibited a slower response to precipitation and reached maximum growth at higher precipitation levels than trees at colder sites. This suggests that warmer stands are threatened by climate change. The non-linear response of growth to precipitation described is meaningful for different ecological applications and provides new insights in the way trees respond to climate. "

Results reveal that forest environmental income represents on average 22% of the total income in the population sampled. The main sources of forest environmental income are fuelwood, wild foods and fodder. Forest environmental income has a strong equalizing effect on local income distribution. Income diversification declined with total income; diversification did, however, increase with dependence on forest resources up to a point, beyond which diversification declined. The partial or complete omission of environmental income in current poverty assessments may lead to an underestimation of rural income and, under certain circumstances, to flawed policies and interventions.

For this purpose, we analysed the spatial pattern of each species as well as the spatial relationships between young and adult individuals. Almost all the analysed species showed a cluster pattern, followed by a random pattern at larger distances. The cluster size is more evident for the young trees whereas adult trees tended to be more randomly distributed. The shade-tolerant species showed greater distances of aggregation than gap or medium-shade-tolerant species. Species primarily dispersed by wind and small birds showed larger distances of aggregation than species dispersed by mammals or big birds. All the under-story woody plants showed a notable cluster pattern, whereas canopy trees showed a variety of spatial patterns, with clustering at small scales being the most frequent. In the case of emergent trees, association was found between young and adult individuals on a large scale. Positive associations between young and adult individuals predominate at small scales for medium and shade tolerant species and at larger scales for bird-dispersed species whereas negative spatial associations at smaller scales were found for shade tolerant species and wind dispersed species. Our study confirms that conspecific organization varies among the woody plants in the analysed forest, and that the spatial pattern of woody plants is partially linked to shade tolerance, primary dispersal mode and life form of the species.

Complex customary Dayak rules exist that control the use and inheritance of these forests that help to avoid over-exploitation of resources. There is clear gender division of labour among Dayak in the management of simpukng that provide a range of products – for household consumption and sale and for customary rituals – fruits, vegetables, medicines, fire wood, honey, rattan, bamboos, and timber. Local knowledge about the more highly valued species are discussed. These indigenous forest garden systems are currently under threat from large-scale mining and logging activities; conflicts between local and external agencies are unfortunately frequent.

abstract = "Abstract This paper analyses local geographical contexts targeted by transnational large-scale land acquisitions (&gt;200 ha per deal) in order to understand how emerging patterns of socio-ecological characteristics can be related to processes of large-scale foreign investment in land. Using a sample of 139 land deals georeferenced with high spatial accuracy, we first analyse their target contexts in terms of land cover, population density, accessibility, and indicators for agricultural potential. Three distinct patterns emerge from the analysis: densely populated and easily accessible croplands (35% of land deals); remote forestlands with lower population densities (34% of land deals); and moderately populated and moderately accessible shrub- or grasslands (26% of land deals). These patterns are consistent with processes described in the relevant case study literature, and they each involve distinct types of stakeholders and associated competition over land. We then repeat the often-cited analysis that postulates a link between land investments and target countries with abundant so-called “idle” or “marginal” lands as measured by yield gap and available suitable but uncultivated land; our methods differ from the earlier approach, however, in that we examine local context (10-km radius) rather than countries as a whole. The results show that earlier findings are disputable in terms of concepts, methods, and contents. Further, we reflect on methodologies for exploring linkages between socio-ecological patterns and land investment processes. Improving and enhancing large datasets of georeferenced land deals is an important next step; at the same time, careful choice of the spatial scale of analysis is crucial for ensuring compatibility between the spatial accuracy of land deal locations and the resolution of available geospatial data layers. Finally, we argue that new approaches and methods must be developed to empirically link socio-ecological patterns in target contexts to key determinants of land investment processes. This would help to improve the validity and the reach of our findings as an input for evidence-informed policy debates. "

The complex interactions among these factors highlight the need for physiology-based models which describe seedling and sapling performance under current and changing climatic conditions. These models should be flexible enough to take into account the effect of growth light environment changes on physiological processes and, therefore, to assist in the decision-making process on different silvicultural management alternatives under climatic uncertainty. In the present work the net photosynthesic rate of Pinus pinea L. natural regeneration is modeled as a function of light irradiance using the non-rectangular hyperbola function. The model fit was carried out following a two-step procedure, where the parameters of the original function were expanded over the most influential factors: leaf temperature, soil moisture, global site factor and needle type. The developed model allows defining the optimal niche conditions for the natural regeneration of the species and permits identifying the most limiting conditions which prevent natural regeneration. Regeneration niche was assessed by using the model to simulate net \{CO2\} assimilation of a seedling over twelve contrasting light environments during both a normal and an extremely dry vegetative period. The model predicts that the most favorable carbon balance would be found in mid-shaded expositions, while fully exposed plants at midday during summer would exhibit longer periods of negative assimilation rates, especially on severe dry years.

Here we present an alternative approach based on non-parametric techniques. The approach was tested for pure stands, but this methodology is likewise applicable to mixed forests. The proposed tests perform well in rejecting a model if the predictions for the targeted population are systematically deviant. It is demonstrated that the suitability of an allometric model is a matter of accuracy. The proposed method also allows localizing the model. The presented approach can improve the transparency of global forest monitoring systems and can be implemented with relatively small effort. "

Besides production, genotypic stability is a key factor in furthering our understanding of the plant material, with important implications for the management of plantations as well as for breeding. To study this factor, several stability models were compared (additive mixed model, Shukla’s stability variance model, Finlay–Wilkinson and Eberhart–Russell models) and differences in the response capacity of the material were evaluated in the different environments. This evaluation of genotypic stability, based on the measurement of variances, was complemented by an analysis of the mean genotypic value and the variability in genotype productivity. Intrinsic water use efficiency was also evaluated as it is an important trait of plant material destined for use in Mediterranean conditions. S. matsudana x Salix spp. ‘Levante’ exhibited the highest production and showed an intermediate reactivity (stability) as well as high intrinsic water use efficiency under the conditions in which it was tested. P. x canadensis ‘Orion’ also displayed a good overall performance and was highly sensitive to improving environmental conditions. Conversely, R. pseudoacacia and P. x hispanica presented yields well below the average as well as low responsiveness to improved environmental conditions. Our findings will contribute to a better understanding of plant material, enabling improved recommendations for plantations the Mediterranean area, including more precise large scale predictions.

This policy scenario can best be met when the governance of food production at local to global scales is multi-sectoral and based on a ‘Systems Approach’. Nevertheless, the adoption of agroforestry has recently been greatly supported by the international agenda on the mitigation of climate change and to achieve sustainable food production. In conclusion we pose the hypothesis that “Agroforestry concepts and practices can form an effective, efficient and fair pathway towards the achievement of many Sustainable Development Goals”, and discuss the main messages and research questions emerging from the papers presented in this special issue.

Many new migrants end up in low-cost or informal areas and slums with attendant environmental concerns. One dimension of improved urban sustainability is the provision of green spaces and trees. Whilst many countries have urban greening programmes for public spaces and streets, few have considered the status and potential contribution of trees from resident's own gardens. This paper reports firstly on the policy environment for urban forestry and greening in South Africa and secondly on the maintenance, use and appreciation of trees on private homesteads of residents of new and older low-income suburbs as well as informal housing areas from three small towns in South Africa. In particular we examine if the most recent centrally planned and built low-income housing schemes (called \{RDP\} suburbs in South Africa) have considered and incorporated plans or spaces for urban greenery in peoples’ homesteads. We found that broad environmental and sustainability concerns and statements are common in urban development and housing policies, but specific guidelines for implementation are generally absent. More specifically, urban forestry and tree planting are rarely mentioned in the broader land use and environmental policies other than the national forest act and subsequent regulations, but even there it is relatively superficial. In the study towns the prevalence, density and number of species of trees was lowest in the new \{RDP\} suburbs relative to the township and informal areas. Consequently, the contribution of tree products to local livelihoods was also lower in the \{RDP\} areas. Yet there were no differences in the level of appreciation of the value and intangible benefits of trees between residents from the three different suburbs. This shows that the failure to plan for and accommodate trees in new low-cost housing developments is missing an opportunity to improve overall urban sustainability and liveability and constraining the potential flows of tangible and intangible benefits to urban residents. Making opportunities for such in older suburbs is challenging because of space limitations and cost implications of retrospective provisions, but incorporation into plans for new low-cost housing development should be possible.

Agroforestry practices may also promote mineral N fertilization and the use of N2-fixing legumes that favor the emission of non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHG) (N2O and CH4). The present study evaluates the net \{GHG\} balance in two adjacent coffee plantations, both highly fertilized (250 kg N ha−1 year−1): a monoculture (CM) and a culture shaded by the N2-fixing legume tree species Inga densiflora (CIn). C stocks, soil \{N2O\} emissions and \{CH4\} uptakes were measured during the first cycle of both plantations. During a 3-year period (6–9 years after the establishment of the systems), soil C in the upper 10 cm remained constant in the \{CIn\} plantation (+0.09 ± 0.58 Mg C ha−1 year−1) and decreased slightly but not significantly in the \{CM\} plantation (−0.43 ± 0.53 Mg C ha−1 year−1). Aboveground carbon stocks in the coffee monoculture and the agroforestry system amounted to 9.8 ± 0.4 and 25.2 ± 0.6 Mg C ha−1, respectively, at 7 years after establishment. C storage rate in the phytomass was more than twice as large in the \{CIn\} compared to the \{CM\} system (4.6 ± 0.1 and 2.0 ± 0.1 Mg C ha−1 year−1, respectively). Annual soil \{N2O\} emissions were 1.3 times larger in the \{CIn\} than in the \{CM\} plantation (5.8 ± 0.5 and 4.3 ± 0.3 kg N-N2O ha−1 year−1, respectively). The net \{GHG\} balance at the soil scale calculated from the changes in soil C stocks and \{N2O\} emissions, expressed in \{CO2\} equivalent, was negative in both coffee plantations indicating that the soil was a net source of GHG. Nevertheless this balance was in favor of the agroforestry system. The net \{GHG\} balance at the plantation scale, which includes additionally C storage in the phytomass, was positive and about 4 times larger in the \{CIn\} (14.59 ± 2.20 Mg \{CO2\} eq ha−1 year−1) than in the \{CM\} plantation (3.83 ± 1.98 Mg \{CO2\} eq ha−1 year−1). Thus converting the coffee monoculture to the coffee agroforestry plantation shaded by the N2-fixing tree species I. densiflora would increase net atmospheric \{GHG\} removals by 10.76 ± 2.96 Mg \{CO2\} eq ha−1 year−1 during the first cycle of 8–9 years.

A major constraint for crop production is the amount of rainfall and its intra and inter-annual variability. We evaluated the effects of planting date on the yield of different varieties of four major crops (maize, millet, sorghum and cotton) over three contrasting growing seasons in 2009–2011 (with 842 mm, 1248 mm and 685 mm of rainfall respectively) with the aim of identifying climate adaptation options in the Sudano-Sahelian region. Three planting dates (early, medium, and late) and three varieties of long, medium, and short duration of each crop were compared. For fertilized cereal crops, maize out yielded millet and sorghum by respectively 57% and 45% across the three seasons. Analysis of 40 years of weather data indicates that this finding holds for the longer time periods than the length of this trial. Late planting resulted in significant yield decreases for maize, sorghum and cotton, but not for millet. However, a short duration variety of millet was better adapted for late planting. When the rainy season starts late, sorghum planting can be delayed from the beginning of June to early July without substantial reductions in grain yield. Cotton yield at early planting was 28% larger than yield at medium planting and late planting gave the lowest yield with all three varieties. For all four crops the largest stover yields were obtained with early planting and the longer planting was delayed, the less stover was produced. There was an interaction between planting date and variety for millet and sorghum, while for maize and cotton the best planting date was more affected by the weather conditions. The findings of this study can support simple adaptation decisions: priority should be given to planting cotton early; maize is the best option if fertilizer is available; planting of maize and sorghum can be delayed by up to a month without strong yield penalties; and millet should be planted last.

Methods include a survey, focus groups, participant observation and adaptive collaborative management processes over a two-year period. Results revealed that while a higher percentage of men than women participate in the harvest of eight forest products, women participate substantially in product sales and have some control over income. A majority of men and women believe that women participate in decision-making, but that participation was of low efficacy. Women face significant obstacles to effective participation in forest decision-making in the community: weak community organization, pressure by spouses, difficulty organizing among themselves and informal sanctions. Improving meaningful participation of women in decision-making requires addressing challenges and obstacles at multiple levels; obstacles at the communal level, where the future of the forests will be decided, cannot be overcome without attention to the household.

Three techniques called ranking, rating, and pairwise comparisons are described and used within the framework of a generic set of criteria and indicators applied in a case study involving a forest concession in Kalimantan, Indonesia. For the case study, an assessment team consisting of national and international experts representing various disciplines was chosen to conduct an assessment of the forest concession. The criteria and indicators (C&amp;I) developed by the Center for International Forestry Research was used as a reference. From this generic set of C&amp;I, the assessment team made revisions to make the set more relevant to the prevailing conditions in the forest concession. This modified set was used in the assessment of the concession. Results from the study indicate that these techniques are effective tools both for selecting sets of criteria and indicators and eventually for prioritizing them. The methods are highly transparent, easy to understand, and offer a convenient environment for participatory decision making. These are desirable features of any evaluation process but most especially for a complex assessment problem such as forest sustainability. "

Under high salinities, total \{FAA\} concentrations increased dramatically, reaching up to 2.1 mM depending on treatment. Examination of individual amino acid concentrations revealed that these increases were based on specific changes in glycine, arginine, alanine, proline and lysine. Among these, alanine showed the greatest increases, resulting in levels six-fold higher under high salinity than in freshwater and under low salinity. The other amino acid species showed increases of 2.5-fold compared to original values. These five \{FAAs\} in freshwater and under low salinity together occupied approximately 45% of total \{FAA\} contents and under high salinity comprised more than 70% of total \{FAA\} contents.

Multi-criteria analysis (MCA) is used as a decision-making tool to analyze and evaluate multiple C&amp;I under a participatory group decision-making environment.

In addition to generating C&amp;I and estimating their relative importance and performance, the paper also presents a soft methodology, called cognitive mapping, which can be used to assess the cross-indicator interaction, linkages, and connectivities of the indicators. The method attempts to evaluate the overall cumulative impacts of all indicators, individually and collectively, as they impact sustainability directly and indirectly through their interactions with other indicators.

In this study, we developed the contemporary and potential vegetation maps of China with a spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km. The vegetation classification scheme includes 17 types of vegetation and 3 non-vegetated land cover types. For cropland, we further provide spatial information on three major cropping systems across China, i.e., single, double and triple cropping system. In addition, we further evaluate the accuracy of this classification against field survey. As a case study, we used this vegetation data set combined with other environmental factors (climate, atmospheric \{CO2\} and nitrogen deposition) to drive the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM) for estimating terrestrial net primary production at both plant functional type and national levels. \{DLEM\} simulations indicate that net primary productivity (NPP) in China's terrestrial ecosystem has substantially increased by 51%, from 2.50 Pg C y−1 in the 1900s to 3.79 Pg C y−1 during the first decade of the 21st century. Among major plant functional types across China, cropland shows the largest \{NPP\} increase by nearly 3–4 fold during 1901–2010 primarily due to cropland expansion as well as increased nitrogen fertilizer use and irrigation. The \{NPP\} increase is estimated to be 480  and 692 gC m−2 y−1 for upland crops and rice fields, respectively. This vegetation distribution data set was originally developed for driving the Dynamic Land Ecosystem model (DLEM), but it can be used for other purposes such as driving hydrological and climate models.

The study focused on floristic data recently collected by industrial timber companies in the tropical forests of the Central African Republic (28,229 0.5-ha plots spread over 14,000 km2). A subset of these plots (n = 1107) was later re-sampled for controlling purposes by experienced botanists. The proportion of agreement between the two samplings was assessed for each species and independently for small and large trees, and at genus and family resolutions. Unsurprisingly, large trees and common species were more accurately identified than small trees and rare species. We found that the quality of the floristic determination increased slightly from species to families. We also detected a significant variation between concessions in the quality of the floristic determination that was more dependent on working conditions during forest inventories than on field workers. Contrary to a widespread belief, we did not find a strong bias toward commercial species, showing that commercial inventory data could also be valid for non-commercial species in ecological studies. Finally, we found that both alpha and beta diversity patterns in commercial inventories were highly consistent with those of the re-sampled inventory. This latter result shows that commercial inventories are well suited to detect large-scale patterns of floristic variation. Large-scale commercial inventories could thus play an important role in the identification of large-scale patterns in tropical tree diversity. This could enhance our ability to manage tropical forests by designing representative reserve networks and developing management plans that integrate diversity patterns at the landscape scale. "

However, the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) of female ginkgo was significantly higher than male. From the view of evolution and through comparison with other gymnosperms and angiosperms, the photosynthetic capacity of ginkgo is not obviously lower than that of other plants.

While previous studies have mainly focused on the metabolic drought response of a single organ, analysis of metabolic differences between organs is essential to achieve an integrated understanding of the whole plant response. In this work, untargeted metabolic profiling was used to examine the response of roots, stems, adult and juvenile needles from Pinus pinaster Ait. full-sib individuals, subjected to a moderate and long lasting drought period. Cyclitols content showed a significant alteration, in response to drought in all organs examined, but other metabolites increased or decreased differentially depending on the analyzed organ. While a high number of flavonoids were only detected in aerial organs, an induction of the glutathione pathway was mainly detected in roots. This result may reflect different antioxidant mechanisms activated in aerial organs and roots. Metabolic changes were more remarkable in roots than in the other organs, highlighting its prominent role in the response to water stress. Significant changes in flavonoids and ascorbate metabolism were also observed between adult and juvenile needles, consistent with previously proven differential functional responses between the two developmental stages. Genetic polymorphisms in candidate genes coding for a Myb1 transcription factor and a malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) were associated with different concentration of phenylalanine, phenylpropanoids and malate, respectively. The results obtained will support further research on metabolites and genes potentially involved in functional mechanisms related to drought tolerance in trees. "

To estimate the basal area, number of trees and mean diameter, the sampling probability is determined for each tree. The accuracy and precision of the estimates derived from stereoscopic hemispherical images was analyzed for a set of National Forest Inventory plots. The results revealed that tree matching depends on the species, the distance to the target tree and the diameter. The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.86 for the mean diameter and 0.89 for the basal area, whereas for the number of trees per hectare it was 0.59. The proposed methods may be used in large scale forest inventories as a cost-efficient way of obtaining data on diameter distribution and basal area from field surveys following a two-stage scheme combined with remote sensing techniques.

This article traces the development of Indonesian forest plantations through time by categorizing them into paradigms. Proposed explanatory framework helps to see the historical legacies in the Indonesian plantation sector. The identification of historical plantation modes is based on a literature review while current approaches and specific policy instruments are discussed based on exploratory empirical case-study material from three Indonesian forest plantation estates (involving joint forest management, community forest management and large private timber company). The historical review shows a range of continuities and helps to explain the problems forest plantations in Indonesia face today.

The use of tree plantations to catalyze restoration of degraded forests and lands in the tropics was addressed at a symposium in Washington \{DC\} in June 1996. The conclusions and suggestions for future research to develop appropriate management options are reported. There is strong evidence that plantations can facilitate forest succession in their understories through modification of both physical and biological site conditions. Changes in light, temperature and moisture at the soil surface enable germination and growth of seeds transported to the site by wildlife and other vectors from adjacent forest remnants.

Following the identification and prioritization of forest-based development sectors for adaptation by stakeholders, the types of markets and trades surrounding the identified sectors were examined in two provinces in the Democratic Republic of Congo as a case study in order to evaluate revenue flows and their potential contribution to adaptation by local communities. The distribution of the market revenue leaves local people with returns much lower than the worth of the commodity, while wholesalers and retailers reap most of the benefits and profit from the high variability in volume and market earnings for the same commodity across provinces. Markets may increase the value of a commodity as observed in this study, but their contributions to adaptation appear highly limited for local communities following their distribution among the stakeholders in the market chain. This is likely to be worse in free market settings, especially when it diminishes the safety net roles of forest goods and services. Markets should therefore complement rather than substitute forests roles for adaptation to climate change in tropical forest countries. Capturing the benefits of trade for adaptation is crucial but will require policy reforms and further research that addresses the complexity in benefit sharing. "

One key aspect is that the magnitude of conflict of use can be location specific, thus adding complexity to policy development. This paper focuses on the extent to which the potential for conflict of use in multipurpose tree species varies across the Amazonian lowland forests shared by Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela, emphasizing the economic dimension of conflict. Based on a review of the current normative and regulatory aspects of timber and \{NTFP\} extraction in the five countries, the paper also briefly discusses the opportunities and constraints for harmonization of timber and \{NTFP\} management of multipurpose species across the region. It was found that about half of the 336 timber species reviewed across the five countries also have non-timber uses. Eleven timber species are multipurpose in all five countries: Calophyllum brasiliense, Cedrela odorata, Ceiba pentandra, Clarisia racemosa, Ficus insipida, Jacaranda copaia, Schefflera morototoni, Simarouba amara and Terminalia amazonia. Seven other multipurpose species occurred only in either Venezuela (Tabebuia impetiginosa, Spondias mombin, Pentaclethra macroloba, Copaifera officinalis, Chlorophora tinctoria, Carapa guianensis) or Ecuador (Tabebuia chrysantha). Four multipurpose tree species presented the highest potential of conflict of use across the region: Dipteryx odorata, Tabebuia serratifolia, Hymenaea courbaril and Myroxylon balsamum yet these were not evenly distributed across all five countries. None of the five studied countries have specific legislation to promote sustainable use of any of the multipurpose species reported here and thus mitigate potential conflict of use; nor documented management options for integration or else segregation of both their timber and \{NTFP\} values.

A review of empirical data (surveys and interviews) and secondary data on wood energy value chains in the \{DRC\} is used to examine the ways that woodfuel institutions affect access to resources and to markets. The main findings are that existing formal mechanisms regulating access to the woodfuel trade are hardly enforced. Informal, socially embedded institutions generally govern access, and the trade is open to less privileged and rural actors. People who benefit from these informal arrangements have many vested interests, and current production patterns are unsustainable and not sufficiently mitigated by these institutions. New strategies are required that promote the positive aspects of informality, while supporting initiatives that contribute to long-term resource sustainability and meet the high levels of urban demand, given the lack of alternative energy sources.

Then we bring down the scale of the analysis to the case study level and provide a detailed methodology for analyzing the spatial relation between deforestation and biofuel development. We argue that this multi-scale approach, based on systematic sampling at the case study level would help to better understand the relation between biofuels and deforestation. Given the fact that biofuels are a highly contested approach to reduction of global carbon emissions, and that different lobbies in this debate are making claims that deforestation is, or is not, occurring as a result of the expansion of biofuel production, clarity on the methodological difficulties of making statements of this kind, at least in a global spatial analysis, may help avoid false conclusions being promulgated in the future.

This conversion has expanded into forests previously protected by the community and onto marginal sites at high-elevation. Market-based ecosystem payments, especially carbon financing, are potential tools to prevent further forest loss in China. Here, we compare rubber net present value (NPV), carbon sequestration, and seed-plant species diversity for Xishuangbanna given three land-use scenarios: Business-As-Usual (BAU), Economic Oriented Scenario (EOS) and Conservation Oriented Scenario (COS) using a previously published spatial map of rubber profitability. The \{EOS\} achieved the greatest rubber profit but caused substantial reductions in natural forest area, biodiversity and carbon stocks. The \{EOS\} also requires substantial immigration of workers into a remote and ecologically important region with little social infrastructure for basic security, food security, health-care and education, causing frequently ignored costs. As expected, the \{COS\} will maintain the highest levels of natural forest area, sequester 57% more carbon, and 71% more biodiversity than EOS. Given the conservation value of the carbon stores and rich biodiversity residing in Xishuangbanna's natural forests, reducing rubber \{NPV\} only marginally would probably cost less than attempting to recover these resources. We recommend that rubber plantations be limited to established, productive lowland areas whilst protecting intact high-elevation forest and reforesting low-productivity plantations. These actions will enhance carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. Management policies focused solely on profits, like the \{EOS\} scenario, will fail to sustain the entire range of natural resources and ecosystem services. The prices in the carbon market would have to be considerably larger than they are currently to compete with the profitability of rubber. "

The assumed positive relationship between fallow length and crop yields has long shaped such negative opinions on the sustainability and environmental impact of the system, as population growth is believed inevitably to lead to its collapse. Empirical evidence for this assumption is scarce, however, and a better understanding of system dynamics is needed before discarding shifting cultivation as unsustainable. With cases from Malaysia and Indonesia, we show that fallow length is a weak predictor of crop yields, though interactions with fertilizer inputs may increase its importance. Other factors such as drought, flooding, and pests are more important determinants of yields. The implication is that when using natural fallow as the only means of nutrient supply, there is no need to cut old fallow vegetation. Moreover, there is no evidence of system collapse, even at short fallow periods. We conclude that shifting cultivation should be accepted as a rational land use system and that earlier calls for bringing a “Green Revolution” to shifting cultivators are still relevant to achieve intensive and sustainable production.

Priorities for tropical ecologists thus include the identification of key thresholds to ecological resilience, and the formulation of clear monitoring protocols and management strategies for implementation by local resource managers.

The most commonly cited impact is deforestation, i.e., the clearance of forest or woodland. At a small spatial scale this may indeed be the case but on a larger landscape scale charcoal production most frequently results only in forest degradation. Much of the charcoal in tropical countries is commonly made in traditional earth and pit kilns with a wood-to-charcoal conversion rate of about 20% and in 2009 the contribution of charcoal production to deforestation in tropical countries with the highest rates of deforestation is estimated at less than 7%. A large proportion of the area utilized for charcoal production has the potential for rapid forest recovery especially with good post-harvest management. There are conflicting reports on the effects of deforestation on catchment hydrology with the majority of small catchment studies indicating increased runoff and low evapotranspiration while studies of large basins have shown no such changes. Emissions of greenhouse gases from charcoal production in tropical ecosystems in 2009 are estimated at 71.2 million t for carbon dioxide and 1.3 million t for methane. The failure of past charcoal policies to address environmental impacts and achieve sustainability can be attributed to erroneous assumptions and predictions by national and international organizations regarding wood-based fuels. Possible ways of enhancing charcoal policies' legitimacy and therefore effective implementation are multi-stakeholder participation and demonstration of coherence with globally recognized principles, goals and relevant international regimes, such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In this way charcoal production can significantly contribute to poverty reduction and environmental sustainability. "

This approach provides a new perspective (i.e., the landscape structure) on forest management, which traditionally has been determined on the basis of individual forest stands. We first created a cover type map of the study area by means of aerial photo interpretation. The characteristics of each cover type identified from the photographs were determined using landscape metrics for each cover class. We digitized a forest administrative map (1:20,000 scale) using 20-m contours, and imported this into \{GIS\} software to produce a terrain model; on this model, we overlaid the cover types. Our examination of landscape metrics showed that most of the natural forest could be managed similarly. However, our examination of topographic characteristics revealed exceptions (e.g., areas that are difficult to regenerate) that will require particular attention when managing the natural forest. Based on the information we obtained, we proposed a guideline for sustainable forest management. From the land cover map, we proposed an “improved” cover type map to illustrate the development of a high growing stock of forest based on forest management. We compared the current cover map with the “improved” cover map and demonstrated that the improved form would have more significant effects on fauna that do not recognize differences in the proportion of the dominant species types than on those that can recognize these differences. Our results show how the information obtained using landscape metrics and terrain models is an essential tool for various stages of forest management planning. "

However, no quercetin conjugates have yet been identified from biological fluids or tissues. In the present study, we isolated and characterized two quercetin conjugates from the plasma of quercetin-administered rats. The blood plasma was collected from 26 rats 30 min after oral administration of quercetin (250 mg/kg body weight), concentrated, dissolved in 2% acetic acid aqueous solution (pH 2.65), and extracted with ethyl acetate. Two compounds (P2, P3) were obtained from the extract by repeated reversed-phase HPLC. On the other hand, two quercetin glucuronides were synthesized chemically and identified as quercetin 3-O-β-d-glucuronide (Q3GA) and quercetin 4′-O-β-d-glucuronide (Q4′GA), as determined from FABMS, 1H- and 13C-NMR, and \{HMBC\} data.

This is, to our knowledge, the first evidence that \{Q3GA\} accumulates in vivo after oral administration of quercetin. \{Q3GA\} is likely to act as an effective antioxidant in blood plasma low-density lipoprotein, because this conjugated metabolite was found to possess a substantial antioxidant effect on copper ion-induced oxidation of human plasma low-density lipoprotein as well as 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity.

Under what conditions is REDD+ a threat to local rights, and under what conditions does it present an opportunity? This article explores these issues based on available data from a global comparative study on REDD+, led by the Center for International Forestry Research, which is studying national policies and processes in 12 countries and 23 REDD+ projects in 6 countries. The article analyses how tenure concerns are being addressed at both national and project level in emerging REDD+ programs. The findings suggest that in most cases REDD+ has clearly provided some new opportunities for securing local tenure rights, but that piecemeal interventions by project proponents at the local level are insufficient in the absence of broader, national programs for land tenure reform. The potential for substantial changes in the status quo appear unlikely, though Brazil – the only one with such a national land tenure reform program – offers useful insights. Land tenure reform – the recognition of customary rights in particular – and a serious commitment to REDD+ both challenge the deep-rooted economic and political interests of ‘business as usual’. "

In this article, we concentrate on some political economy forces that could help explaining the gap between \{PES\} theory and practice, with respect to policy adoption, including opportunities and challenges in this process. Public policy theories grasp the adoption determinants of three large, government-led incentive programs for forest conservation in the Amazon, in Peru, Ecuador, and Brazil. We use Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework to analyze decision-making regarding program initiation, including key stakeholder interviews, to understand policy choices. We find that environmental concerns are not always the prime motives for \{PES\} programs, as political and institutional contexts limit environmental policy-makers' actions. Yet, policy choice processes become less constrained when environmental issues are closer to a government's priorities. "

There was a tendency for higher \{SOC\} in converted land, associated with higher bulk density suggesting quality based land use selection with forest left on inferior soils. Cultivation, landscape position, slope and sampling depth were all significantly (P &lt; 0.05) related to variation in \{SOC\} stocks following forest conversion but time since conversion had no detectable impact. Interestingly, there was no significant relationship between \{SOC\} in the top and sub-soils. Higher \{SOC\} is largely determined by higher bulk density. The large \{SOC\} stocks in these afro-montane soils are less predictable and more persistent than anticipated. "

It has been recognized for its success in producing scientific outputs and real world impacts and as a pioneer in integrated natural resource management (iNRM). Until now, there has been little understanding of the reasons for its success in integrating different perspectives and ways of working. To fill this gap, an on-line consultation involving \{ASB\} researchers was structured following an analytical framework developed by the Initiative on Science and Technology for Sustainability. The structure of the presentation of major results presented in this article also follows that framework, which includes four dimensions of integration (disciplinary, functional, spatial/temporal, and knowledge) and linked challenges of institutional learning and adaptation, fostering appropriate participation, and managing resource and capacity constraints. To lay the foundations for interpreting these insights and to motivate the study, introductory sections present qualitative evidence regarding organizational learning within the consortium (using research hypotheses as indicators) and success in producing integrated results (using a selection of research results as evidence). This report on ASB's experience in integrative science and organizational learning is intended to advance understanding of the scope and limits of a complex international consortium to integrate activities across disciplines, organizations, scales and knowledge systems in order to produce knowledge and policy relevant outputs. ASB's processes and structures have weaknesses as well as strengths. And while there almost certainly are a range of effective alternative approaches to integrative science, the insights from ASB's experience documented in these online discussions could be of interest to other geographically dispersed teams, especially those working on environment and development issues. Moreover, from a methodological perspective, the use of information technology reported in this article proved to be an effective means of triangulating the perceptions of geographically dispersed researchers. In doing so, this web-based consultation provided a medium for reflection by a large ‘virtual team’ on whether words about integration are translated into practice, at least as perceived and self-reported by the scientists who participated. These techniques could be employed for process documentation by other dispersed teams, thereby adding to the stock of information on what works (and what does not) in efforts to put integrative science into practice on a significant scale.

Using participatory action research (PAR), stakeholders were asked to identify relevant indicators of sustainable forest management. The indicators identified by each stakeholder were then compared to a consolidated list assembled by field facilitators with respect to whether relevant indicators are present or not. Based on the resulting presence/absence matrix, a statistical tool called the simple matching coefficient was used to estimate the similarity measures among the stakeholders' perspectives. In addition, cluster analysis was used to classify groups of stakeholders depending on their similarities to each other. Finally, hypotheses related to the ‘closeness’ of perspectives among local communities, non-governmental organizations, a timber company, and government organizations, as revealed by their selection of indicators, were tested. Results show that: (a) local communities have different perceptions in terms of what they consider to be important indicators compared to the NGOs, (b) there are significantly different perceptions between the government and the timber companies, and (c) there are also different perceptions between urban and field-based personnel of the same organization.

Stakeholders revealed interest in using certification as a capacity-building tool, towards which they indicated a willingness to bear associated costs. However, their preferences indicated confusion about the meaning of certification and skepticism as to its transparency, as well as a need for as-of-yet unavailable simple but scientific standards.

Despite their widespread popularity, participatory methods developed so far have often been criticized as lacking in rigor and in need of better structuring and analytical capabilities. This paper proposes and combines two approaches, namely multi-criteria analysis (MCA) and participatory modeling. \{MCA\} offers an analytical environment where multiple goals, objectives, and perspectives can be accommodated and analyzed collectively and holistically. Such framework is deemed appropriate under a community-based forest management (CBFM) setting that is typically characterized by plurality of opinions and interests. Participatory modeling, on the other hand, is a general framework that subscribes to the principles of participatory action research, where direct participation of local communities is deemed crucial to the success of any management strategy. To ensure that the modeling process is participatory, the modeling environment, model formulation, and model development must be transparent and within the grasp of local participants. This paper describes how these two approaches can be integrated in a decision support system. The integration of the two approaches takes advantage of the analytical capabilities of \{MCA\} and the open and collaborative nature of participatory modeling. Applications of these two approaches as stand alone models are briefly described. A more detailed case study describing the integration of the two approaches is also described. "

Height growth was also significantly greater for trees in scarified compared to unscarified areas, despite a near doubling of soil compaction in scarified areas. The principal species benefiting from soil disturbance by skidders was Schizolobium amazonicum, which had nearly 10× higher density and 2× greater height growth in scarified compared to unscarified areas. Although initially devoid of vegetation and litter cover, scarified areas had vegetation and litter cover levels similar to unscarified areas after 7 months.

This study was undertaken, in Chingola District in Zambia, operation centre for Konkola Copper Mines (KCM), and Lubumbashi in DRC, where Gécamines and other mining companies operate, to ascertain the relationship between copper mining, forest management and forest-based livelihoods. A multi-site approach was utilized for consultations with diverse actors at local, district and national levels, and with forest dependent communities from fringes of towns and in remote areas where mines have been obtaining timber. Interviews and field observations revealed that mining affects forests in a number of direct and indirect ways; from deforestation during green site development and sourcing of high quality timber to the sharp but indirect pressures over forests through the population pull effect of mining towns. Impacts on forest communities were in large part negative and huge investment in mining were in sharp contrast with levels of poverty and environmental degradation. Findings illustrate the need for concerted efforts to mitigate negative impacts from mining on the copper belt. "

The three models entail different information requirements, knowledge base, and varying degrees of complexity. The models can be developed and used as stand-alone resource management tools. Or, depending on the level of complexity and the availability of information about the resource management system in question, they can be integrated to constitute a more robust and flexible planning framework. This paper describes applications of these models in different case studies. Applications of the first two models are reported in detail elsewhere, hence, they are only described briefly.

In both localities, timber is harvested via reduced-impact logging (RIL) practices. In Guatemala, the main \{NTFP\} extracted is foliage from the understory xate palm (Chamaedorea spp.); in northern Bolivia, the fruits of the Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa). The Guatemalan case suggests a relatively high degree of compatibility due to low timber harvesting intensities, coupled with temporal, spatial, and social segregation of xate extraction in a well-defined land tenure system. In northern Bolivia, forest management regulations pay little attention to \{NTFPs\} and land tenure issues and related conflict complicate efforts to limit timber harvesting impacts on Brazil nut trees. The introduction of timber management plans overlain on customary property rights systems in which the extraction of Brazil nut is organized could undercut its management system. The two case studies suggest that specific legislative, education, and project interventions may help to promote the compatibility of timber and \{NTFP\} extraction and management. These include formal training of foresters on \{NTFP\} ecology and management while taking into account the perspectives of multiple stakeholders in the design of management plans. Tropical forest users, research managers, and policy makers will also better understand the need for integrated management of timber and NTFPs, if the trade-offs and potential economic benefits from \{NTFP\} extraction are clarified.

It shows that national average N deposition rate had large interannual variation, and it increased by 59%, from 12.64 kg N ha−1 yr−1 in the 1960s to 20.07 kg N ha−1 yr−1 in the recent decade, with the most rapid increase centered in the southeastern China that is already N-enriched. Large spatial variation as well as dry deposition input has to be taken into account when estimating the amount of N deposited onto land surface of China. The spatial and temporal information on N deposition derived from this study could be used by ecosystem, hydrological, and climate modeling as well as by policy makers for assessing the impacts of nitrogen enrichment on regional climate, water resources, and biogeochemical cycles.

However, an important factor that hinders effective governance in most situations is the prevalence of complex interplay of power and knowledge among diverse groups of actors with unequal access to deliberative interactions related to governance. This means that improving governance must meet the challenges of modifying deep rooted, complex patterns of power that affect deliberative processes. Drawing on the concepts of deliberation (following Habermas) and symbolic violence (following Bourdieu), this paper explores the possibility and challenges of deliberative governance, taking the case of community forestry in Nepal. The central question this study seeks to address is how and to what extent various actors engage (or do not engage) in deliberative processes while enacting governance practices. It shows how a national forest governance programme is enacted as a complex economy of practices by a wide array of participants and analyses how certain groups continue to dominate the decision-making practices despite the growing rhetoric of participatory governance. Symbolic violence for our purpose occurs when claims to superior knowledge are used to legitimate closure in deliberation on forest governance practices and accepted by those excluded from effective deliberation. In the field of forest governance, we identify patterns of symbolic violence that limit the possibility of deliberation: creating boundaries in social field, cultivating internalised beliefs among governance actors, and sustaining unequal access to symbolic capital. The paper following Bourdieu, stipulates crisis as a necessary condition for the development of demands for increased deliberation by subordinated participants, and then explore sociological conditions for the development of crises into the situation of symbolic violence.

The peatland has expanded laterally and rivers have maintained narrow levee-channel tracks through the swamp, which has grown vertically in balance with river accretion. Historical fires are associated with extreme El Niño years of drought, but human agency is important. The fires of 1982–1983 and 1997–1998 burnt up to 85% of the vegetation on the peatland. Although charcoal analyses show that fire has occurred throughout the history of the peatland, it is rare in forests remote from rivers until the last 3000 years and only common within the last millennium. Fires are earlier and more frequent in sites accessible from waterways, and floodplains have been widely burnt down to water table or below, forming extensive lakes. "

The average frequency of trees greater than 35 cm \{DBH\} was approximately 55 ha−1. Based on tree diameters, allometric relations, and published relations for biomass in other compartments besides trees of DBH&gt;35 cm, we estimated a total biomass density of 372 Mg ha−1. We produced a highly conservative error estimate of about 50% of this value. Trees with diameters greater than 35 cm \{DBH\} accounted for about half of the total biomass. This estimate includes all live and dead plant material above- and below-ground with the exception of soil organic matter. We propagated errors in sampling and those associated with allometric relations and other ratios used to estimate biomass of roots, lianas and epiphytes, and necromass. The major sources of uncertainty in our estimate were found in the allometric relations for trees with \{DBH\} greater than 35 cm, in the estimates of biomass of trees with \{DBH\} less than 35 cm, and in root biomass. Simulated sampling based on our full survey, suggests that we could have estimated mean biomass per hectare for trees (DBH≥35 cm) to within 20% (sampling error only) with 95% confidence by sampling 21 randomly selected 0.25 ha plots in our study area.

Combining literature on multi-level and polycentric governance of socioecological systems with transaction-cost economics, we argue that transaction costs structure cross-level information-sharing and collaboration relationships among organizations engaged in \{REDD\} + policy development at the national and provincial levels in Indonesia. Using an exponential random graph modelling approach with data collected from interviews with over 80 organizations between 2010 and 2012, we find that powerful organizations tend to dominate cross-level connections, though this effect is somewhat mediated by organizational similarity, which reduces transaction costs. We suggest that explicit efforts to help local organizations overcome the transaction costs of building cross-level relationships will be a central component of building an effective and equitable multi-level governance system for \{REDD\} + in Indonesia.

We used household income data from 7975 households in 24 developing countries across three continents collected by the Poverty Environment Network (PEN). We found 77% of households to be engaged in wild food collection from forest and non-forest environments even though the share of wild food income in total household income was on average only 4%. Poorer households and households experiencing shocks derived higher income shares from wild foods. State land is the main source of forest-derived wild food income while private lands are most important for non-forest wild food income. Considerable regional variation in determinants and the direction of significant relationships indicate there is no one-size-fits-all approach to integrating wild foods into food and forest policies. However, our results reveal potential to increase household food security by integrating wild foods into national food policies in more customized ways. "

abstract = "Biofuels are considered as a climate-friendly energy alternative. However, their environmental sustainability is increasingly debated because of land competition with food production, negative carbon balances and impacts on biodiversity. Arid and semi-arid lands have been proposed as a more sustainable alternative without such impacts. In that context this paper evaluates the carbon balance of potential land conversion to Jatropha cultivation, biofuel production and use in arid and semi-arid areas. This evaluation includes the calculation of carbon debt created by these land conversions and calculation of the minimum Jatropha yield necessary to repay the respective carbon debts within 15 or 30 years. The carbon debts caused by conversion of arid and semi-arid lands to Jatropha vary largely as a function of the biomass carbon stocks of the land use types in these regions. Based on global ecosystem carbon mapping, cultivated lands and marginal areas (sparse shrubs, herbaceous and bare areas) show to have similar biomass carbon stocks (on average 4–8 t C ha−1) and together cover a total of 1.79 billion ha. Conversion of these lands might not cause a carbon debt, but still might have a negative impact on other sustainability dimensions (e.g. biodiversity or socio-economics). Jatropha establishment in shrubland (0.75 billion ha) would cause a carbon debt of 24–28 t C ha−1 on average (repayable within 30 year with yield of 3.5–3.9 t seed ha−1 yr−1). Land use change in the 1.15 billion ha of forested area under arid and semi-arid climates could cause a carbon debt between 70 and 118 t C ha−1. This debt requires 8.6–13.9 t seed production ha−1 yr−1 for repayment within 30 years. If repayment is required within 15 years, the necessary minimum yields almost double. Considering that 5 t seed ha−1 yr−1 is the current maximum Jatropha yield, conversion of forests cannot be repaid within one human generation. Repayment of carbon debt from shrubland conversions in 30 years is challenging, but feasible. Repayment in 15 year is currently not attainable. Based on this analysis the paper discusses the carbon mitigation potential of biofuels in arid and semi-arid environments. "

abstract = "Summary Responses of biodiversity to changes in both land cover and climate are recognized [1] but still poorly understood [2]. This poses significant challenges for spatial planning as species could shift, contract, expand, or maintain their range inside or outside protected areas [2–4]. We examine this problem in Borneo, a global biodiversity hotspot [5], using spatial prioritization analyses that maximize species conservation under multiple environmental-change forecasts. Climate projections indicate that 11%–36% of Bornean mammal species will lose ≥30% of their habitat by 2080, and suitable ecological conditions will shift upslope for 23%–46%. Deforestation exacerbates this process, increasing the proportion of species facing comparable habitat loss to 30%–49%, a 2-fold increase on historical trends. Accommodating these distributional changes will require conserving land outside existing protected areas, but this may be less than anticipated from models incorporating deforestation alone because some species will colonize high-elevation reserves. Our results demonstrate the increasing importance of upland reserves and that relatively small additions (16,000–28,000 km2) to the current conservation estate could provide substantial benefits to biodiversity facing changes to land cover and climate. On Borneo, much of this land is under forestry jurisdiction, warranting targeted conservation partnerships to safeguard biodiversity in an era of global change. "

Most of the embryos from long-term anther cultures were haploid (90.7 percnt;), corresponding to their microspore origin. The presence of a low percentage of diploid embryos (7.4 percnt;) was observed. Microsatellite analysis of haploid embryos, indicated different microspores origins of the same anther. In the diploid embryos, homozygosity for different alleles was detected from anther wall tissues, excluding the possibility of clonal origin. The maintenance of a high proportion of haploid embryos, in long-term anther cultures, is similar in percentage to that reported in embryos originating after 20 days of plating (Bueno et al. 1997). This suggests that no significant alterations in the ploidy level occurred during long incubations (up to 12 months). These results suggest that ploidy changes are rare in this in vitro system, and do not significantly increase during long-term cultures. Microscopical studies of the microspore embryos in various stages revealed a healthy and well developed anatomy with no aberrant or chimeric structures. The general morphology of embryos appearing at different times after plating, looked similar to that of earlier embryos, as well as the zygotic embryos, indicating that they represent high quality material for cork oak breeding.

Two different markers were employed: \{RAPDs\} and AFLPs. Throughout the process, the origin of the apices (in vitro shoot from which they were excised) was recorded. Eight complete lines (from which \{DNA\} could be amplified after all the steps considered) were studied. Two out of twelve arbitrary primers showed polymorphisms. Three \{RAPD\} markers were replaced by three new ones in the Cr sample in one line. Using a different primer, a 700 bp fragment was absent from all samples from the 0.3 M sucrose-culture step (‘P’) onwards, in all the lines studied. The sequences of these fragments were studied to find similarities with known sequences. Polymorphic \{AFLP\} fragments were also observed, and most of the differences appeared from step ‘P’ onwards, pointing out the possible effect of this process (preculture on 0.3 M sucrose) in the \{DNA\} variation. These results show that genetic variation can appear throughout the cryopreservation process, and the low temperature itself is not the only stress risk of the technique. Therefore, genetic stability of the regenerants obtained after cryopreservation should be monitored. "

Careful harvesting regimes, using natural regeneration, could preserve genetic resources within commercially important species, both in reserves and in logged areas. We investigated the effects of two natural regeneration methods, shelterwood and group selection cutting, on subsequent pollen movement and mating system in four native stands of monospecific Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in the Guadarrama Chain of central Spain. Using TwoGener analysis, we estimated an average pollination distance of 17–22 m and a relatively large effective number of pollen donors (Nep&gt;70). We found a non-significant trend toward increasing pollination distance and larger effective number of pollen donors, subsequent to cutting. Considering the high conspecific density of the stands we studied (80–315 trees/ha), pollen dispersal estimates seem consistent with values from other studies, using other methods. Mating system analysis, using the \{MLTR\} mixed-mating model, showed high outcrossing rates for all four stands (tm=0.93–0.99), but failed to show significant effects of stand thinning, although slight increases of the outcrossing rate and the apparent rate of consanguineous mating (tm–ts) occurred, subsequent to cutting. Results suggest that the pollination system of Scots pine is resilient enough to preclude a negative impact of natural regeneration cutting. From the pollination point of view, normal Scots pine silvicultural systems seem compatible with genetic conservation purposes in central Spain. "

In both study areas, we observed recovery patterns similar to those described in the literature for tropical forest succession, although these were not necessarily related to the time elapsed since the gardens were established. The structure and composition of the managed gardens are a compromise between two opposite forces. Firstly, the natural succession process increases basal area and plant species richness. Secondly, the intensity of human intervention reduces species richness and partially or totally impedes an increase in the basal area. The importance of those forces depends on the biological requirements of the species managed, which determine the intensity of human control. In benzoin gardens, subjected to highly intense management, the recovery process of the forest is exclusively related to the silvicultural activities carried out therein. In rattan gardens, with less intervention in the system, changes in structure and composition are partially related to succession. "

Remaining between-plot variability was related with ecological attributes, as winter rainfall and altitude, resulting in a hybrid model. The third approach attempted to develop an ecological-type based model by considering a previous stratification of stone pine forests based on altitude, soil, geology and climate characteristics. The best model in terms of likelihood, bias and accuracy on predictions was the ecological-type one, producing unbiased marginal estimates for the main part of the territory with an efficiency reaching up to 39%. Due to the hierarchical structure of data set, proposed model was formulated as a multilevel mixed model. Stochastic formulation allows simulating cone production under different changing scenarios and describing real distribution of cone production within a given stand. Developed model constitutes the cone yield module for PINEA2, an integrated single tree model for the management of stone pine stands within the northern Plateau of Spain. "

In this study, the level of vegetative propagation and the genetic diversity found in a coppice forest of rebollo oak (Quercus pyrenaica) was examined. The current range of rebollo oak in the Iberian Peninsula reveals its adaptation to sub-Mediterranean mountain ecosystems. High sprouting capability, mainly by root suckers, has favoured traditional exploitation of rebollo oak in coppice forests. Using nine microsatellite loci, we have detected 14 clone assemblies compounded by 2–4 stems (7.9 ± 1.3 ramets per genet, considering stand density) and covering an average surface of 11.4 m2 per genet. The levels of genetic diversity and the amount of unique genotypes were high (D = 0.9972, G/N = 0.86) and similar to the clonality levels found in a nearby open oak woodland. Despite numerous clear-cutting rotations, known at least since 1750, and the heavy root sprouting observed after a thinning event, low clonal propagation (∼27%) was detected. This fact pointed towards the long-term persistence of several small clonal assemblies in this coppice. Our findings suggest that intense thinning practices are unadvisable in the conversion of Q. pyrenaica coppice into high forest due to the significant losses of genetic diversity when removing unique genotypes.

abstract = "The increasing demand for wood for barrel-making in addition to the rapid extension of alternative aging system, have led to looking into the possibility of utilizing Spanish oak. Quercus pyrenaica is the species that predominates in Spain, and the chemical composition of its heartwood (ellagitannins, low molecular weight phenolic and volatile compounds) and its incidence in characteristics of wine are similar to that of other species that are of recognized oenological quality for barrel-making, showing only quantitative differences with respect to French (Quercus petraea) and American (Quercus alba) species. However, at present, the quantity of good quality wood that we can obtain from the Q. pyrenaica Spanish forest is limited. Hence, in the short term, and considering the high chemical oenological quality of Q. pyrenaica wood, we propose the utilizing of chips, segments, staves, and other oak alternatives for wine aging, which would be obtained from wooden remnants from barrel-making as well as from trees with small diameters or physical defects which would normally be inappropriate for cooperage. With regards to the latter idea, studies on special chip-making processes, and other oak wood pieces are being carried out, especially focused on reducing seasoning time, and to toasting optimization as a function of wood piece size, in addition to its behaviour when incorporated into the different alternative aging systems. We present in this study the effect of seasoning way (traditional or unconventional) on volatile composition of Q. pyrenaica chips and staves at three toasting levels (light, medium and heavy), and the evolution of the wood-released aromatic composition of a Spanish artificially aged wine, using these alternative products. The wines showed in general small differences in their oak-derived characteristics, which were more related to the wood piece size and the toasting intensity than to the seasoning way, and they could be linked with the concentrations of compounds as eugenol, furfural, and the cis and trans isomers of β-methyl-γ-octolactone.

This paper shows the results obtained from the study of oxygen required by a same wine aged in tanks with different alternative products (chips and staves) made of American (Q. alba), French (Q. petraea) and Spanish oak (Q. pyrenaica), with a strategy of micro-oxygenation as required.

Factorial kriging and principal components analysis were used on a data set that comprised 721 soil samples. We found that the concentrations of heavy metals in the analysed samples do not exceed the limits set by Spanish legislation excepting mercury that presents high values in a limited number of samples (maximum 1041 μg/kg). The linear model of coregionalization–the basic model for factorial kriging analysis–was composed of two structures (representing two scales of variation) with ranges of 20 km (local scale) and 130 km (regional scale). Six of seven elements (Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, Zn and Cu) were found to be strongly correlated regardless of the spatial scale considered. In contrast, correlations of Hg with other elements were small at the local spatial scale but augmented substantially at the regional scale. We conclude that agricultural practices in the Duero basin have not altered yet the natural content for Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, Zn and Cu. On the other hand, Hg inputs from human origin, most probably related to airborne emission and deposition from industrial plants, are observable at the local spatial scale. Finally, no human-induced correlations among heavy metals were detected at the regional spatial scale. Based on the results of this study and in accordance with the results obtained in the nearby Ebro river basin (Rodríguez et al., 2008) we conclude that anthropogenic heavy metals in soil are visible only at local spatial scales. In contrast, natural factors maximize their influence on the distribution of heavy metals when considering larger spatial scales. "

Heartwood and sapwood thickness, together with age and radial growth traits were measured in each section. Heartwood tapered towards the top of the tree and disappeared at a certain height. Sapwood distribution was more variable among individuals; sapwood width was almost constant in some individuals but tapered slightly or with a curvilinear variation in others. Two general patterns of heartwood and sapwood variation were defined, one characterised by a constant decrease in heartwood percentage and subsequently a slight sapwood variation along the stem (uniform pattern) and another one with a peak in heartwood percentage at a height between 4 and 8 m (irregular pattern). The relative crown height to total tree height was significantly higher in the second group, averaging 49% versus 32% in the uniform group. A mechanical–physiological hypothesis is given to explain this result in the light of similar results in other species. A model including heartwood radius at breast and tree height as predicting variables was able to explain 90% of heartwood radius at a given height in the stem. A similar model with sapwood width at breast height explained 80% of sapwood width variation along the stem. Heartwood volume was predicted by means of log–linear regression models including heartwood diameter at breast height and tree height (r2=97.5%).

In the Brazilian Amazon, large-scale pasture for cattle ranching and soybean production are the main land uses, leading to a yearly deforestation rate of 0.5%. These conversions are mostly located in frontier areas distributed along the so-called “arc of deforestation”. Within this large zone, various land use change processes are interacting through several modes of land valuation and organisation. From several case studies in the State of Pará (Brazil), the current project aims at analysing how landscape dynamics are related to infrastructure development, ecological conditions, zoning policies and to the evolution and the organisation of the production, consumption and marketing chains of livestock products. This paper presents the results for one test site, the region of São Félix do Xingú, South of Pará. This region is the focus of land speculation, cattle expansion, and deforestation. Road construction, investments in electrical energy, financial credit for cattle, and the land reform policies have all fuelled this process. All these factors make this region one of the most dynamic agricultural frontiers in the Brazilian Amazon. The main objective of the paper is to improve our understanding of deforestation processes by crossing spatial analyses and livestock economics studies, and to characterise the role and impact of various natural and anthropic factors in the location and development of the main types of farmers, and their policy implications.

The paper demonstrates that: (a) macroeconomic policies promoted some industrial forestry activities in the post-independence period, more during the economic structural adjustment programme (ESAP) era when there were more pro-export policies, and then less in the recent post-ESAP years when dirigisme returned and the economy almost collapsed; (b) economic reform policies which initially had the greatest impact on industrial forestry were those of trade liberalisation and domestic deregulation, which came at a time when world timber markets were strengthening and therefore provided the timber industry with the capacity to grow, develop a wide range of products and adopt an export focus; (c) timber production for construction tends to increase with economic growth and vice versa; (d) in the post-ESAP period the forest industry has been characterised by uncertainty of tenure for its plantations due to recent changes in land laws, high inflation that erodes profitability, local market shrinkage due to prevailing stressed economy, loss of investor confidence and unrealistic currency exchange rates that make exporting unattractive. All these combine to form a very hostile environment for the forestry industry. "

The assessment is guided by an analytical framework that predicts the relevance and receptiveness of different timber supply chains to current systems of trade-based governance. We find that Brazil's efforts to control illegal deforestation through satellite monitoring have contributed significantly to reducing deforestation, but the effects on degradation are less clear. Efforts focused on the timber supply chain, including certification and legal verification of traded timber, have been limited by the fragmented nature of Amazonian wood production. Both certification and legality verification favor large producers and concentrated supply chains destined for external markets (e.g. pulp and paper and high-value tropical sawnwood), while extensive legal requirements inhibit local benefit-capture. In order to prevent the means of forest governance (i.e. certification and law enforcement) from trumping its commonly stated ends (sustainable forest management and local welfare), there is a need to prioritize the generation of local benefit from locally adapted production systems.

This study explored the use of the spatially explicit \{FALLOW\} model, with a new livestock module, to assess the impact of land use zoning strategies, in combination with access to fodder harvesting, on welfare, fodder availability and landscape carbon stocks in the Upper Konto catchment, Indonesia. The existing land zoning in Upper Konto catchment is in name ‘land-sparing’ but de facto combined with ‘land sharing’ approach with access to cut and carry fodder sources in watershed protection areas. Scenario analysis revealed that the existing land zoning approach is the most promising in terms of balancing fodder availability, farmers’ welfare (total profits gained from production in the landscape minus products consumed by people living in the area) and ecosystem functions (with above-ground carbon stocks as indicator). A pure land sparing approach with agricultural intensification indicates increase in farmers’ welfare but with a higher decrease (in percentage) of landscape above-ground carbon stocks. Hence, careful integration of livestock systems into zoned conservation areas can achieve multiple goals including enhancing peoples’ livelihoods and protecting environmental services. "

The objective of this paper is to evaluate whether meta-analyses applied to studies comparing water flows in tropical watersheds under natural or planted forests and non-forest lands can provide useful results for valuing watershed ecosystem services and making decisions. The meta-analyses show significantly lower total flows or base flows under planted forests than non-forest land uses. Meta-analyses conducted with subsamples of the data also show lower total flow and higher base flow under natural forests than non-forest land uses. However, the available studies were restricted to humid climates and particular forest types (Pinus and Eucalyptus planted forests and lowland natural forests). The small number of available studies with sufficient original data is a major constraint in the application of meta-analyses. This represents a major technical challenge for valuation studies or payment for ecosystem services, especially in countries where financial resources for implementing field research are scarce. "

A thinning experiment was established in 1993 on a 32-year-old Pinus nigra Arn. stand in central Spain. The response of growth, climate-growth relationships and intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) to a stand density reduction were compared between moderate thinned plots and a control plot by a combined analysis of basal area increments (BAI), and C and O stable isotope ratios (δ13Cc and δ18Oc). \{BAI\} in the control plot showed a decreasing trend that was avoided by thinning in the thinned plot. Thinning also partially buffered tree-ring response to climate and trees were less sensitive to precipitation although more sensitive to temperature. Δ13Cc in the thinned plot was not modified indicating that stomatal conductance (g) and photosynthetic capacity (A) did not change or change in the same direction. However, δ18Oc decreased in the control plot (unrelated to δ18O of precipitation) but not in the thinned plot, suggesting a relative increase of temperature and irradiance and/or a decrease of air humidity after reducing the density consistent with an increase in A, g and BAI. As \{WUEi\} did not increase in the thinned plot, faster growth in this plot was caused by higher abundance of resources per tree. The trend of \{WUEi\} in both plots indicated low-moderate CO2-induced improvements. Thinning might be a useful adaptation measure against climate change in these plantations reducing their vulnerability to droughts. However, because \{WUEi\} was not affected, the positive growth response might be limited if droughts and warming continue and certain thresholds are exceeded. "

The Canary Island pine provides an excellent case to study the significance of critically endangered marginal populations (from 20 to a few hundred trees) in an endemic conifer that is also extensively used in commercial plantations. Our chloroplast microsatellite (cpSSR) survey showed contrasting values of haplotypic genetic diversity in marginal populations of Canary Island pine, from very low at Garabato (northern La Gomera) and Anaga (Tenerife), located within broad-leaved tree formations, to very high in Gran Canaria marginal populations (Arguineguin and Galdar). Competition with broad-leaved vegetation, after rare long-distance colonization events, might explain present-day low levels of variation in Garabato and Anaga. Gran Canaria and southern La Gomera relict populations, which contain high haplotypic diversity, are probably remnants of larger populations severely reduced by adverse climatic conditions and human activities, the latter starting shortly after the European colonization of the islands in the \{XV\} century. Given the extremely low population numbers and a general lack of natural regeneration, the risk of extinction in the near future is high in marginal populations of Canary Island pine. Conservation activities are urgently required and should focus on the highly diverse Gran Canaria and southern La Gomera pine marginal populations. Here, the establishment of in situ genetic reserves (Arguineguin and Imada), and multifunctional ex situ collections (Arguineguin and Galdar), such as seed orchards, is highly recommended. In addition, common garden experiments to test the performance of potentially drought-tolerant genotypes from Arguineguin (southernmost Gran Canaria’s relict) and potential risks due to inbreeding and/or outbreeding depression should be established.

abstract = "Abstract Invasive species currently pose a major environmental challenge. Understanding their development and the factors associated with their expansion is the first step towards developing effective control measures. This work proposes the use of detailed spatio-temporal information from forest monitoring systems to assess the demographic rates, spatio-temporal patterns and spread determinants of invasive plants in forest ecosystems. For this purpose, we selected two of the most widespread non-native plants in Europe: Acacia dealbata and Acacia melanoxylon. Focusing on the forested area of northwest Spain and based on the comparison of two cycles of the Spanish National Forest Inventory, this study analyzes the dynamics of Acacia species between 1998 and 2008 in regards to changes in their spatial distribution, dominance, abundance, diametrical (dbh) structure and regeneration. In addition, the forested area was classified into forest types to identify the forests which are more susceptible to invasion. Finally, through general linear models, this study analyzes the relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors determining the spread of Acacia species over the studied period. The results confirm a rapid expansion in the presence of Acacia species in the forests of \{NW\} Spain, with annual spread rates around 0.1%. These two species are increasing their dominance across most forest types in the study area, where they are becoming the dominant species in the regeneration of some of them. Environmental factors and connectivity between Acacia populations are identified as the main factors associated with their spread into new areas. Additionally, the combination of disturbances and biotic factors associated with stand structure (total basal area, richness and tree cover) appear to determine the vulnerability or resistance of some forest to their spread. The early stage of invasion detected highlights the potential of Acacia species to continue spreading. This aspect, in conjunction with the high degree of disturbances (mainly fires) in this region, could be critical in determining the configuration of future forest landscapes in \{NW\} Spain. This study demonstrates the value of considering broad-scale periodic forest surveys to monitor biological invasions in forests ecosystems. The spatially-explicit data obtained from these surveys can contribute not only to furthering our knowledge with regard to invasion biology but also to developing more efficient conservation and management strategies.

Relative glucose recovery in presence of laccase (10 IU/g substrate) with model cellulosic substrate (Sigmacell) at 10% (w/v) was almost 10% points lower (P &lt; 0.01) than in the absence of laccase. This fact could be due to an increase in the competition of cellulose binding sites between the enzymes and a slight inhibition of β-glucosidase activity. However, enzymatic hydrolysis and infrared spectra of laccase-treated and untreated wheat straw filtered pretreated residue (WS-FPR), revealed that a grafting process of phenoxy radicals onto the lignin fiber could be the cause of diminished accessibility of cellulases to cellulose in pretreated wheat straw.

Selective logging is one of the main sources of \{GHG\} emissions; but few studies in Cameroon have analyzed the impact of selective logging activities on above-ground biomass (AGB). This has resulted in a gap in essential information needed for the design of suitable forest management policies that can guarantee reductions in \{GHG\} emissions. In this study, we assessed the impact of selective logging on \{AGB\} in a forest concession in South-East Cameroon by quantifying \{AGB\} logged and \{AGB\} damaged by logging. We equally investigated through linear regression modeling whether the density of logging roads and \{NDVI3\} Normalized difference vegetation index. 3 values (from \{MODIS\} 250 m) can be used to predict the quantity of \{AGB\} logged. Allometric equations were used to estimate \{AGB\} of trees, while the surface area of logging infrastructures and the unit area value (ha−1) of \{AGB\} for the forest zone of Cameroon permitted the calculation of \{AGB\} damaged by logging. The study reveals that 0.78 trees ha−1; an equivalence of 6.97 Mg ha −1 of \{AGB\} was logged. Logging affected a surface area of 85.04 ha; approximately 2% of the study area. This is equivalent to 0.02 ha ha−1 and 5.65 Mg ha−1 of \{AGB\} damaged. The density of the logging roads explained 66% of the variation in \{AGB\} logged, while the density of the logging roads and \{NDVI\} values together explained 73% of the variation. This study concludes as follows: (i) selective logging reduces \{AGB\} stock of the forest and the magnitude of the impact varies with the different activities of selective logging, (ii) ground-based measurements facilitated by \{GIS\} permitted to quantify the impact of selective logging on AGB, (iii) logging roads and \{NDVI\} (which can either be field measured or captured remotely) can be used to indirectly determine \{AGB\} logged, hence can contribute in the measurement and monitoring of forest degradation caused by selective logging, and (iv) the findings from this study can usefully support the design of sustainable forest management policies, which are beneficiary to the \{REDD\} + process in Cameroon.

Shrub clearing is a traditional silvicultural practice aimed to: (1) facilitate cork extraction (conducted every nine years); (2) increase cork yield by reducing competition from neighbouring shrubs; and (3) reduce fire risk by decreasing fuel load. These silvicultural practices, however, may interfere with current objectives of conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. The effects of shrub clearing on different diversity components were assessed in three structurally contrasting forests sites, located in Southern Spain. A fenced experimental plot (1 ha) was established at each forest site. Half of each plot was shrub-cleared and the other half was left unmanaged (control stand). Afterwards, the presence of herbaceous species was monitored during five consecutive years in a total of 120 permanent quadrats (1 m2). Species richness (α- and γ-diversity) increased with the clearing, mainly by expansion of open grassland species, while β-diversity declined due to the homogenizing process associated with this expansion. Thus, the herbaceous species composition was modified by these silvicultural practices, especially the second year following treatment application. Effects differed across forest stands, being more marked in the Open Woodland, while there was no significant effect observed in the closed Forest. Understorey herbaceous communities were resilient to shrub clearing and initial diversity values were approximately restored after five years. The high resprouting potential of shrubs contributed to this resilience. Based on the results of this study, we propose several low costs strategies to be incorporated in forest management plans to reconcile cork oak extraction with the maintenance of biodiversity. "

In this stage reactive oxygen species play a role in proliferation, while other proteins like \{CAD\} and \{PR5\} seem to be implied in embryonic competence. In the transition to the cotyledonary stage diverse \{ROS\} detoxification enzymes are activated and reserve products (mainly carbohydrates and proteins) are accumulated, whereas energy production is increased probably to participate in the synthesis of primary metabolites such as amino acids and fatty acids.

The overall model is a hierarchical system that consists of three main components: a stand height projection function, a stand basal area projection function and a merchantable stand volume equation. In the model, the initial stand conditions at any point in time are defined by two state variables usually collected from common forest inventories: stand mean height and stand basal area. The model includes two transition functions, derived by the generalized algebraic difference approach, to enable projection of these variables at any particular time. The projected variables were incorporated into a merchantable stand volume equation to enable calculation of the commercial stand volume at a minimum diameter, which establish a merchantability threshold. Sensitive analysis of the accuracy of the predictions of the submodels according to the length of the time interval was achieved by use of the critical error statistic and the \{RMSE\} in relative proportion of the mean.

To explore evolutionary patterns, the Mediterranean pines’ phylogeny was first reconstructed analyzing a new set of 21 low-copy nuclear genes with multilocus Bayesian tree reconstruction methods. Secondly, a phylogenetic approach was used to search for footprints of natural selection and to examine the evolution of multiple phenotypic traits. We identified two genes (involved in pines’ defense and stress responses) that have likely played a role in the adaptation of Mediterranean pines to their environment. Moreover, few life-history traits showed historical or evolutionary adaptive convergence in Mediterranean lineages, while patterns of character evolution revealed various evolutionary trade-offs linking growth-development, reproduction and fire-related traits. Assessing the evolutionary path of important life-history traits, as well as the genomic basis of adaptive variation is central to understanding the past evolutionary success of Mediterranean pines and their future response to environmental changes.

Shaded seedlings displayed an extremely low dry weight, 2% of well-illuminated seedlings biomass at the end of the experiment (158 days). Light × water interactions were significant for most traits considered. However, the complementary allometric analysis showed that the effect of water availability under high irradiance could be explained through ontogenetic differences related to plant size. Shaded plants exhibited higher root biomass and reduced leaf area ratio in response to low water availability, and this was confirmed by allometric analysis. By contrast, plants under full sunlight showed only apparent plasticity; i.e. ratios for both watering treatments belonged to common allometric trajectories. Moreover, only the seedlings under low irradiance underwent a significant decrease in specific needle area due to a shortage in water availability. We, therefore, conclude that the effect of the imposed drought was more dramatic in the shaded environment. "

abstract = "Many external effects of land use change are based on modifications of lateral flows of soil, water, air, fire or organisms. Lateral flows can be intercepted by filters and thus the severity and spatial range of external effects of land use change is under the influence of filter effects. Wherever lateral flows are involved, research results cannot be simply scaled on an area basis, and overall impact does not follow simple linear causal relationships. This complexity has consequences for relationships amongst the primary agents who initiate or exacerbate external effects, other stakeholders who are affected by them and policymakers who attempt to mitigate problems that reach sufficient visibility in society. In this paper we review how the relative importance of lateral flows and filter effects differs among a number of externalities, and the implications this has for research methods. If flows and filters are incompletely understood, policies may be based on fallacies. Whereas ‘fire-breaks’ act as filters in the lateral flow of the high temperature pulse of a fire, smoke from land-based fires can be intercepted only by rainfall acting as a filter and the external impact of smoke is determined by the atmospheric conditions governing lateral flow and chemical transformations along the pathway. Causal relations in smoke and haze problems are relatively simple and may form a basis for designing policy interventions to reduce downwind damage. For biodiversity issues, landscape connectivity, the absence of filters restricting dispersal and movement of organisms, is increasingly recognised as an influence on the dynamics of species richness and its scaling relations. Biodiversity research methods can extend beyond the current descriptive stage into clarifying causal relations with a lateral flow perspective. The question whether connectivity is in fact desired, however, depends on stakeholder interests and situation. Forest functions in watershed protection, presumably leading to a continuous flow of clean water in the dry season through the subsoil instead of a rapid surface transfer, have been generally attributed to the trees rather than the forest, with its rough surface structure, swamps and infiltration sites. A new synthesis of site-specific hydrological knowledge and tree water balance studies may be needed to separate myth from reality, and avoid wasting public funds on tree planting under the heading of reforestation, without restoring the hydrological regime of a real forest. Soil movement can be intercepted at a range of scales and in as far as soil transport entails movement of soil fertility, filter zones can be very productive elements of a landscape. To achieve ‘integrated natural resource management’ all external effects of land use will somehow have to be taken into account in farmer decision making about the use of natural resources on and off farm. Farmers’ ecological knowledge may include concepts of lateral flows and should be further explored as an integral part of a new landscape ecological approach. "

The present study is based on data collected from a 6 years seed trap experiment considering different regeneration felling intensities. From a spatial perspective, we attempted alternate established kernels under different data distribution assumptions to fit a spatial model able to predict P. pinea seed rain. Due to P. pinea umbrella-like crown, models were adapted to account for crown effect through correction of distances between potential seed arrival locations and seed sources. In addition, individual tree fecundity was assessed independently from existing models, improving parameter estimation stability. Seed rain simulation enabled to calculate seed dispersal indexes for diverse silvicultural regeneration treatments. The selected spatial model of best fit (Weibull, Poisson assumption) predicted a highly clumped dispersal pattern that resulted in a proportion of gaps where no seed arrival is expected (dispersal limitation) between 0.25 and 0.30 for intermediate intensity regeneration fellings and over 0.50 for intense fellings. To describe the temporal pattern, the proportion of seeds released during monthly intervals was modelled as a function of climate variables – rainfall events – through a linear model that considered temporal autocorrelation, whereas cone opening took place over a temperature threshold. Our findings suggest the application of less intensive regeneration fellings, to be carried out after years of successful seedling establishment and, seasonally, subsequent to the main rainfall period (late fall). This schedule would avoid dispersal limitation and would allow for a complete seed release. These modifications in present silviculture practices would produce a more efficient seed shadow in managed stands. "

New Caledonia is a group of islands in the \{SW\} Pacific that are currently under influence of \{ENSO\} events. Endemic to New Caledonia, the long-living species of Agathis lanceolata and A. ovata, growing on poor ultramafic-derived soils may provide valuable proxies for the local climate and for ENSO. These trees present visible growth bands of changing thickness along their circumference. However, several bands are locally absent, and the growth axis is generally offset with respect to the geometrical axis of the tree. This led us to compute so-called composite ring thickness profiles, accounting for the geometry of growth bands on the whole surface of a tree disk. Our computational method involves 10 optical density profiles measured along 10 equally spaced radii drawn from the bark toward the growth axis, and 10 to 20 master rings, that can be easily identified on the whole disk. Growth bands visible on less than 5 radii were discarded. Our method is similar to the cross-dating method used by dendrochronologists, except that it is applied here to a single tree disk. Our samples consist of three disks of A. lanceolata, one disk of A. ovata, and one disk of Araucaria columnaris. Multiple regressions have been computed between composite profiles and climatic variables i.e. monthly and yearly temperatures and rainfall amounts. The best correlation is found between the width of the ring growing between July (n − 1) and June (n) with the rainfalls of June (n), June (n − 1) and June (n − 2). Monthly rainfalls allow to explain between 20% to 50% of the ring thickness variance, a result similar to that obtained with other studies on Agathis of New Zealand. No temperature parameter appears in the most stable regressions. 30 measurements of tree ring cellulose δ18O have been conducted on one single disk selected for the strong climate-ring width correlation. While earlier studies have used δ18O measurements to identify seasonal cycles in tropical woods and date the rings, our data suggest that the direct use of δ18O is misleading due to false rings that do not correspond to a complete growth year. When these false rings are identified from the disk analysis and discarded, a fair visual correlation with the total rainfall during the growth season is obtained. This requires information that cannot be found in single growth band thickness profiles, for example as obtained by coring. Thus, Araucariacae of New Caledonia may present a valuable potential for dendroclimatology. However, reconstructing a chronology of this region will require more extensive sampling and possibly an account of additional species. "

The exploration of market opportunities for the commercialization of forest goods and services has become the prevailing conservation approach. It is likely that the generation of income from forests will motivate forest owners and users to appreciate and use their resources more sustainably. After more than 20 years of applying, adjusting and expanding this approach, this paper critically reflects on its main assumptions, successes and consequences with a special emphasis on the Amazon's natural forests. Over time, three major strategies have been outlined to translate the approach into practice: (1) the management of timber by logging companies in forest concessions, (2) the use of timber and non-timber forest products by smallholders and communities, and (3) the selling of environmental services that forests provide, in particular carbon. The analysis revealed that the commercialization of goods and services from natural forests has indeed the potential to generate income, yet their financial attractiveness is rather limited if compared with other land use options. This seriously affects the probability that forest-related uses at a wider scale will be successful. It also became evident that the legal-institutional framework set up to facilitate economic gains from the forests' commercial potential tended to discriminate against traditional forest users who, due to disparate reasons, would be willing to accept the modest financial returns from managing natural forests in commercial ways. It is discussed that the feasibility of market approaches, in contrast to the assumptions of free market environmentalism, depends on effective measures to strengthen the role and market position of local forest users and on initiatives from firms to invest in the establishment of more sustainable commodities even when a reduction in profits are a possibility.

Water stress is forecasted to increase drastically in the next decades in certain regions, such as in the Mediterranean basin. Consequently, a proper knowledge of the response and adaptations to drought stress is essential for the correct management of plant genetic resources. However, most of the advances in the understanding of the molecular response to water stress have been attained in angiosperms, and are not always applicable to gymnosperms. In this work we analyse the transcriptional response of two emblematic Mediterranean pines, Pinus pinaster and Pinus pinea, which show noticeable differences in their performance under water stress. Using microarray analysis, up to 113 genes have been detected as significantly induced by drought in both species. Reliability of expression patterns has been confirmed by RT-PCR. While induced genes with similar profiles in both species can be considered as general candidate genes for the study of drought response in conifers, genes with diverging expression patterns can underpin the differences displayed by these species under water stress. Most promising candidate genes for drought stress response include genes related to carbohydrate metabolism, such as glycosyltransferases or galactosidases, sugar transporters, dehydrins and transcription factors. Additionally, differences in the molecular response to drought and polyethylene-glycol-induced water stress are also discussed. "

Drawing on data collected in six villages under two REDD+ projects targeted in Cameroon, this paper addresses four questions: (1) What are the tenure conditions at the two study sites? (2) How have the project proponents perceived the tenure and other challenges and how do they plan to address those challenges? (3) What have the proponents done to engage communities in the process of establishing REDD+? (4) Are communities informed about and satisfied with the process of establishing REDD+? The paper shows that while the proponents have worked to resolve tenure issues and engage communities, there is still frustration among project participants because of a lack of progress toward implementing compensation and benefit sharing system. The paper concludes that it is crucial to safeguard the rights, access and participation of local communities, and benefits to them, throughout the design and implementation of REDD+ projects. "

The results showed that \{MSW\} compost increased Cu, Pb and Zn in soil, while \{NPK\} fertilizer increased Cd and Ni, but decreased Hg concentration in soil. The root system acted as a barrier for Cr, Ni, Pb and Hg, so metal uptake and translocation were lower in aerial plant parts. Biomass production was significantly enhanced in both \{MSW\} and \{NPK\} fertilizer-amended soils (17%), but also provoked slight increases of metals and their bioavailability in soil. The highest metal concentrations were observed in roots, but there were no significant differences between plants growing in amended soil and the control soil.

Toasting notably changed these profiles, in general, proportionally to toasting intensity and led to a minor differentiation among species in toasted woods, although we also found phenolic markers in toasted woods. Thus, methyl syringate, benzoic acid, methyl vanillate, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3,4,5-trimethylphenol and p-coumaric acid, condensed tannins of the procyanidin type, and the flavonoids naringenin, aromadendrin, isosakuranetin and taxifolin will be a good tool to identify cherry wood.

The article develops an alternative approach for six timber concessions in Cameroon, Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo, in which the foremost purpose of \{MFM\} is to solve or reduce actual conflicts of uses, notably regarding agriculture, hunting, chainsaw milling and firewood collection. On the other hand, the costs of implementing \{MFM\} measures are rarely estimated and assigned to concerned actors. The costs of resolving conflicts of use were evaluated in the same concessions, based on consensual solutions elaborated by the logging companies, the forestry and agriculture administrations and the local people. In half of these concessions, the cost of \{MFM\} equals or exceeds 1.5 million dollars in the next fifteen years. Several trade-offs are possible between these stakeholders, combining tax relief, technical and financial support to local development, and reduction of some illegal practices. "

The environmental effects of such conversions have raised global concerns due to the potential to increase nitrous oxide emissions (N2O) to the atmosphere. To quantify this effect, we conducted a series of monthly \{N2O\} flux measurements between July 2010 and August 2011 using a static chamber method in an undisturbed forest, a disturbed forest, a one year old rubber plantation, a twenty year old rubber plantation and an eight year old oil palm plantation. All plantations belonged to smallholders and were usually not fertilized. In order to understand the effect of management intensification on \{N2O\} fluxes, we applied nitrogen (N) as urea (33.3 kg N ha−1) in the oil palm plantation in April 2011 and monitored the emissions intensively until 28 days after fertilizer application. Nitrous oxide consumption was significant in these weathered soils, accounting for 30% of recorded flux data, although 17% of the negative fluxes fell below detection limits. Most of these happened in the oil palm plantation and undisturbed forest. Annual \{N2O\} emission rates amounted to 1.73 ± 0.48, 1.22 ± 0.27, 1.34 ± 0.36, 1.02 ± 0.27 and 1.04 ± 0.39 kg N ha−1 y−1 in the undisturbed forest, disturbed forest, one year old rubber plantation, twenty year old rubber plantation and oil palm plantation, respectively. Forest disturbance and conversion to rubber and oil palm plantation did not significantly affect annual \{N2O\} emission rates. However in the oil palm plantation, the amount of N emitted as \{N2O\} was high (3.1 ± 1.2% of the fertilizer N applied), so at a typical fertilizer application rate of 141 kg N ha−1 y−1, annual emissions would have amounted to 4.4 ± 1.6 kg N ha−1 y−1, more than twice the emission rate in the undisturbed forest. Dry mass and nitrogen mass in standing litter, distance to the nearest termite nest, rainfall on the day of measurement and air temperature were the key factors that predicted annual \{N2O\} fluxes across the land-use change transitions.

This is the first time that these entomopathogenic fungi have been isolated from M. galloprovincialis beetles. Assays showed the B. pseudobassiana \{EABps\} 11/01-Mg strain to be highly virulent against the pine sawyer. Horizontal and vertical transmission were assessed for both aqueous (1 × 108 conidia/ml) and dry (4.25 × 109 conidia/g) conidial formulations. Evidence of horizontal or vertical transmission was not found when insects were inoculated with the aqueous conidial suspension. However, when dry conidia were applied, 100% of the horizontally-infected insects died and their average survival times (AST) were significantly reduced (from 21.10 and 25.00 days in controls to 10.40 and 10.00 days in infected males and females, respectively). Compared to control females, numbers of egg-laying wounds, eggs laid, live larvae after 5 days and larvae entering the xylem after 6 months were significantly reduced in both inoculated females and clean females that had mated with inoculated males, pointing to horizontally-induced reduction of progeny. These results validate the potential of the isolated B. pseudobassiana strain as an important natural population regulator. Through auto-dissemination techniques, it could be used for the integrated control of Pine Wood Nematode vectors and constitute a new tool for Pine Wilt Disease management. "

The Mediterranean mountain forest ecosystems can be severely affected by climate change since an increment in temperature has been observed. The main aim of this work was to analyze shifts in the distribution and changes in the abundance of Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Mediterranean mountains over a period of 47 years (1965–2012) by using data from the National Forest Inventories, extending the Universal Kriging/Cokriging models to the space–time case for long-term forest inventory data analysis including climatic variables. Our results indicated that both the distribution and the abundance of Scots pine remained quite constant during the study period. Pyrenean oak increased its presence by 42% whereas its abundance doubled between 1965 and 2012. This movement took place towards both higher and lower altitudes. With regard to climatic factors, the kriging models showed a negative association between the presence of Scots pine and the temperature. However, we found a quadratic relationship between the Pyrenean oak and temperature, pointing to the occurrence of at intermediate altitudes. Additionally, we found significant relationships between the rainfall and the abundance of both species. Rainfall was positively related to the abundance of Scots pine and negatively to that of Pyrenean oak. Our results indicate that there has been a threefold increase in the area covered by mixed stands. However, successive land use changes as well as forest policies related to conservation have played an important role in the distribution of both species and therefore are taken into account in the discussion of these results.

We use a large global-comparative dataset to test these responses. We find households rank forest-extraction responses to shocks lower than most common alternatives. For seasonal gap-filling, forest extraction also has limited importance. The minority of households using forests for coping is asset-poor and lives in villages specialized on forests, in particular timber extraction. Overall, forest resources may be less important as a buffer between agricultural harvests and in times of unforeseen hardship than has been found in many case studies. "

The paper mainly aims at identifying the main drivers of household behavior regarding collection of main forest products in the context of dry forest environment. A multivariate probit analysis was used to explain variation in household participation in collection of different forest products. The results show that households' participation in collection of different forest products is significantly determined by a combination of household demographic characteristics, ownership of oxen and of cows, proximity to forest, access to health and school infrastructure, resettlement history and self-reported change in standard of living. The estimation results also suggest households most likely to engage in collection of forest honey, gum, and wood for fuel and other purposes are those located farther from the forest.

We analysed the structure of genetic diversity of 17 populations from 11 river valleys that are part of seven catchment systems (Danube, Ebro, Elbe, Po, Rhine, Rhone, and Usk) in Europe, in relation to geography and river management. In total, 1069 trees were genotyped using \{AFLP\} and microsatellite markers. The trees had an observed heterozygosity of 0.74 (range 0.59–0.82 across microsatellite loci). The majority (72.6–90.8%, depending on the marker system) of the genetic variation was present within populations. Most pairs of populations along a river were relatively similar (pairwise Fst 0.042–0.135 based on AFLP, 0.002–0.037 based on microsatellites). Overall population differentiation among rivers was considerable (Fst among populations was 0.268 based on AFLP, and 0.081 based on microsatellites). An analysis using the program Structure indicated that all populations recruited plants from several clusters. Geographically close populations tended to draw from the same Structure clusters, including populations from adjacent catchments. The Danube and Inn populations in Austria were genetically more similar to the Vltava population (Elbe catchment) in Czech Republic than the geographically more distant populations along the Tisa and Prut rivers of the Danube catchment in Ukraine. This indicates that gene flow and dispersal takes place across fairly large distances and between river catchments. Consistent with this result, a principal coordinate analysis of genetic distances among individual trees based on \{AFLP\} bands showed large overlap of populations, although the French and Spanish samples formed distinct clusters, and the samples from the Ticino (Italy) were at an intermediate position. The extent of clonal duplication was highest along regulated rivers, with e.g., 41% clonal duplication along the Rhine in The Netherlands (up to 32 trees for one genet). The Usk contained a man-made population (two genotypes along the entire river, one genet present as 70 trees out of 72 trees sampled). No clonal duplication was found along dynamic rivers, such as the Ebro (Spain), the Drome (France), and the Tisa and Prut (Ukraine). It is concluded that the restoration of the natural habitat and the re-creation of the natural dynamics of the floodplain, in combination with sufficiently sized and spaced natural populations as seed sources, are the most important measures for sufficient natural regeneration and conservation of this species in the future.

However, it is unclear how such an approach can be designed in the scale necessary to match local, national and international interests in protecting forests. For this reason, the functions of intermediaries deserve explicit recognition by key actors in shaping \{REDD\} + policy nationally and internationally. Indonesia is promoting the more localized Forest Management Unit (Kesatuan Pengelolaan Hutan or KPH) as a key element of forest governance reform for embracing \{REDD\} + and related initiatives. Using a case study from eastern Indonesia, we analyzed local factors driving deforestation and forest degradation. We then reviewed the work of the local \{KPH\} to examine the necessary roles of a potential \{REDD\} + intermediary. We argue that progress made by the local \{KPH\} in improving forest governance, including partnerships with local communities, is made possible by the \{KPH\} fulfilling the role of policy intermediary while taking on transformative roles reshaping internal and external relations. However, for the \{KPHs\} to fulfill their mandate as effective \{REDD\} + intermediaries, more concerted efforts from the central and provincial governments, as well as from international donors, are still needed. These include greater consistency in government policies and regulations, improved policy communications, and the commitment to strengthening the capacity of individual KPHs. "

Both approaches have the clear advantages of simplicity and the possibility of fitting to an evolving greenhouse gas emission reduction regime. The authors consider the strengths and limitations of each proposal and build upon them to address several implementation challenges and options for improvement. Given the urgency of avoiding dangerous climate change, the timely development of technically sound, politically acceptable, cost-effective and practicable measures to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation is essential. These two approaches take us a step closer to this goal, but they need to be refined rapidly to enable this goal to be realised. "

Lack of quantity, quality, uniformity and price as well as a lack understanding of \{NTFPs\} socioeconomic, cultural or spiritual value and function in societies relegates them to a marginal economic status eclipsed by timber. The data vacuum for most \{NTFPs\} is contrasted by the large amount of timber-specific data available for many logged species. Such data sources can offer insights into the extraction level and locations of a subset of species that are valued for both timber and NTFPs. These are referred to as ‘conflict-of-use’ species. In this article we examine three such species, focusing on the Amazonian state of Pará. Pará is situated in the Brazilian “arc of deforestation” and the state accounts for 47% of all timber produced in the Legal Amazon. We describe three highly-utilized Amazonian \{NTFPs\} currently logged commercially: (1) Cumuru, Dipteryx odorata, which bears a seed yielding an essential oil employed in the perfume industry and providing income and medicine to rural families; (2) Amapá amargoso, Parahancornia fasciculata, which produces a powerful exudate used as a treatment of respiratory diseases; and (3) Uxi, Endopleura uchi, which produces a nutritious fruit consumed by humans and wildlife. We analyze data from the timber industry indicating the rate of extraction of these species, as well as data regarding their use and value as NTFPs. Results indicate that extraction of these species in logging frontiers contributes to declining access. However, in communities with links to markets, undocumented management systems supply the increasing demand for \{NTFPs\} in urban areas. While there are no formal management plans for these species and few scientific attempts made to manage them, small holders have developed local knowledge and innovative techniques to improve productivity, increase density and create multiple-use systems in the face of growing land use pressures.

Conjoint analysis was used for the weight estimations.

Although now largely discredited, this assumption remains a foundation of laissez-faire policies that anticipate energy transition resulting spontaneous forest recovery with economic development. Our results suggest that such policies can undermine broader policy objectives and actually worsen forest conditions in rural Indonesia. Based on a case study of forest margin communities in eastern Indonesia, we demonstrate that fuel subsidy reform did little to reduce rural household demand for fuelwood, while dramatically increasing fuelwood demand for processing agricultural products. Our results show how household decisions related to fuel sources are affected by non-economic considerations and external factors, such as opportunities to sell fuelwood. We argue that policy interventions that encourage energy transition of households do not necessarily improve forest conditions, as household fuelwood use may be a symptom, rather than a driver of deforestation and forest degradation. Thus policies to improve forest conditions should focus more on addressing the market environment of forest-margin communities, providing energy alternatives to small industries that are often the larger consumers of fuelwood.

However, the interaction between climate warming and precipitation reduction on soil respiration has not been well documented. This study aimed to determine the impacts of soil warming and throughfall reduction on soil respiration and its components (heterotrophic respiration and autotrophic respiration). A field manipulation experiment with soil warming and throughfall reduction was conducted in an oak natural forest (Quercus aliena) at a transitional climatic zone in central China during the growing seasons (May–November) in 2011 and 2012. Soil temperature was elevated by 1.23–1.66 °C relative to the ambient environment by using infrared heaters, and throughfall was reduced by 50% through roof interception. There were significant interactive effects of soil warming and throughfall reduction on soil respiration and autotrophic respiration in both 2011 and 2012. Soil warming substantially elevated soil respiration by 32.0–46.3% and autotrophic respiration by 57.8–63.2% without throughfall reduction, respectively, but suppressed both of them with throughfall reduction. Throughfall reduction increased soil respiration by 16.2–37.2% and autotrophic respiration by 62.9–97.7% under ambient temperature, whereas decreased them by 13.7–29.2% and 22.6–51.9% under soil warming. Heterotrophic respiration was significantly increased by soil warming while showed little effect by throughfall reduction or its interactions with soil warming. The offset of the positive warming effect on soil respiration under throughfall reduction may be attributed mainly to the changes in soil microbial biomass and fine root biomass induced by throughfall reduction. Our observations suggest that either climate warming or precipitation reduction may increase soil \{CO2\} emission, but this stimulation in oak forests will be largely counteracted if climate warming accompanies with simultaneous precipitation reduction at the climatic transitional zone.

This study was designed with the objectives of assessing the contribution of forests to annual income of rural households and identifying its determinants using the case of Jelo Afromontane forest in eastern Ethiopia. It also examined the gender dimensions of forest income, and how this income varies with the wealth status of households. Key informant interview, focus group discussion and household-based questionnaire survey were used to collect data. On average, income from crop production accounted for 40.7% of the total annual household income. Forest income was second in importance, contributing 32.6%. Income from livestock, off- and non-farm activities, and woodlots accounted for 13.6%, 11.4%, and 1.7% of the total household income respectively. Firewood was the most used forest product and constituted the largest proportion (79%) of the total forest income. The contribution of forest income to the total household income varied significantly (P &lt; 0.05) with wealth category. Forest income was more important for poor households (47.3%) than for medium (30.5%) or rich (20.2%) households. It was also more important for female headed households (58.2%) than for male headed households (29%). The gender dimension of forest income was also apparent within the household. Female members generated about four times more forest income (77% of the household forest income) than male members (23%). The sex of the household head (P &lt; 0.01) and distance to the forest (P &lt; 0.05) were the two determinant variables that significantly affected forest income out of the eight explanatory variables considered in the regression model. Policy to promote new forest management arrangement such as participatory forest management (PFM) in Jelo forest needs to take into account the major forest users and the types of products they depend on, and be accompanied with other poverty reduction measures so that improved forest conservation outcome will not have negative consequences on local livelihoods, particularly on poor and women, who depend most on the forest.

Recent short fallows have reduced soil fertility and rice productivity in these systems. Genotypes adapted to a range of soil fertility conditions are needed for their food security. Rainfed experiments were conducted to identify genotypes with high yield and to examine the nature of genotype by environment (G × E) interaction for grain yield. Two improved indica genotypes and seven traditional genotypes including indica and tropical japonica groups were grown without fertilizer in ten environments over the course of 2 years. The effects of G, E and G × E interaction were significant for grain yield, yield components, plant height and days to flowering. Two improved indica genotypes (B6144F-MR-6-0-0 and \{IR\} 55423-01) and a traditional indica genotype Chao Mat out-yielded the other genotypes across the environments (2.1 t ha−1 vs. 1.6 t ha−1). Pattern analysis showed that 40.2% of the G × E sum of squares was captured by a two genotype group by two environment group summary. One environment group had higher contents of soil organic carbon and extractable P and K, and mean grain yield than another environment group. The performance of one genotype group including consisting of improved and traditional indica genotypes was more stable across two environment groups than that of another group consisting of tropical japonica genotypes, which performed well only in the high soil fertility environment group. The low grain yield of tropical japonica genotypes in the low soil fertility environment group was the result of low sink size and grain-filling percentage. In conclusion, two improved genotypes are identified for high yield in both low and high soil fertility conditions and soil organic carbon appears to be a major factor contributing the G × E interaction for grain yield as well as overall productivity.

We discuss a series of challenges, and suggest that caution is needed: insufficient demand for multiple services, high biophysical service complexity, and elevated monitoring costs all indicate that opportunities for large-scale commercial viability of certified forest ecosystem services are limited. While some certification already exists for forest carbon services, we expect the certification of other services to remain a minor niche that seldom justifies major subsidies. "

Seedlings of H. odorata were planted in the nurse tree stands at a uniform spacing of 4 m × 4 m and in control plots (no nurse trees) in 1990. Stem numbers of some nurse trees were thinned by half in 1994. The stem diameter and height of all trees were measured annually until 1995 and again in 2007. The mean annual increment (MAI) in volume was estimated as 8.2–10.1 m3 ha−1 year−1 for E. camaldulensis and 0.9–1.2 m3 ha−1 year−1 for S. siamea, smaller than reported elsewhere. This suggests that the site properties were not suitable for them. The \{MAI\} of A. auriculiformis was 7.9–9.8 m3 ha−1 year−1, within the reported range. Survival rates of H. odorata in the S. siamea stands and the control plots decreased rapidly during the first 2 years but then stayed constant from 1992. In contrast, survival rates of H. odorata in the E. camaldulensis and A. auriculiformis stands were initially high (&gt;70%), but then decreased after 1995. Stem diameter, tree height, and stand basal area of H. odorata were large in both the S. siamea stands and the control plots from then. The growth of H. odorata was largest in the 2 m × 8 m S. siamea stands. In contrast, it was restricted in the E. camaldulensis and A. auriculiformis stands owing to strong shading by their canopies. Thinning by 50% tended to facilitate the growth of H. odorata temporarily in the E. camaldulensis and A. auriculiformis stands. The stand basal areas of nurse trees and of H. odorata showed a trade-off. These results suggest that the growth of H. odorata was maximized in the S. siamea stands. We assume, however, that the growth of H. odorata could be improved even in the E. camaldulensis and A. auriculiformis stands by frequent or heavy thinning. "

We conducted analysis in six \{REDD\} + countries (Brazil, Cameroon, Indonesia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea and Vietnam). The paper combines three methods: policy analysis, media-based discourse analysis and policy network analysis. The paper shows that policies both within and outside the forestry sector that support deforestation and forest degradation create path dependencies and entrenched interests that hamper policy change. In addition, most dominant policy coalitions do not challenge business-as-usual trajectories, reinforcing existing policy and political structures. No minority policy coalitions are directly tackling the root causes of deforestation and forest degradation, that is, the politico-economic conditions driving them. Instead they focus on environmental justice issues, such as calls for increased participation of indigenous people in decision-making. Only in two of the six countries are these transformational change coalitions vocal enough to be heard, yet to exercise their agency effectively and to support more substantial reforms, these coalitions would need the participation of more influential policy actors, particularly state agencies that have the authority to make binding decisions about policy. Furthermore, discourses supporting transformational change would need to be reflected in institutional practices and policy decisions. "

The complexity of tropical moist forest means that there is often little objective information to classify sites and species for growth modelling and yield prediction. Classification based on observable morphological characteristics may be a useful surrogate for, or supplement to, other alternatives. This study investigated the utility of plant functional attributes (PFAs) for site and species classification. \{PFAs\} describe a plant in terms of its photosynthetic and vascular support system, and the sum of individual \{PFAs\} for all species on a plot provides an efficient summary of vegetation features at the site. Preliminary observations suggested that the \{PFA\} summary may also indicate site productivity, and that specific \{PFAs\} may be used to group species for modelling growth and yield. Data from 17 permanent plots in the tropical rainforests of North Queensland were used to test these preliminary observations. Standard \{PFA\} proformas were completed for each plot in January 1995, and the relationships between the PFAs, site productivity and specific growth patterns were examined using discriminant analysis, linear regression and standard statistical tests. Results indicate that mean leaf size, and the incidence of species with vertical leaf inclination (more than 30° above horizontal) are significantly correlated with site productivity. Of the \{PFAs\} assessed, five elements appear to offer a useful basis for grouping species for modelling: leaf size and inclination, a furcation index (i.e. relative height to first fork or break in the main stem), and the presence of lenticels and chlorophyllous tissue on the main stem. The restricted nature of our database limits comment on the general utility of the method, but results suggest that further work on \{PFAs\} is warranted. "

Today the ecological bounty of this region is threatened by the expansion of settled agriculture, including the proliferation of rubber plantations. In the current conception of REDD+, landscapes involving swidden qualify almost automatically for replacement by other land-use systems because swiddens are perceived to be degraded and inefficient with regard to carbon sequestration. However, swiddening in some cases may be carbon-neutral or even carbon positive, compared with some other types of land-use systems. In this paper we describe how agricultural policies and institutions have affected land use in the region over the last several decades and the impact these policies have had on the livelihoods of swiddeners and other smallholders. We also explore whether incentivizing transitions away from swiddening to the cultivation of rubber will directly or reliably produce carbon gains. We argue that because government policies affect how land is used, they also influence carbon emissions, farmer livelihoods, environmental services, and a host of other variables. A deeper and more systematic analysis of the multiple consequences of these policies is consequently necessary for the design of successful REDD+ policies in MMSEA, and other areas of the developing world. REDD+ policies should be structured not so much to ‘hold the forest boundary’ but to influence the types of land-use changes that are occurring so that they support both sustainable livelihoods and environmental services, including (but not limited to) carbon.

The state has usually attempted to keep people and their livestock out of the state forest. We show that the private benefits of cropland may be greater than those related to state or local use of the woodland, but further work is required to incorporate the public costs of subsidies to cropland, and the public benefits of woodland services. Livestock production in the woodlands is compatible with woodland management, both from economic and ecological perspectives. Expulsion of forest1The vegetation formation in these areas is, strictly speaking, woodland, but the areas gazetted under the Forest Act are officially termed state forests. We use the term ‘forest dwellers’ for illegal inhabitants within the state forests. 1 dwellers from the state forest makes little ecological impact on the woodland, and does not improve the economic value of the woodland to the state. However, if the Forestry Commission relaxes the current control on in-migration, it is likely that the woodland will be rapidly depleted in the face of massive in-migration. Modelling is seen as a framework for integration of ecological and economic issues, but further work is required to incorporate institutional perspectives from the sociological and anthropological disciplines.

However, large discrepancies in the existing \{LULC\} datasets have hindered our efforts to better understand interactions among human activities, climate systems, and ecosystem in India. In this study, we incorporated high-resolution remote sensing datasets from Resourcesat-1 and historical archives at district (N = 590) and state (N = 30) levels to generate \{LULC\} datasets at 5 arc minute resolution during 1880–2010 in India. Results have shown that a significant loss of forests (from 89 million ha to 63 million ha) has occurred during the study period. Interestingly, the deforestation rate was relatively greater under the British rule (1880–1950s) and early decades after independence, and then decreased after the 1980s due to government policies to protect the forests. In contrast to forests, cropland area has increased from 92 million ha to 140.1 million ha during 1880–2010. Greater cropland expansion has occurred during the 1950–1980s that coincided with the period of farm mechanization, electrification, and introduction of high yielding crop varieties as a result of government policies to achieve self-sufficiency in food production. The rate of urbanization was slower during 1880–1940 but significantly increased after the 1950s probably due to rapid increase in population and economic growth in India. Our study provides the most reliable estimations of historical \{LULC\} at regional scale in India. This is the first attempt to incorporate newly developed high-resolution remote sensing datasets and inventory archives to reconstruct the time series of \{LULC\} records for such a long period in India. The spatial and temporal information on \{LULC\} derived from this study could be used by ecosystem, hydrological, and climate modeling as well as by policy makers for assessing the impacts of \{LULC\} on regional climate, water resources, and biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial ecosystems.

Here, we applied a well calibrated and verified ecosystem model (the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model, DLEM), in conjunction with newly developed data sets of multiple environmental factors including land use change, climate variability, elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen deposition, ozone pollution, and nitrogen fertilizer application, to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of evapotranspiration (ET) and runoff in eastern China during 1961–2005 and further quantified the relative contributions of multiple environmental factors to these patterns at both basin and regional scales. The simulation results indicated that annual \{ET\} in the study area had a significantly increasing trend from 1961 to 2005. Yet there were no significant changing trends for estimated runoff and net water balance (precipitation minus ET). Substantial spatial heterogeneities in \{ET\} and runoff were observed. Annual \{ET\} increased in all basins except Yellow River Basin. Runoff increased in the southern part of the study area (including Pearl River and the Southeast basin), but decreased in northern part of the study area, particularly in Haihe and Huaihe river basins. Factorial analysis showed that climate change was the dominant factor responsible for the interannual variations in \{ET\} and runoff in the past 45 years. Land use change (including land conversions and land management practices) yielded minor effects on the interannual variations in \{ET\} and runoff but caused relatively large effects over long-term period. For the accumulated change in \{ET\} at basin scale, climate change was the dominant factor in the basins of Song-Liao, Pearl River, while land use change contributed the most in the basin of Haihe, Huaihe, and Yellow River. Climate change was the dominant factor controlling runoff change in all basins except Huaihe and Yangtze River basins. Our simulated results imply that it is important to quantify relative roles of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on water fluxes for maintaining water sustainability in a changing climate. "

It is especially relevant for conservation planning to assess whether the economic value of ecosystem services is spatially congruent with biodiversity. Previous analyses have largely focused on ecosystem service provision or assumed homogeneous economic values across land uses within biomes. We relax this assumption by carrying out a spatially explicit meta-analysis based on 30 studies of ecosystem service values in tropical forests from The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) database, while controlling for economic, environmental and methodological variables. Our results demonstrate a lack of spatial congruence between the economic value of ecosystem services and biodiversity in tropical forests. Instead, we find that economic value presents a nonlinear inverted-U relationship with site accessibility and economic activity, highlighting the importance of matching supply and demand between each ecosystem service and its beneficiaries for economic values to be realized. The implications are that conservation policies focusing solely on the economic value of ecosystem services will fail to protect biodiversity in remote and less disturbed regions. "

These factors need to be taken into consideration to enhance women's participation in forestry and to achieve sustainable forestry in Turkey.

Increased canopy openness and increased detritus (debris) deposition are two of the most likely factors, but due to their simultaneous occurrence during a hurricane, their relative effects cannot be separated without a manipulative experiment. Hence, in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) of Puerto Rico, the Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research Program (LTER) has undertaken experimental manipulations in replicated 30 × 30 m plots to simulate the major effects of hurricane disturbance–increased canopy openness and debris addition to the forest floor. Using a factorial experiment enabled investigation of the separate and combined effects of canopy opening and debris on this wet tropical forest; the experimental outcomes may help direct forest management decisions in similar disturbance-prone environments. In this first article of the special issue, we (1) provide details of the design and methodology for this manipulative experiment (the Canopy Trimming Experiment, CTE), (2) report some principal abiotic responses to treatments, and (3) introduce the subject areas of the 12 additional \{CTE\} manuscripts in this special issue. The physical conditions created by canopy and understory treatment and the amounts of debris added to \{CTE\} plots were similar to the LEF’s conditions following Hurricane Hugo (a category 4 storm) in 1989; although more wood and a 37% (1.5 cm) deeper litter layer was present in the CTE. Our selective cutting and removal of the forest canopy above 3 m, which included trimming 234 palm trees and 342 non-palm trees, greatly altered the understory micro-environment by increasing light levels and decreasing litter moisture for 18 months; throughfall and soil moisture were elevated in trim plots for 3 months. In plots where the canopy was trimmed and the debris (6 kg m−2) was added to the forest floor, the canopy debris persisted on the forest floor for at least 4 years; debris decomposed more quickly in plots with intact canopies. The diverse collection of papers in this special issue provide mechanistic understandings of response patterns of tropical forest biota (microbes, plants, animals) and processes (decomposition, herbivory, nutrient cycling, primary production) to canopy and understory disturbance that resembles a major (⩾category 3) hurricane. Although measurements for this experiment are on-going to further identify the mechanisms of long-term forest change resulting from hurricanes, we include findings up to the first seven years post-treatment at this time.

Knowledge of wheat root depth and the vertical distribution during the winter growing season is needed for sound scheduling of irrigation and efficient use of water. This article reports evaluation of root development for three winter-grown bread (Triticum aestivum L.) and durum (Triticum turgidum L.) wheat under four soil water regimes (rainfed and full irrigation with two intermediate levels of 33 and 66% of full irrigation). Roots were sampled by soil coring to a depth of 0.75 m at four occasions during 2005–2006 growing season. Two distinct phases of root development were identified, a rapid downward penetration from emergence to end tillering phase, followed by a substantial root mass growth along the profile from tillering to mid-stem-elongation phase. Roots were detected as deep as 0.75 m during the initial rapid penetration, yet only 29% of the total seasonal root mass was developed. This downward penetration rate averaged 7 mm d−1 and produced 10.8 kg ha−1 d−1 of root dry-biomass. The bulging of root mass from tillering to mid-stem-elongation coincided with vigorous shoot growth, doubling root dry-biomass at a rate of 52 kg ha−1 d−1, compared to the seasonal root growth rate of 18.3 kg ha−1 d−1. A second-degree equation described the total root dry-biomass as a function of days after emergence (r2 = 0.85), whereas a simpler equation predicted it as a function of cumulative growing degree days (r2 = 0.85). The final grain yield was a strong function of irrigation regimes, varying from 3.0 to 6.5 t ha−1, but showed no correlation with root biomass which remained similar as soil water regimes changed. This observation must be viewed with care as it lacks statistical evidence. Results showed 90% of root mass at first irrigation (15 April) confined in the top 0.60–0.75 m soil in bread wheat. Presence of shallow restricting soil layers limited root depth of durum wheat to 0.45 m, yet total seasonal root mass and grain yield were comparable with non-restricted bread wheat. Most root growth occurred during the cool rainy season and prior to the late irrigation season. The root sampling is short of rigorous, but results complement the limited field data in literature collectively suggesting that irrigation following the rainy season may best be scheduled assuming a well developed root zone as deep as the effective soil depth within the top meter of soil.

This environment is marked by more fertile soils than generally found on terra firme lands. Floodplain soils may flood yearly or once every several years. Farmers grow combinations of crops on different agricultural sites, and under annul production and multi-annual regimes. Secondary forest plays and important role in this environment. The main trends in the process of formation of secondary forest have been analyzed through a survey among 218 farmers, collecting data on land use, primary and secondary forest management, and other economic activities. The results show that processes of secondary forest formation are influenced by advancing market access, changes in the dominant land type as a result of river floods, and population pressure when villages become older. As villages age farmer’s holding tend to become smaller. While this happens, private primary forest reserves are replaced by secondary forest, but total forest cover does not decline. The economic importance of secondary forest increases when these forests age, but improved market access seems to off-set this trend. The concept of frontier expansion, and the related change of the role of secondary forest in the landscape, typical for colonization areas, does only partly apply to this environment. "

The Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China, encompasses large area of natural freshwater marshy wetlands. However, the magnitude and temporal patterns of major greenhouse gases (GHGs: CO2, \{CH4\} and N2O) in this region remain far from certain. Here we used a process-based ecosystem model to examine \{GHGs\} fluxes and their underlying mechanisms in the marshland across the Sanjiang Plain over the period 1949–2008. Simulation results indicated that during the past 60 years, the Sanjiang Plain's marshland acted as a net \{CO2\} sink of 4.20 ± 0.44 Tg C yr−1, while approximately 0.46 ± 0.02 Tg C yr−1 for \{CH4\} and 0.02 ± 0.00 Tg N yr−1 for \{N2O\} were released to the atmosphere. Land cover and land use change (LCLUC) was the primary driver for \{GHGs\} changes. Climate change and tropospheric ozone (O3) pollution decreased \{CO2\} uptakes, yet elevated \{CO2\} concentration and nitrogen deposition increased \{CO2\} uptake. Tropospheric \{O3\} pollution and nitrogen deposition decreased \{CH4\} emission by 7.94 Gg C and 0.41 Gg C, respectively, while elevated \{CO2\} concentration increased the \{CH4\} emission by 133.81 Gg C. Accumulatively, tropospheric \{O3\} pollution and climate change contributed approximately 5.37% and 4.89% to the increased \{N2O\} emission, respectively, while elevated \{CO2\} concentration reduced 2.81% of the \{N2O\} emission. The global warming potential (GWP) ranged from −1.81 Tg \{CO2eq\} yr−1 in the 1970s to 29.15 Tg \{CO2eq\} yr−1 in the 2000s. The decadal \{GWP\} by \{CO2\} fluxes shifted from negative values between the 1950s and the 1990s to positive values in the 2000s, while \{CH4\} and \{N2O\} emissions enhanced \{GWP\} from the 1950s to the 2000s. The total \{GWP\} decreased from the 1950s to the 1970s, but increased from the 1980s to the 2000s. This suggested that the reduced \{GWP\} by decreased \{CH4\} emissions was gradually offset by the increased \{GWP\} by increased \{N2O\} emissions and decreased \{CO2\} sink from the 1980s to the 2000s, implying that a full accounting of the greenhouse gas balance is essential in assessing global change impacts.

Predictive models on the emissions of \{N2O\} and \{NO\} emissions from soil into the atmosphere are required. We modified the \{CENTURY\} model (Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J., 51 (1987) 1173) to simulate the emissions of \{N2O\} and \{NO\} from tropical primary forests in the Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica at a monthly time step. Combined fluxes of \{N2O\} and \{NO\} were simulated as a function of gross N mineralization and water-filled pore space (WFPS). The coefficients for partitioning \{N2O\} from \{NO\} were derived from field measurements (Global Biogeochem. Cycles, 8 (1994) 399). The modified \{CENTURY\} was calibrated against observations of carbon stocks in various pools of forest ecosystems of the region, and measured \{WFPS\} and emission rates of \{N2O\} and \{NO\} from soil to the atmosphere. \{WFPS\} is an important factor regulating nutrient cycling and emissions of \{N2O\} and \{NO\} from soils making the accuracy of the \{WFPS\} prediction central to the modeling process. To do this, we modified the hydrologic submodel and developed a new method for the prediction of \{WFPS\} at the monthly scale from daily rainfall information. The new method is based on: (1) the relationship between monthly rainfall and the number of rainfall events, and (2) the relative cumulative frequency distribution of ranked daily rainfall events. The method is generic and should be applicable to other areas. Simulated monthly average \{WFPS\} was 0.68±0.02 — identical with the field measurement average of 0.68±0.02 from the annual cycle observed by Keller and Reiners (Global Biogeochem. Cycles, 8 (1994) 399). Simulated fluxes of \{N2O\} and \{NO\} were 52.0±9.4 mg-N m−2 month−1 and 6.5±0.7 mg-N m−2 month−1, respectively, compared with measured averages of 48.2±11.0 mg-N m−2 month−1 and 7.1±1.1 mg-N m−2 month−1. The simulated N2O/NO ratio was 11.2±1.9 compared with the measured value of 10.9±4.7. \{WFPS\} is the dominant determinant of the fraction of gross N mineralization that is emitted from the soil as \{N2O\} and NO. If \{WFPS\} were not limiting during part of the year, this fraction would be 4.2%. With some periods of lower WFPS, the realized fraction is 2.2%. Because of the strong relationships between \{N2O\} and \{NO\} emission rates and rainfall and its derivative, WFPS, these moisture variables can be used to scale up nitrogen trace gas fluxes from sites to larger spatial scales.

Results show that the average reduction in the annual allowable cut (AAC) of concerned \{FMUs\} is about 11% when legal harvesting rules are adopted, about 18% when the \{FSC\} rules as requested by the certifying bodies (CBs) are applied, and about 34% when the ‘FSC logic of sustainable harvesting’, as agreed upon on paper by logging companies and CBs, is used. Our findings confirm that forest certification has the potential to improve weak normative frameworks that allow the unsustainable use of forests.

The system was developed in the context of strong contestation, in Tasmanian and Australian civil society and politics, about appropriate forest policies and practices in Tasmania. The system is governed by a Forest Practices Act, which provides for a co-regulatory approach administered by an independent statutory body, the Forest Practices Authority. All forest operations must be undertaken in accordance with a certified forest practices plan, prepared and certified by accredited Forest Practices Officers employed by forest managers. These co-regulatory components of the system are supported by independent monitoring and enforcement by the Forest Practices Authority. This paper describes the genesis and evolution of the Tasmanian forest practices system, and summarises the range of measures employed to foster high levels of compliance, with an emphasis on training and education, self-monitoring and reporting by the industry, independent monitoring by the Forest Practices Authority, and corrective actions, backed by enforcement provisions. Compliance monitoring over 27 years demonstrates rapid improvement in the decade following establishment of the system, with consistently high levels of achievement subsequently. However, larger corporate forest managers consistently achieve higher rates of compliance than do small-scale forest owners, and redressing this imbalance has been a recurrent theme in Tasmania's forest practices system. Experience of implementation of Tasmania's forest practices system suggests that well-designed and implemented co-regulatory approaches, with high levels of transparency, can be effective in delivery of good technical standards of forest practices and high levels of compliance. However, these will not in themselves mitigate public concern about forest management practices unless the policies governing those practices have broad support in civil society. "

No significantly shared \{AFLP\} fragment was found between the three species, indicating that D. confinis and litchi are very far in genetic distance from any longan accession studied. Partial rbcL sequences of 501 bp from the first coding site in these species were obtained, which revealed several substitutes. One such \{DNA\} base pair substitute resulted in an amino acid difference between longan and litchi. Furthermore, another 4 bp resulted in a two amino acid difference between longan and D. confinis, which was consistent with \{AFLP\} results and indicated that D. confinis should be excluded from the longan genus, Dimocarpus. Within the longan species, no \{DNA\} substitute was found. Using nine primer combinations, a total of 66 \{AFLP\} markers were obtained from 41 longan accessions. One non-Chinese longan accession ‘Miaoqiao’ was distinctly different from all other longan cultivars collected in China, indicating that more genetic resources of longan might be collected also from longan production regions outside of China. \{AFLP\} markers might be developed to identify longan cultivars as well as expedite progeny screening in breeding programs of this perennial fruit tree.

Forest certification and bioenergy from forest were identified as key elements for future integrated bottom-up policies that need to concentrate on facilitating the linkage between forestry and renewable energy as well as on promoting environmentally sound management and forest certification.

The promise of sustainability is rooted in the two premises; first that ecosystems have the potential to renew themselves and second that economic activities and social perceptions or values that define human interaction with the environment are choices that can be modified to ensure the long term productivity and health of the ecosystem. \{SFM\} addresses a great challenge in matching the increasing demands of a growing human population while maintaining ecological functions of healthy forest ecosystems. This paper does not seek to define SFM, but rather provides analyses of key indicators for the national-scale enabling environment to gain a global insight into progress in implementing enabling and implementing \{SFM\} at the national and operational levels. Analyses of the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 (FRA) country report data are used to provide insights into the current state of progress in implementing the enabling conditions for SFM. Over 2.17 billion ha of the world’s forest area are predicted by governments to remain in permanent forest land use, of which some 1.1 billion ha are covered by all of the \{SFM\} tools investigated in \{FRA\} 2015. At the global scale, SFM-related policies and regulations are reported to be in place on 97% of global forest area. While the number of countries with national forest inventories has increased over that past ten years from 48 to 112, only 37% of forests in low income countries are covered by forest inventories. Forest management planning and monitoring of plans has increased substantially as has forest management certification, which exceeded a total of over 430 million ha in 2014. However, 90% of internationally verified certification is in the boreal and temperate climatic domains – only 6% of permanent forests in the tropical domain have been certified as of 2014. Results show that more work is needed to expand the extent and depth of work on establishing the enabling conditions that support \{SFM\} over the long term and suggests where those needs are greatest.

With an increasing amount of satellite data being released to the public free of charge, understanding forest change dynamics in the tropics is gradually becoming a reality. Methods to track forest changes using dense satellite time series allow for description of forest changes at unprecedented spatial, temporal and thematic resolution. We developed a data-driven approach based on structural change monitoring methods to track disturbance-regrowth dynamics using dense Landsat Time Series (LTS) in a tropical forest landscape in Madre de Dios, southern Peru. Whereas most existing post-disturbance regrowth monitoring methods rely on annual or near-annual time series, our method uses all available Landsat data. Using our disturbance-regrowth method, we detected annual disturbance from 1999 to 2013 with a total area-weighted accuracy of 91 ± 2.3%. Accuracies of the regrowth results were strongly dependent on the timing of the original disturbance. We estimated a total area-weighted regrowth accuracy of 61 ± 3.9% for pixels where original disturbances were predicted earlier than 2006. While the user's accuracy of the regrowth class for these pixels was high (84 ± 8.1%), the producer's accuracy was low (56 ± 9.4%), with markedly lower producer's accuracies when later disturbances were also included. These accuracies indicate that a significant amount of regrowth identified in the reference data was not captured with our method. Most of these omission errors arose from disturbances late in the time series or a lack of sensitivity to long-term regrowth due to lower data densities near the end of the time series. Omission errors notwithstanding, our study represents the first demonstration of a purely data-driven algorithm designed to detect disturbances and post-disturbance regrowth together using all available \{LTS\} data. With this method, we propose a continuous disturbance-regrowth monitoring framework, where \{LTS\} data are continually monitored for disturbances, post-disturbance regrowth, repeat disturbances, and so on.

Our results indicate that while agriculture began displacing grasslands that originally provided high yields of honey, afforestation now compensates those losses through the flowerings of Eucalyptus grandis. By extending the flowering season from six to eight months, beekeepers' dependency on tree plantations has increased. However, forestry enterprises are now shifting to plant more productive species that do not flower similarly, anticipating a threshold crossover to which the beekeepers may be unable to adapt. In conclusion, resilience of this environmentally sensitive livelihood has been suppressed primarily by land use changes that have introduced new costs and challenges into honey production. However, threshold dynamics that appear as multifaceted challenges faced by beekeepers occur also elsewhere in the system. Certain outcomes of the threshold dynamics similar to feedback loops in social-ecological systems were identified, including considerations of out-migration and change in occupation, of which ultimate impacts remain unclear. Most beekeepers still cope with the remaining viability, but it appears that the current resilience level does not allow for further harmful impacts. This case example of coupled social and ecological interactions through a livelihood lens gives rise to future research in evolving new dimensions to govern social-ecological systems in Uruguay and beyond.

However, surface elevations change as a result of compaction or expansion of the soil under forest management and land use. On the other hand, the calculation of soil C stocks based on “equivalent soil mass” is not affected by compaction or expansion of forest soil. To contribute to the development of a forest C accounting methodology, we compared changes in soil C stocks over 4 years between depth- and mass-based approaches using original soil data collected at 0–30 cm depths in young plantations and secondary forests in West Java, Indonesia. Our methodology expanded on the mass-based approach; rather than using one representative value for the mass-based calculation of soil C stocks, we adjusted individual values, maintaining the coefficient of variance in soil mass. We also considered the effect of an increase or decrease in soil organic matter on equivalent soil mass. Both increasing and decreasing trends in soil C stocks became clearer when the mass-based approach was used rather than the depth-based approach. The trends in soil C stocks based on equivalent soil mass were particularly evident in the surface soil layers (0–5 cm) and in plantation sites, compared with those for soil profiles including subsurface soil layers (0–30 cm) and in secondary forests. These trends in soil C stocks corresponded with temporal trends in litter stocks. We suggest that equivalent mass-basis soil C stock for the upper 30 cm of soil be calculated based on multiple soil layers to reduce estimation errors. Changes in soil organic matter mass had little effect on the estimation of soil C stock on an equivalent mass basis. For the development of a forest C accounting system, the mass-based approach should be used to characterize temporal trends in soil C stocks and to improve C cycle models, rather than simpler methods of calculating soil C stocks. These improvements will help to increase the tier level of country-specific forest C accounting systems. "

The activity of the enzymes related to the process of NO3− reduction (nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase and glutamine synthetase) was affected differently depending on the application rate of mixed amino acids. Applying mixed amino acids increased the fresh weight, dry weight, and N yield. The NO3− content was reduced to 24–38%, but no significant differences were observed in amino acids and proteins. In addition, the nitrogen derived from fertilizer and the 15N-NO3− recovery rate increased to 2–8% and 15–47%, respectively.

abstract = "The identification and study of adaptively important genes in forest trees represents a formidable challenge because of their long generation spans. In annual or perennial herbs, formal genetic studies can be employed to identify the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and/or candidate genes that underlie important traits, and the segregating populations can be transplanted into natural populations to measure the strength and direction of selection. However, the application of these methods to forest trees is difficult, because the creation of appropriate genetic material is extremely time-consuming in long-lived, woody plants, and life-time fitness estimates are difficult or impossible to obtain. Although \{QTL\} mapping should in principle be feasible in wild intraspecific populations (as an alternative to artificial crosses), this approach is less likely to be successful in trees because \{LD\} (linkage disequilibrium) will decay quickly in large outbreeding plant populations. Within the present paper, we discuss a modified approach based on natural hybrid zones. We describe the use of wild annual sunflowers (Helianthus spp.) as a model for exploring the hybrid zone approach. Transplanted experimental hybrids allowed us to assess the adaptive value of individual chromosomal blocks in nature, and data on natural Helianthus hybrids suggest that similar approaches are possible in natural hybrid zones. Our results allowed us to test the role of hybridization in the origin of ecological divergence in wild sunflowers. In addition, they have practical implications for identifying adaptively important genes or \{QTLs\} in trees. This is exemplified by three temperate forest taxa, Populus (poplars, aspens, cottonwoods), Fraxinus (ash), and Quercus (oak). All three are diploid and important genomic tools are under development. Moreover, all three offer extensive hybrid zones whose likely age can be inferred from fossil data. Age data enables estimates of the size and frequency of chromosomal blocks in hybrids, thereby providing guidance in designing marker-based experiments. We predict that natural hybrid zones will be valuable tools for identifying the \{QTLs\} and/or candidate genes responsible for adaptive traits in forest trees. "

The forest was located at a Mediterranean mountain site (Valsaín, Segovia, central Spain). The temporally explicit relationships between the mentioned variables were explored by chronological cluster of their time series. Mean air temperature significantly influenced litter production and its seasonal and intradecadal patterns. Seasonal patterns of litter N and P content were negatively correlated with litter production, exhibiting minima of 5.3 g kg−1 (N) and 0.5 g kg−1 (P) by the end of the summer and maxima of 15 g kg−1 (N) and 1.2 g kg−1 (P) during winter; these results are interpreted as retranslocation before needle shedding in summer and loss of green needles in winter respectively. In general the driest and hottest years (1994 and 1995) were associated with significantly decreased secondary growth in the next year, an increased cone production, and an increased nutrient loss due to the combined effect of an increased litter production and an increased nutrient concentration of the litter. Climatic changes during the early stages of cone formation that take place during the spring led to alterations in masting and in the tri-annual process of cone production. Since each parameter studied was differentially affected by climatic variability, the overall effect of the short-term climatic changes experienced by the Scots pine forest studied was an uncoupling of litter production, secondary growth, and reproduction.

Leaf water relations and gas exchange were studied in the first experiment. For both species, lower pre-dawn leaf water potential (Ψpd) evidenced a higher degree of water stress in the understory seedlings, even though soil moisture was similar in both sites. Rates of photosynthesis (Asat) and stomatal conductance (gsat) at saturating light were higher in the gap seedlings in all measuring dates, but the earlier and more pronounced stress imposed in the understory precluded the comparison of tolerance responses between sites. Q. pyrenaica showed always higher Asat and gsat than Q. petraea, independently of Ψpd, which did not differ significantly between species. At the end of summer, values of Asat/gsat and leaf carbon isotopic composition reflected a less efficient water use in Q. pyrenaica. In the second experiment, growth and root development were examined in a different set of seedlings planted in the same sites. Q. petraea allocated less biomass to roots, and attained 20% higher total plant dry mass than Q. pyrenaica at the end of the second growing season in the field. For both species total plant dry mass and coarse plus fine root dry mass reached at this time were approximately three-fold higher in the gap than in the understory. Poor root development could explain the more limited access to water of seedlings outplanted in the understory. This study reveals that seedlings of Q. petraea and Q. pyrenaica planted under a dense, mature pine stand are more susceptible to summer drought and present a delay in growth with respect to a medium canopy gap.

A map of vegetation types was also used to determine these factors’ spatial and temporal variability and interactions with the total amount of burned area and active fires detected in Colombia. Grasslands represented the vegetation most affected by fires every year in terms of burned area (standardised by their total area), followed by secondary vegetation, pasture and forests. Grasslands were also most affected by active fires, but followed closely by pasture, agricultural areas, secondary vegetation and forests. The results indicated strong climate and fire seasonality and marked regional difference, partly explained by climatic differences amongst regions and vegetation types, especially in the Orinoco and Caribbean regions. The incidence of fire in the Amazon and Andes was less influenced by climate in terms of burned area impacted, but the strength of the \{ENSO\} phenomenon affected the Orinoco and the Andes more in terms of burned area. Many of the active fires detected occurred in areas of transition between the submontane and lowland Andes and the Amazon, where extensive conversion to pasture is occurring. The possible high impact of small fires on the tropical rainforest present in this transition area and the Amazonian rainforest deserves more attention in Colombia due to its previous lack of attention to its contribution to global change.

However, approximately 39.2% of Spanish forest lands are under different types of protection and only 18.4 million ha (36% of the country) are true forests or plantations. Four main forest ecoregions can be distinguished in Spain: Mediterranean, Atlantic, Alpine and Subtropical (Macaronesic). The particular characteristics of these eco-regions determine the particular types of forest resource utilisation. Three objectives are dominant: (a) biodiversity conservation (main objective in the Macaronesic area), (b) timber production (important in the Atlantic region) and (c) multifunctionality as well as non-timber products (important in the Mediterranean and Alpine ecoregions). In the second half of the 20th century, the combination of new Permanent Plot Networks (PPN), silvicultural trials (covering a wide range of species and site conditions), and the National Forest Inventory (NFI), made possible to develop new forest models, especially during recent years due to advances of statistical software combined with improved field observations. New forest models for different tree species, management purposes and regions have been developed at different scales, including whole stand and individual-tree approaches, and taking into account forest diversity and end-user aims. The combination of \{PPN\} and \{NFI\} allows further improvement of the models, including additional output functions to estimate tree and stand variables related to specific objectives (e.g. crown fire risk). The advantages and disadvantages of Forest Observational Studies (FOS) and National Forest Inventory data for developing forest models are discussed. Finally, an example of synergy between \{FOS\} and \{NFI\} observations for developing dynamic growth models for intensively managed forest in the Atlantic ecoregion is presented. "

In this paper, we studied female fertility, seed dispersal and spread rates in P. pinaster from the Spanish Northern Plateau, where natural regeneration failure is a main concern for forest managers. For this purpose we periodically collected data from seed traps and trees located at two core locations across several years. We found significant variation in interannual cone production, with the best seed trees being the same across years. In addition, we found highly skewed distributions of female reproductive effort and large fertility differences across stands located few kilometres away. Annual seed dispersal kernels fitted lognormal or 2Dt models depending on the stand analysed, with median dispersal distances between 14 and 25 m. Kernels fitted for maximum dispersal periods showed an outstanding intraseasonal variation of median dispersal distances, from 10 to 54 m, in association to variable patterns of rainfall and maximum wind speed. The amount of seed produced appeared to be enough to guarantee the natural regeneration of the stands during the typical 20-year regeneration period. Colonisation simulations concluded that Mediterranean maritime pine has a notable dispersion capacity, which is strongly influenced by levels of fecundity and, especially, by the number and frequency of long-distance dispersal events. The latter play a key role in tree dispersion processes through enlarging the occupied area and fostering the invasion of abandoned crop land. "

We studied the patterns of mixed stands including two main Mediterranean pine species: Pinus pinaster Ait. and Pinus pinea L. The spatial distribution of adult trees and saplings was studied via a point pattern approach. The effect of competition on growth of adult trees was investigated by comparing the performance of several competition indexes for each pine species through generalized linear models. Adult trees formed mixed clumps in which individuals of both species appeared together. Part of the tree growth variation was explained by tree size along with tree competition. However, the effect of conspecific vs heterospecific competition on tree growth differed and reflected species-specific neighbor-asymmetric competition. Facilitation was fundamental in the early stages for tree species development. The spatial distribution of saplings was strongly related to the spatial distribution of adult trees, also being asymmetrically clustered and neighbor-species-dependent. However, the required facilitation in early life-stage trees shifted to competition among trees in the adult stage. Species mixture may be desirable in terms of increasing and diversifying productivity, although the conditions currently present in the stand are likely to lead to future dominance of P. pinea over P. pinaster due not only to the greater competition tolerance of the former but also to a greater ability to successfully recruit in the plots, forming clusters that may be in turn be impenetrable to P. pinaster. Therefore, in order to maintain mixed stands, it would be necessary to enforce adequate silvicultural management strategies which avoid future stand dominance by P. pinea. "

However, little has been done to explore the necessary enabling conditions for synergistic design and implementation. This paper proposes an analytical framework to assess enabling conditions for synergies at the national level and applies it to developing countries to explore the potential move toward synergy. Four enabling conditions for integrating adaptation and mitigation, i.e. policies and strategies, programs and projects, institutional arrangements and financial mechanisms, were used to score developing countries relative to each other. We hypothesized that low income and vulnerable countries might more likely pursue synergy given the urgency for both adaptation and mitigation. Despite the relative infancy of the synergy concept, about half of countries studied exhibited good synergy potential, 80% of which were middle-income developing countries. The assumption of vulnerability as a precursor for pursuing synergy was supported by the fact that small island states possessed relatively high synergy potential. Income was weakly associated with the synergy potential with least developed countries having low synergy scores. Emerging economies possessed strong synergy potential which might be associated with better capacity available and/or potential for shaping their global images due to their growing emissions. In sum, the proposed analytical framework could be useful to identify areas of emphasis to promote holistic and efficient climate policies. As this study largely focused on the enabling conditions, further studies are needed to scrutinize and manage the mitigation-adaptation balances in countries possessing good synergy potentials. "

The regional analysis of land cover changes in heterogeneous landscapes can be masked by spatial variations caused by both bioclimatic and socioeconomic factors. Recognizing these influences, however, can be critical for designing conservation policies suited for each region. In this study, we examined the main processes of land cover change in Spain during c. 20 years (1987–2006), using \{CORINE\} land cover maps and five comparative spatial frameworks based on biomes (temperate and Mediterranean) and protection levels (Nationally Designated areas, European Natura Net 2000 and unprotected areas). We observed high land cover persistence (ca. 93%) throughout Spain, but with important anthropization processes and internal changes in natural areas – which experienced a slight decrease – while, agrarian areas remained almost stable. However, there were significant differences in the occupation, intensity and direction of change depending on the biome and protection level. The Mediterranean region had lower persistence and higher anthropization processes than the temperate region, suggesting a high vulnerability to land cover changes for natural habitat and related species. Overall, we observed a lower intensity of anthropization processes in protected areas, increasing the persistence of natural and agrarian areas; key habitats for species conservation. The highest persistence of natural areas corresponds to Nationally Designated Protected (NDP) areas, while in Natura Net 2000 we found the highest agrarian areas persistence. Nevertheless, Natura Net 2000 areas – with the exception of those nominated as \{NDP\} – had the largest increase of artificial surfaces as well as the highest internal processes of change within natural areas due to disturbances. The trends reported in this study suggest the importance of effective management plans and conservation measures that ensure both habitat and species conservation, especially in the Mediterranean region. In the case of Natura Net 2000, where traditional agricultural and livestock activities had a larger importance, it would be advisable to definitively implement the pending management plans, which are feasible and compatible with local human activities.

By 1999 electricity was used by almost all households in towns with good electricity supplies, while use of firewood in these towns was infrequent.

The upland rice-based systems tested were: (1) fallow crop rotation, including natural fallow (NaFa) and Tephrosia fallow (TepFa); (2) continuous cropping, including monocropping (Mono), Tephrosia hedgerow intercropping (TepAl), and Tephrosia mulch transfer (TepMu). In this paper, findings concerning net returns per labour day and the response of farmers to the test systems are presented. The Tephrosia systems (TepFa, TepAl, and TepMu) and the existing systems (NaFa and Mono) were evaluated using both experimental measurements and participatory rural appraisal (PRA) techniques. In the different treatments over a 4-year rotation, 386–778 labour days ha−1 were used, while 2612–4924 kg ha−1 upland rice grain and 939–9601 kg ha−1 fuel wood were harvested. The upland rice grain harvested was enough to feed 8.7–16.4 persons ha−1.

Farmer criteria concerning management, labour input and soil conservation were well in accordance with the findings on labour input, crop yields and net returns. The Tephrosia systems seemed not to be rational alternatives for situations where the natural fallow systems are still viable.

In this study we incorporate positive resource-mediated interactions in classic resource competition theory and investigate the main consequences for plant population dynamics and species coexistence. We focus on plant communities for which water infiltration rates exhibit positive dependency on plant biomass and where plant responses can be improved by shading, particularly under water limiting conditions. We show that the effects of these two resource-mediated positive interactions are similar and additive. We predict that positive interactions shift the transition points between different species compositions along environmental gradients and that realized niche widths will expand or shrink. Furthermore, continuous transitions between different community compositions can become discontinuous and bistability or tristability can occur. Moreover, increased infiltration rates may give rise to a new potential coexistence mechanism that we call controlled facilitation. "

We measured variations in the δ13C of soil organic matter at eight sites now occupied by forest or savannah. The forest sites were selected to cover two regions (forest refugia and peneplains) which are thought to have experienced different intensities of disturbance during the latest Pleistocene and the Holocene. We found that none of the forest sites underwent major disturbances during the Holocene, i.e. they were not replaced by \{C4\} savannahs or \{C4\} forest savannahs for long periods. Our results thus suggest that tropical rainforests in northern French Guiana were resilient to drier climatic conditions during the Holocene.

Cultural evolution theory predicts which social learning biases we expect people to use, but much less often when—during a person's life cycle— different social learning biases will be used. By measuring knowledge and skill variation among age cohorts, it is possible to infer how people socially acquire different types of knowledge at different ages. We use this strategy among the Jenu Kuruba, a tribal community in South India. We document the accumulation of local knowledge required for collecting wild honey among 71 children and 125 adults from five communities. Combining quantitative measurements of knowledge with measures of four honey-collecting skills and self-reported data on learning age, we infer patterns of social learning across the lifecycle. We find that (1) most knowledge related to honey collecting is acquired by the early 20s, and later social learning mainly functions to update information; (2) the eldest cohort has the highest average explicit knowledge, although the most knowledgeable or skilled individuals do not always belong to the most elderly cohort; (3) length of learning can be affected by age-dependent trade-offs of costs and benefits to learners; and (4) children tend to learn from parents, but individuals use other demonstrators later in life. These results have implications for current models of cultural evolution. "

Local competition is asymmetric with the same superior competitor in both patches. Migration is asymmetric, species dependent and fast in comparison to local competitive interactions. The species and patches are taken to be otherwise similar: in both patches we assume the same carrying capacities for both species, and the same growth rates and pair-wise competition coefficients for each species. We show that global dynamics can be described by a classical Lotka–Volterra competition model. We found that by modifying the ratio of intraspecific migration rates for both species all possible combinations of global species relative dominance can be achieved. We find specific conditions for which the local superior competitor is globally excluded.

At three locations in Central Spain, we assessed \{SOC\} stocks in the forest floor and down to 50 cm in the mineral in pure and mixed stands of Pyrenean oak and Scots pine, as well as litterfall inputs over approximately 3 years at two sites. The relative \{SOC\} stability in the topsoil (0–10 cm) was determined through size-fractionation (53 μm) into mineral-associated and particulate organic matter and through KMnO4-reactive C and soil C:N ratio. Scots pine soils stored 95–140 Mg ha−1 of C (forest floor plus 50 cm mineral soil), roughly the double than Pyrenean oak soils (40–80 Mg ha−1 of C), with stocks closely correlated to litterfall rates. Differences were most pronounced in the forest floor and uppermost 10 cm of the mineral soil, but remained evident in the deeper layers. Biochemical indicators of soil organic matter suggested that biochemical recalcitrance of soil organic matter was higher under pine than under oak, contributing as well to a greater \{SOC\} storage under pine. Differences in \{SOC\} stocks between tree species were mainly due to the particulate organic matter (not associated to mineral particles). Forest conversion from Pyrenean oak to Scots pine may contribute to enhance soil C sequestration, but only in form of mineral-unprotected soil organic matter. "

We used a new approach to simultaneously account for climate–growth relationships, inter-annual growth variability, and stand structural changes, by fitting a linear mixed effects model (LMEM) for basal area increments (BAI) using climate data, tree-ring chronologies, and repeated forest inventory data. This approach showed the potential to improve our understanding of climate effects on tree growth and to include climate in empirical forest growth models. We used the \{LMEM\} to make projections of \{BAI\} growth under two \{CO2\} emission scenarios and two global circulation models (GCM). The main climate drivers for growth were precipitation from previous autumn to summer and winter temperature with a positive effect, and temperature in spring–summer which had a negative effect. Tree response to climate was modulated by stand conditions, tree competition, and productivity. The more productive stands showed greater ability to either maintain or increase growth at warmer spring–summer temperatures under different levels of autumn–summer precipitation. Growth projections showed important regional differences. In general, growth under future climate is predicted to decrease although moderate growth increases might be expected in the northern region for highly and moderately productive stands. "

After laccase treatment, a negative impact on enzymatic hydrolysis was observed. This effect, together with the low enzymatic hydrolysis yields when increasing consistency, resulted in a decrease in final ethanol yields. Furthermore, when using high substrate loading (20% \{DM\} (w/v)), high concentration of inhibitors prevailed in broths and the absence of an extra nitrogen source led to a total cell growth inhibition within the first 24 h in non-treated samples.

Much less is known about this variation within tree species and, in particular, about its relationship with performance variables such as photosynthetic rates under water deficit. Nevertheless, this knowledge is fundamental to understand the adaptive potential of drought sensitive tree species to increased aridity as predicted in the context of climate change. Intraspecific variation in photosynthetic performance and other leaf functional traits in response to water availability were examined in a glasshouse experiment using seedlings of six European beech populations. The physiological response of seedlings to a “water stress” treatment was compared to a “control” treatment along an experimental cycle of progressive soil water deficit and recovery. We found evidence of intraspecific variation in beech's photosynthetic performance and other leaf functional traits in response to water availability. We also detected intraspecific variation in leaf-level tolerance of water deficit and phenotypic plasticity to water availability suggesting a pattern shaped by both regional and local scale effects. The Swedish population was particularly sensitive to water deficit, being the only population showing impaired photochemical efficiency under the experimental water deficit. Leaf-level tolerance of water deficit was related to PNUE, but not to other functional traits, such as WUE, \{SLA\} or leaf nitrogen content, that have been described to vary across species in adaptation to drought tolerance. Our results support the idea that general trends for variation in functional traits across species do not necessarily reflect a similar pattern when observed at the intraspecific level. The observed functional variation between beech populations reaffirms the importance of local adaptation to water deficit in the context of climate change. "

Today, large-scale forest decline is observed at the rear edge of Mediterranean forests, with drought identified as the most likely driver. The vulnerability of Mediterranean mountain plantations to regional climatic variations; however, is poorly understood. In this paper, we analyze the impact of biotic and abiotic factors on the growth and vigor of two pine species in drought-prone areas. We assess the main factors influencing crown defoliation and radial growth to develop a predictive model of forest decline risk for pine plantations at the dry edge of the species range. Dendrochronological data were collected on 50 plots for Pinus nigra subsp. salzmanii and 40 plots for Pinus sylvestris. We examined tree size, competition, site characteristics and climate variables related to decline of pine plantations. Correlation and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to identify the correlates of decline with crown condition and growth, separately. Logistic regression and generalized linear models were used to study the relationship between canopy defoliation and growth, respectively, for P. nigra and P. sylvestris. Explanatory variables were introduced in a stepwise selection. The \{PCA\} revealed three main axes, associated with climate, competition and physiographic variables. Those three axes were associated with crown damage and basal area growth, respectively. Probability of crown damage was associated with tree size, competition and climate conditions. P. sylvestris was more sensitive than P. nigra to summer potential evapotranspiration effects. Also, climate and competition were the two main drivers affecting basal area growth. Unlike crown defoliation, physiography had an important effect. Within each species, there was a divergence between healthy and damaged trees, mainly related to competition factors. On the other hand, growth trends as an independent variable were not included in the crown damage probability model in a stepwise selection. However, declining growth found in trees at higher crown defoliation and drier sites may imply a greater vulnerability to decline, suggesting an enhanced die-off risk. The sharp growth reduction and widespread defoliation in declining pine plantations make their future persistence in xeric sites subject to frequent and severe droughts unlikely under expected warmer and drier conditions in the future.

The analysis includes a sample of 37,761 plots for 38 commercial tree species in the Spanish Mediterranean region, where we identify sustainable and non-sustainable forests in terms of harvesting intensities and value both the flow of benefits and their net present value. From the analysis we conclude that non-sustainable forests are providing higher economic returns than sustainable forests for most abundant tree species. However, when analysing long term trends, results show that sustainable forests yield higher economic benefits. This latter perspective is preferred when looking at the value of timber as a provisioning service of forests. According to our results, if we wish to encourage sustainability we need to (a) get lower discount rates adopted for the private sector and (b) ensure longer time horizons. "

In this regard frugivory (i.e., the intake of fruits by animals) enhances natural regeneration by mobilizing a large amount of seeds from source trees to deposition sites across the landscape. By doing so, frugivores move propagules, and the genotypes they harbour creating the spatial, ecological, and genetic environment under which subsequent recruitment proceeds. Recruitment patterns can be envisioned as the result of two density- and distance-dependent processes: seed dispersal and seed/seedling survival (the Janzen–Connell model). Population genetic studies add another layer of complexity for understanding the fate of dispersed propagules: the genetic relatedness among neighbouring seeds within a seed clump, a major outcome of frugivore activity, modifies their chances of germinating and surviving. Yet, we virtually ignore how the spatial distribution of maternal progenies and recruitment patterns relate with each other in frugivore-generated seed rains. Here we focus on the critical role of frugivore-mediated seed dispersal in shaping the spatial distribution of maternal progenies in the seed rain. We first examine which genetic mechanisms underlying recruitment are influenced by the spatial distribution of maternal progenies. Next, we examine those studies depicting the spatial distribution of maternal progenies in a frugivore-generated seed rain. In doing so, we briefly review the most suitable analytical approaches applied to track the contribution of fruiting trees to the seed rain based on molecular data. Then we look more specifically at the role of distinct frugivore guilds in determining maternal genetic correlations and their expected consequences for recruitment patterns. Finally we posit some general conclusions and suggest future research directions that would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of dispersal mutualisms in plant populations.

abstract = "Multiple-use forest management (MFM) for timber, non-timber forest products and environmental services is envisioned by many as a preferable alternative to timber-dominant management models. It is praised as a more equitable strategy of satisfying the demands from multiple stakeholders, an ecologically more benign harvesting approach, and a way of adding more value to forests making them more robust to conversion. \{MFM\} thus represents a common and prime management objective under the sustainable forest management (SFM) paradigm. However, its implementation has been lagging behind the expectations, particularly in the tropics. In this paper, we analyze selected \{MFM\} implementation examples to try to explain why. We scrutinize the tropical forestry debate to find that the meaning of \{MFM\} has undergone significant changes along the way, and that the topic depends heavily on the scale of inspection. Also, we examine the conditions that either favor or constrain \{MFM\} adoption. At the local scale, the factors that set the scene for multiple-use approaches to be successfully adopted are favorable governance conditions relate to land-devolution policies, effective collective institutions, and multi-agent forest-management models. \{MFM\} feasibility also depends on the stage of forest transition, i.e. in society's economic development. \{MFM\} (at the stand level) dominates in poor subsistence-oriented autarchic forest settings, it typically declines when entering capitalist stages of specialized commodity production, but may then rebound (at the landscape level) in more advanced development stages. Key factors \{MFM\} generally is up against range from intricate technical trade-offs to the economies of scale in forestry production and marketing. \{MFM\} remains a valid management alternative under specifically favorable local context conditions, especially when practiced at the landscape scale, but these conditions are less frequent than commonly assumed.

The data used to build the model came from 41 permanent plots belonging to the Spanish National Forest Inventory with the dependent variable being 10-year diameter increment over bark for trees larger than 7.5 cm at breast height. The basic field data required for predictions had been divided into four main groups: size of the tree, stand variables, competition indices and biogeoclimatic variables. The most significant independent variables were the individual-tree diameter, the basal area of trees larger than the subject tree, dominant height, site index and biogeoclimatic stratum. The model was defined as a mixed linear model with random plot effect, achieving an efficiency of 44.38%. The accuracy of the model was tested against the modelling data and against independent data from the same stands. Mixed model calibration of diameter increment was carried out with the independent data using a different sample of complementary observations of the dependent variable. The calibrated model was an improvement on the trivial model, which assumes constancy in diameter increment for a short projection period, especially the pattern of residuals with respect to predicted diameter and the independent variables.

The wild European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus L., a hunted and threatened species in its native range, is at the same time a key species for the preservation of threatened Mediterranean predators. Cereal sowing is one of the most common practices to augment the food supply of rabbits, and it is used not only by hunters but also by conservationists. At present, limited scientific information is available regarding the effectiveness of cereal sowing. To evaluate its effectiveness, we analysed data on sowing trials conducted in 125 plots, located in 14 private estates throughout central Spain, most of them with low density populations. Brush was cleared from 44 of these plots prior to sowing. Our results indicated that rabbits preferentially selected sown areas over control (unsown) areas. This selection increased in plots that represented suitable habitats for rabbits, such as pasturelands, as well as when thicket islands and natural or artificial shelters were available within the sown plots. Local enhancement of rabbit populations was also observed. These positive results were also obtained regardless of the initial habitat conditions, not only in the treatment plots but also in the surrounding area. Our recommendations can be broadly applied for managing rabbit-dependent threatened species. "

Data were supplied by the Forest Research Centre of the National Institute of Agricultural and Food Research (INIA) of Spain, consisting of a Permanent Sample Plot network (PSP) covering different stand conditions. In this study, 84 plots for Mediterranean maritime pine and 74 plots for Scots pine were used. Several models were tested. Variables concerning tree size, competition and social position of the tree were introduced in stepwise selection. The ratio diameter at breast height versus quadratic mean diameter and the interaction basal area-site index resulted as the most significant variables in the case of Mediterranean maritime pine. For Scots pine, the most significant variables were site index, DBH−1 and the interaction between basal area of larger trees and the coefficient of variation of the \{DBH\} distribution as a surrogate of structure. Results indicate that competition, tree size and social position within the stand are present in the survival process of both species. One-sided competition in highly structured stands for Scots pine and two-sided competition for Mediterranean maritime pine, are shown to be also important. Model evaluation has been done with data from the \{PSP\} not used in the fitting process. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve is 0.86 for Mediterranean maritime pine and 0.85 for Scots pine. The overall predicted rates of survival and mortality are shown for different cut-off points, indicating that the use of random uniform numbers yields better results. Afterwards, the performance of the model in thinned stands is tested for both species. Results for Mediterranean maritime pine show that it is appropriate to use the same model both for unthinned and thinned stands. However, a new model should be fitted for thinned Scots pine stands.

The objective of the study was to explore the spatial arrangement of some stand attributes such as age of trees, diameter at breast height (DBH), total height, diameter increment and number of female strobili and cones. Genetic data (three highly polymorphic nuclear microsatellites) were used to investigate extend of relatedness within the stand and differentiate between genetic and environmental causes of spatial aggregation. We employed, in the analysis of tree attributes, only geostatistical tools (direct and cross variograms as well as their indicator counterparts). The results revealed that all the studied attributes are spatially correlated and some of them cross-correlated. Competition and height were found to be key-variables in stand dynamics, which influence the rest of the attributes. Fine-scale genetic structure exists within the stand (0–30 m range). Relatedness between neighboring trees can partially explain the spatial aggregation of individual tree attributes. Geostatistical tools are recommended for this type of spatial analysis of forest stands. Their use can provide useful insights into the nature of stand organization and can guide future silvicultural treatment toward higher stand productivity or better and faster regeneration. "

At the end of the first year, biomass production from the different poplar plantations differed significantly among sites and densities. Furthermore, after one year of growth, biomass production was found to increase exponentially with plot density. However, after three years of growth, at the end of the first rotation, significant differences were not found. When we analyzed the variables that affect the production, we found that weed control and therefore a reduction in competition explained much of the variability. The greatest biomass production was achieved in high density plots in more southern latitudes where high spring temperatures benefit trees growing in well-watered soils. Considering on the one hand the scope of current weed control methods and on the other, the cost of plantation and/or the difficulties associated with management and mechanisation, plantation densities of more than 15,000 plants ha−1 would not be recommendable.

Here, we investigated whether rising water stress determined enhanced Pinus sylvestris L. mortality at the species low-elevation limit in Central Spain. We analyzed the factors determining the health status of pines and compared with co-occurring and more drought-tolerant Quercus pyrenaica Willd. along one transect following an elevation gradient. We used ordinal logistic regression to model the susceptibility of a tree to decline in relation to variability in stand competition and individual growth-patterns. The mortality pattern differed with local site conditions. Pine growth was faster but life-span shorter at drier and warmer low-elevations than at high-elevations. However, within stands, healthy trees exhibited less abrupt growth reductions and higher growth-rates but not as a consequence of lower competition, which under present stand conditions did not seem to increase adult mortality risk. Low moisture availability reduced tree-growth and, although P. sylvestris is less tolerant to drought, Q. pyrenaica was more sensitive to year-to-year moisture variability. Previous growth of dead trees from both species declined with rising water stress after the 1970s at low-elevations, which suggests that water stress intensity limited particularly tree-growth of dead trees in the long-term. For pines, widespread symptoms of crown decline (expressed by mistletoe infestation and defoliation) were only observed at low-elevation stands where, in opposition to oaks, weakened and healthy pines also exhibited recent negative growth-trends parallel to those of dead trees. The pervasive growth decline with enhanced water stress in pines from all health status at the species sampled xeric ecotone combined with the abundant crown decline symptoms observed, suggest pine vulnerability and could portend widespread mortality at its current low-elevation limit.

So, the aim of this work was to evaluate the phenolic composition of wines elaborated from Monastrell grapevines treated with a commercial oak extract in order to study its biostimulant activity. Several families of polyphenols were studied, including phenolic acids, stilbenes, flavanols, flavonols and anthocyanins, which were analyzed by HPLC-DAD-MS. Results showed oak extract could be considered like an important biostimulant of grape polyphenols, since it affected grape composition, producing less alcoholic and acid wines with higher colour intensity, lower shade and so a more stable colour and higher content of polyphenols such as gallic acid, hydroxycynnamoyltartaric acids, acylated anthocyanins, flavanols and stilbenes.

A modified WaNuLCAS model was then used to infer the amount of water redistribued based on ψs values. Tree transpiration rate was also estimated from sap velocity using thermal dissipative probes (TDP) and sapwood area, and the contribution of hydraulically redistributed water in tree transpiration was determined. The results revealed on average that 46% of the psychrometer readings under karité and 33% under néré showed the occurrence of \{HR\} for the two years. Soil under néré displayed significantly lower fluctuations of ψs (0.16 MPa) compared to soil under karité (0.21 MPa). The results of this study indicated that the existence of \{HR\} leads to a higher ψs in the plant rhizosphere and hence is important for soil water dynamics and plant nutrition by making more accessible the soluble elements. The simulation showed that the amount of water redistributed would be approximately 73.0 L and 247.1 L per tree per day in 2005 for karité and néré, and would represent respectively 60% and 53% of the amount transpired a day. Even though the model has certainly overestimated the volume of water hydraulically redistributed by the two species, this water may play a key role in maintaining fine root viability and ensuring the well adaptation of these species to the dry areas. Therefore, knowledge of the extent of such transfers and of the seasonal patterns is required and is of paramount importance in parkland systems both for trees and associated crops. "

As a continuation of this study, the present research evaluates different aspects, including pretreatment conditions, process configurations and substrate loadings, with the aim to proceed towards the use of K. marxianus and laccases for second generation ethanol production. For it, two wheat straw slurries resulting from different steam explosion pretreatment conditions (200 °C, 2.5 min and 220 °C, 2.5 min) were employed at various substrate loadings [5–14% (w/v)] under two process configurations: \{SSF\} (simultaneous saccharification and fermentation) and \{PSSF\} (presaccharification and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation). The better performance of K. marxianus was observed on the slurry produced at softer conditions. Its lower inhibitors content allowed to increase the total solids loading up to 10% (w/v) in both process configurations, reaching higher ethanol concentrations (12 g/L). Moreover, laccase detoxification improved these results, particularly in \{SSF\} processes, increasing the substrate loading up to 12% (w/v) and, consequently, obtaining the highest ethanol concentration (16.7 g/L).

The partnership scheme aims to reduce illegal logging and forest encroachment on abandoned state plantations initially developed in 1986. However, the cooperatives have no secure full rights to harvest the mature teak trees (Tectona grandis) inside the plantations, as important incentives to maintain their commitment. This paper aims to explore the potential benefits of different scenarios, as the basis for convincing the Ministry of Forestry (MoF) to give full secure rights to the local communities. In this study, we used a participatory modelling approach, to identify problems and to define future scenarios of partnership arrangements with the local key stakeholders. This research used the concept of system dynamics modelling, which included the two concepts of systems thinking and resilience. As a management tool, the visualisation of the management alternatives and their associated impacts had stimulated the community's awareness of the importance of protecting the teak plantations from illegal logging and forest encroachment. The simulation results have also shown how granting local communities a full secure access to manage the state forest does not necessarily reduce the revenue for the government at all levels. "

Stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) is one of the main species in the Mediterranean basin that is able to grow under hard limiting conditions (sandy soils and extreme continental climate), and typically defined as a masting species. Considering the high economical value associated with edible nut production, the masting habit of stone pine has been a main concern for the forest management of the species. In the present work we have used annual fruit data series from 740 stone pine trees measured during a 13 years period (1996–2008) in order: (a) to verify our main hypothesis pointing out to the existence of a weather control of the fruiting process in limiting environments, rather than resource depletion or endogenous inherent cycles; (b) to identify those site factors, stand attributes and climate events affecting specific traits involved in fruiting process; and (c) to construct a model for predicting spatial and temporal patterns of variability in stone pine cone production at different spatial extents as region, stand and tree. Given the nature of the data, the model has been formulated as zero-inflated log-normal, incorporating random components to carry out with the observed lack of independence. This model attains efficiencies close to 70–80% in predicting temporal and spatial variability at regional scale. Though efficiencies are reduced according to the spatial extent of the model, it leads to unbiased estimates and efficiencies over 35–50% when predicting annual yields at tree or stand scale, respectively. In this sense, the proposed model is a main tool for facilitating decision making in some management aspects such as the quantification of total amount of cones annually supplied to nut industry, design of cone harvest programs or the optimal application of seedling felling.

Study of the flammability of different plant species is essential for the Mediterranean area, where most ecosystems are adapted to natural fire but vulnerable to recurrent human-induced fires, which are the main cause of forest degradation. However, the methods used to evaluate vegetation flammability have not yet been standardized. Cupressus sempervirens is a native or naturalized forest tree species in the Mediterranean area that is able to tolerate prolonged drought and high temperatures. The aim of this study was to characterize the flammability of C. sempervirens var. horizontalis at particle level by using different bench-scale calorimetry techniques (mass loss calorimeter, epiradiator and oxygen bomb) to determine the main flammability descriptors (ignitability, sustainability, combustibility and consumability) in live crown and litter samples. Our findings indicate that this variety of cypress is relatively resistant to ignition because of the high ash content, the high critical heat flux, the high time to ignition displayed by both crown and litter samples and the ability of the leaves to maintain a high water content during the summer. We also discuss the possibility of exploiting some morphological, functional and ecological traits of the species to construct a barrier system (with selected varieties of cypress) as a promising complementary land management tool to reduce the fire spread and intensity in a Mediterranean context.

This work analyzed the long-term effect of two standard thinning regimes on carbon stocks both in tree biomass and soil compartments as well as its effect on soil condition. The target population was a 90-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand in southwestern Europe. Soil condition was measured as dry mass of the forest floor and concentration of carbon, nutrients in the forest floor as well as exchangeable cations, effective cation exchange capacity, pH and bulk density in the mineral soil. Repeated thinnings from below in a southern European population of Scots pine led to a reduction in current on-site carbon stock in tree biomass of 28% in moderately thinned stands (D grade: average residual basal area of 65–79% relative to the control plots) which was consistent with an observed loss of volume production. However, the inclusion of the amount of carbon exported off-site with harvested biomass reduced the decrease in stock to 4.8%. Nutrient concentrations in the forest floor increased in moderate thinned stands (P, K, Mg and Mn) or were unchanged (C, N and Fe). The selected thinning regime did not alter mineral soil condition. A decreasing pattern of Ca and Mn stocks with depth was consistent with a high reduction of nutrient concentration of elements and higher bulk density with depth. However K, Mg and Na showed stable stocks across depths because of a much smaller reduction of nutrient concentrations in deeper layers relative to the surface layer. We hypothesized that this stable pattern with soil depth was due to leaching. The sustainability of forest thinning is a trade-off between loss of standing biomass and increasing stand stability as long as other indicators, like soil condition, do not significantly change. "

A soil sampling campaign was conducted in a replicated stratified random manner on three land uses that had been continuously managed for over 30 years. Samples were analyzed for organic carbon and nitrogen contents, δ13C, δ15N, pH and texture. Compared to sites implementing conventional agriculture, the establishment of \{SWC\} structures in this erosion-prone landscape resulted in the recovery of \{SOM\} levels comparable to those observed in neighboring semi-natural ecosystems. Sites under conventional agriculture practices contained 20 Mg C ha− 1 (0.85 m), while sites with \{SWC\} measures and those hosting semi-natural vegetation stored above a third more. There were significant differences in soil C/N ratios as well as in δ13C and δ15N values between \{SWC\} cultivation practices classified according to the presence or absence of trees. The presence of woody vegetation in sites with \{SWC\} structures had a strong impact on the spatial variability of SOM-related properties. There was also a significant negative relationship between δ15N values and C/N ratios across the different land uses. Our findings indicate the existence of contrasting \{SOM\} dynamics caused by vegetation-related effects, and provide suggestions for enhancing \{SOM\} storage in agricultural sites implementing \{SWC\} measures.

However, although the Iberian North-West extreme would appear to be climatically suitable for the species, F. sylvatica is not present there. This fact has led to the suggestion that the species is not yet in equilibrium with the climate and that there is a migration lag in the post-glacial expansion of the species. The objective of this work is to understand the main biotic and abiotic factors driving F. sylvatica distribution and population dynamics in the Iberian Atlantic biogeographical region over recent decades. Furthermore, in the light of other studies which suggest that the expansion of F. sylvatica in North-Western Iberia might be related to the retraction of Q. petraea (Matt.) Leibl. forests, we also study the demographic trends of both F. sylvatica and Q. petraea along with oak-beech interaction processes to infer forest succession dynamics. Using data from the last two cycles of the Spanish National Forest Inventory (1986–2012) for the study area (the Iberian Atlantic biogeographical region); dominance, population structure, recruitment and basal area increment were analyzed in different forest types for the two target species. General linear models and Bayesian structural equation modelling techniques were also applied to study the direct and indirect drivers of recruitment and forest succession. Contrary to what might be expected under the current conditions of climatic change, the population of F. sylvatica in North-Western Iberia is expanding, the basal area increment of F. sylvatica increasing westwards and new recruitment occurring in the lowlands. Accordingly, the Iberian Atlantic biogeographical region may be considered one of the leading edges of F. sylvatica. Our results also identify an inter-specific relationship between Q. petraea and F. sylvatica which negatively affects Q. petraea. The findings demonstrate that Q. petraea forests are being replaced by F. sylvatica forests in North-Western Iberia. These results not only confirm a previous biogeographical hypothesis but also provide new leads for forest management and conservation strategies under current and future climatic conditions. "

However, this activity is decreasing, especially in arid environments, where considerable biodiversity loss is expected in the near future. Meanwhile, wild ungulate populations are regaining long lost territories and densities. The question arises as to how far wild ungulates could substitute the ecological role traditionally played by extensive livestock. This study focuses on the effect of an exotic wild ungulate, the aoudad (Ammotragus lervia), on the woody vegetation of a semiarid protected area in Southeast Spain where it was introduced in 1970. Forty-five field surveys provided information on the effect of browsing on 92 woody plant species and on the aoudad's feeding behavior. Small shrubs were the most preferred species and showed, on average, higher levels of browsing damage. However, browsing intensity was low in broadleaved trees and negligible in conifers. Highly preferred and sparse shrub species might be severely affected by medium to high aoudad densities. The aoudad could become an opportunity for arid environments that lack native wild ungulates and traditional livestock grazing, since it could partially fulfill most ecological roles played by livestock. However, it could also become a threat should it become overabundant. "

Given the economic, social and environmental vulnerability due to high water scarcity and variability in the basin, improvements in agricultural water management (AWM) are needed to ensure sustainable benefits. A survey was conducted among 326 crop-livestock households in four water scarce sites of the basin in Burkina Faso and Ghana to characterize households in terms of access to water, services and information, \{AWM\} intensity and livelihoods, and to explore the linkages between these characteristics. The sources of water were more diverse for study sites in Ghana than in Burkina, allowing different types of \{AWM\} strategies. Most of the farmers perceived a strong positive impact of \{AWM\} strategies on their livelihoods. Almost 70% of the variation in livelihood assets was explained by variation in \{AWM\} intensity, affecting mainly food consumption, sources of income and housing index. With increasing access to water, services and information, \{AWM\} intensity significantly increased, as well as labour for water-related activities and food consumption. This increase in \{AWM\} was significantly related to an increase in livelihood assets (R2 = 52%). Policies should be developed to improve access to information and services as well as access to market in rural areas of the Volta Basin, to enhance positive impact of \{AWM\} strategies on livelihoods of the rural households.

abstract = "Abstract Forest decline and increasing tree mortality are of global concern and the identification of the causes is necessary to develop preventive measures. Global warming is an emerging factor responsible for the increasing tree mortality in drought-prone ecosystems. In the southwestern Iberian Peninsula, Mediterranean holm oak open woodlands currently undergo large-scale population-level tree die-off. In this region, temperature and aridity have increased during recent decades, but the possible role of climate change in the current oak mortality has not been investigated. To assess the role of climate change in oak die-off in managed open woodlands in southwestern Spain, we analyzed climate change-related signals in century-long tree ring chronologies of dead holm oaks. We examined the high/low-frequency variability in growth and the relationship between growth and climate. Similar to other Mediterranean forests, growth was favored by precipitation from autumn of the year prior to ring formation to spring of the year of ring formation, whereas high temperatures during spring limited growth. Since the 1970s, the intensity of the high-frequency response to water availability increased simultaneously with temperature and aridity. The growth trends matched those of climatic changes. Growth suppressions occurred during droughts in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Widespread stand-level, age-independent mortality occurred since 2005 and affected trees that cannot be considered old for the species standards. The close relationship between growth and climate indicate that climate change strongly controlled the growth patterns. This suggests that harsher climatic conditions, especially increased aridity, affected the tree performance and could have played a significant role in the mortality process. Climate change may have exacerbated or predisposed trees to the impact of other factors (e.g. intense management and pathogens). These observations could suggest a similar future increase in oak mortality which may occur in more northern oak open woodlands if aridity further increases. "

Precisely how the biological traits of plants and the cultural practices of farmers act on fundamental evolutionary forces – drift, migration, selection, and mutation – to create and maintain crop plant diversity has been little investigated in detail. We develop some elements of the framework required for studying such biocultural interactions, focusing on one component of management: farmers' decisions on what to plant, and the structure of germplasm exchange among farmers. We illustrate the approach with a study of Duupa farmers in northern Cameroon. Our results suggest that sorghum populations managed by the Duupa function like source–sink metapopulations. Fields of older farmers, larger and containing a greater number of varieties, act as sources, whereas fields of younger farmers act as sinks, becoming sources as their owners mature. In each field, seeds for sowing are selected from a small number of plants. The frequent exchange of germplasm among fields may counteract the genetic bottlenecks associated with the small number of genitors within each field. Identifying key processes and key individuals should facilitate the design of in situ conservation measures to maintain crop plant diversity against the threat of genetic erosion. "

The antennae bore several types of sensilla. Two plate areas in the proximal and distal ends of each antennal segment were covered with basiconic sensilla that responded to the odour stimuli. Sensilla basiconica contained one or two cells of different spike amplitude. The 32 male and 38 female \{ORNs\} tested responded with excitations or inhibitions to the different plant odours. In general the response of male and female receptors was very similar so they were pooled to perform a cluster analysis on \{ORN\} responses. Six \{ORNs\} were clearly specialised for pheromone reception. Responses to kairomone and smoke odours were less specific than those of pheromone, but a group of 9 cells was clearly excited by smoke compounds (mainly eugenol and 4-methyl 2-methoxyphenol), a group of 8 cells was very responsive to α-pinene, β-pinene and cis-verbenol, and a group of 14 cells responded to a wider range of compounds. The rest of the cells (47%) were either non-responsive or slightly inhibited by smoke compounds. Dose–response curves were obtained for several compounds. Different compounds induced significantly different latencies and these appeared to be unrelated to their boiling point. "

We analyze functional connectivity in a holm oak (Quercus ilex) fragmented landscape by considering three important stages driving recruitment: effective pollination, acorn production and acorn dispersal. We used a network approach to (1) determine if pollen-mediated gene exchange across the landscape was spatially structured; (2) estimate the effects of limited acorn dispersal on functional connectivity; (3) identify which landscape traits could drive source–sink dynamics of gene flow. Although long distance dispersal was relatively frequent, most effective pollen flow occurred over short distances (&lt;100 m). This resulted in a significantly modular structure of the mating network, yielding higher gene flow among nearby fragments. Limited mouse acorn hoarding activity had a strong impact on landscape connectivity, decreasing male gametic immigration rates into forest patches by one order of magnitude Besides, our results show that big forest fragments (&gt;10 ha) are the main pollen sources, while small ones (&lt;1 ha) are important pollen sinks. Thus, big fragments are critical to maintain functional connectivity, while small forest fragments may provide acorn crops better representing regional genetic diversity. In addition to area effects, less isolated and more central fragments showed higher migration rates and exchanged effective pollen with more fragments. Hence, we expected that landscapes with uniform or clumped distribution of big forest fragments would show optimal connectivity traits. However, despite that simulated gene flow was more evenly distributed across the landscape, connectance and migration rates decreased. Our results call for caution before translating patch-level management guidelines to the landscape scale. They also show that the level of functional connectivity may change throughout the recruitment process, suggesting that large-scale conservation strategies may fail if local effective seed establishment is disregarded.

The \{ES\} approach is not widely understood by policymakers, the general public and the private sector. While the approach is a promising contribution to providing for common good outcomes from the management of natural resources, much needs to be done to ensure that it achieves the dual purposes of maintaining and enhancing the supply of different services and improving the livelihoods of the rural poor in developing countries. Critical areas for further attention are assessments of ecosystem services in developing countries that incorporate local and indigenous knowledge, clear links to policy and decision making, public education and engagement about the value of ecosystem services and payment mechanisms that drive local actions and contribute to local livelihoods.

In this paper, we compare the role of natural and planted Pinus spp. for the maintenance of regional forest bird diversity along large-scale ecological gradients in Southern Europe. We modelled the relative contribution of the extent of either natural or planted pine forests to explain the richness of pine-dwelling forest birds in 3950 sample units (10 km × 10 km cells) in peninsular Spain after controlling for the potential effects of geographical variables, environmental factors, surrounding land-uses, forest cover and vegetation structure within pine forests. Planted pine forests maintained less pine-dwelling forest bird species than did natural pine forests after controlling for confounding variables and structural differences. Such differences may be due to the time lags involved in forest bird community assembly. Regional and local drivers explaining the regional bird species richness varied among pine species, either natural or planted. Management recommendations to increase bird diversity should not be based on just mimicking natural pine forest structure as quickly as possible. Rather, specific practices should be developed locally together with the maintenance of unexploited natural stands for both reference and conservation of the results of the temporal component of community assembly.

Quantitative analyses were conducted within and near forest concessions in Cameroon to determine the density of multiple use tree species that provide both timber for industry and foods consumed by local populations (fruit and oil or edible caterpillars), and how this has been affected by logging. Individuals of the three species (Moabi, Baillonella toxisperma; Sapelli, Entandrophragma cylindricum; and Tali, Erythrophleum suaveolens), including their stumps, were identified and measured on 5 ha (100 m × 500 m) sample plots around 4 villages and in 2 concessions. Around each village 21 sample plots, stratified by distance, were laid out along three transects extending 10 km towards the concession, each oriented 45° from the other. In concessions, 20 plots were established within the 2012 cutting unit after timber harvesting, using a stratified random system. Moabi trees occurred at the lowest densities: around villages, 22.8 ± 3.3/100 ha of precommercial individuals and 5.0 ± 1.4/100 ha of individuals of harvestable size (⩾80 cm dbh); on concessions, 7.5 ± 2.4 precommercial trees/100 ha, and 0–2.0 ± 1.4/100 ha harvestable individuals. Densities of Sapelli trees were not significantly different between villages and concessions, averaging 32.6 ± 3.8/100 ha and 37.5 ± 5.5/100 ha, respectively, for precommercial sizes and 9.5 ± 2.2/100 ha and 6 ± 1.6/100 ha, respectively, for harvestable trees (⩾100 cm dbh). Pre-commercial Tali trees occurred at lower densities (3.8 ± 0.9/100 ha) around villages, as compared to 11.5 ± 3.1/100 ha on concessions. Harvestable Tali trees (⩾60 cm dbh) occurred at the same densities around villages and on concessions (56.0 ± 7.2/100 ha). Half, or more, of commercial-sized trees of caterpillar-hosting species were left standing after harvest on concessions (89–94% of Tali; 50–79% of Sapelli), reflecting constraints due to timber quality, market demand and inaccessibility. No harvestable Moabi trees were logged from the 2012 cutting areas, reflecting agreements between communities and concessionaires to leave them for fruit and oil, but densities were so low it will be important that villagers conserve those around their villages. Stumps of all three species were found around villages, revealing that mechanisms for negotiation are also needed among villagers with interests in either timber or non-timber resources obtained from the same tree species.

This study shows a goal programming-based methodology, which permits to select the best management alternative in 6 climate change scenarios when different indicators are aggregated over 100 years in a mountain forest in Central Spain. The results revealed the predominance of one management alternative (no management) when the preferences of the stakeholders were aggregated.

However, a growing number of studies report that community-based approaches are experiencing formidable challenges, with limited outcomes in terms of livelihoods, decentralization and sustainability. Yet, policies continue to focus attention unduly on “community participation”, ignoring the ways in which the “community” is itself embedded in a wider social system. Recent studies have shown that local communities are more complex than previously assumed, with local community actions being heavily shaped by wider social and environmental contexts. Yet, scholarly research tends to focus on reporting such cross-scalar dynamics, with little explanation of how and why they occur. This paper advances a framework to understand how local communities interact with the wider world, through what we term “delocalization of communities” in natural resource management. Using Bourdieu’s theory of social field, we present an approach to analyze various trajectories of delocalization involving the exchange of, and struggle for, a variety of resources valued in specific fields of natural resource governance. We extend the work of several researchers who have been critical of the conventional view of the community, and argue that a new model of delocalized “community” needs to be envisaged, one that emphasizes the interactions among actors within and between spatial scales and levels of political organization. While such a cross-scalar view is not novel, we deepen social field approach to assess how cross-scalar processes unfold in the course of “delocalization” of communities in the context of rapid social and environmental change. We draw on evidence from five different case studies from three continents that demonstrate specific aspects of the delocalization phenomenon. The cases selected are from Australia, Indonesia, Mexico, Nepal, and Papua New Guinea. We demonstrate through these cases that increasingly diverse interests in natural resources such as forests have served to delocalize communities beyond “local” domains. We conclude that local community is not a localized entity, and there are multiple cross-scale networks which need to be recognized, as these have profound implications in community-based natural resource management. In such situations, open and exploratory approaches - moving away from blueprint interventions - are required to facilitate context-specific fields and spheres of local democracy, nurturing diverse, flexible, and networked models of community participation, along with the recognition of political and economic influence coming from the wider domain.

For all the genotypes, experimental tests to quantify the moisture content, particle size distribution, bulk density, heating value, ash content and composition as well as the volatile matter were performed. In addition, natural air drying of biomass (stem and branches) was studied in two locations with the aim of determining the humidity loss during raw storage.

In this study we evaluated how water use strategies can influence the establishment phase of three coexisting species in forests where harvesting intensity and silvicultural interventions have been reduced over recent decades. We conducted a greenhouse experiment between February and July, applying two watering regimes (moist and dry) to current year seedlings in 1.5 m high pots to avoid root growth constraint. At the same time, the physiological performance of seedlings of the same species was monitored under natural conditions in the field over a period of decreasing soil moisture. Our results indicated that resprouter species allocated more than 40% of total biomass to roots whereas the non-resprouter P. pinea allocated only 26%. The plasticity index for the root traits was highest in Q. ilex, in which the highest stomatal conductance was measured in early summer. The slowest growth and lowest root plasticity, root hydraulic conductance and leaf water potential were measured in J. oxycedrus. The three species exhibited a positive carbon balance under low water availability. Coexisting species displayed a continuum in the water use strategies adopted. P. pinea would be the least competitive species under the forecasted increasing drought conditions in contrast to J. oxycedrus, which presents traits more suited to coping with droughts. "

Challenges with this concept and its applications are well documented, but have not yet been systematically assessed alongside strengths and external factors that influence uptake. Such an assessment could form the basis for improving \{ES\} thinking, further embedding it into environmental decisions and management. The Young Ecosystem Services Specialists (YESS) completed a Strengths–Weaknesses–Opportunities–Threats (SWOT) analysis of \{ES\} through \{YESS\} member surveys. Strengths include the approach being interdisciplinary, and a useful communication tool. Weaknesses include an incomplete scientific basis, frameworks being inconsistently applied, and accounting for nature's intrinsic value. Opportunities include alignment with existing policies and established methodologies, and increasing environmental awareness. Threats include resistance to change, and difficulty with interdisciplinary collaboration. Consideration of \{SWOT\} themes suggested five strategic areas for developing and implementing ES. The \{ES\} concept could improve decision-making related to natural resource use, and interpretation of the complexities of human-nature interactions. It is contradictory – valued as a simple means of communicating the importance of conservation, whilst also considered an oversimplification characterised by ambiguous language. Nonetheless, given sufficient funding and political will, the \{ES\} framework could facilitate interdisciplinary research, ensuring decision-making that supports sustainable development. "

This publicity could potentially generate financial and political support to prevent the species from becoming ‘extinct’ once again. However, it can also back-fire when publicity creates threats that were previously absent. In 2013, evidence that the Sumatran rhinoceros Dicerorhinus sumatrensis still existed in Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of the island of Borneo, made global headlines. The species was thought to have been extinct there for over a quarter of a century. The threat of poaching for its horn, however, remains as strong as ever. We question the decision to publicise this rediscovery. We argue that in the decades the species was thought to be extirpated, the population in Kalimantan could persist precisely because of the lack of attention. Interviews with hunters suggests that without information on the presence of rhinos, the perceived financial benefits of hunting down widely dispersed rhinos no longer justified the actual costs. The “publicize-and-protect” strategy now envisaged following the widely announced rediscovery of rhinos in Kalimantan requires immediate major conservation intervention, which, given the track record of conservation in Indonesia, is unlikely to be effective. We suggest that a secrecy-based strategy for Kalimantan’s rhinos would have had lower risks and potentially higher long-term returns for conservation. The trade-offs facing organizations with the exciting prospect of a Lazarus species is one between the costs and benefits of publicity. Costs and benefits change over time but may not do so at the same rate, and publicity can change these rates significantly. When, without publicity, costs are expected to remain relatively constant over time, or when publicity increases the risk significantly relatively to benefits, secrecy-based strategies should be favoured to develop ways that maximize the likelihood of benefits exceeding costs. For Kalimantan’s rhinos the choice to publicize-and-protect has been made, closing the door for a strategy based on secrecy, and making effective conservation solutions now all the more urgent. "

Many tropical forests are exploited both commercially for timber and by forest-dependent communities for non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Divergences between these two uses may have significant implications for forest-dependent livelihoods. This article gathers existing examples of conflicts and complementarities between selective logging and non-timber uses of forest from the livelihood perspective. Additionally it draws on three case studies from Brazil, Cameroon and Indonesia to examine by what mechanisms, and to what extent, logging impacts forest resources of livelihood importance, as well as to consider how factors such as logging regime and forest management system may mediate such influences. By doing so we aim to shed further light on a relatively unacknowledged issue in tropical forest management and conservation. Four specific mechanisms were identified; conflict of use and the indirect impacts of logging being those most commonly implicated in negative effects on livelihood-relevant NTFPs. Eighty two percent of reviewed articles highlighted negative impacts on \{NTFP\} availability. Examples of positive impacts were restricted to light demanding species that respond to the opening of forest structure and typically represent a small subset of those of livelihood value. Despite considerable impacts on livelihoods, in all three case studies we found evidence to support the potential for enhanced compatibility between timber extraction and the subsistence use of NTFPs. Drawing on this evidence, and findings from our review, we make specific recommendations for research, policy and management implementation. These findings have significant implications for reconciling timber and non-timber uses of tropical forests. "

Foliar symptoms of Mn toxicity for white birch were: (1) chlorosis at entire young leaves in the 50 and 100 mg Mn l−1 treatments; and (2) brown speckles at the leaf marginal and interveinal area for old leaves in the treatments greater than 1 mg Mn l−1. Mn preferably accumulated into the leaf marginal and interveinal area, where the brown speckles were observed.

Using G. bancanus as a case study, \{DNA\} markers were used to develop identification databases at the species, population and individual level. The species level database for Gonystylus comprised of an rDNA (ITS2) and two cpDNA (trnH-psbA and trnL) markers based on a 20 Gonystylus species database. When concatenated, taxonomic species recognition was achieved with a resolution of 90% (18 out of the 20 species). In addition, based on 17 natural populations of G. bancanus throughout West (Peninsular Malaysia) and East (Sabah and Sarawak) Malaysia, population and individual identification databases were developed using cpDNA and \{STR\} markers respectively. A haplotype distribution map for Malaysia was generated using six cpDNA markers, resulting in 12 unique multilocus haplotypes, from 24 informative intraspecific variable sites. These unique haplotypes suggest a clear genetic structuring of West and East regions. A simulation procedure based on the composition of the samples was used to test whether a suspected sample conformed to a given regional origin. Overall, the observed type I and \{II\} errors of the databases showed good concordance with the predicted 5% threshold which indicates that the databases were useful in revealing provenance and establishing conformity of samples from West and East Malaysia. Sixteen \{STRs\} were used to develop the \{DNA\} profiling databases for individual identification. Bayesian clustering analyses divided the 17 populations into two main genetic clusters, corresponding to the regions of West and East Malaysia. Population substructuring (K = 2) was observed within each region. After removal of bias resulting from sampling effects and population subdivision, conservativeness tests showed that the West and East Malaysia databases were conservative. This suggests that both databases can be used independently for random match probability estimation within respective regions. The reliability of the databases was further determined by independent self-assignment tests based on the likelihood of each individual’s multilocus genotype occurring in each identified population, genetic cluster and region with an average percentage of correctly assigned individuals of 54.80%, 99.60% and 100% respectively. Thus, after appropriate validation, the genetic identification databases developed for G. bancanus in this study could support forensic applications and help safeguard this valuable species into the future.

Much concern has been raised about how cropland expansion and associated management practices (nitrogen fertilizer use, irrigation, etc.) have affected the terrestrial carbon cycle in this region. In this study, we used a process-based ecosystem model, the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM), to assess the magnitude, spatial and temporal patterns of terrestrial carbon fluxes and pools in Tropical Asia as resulted from cropland expansion and land management practices during 1901–2005. The results indicated that cropland expansion had resulted in a release of 19.12 ± 3.06 Pg C (0.18 ± 0.029 Pg C/yr) into the atmosphere in Tropical Asia over the study period. Of this amount, approximately 22% (4.18 ± 0.66 Pg C) was released from South Asia and 78% (14.94 ± 2.40 Pg C) from Southeast Asia. Larger land area was converted to cropland while less carbon was emitted from South Asia than from Southeast Asia, where forest biomass and soil carbon were significantly higher. Changes in vegetation, soil organic matter, and litter pools caused emissions of 15.58, 2.25, and 1.71 Pg C, respectively, from the entire region. Significant decreases in vegetation carbon occurred across most regions of Southeast Asia due to continuous cropland expansion and shrink of natural forests. When considering land management practices, however, less carbon was released into the atmosphere, especially in South Asia where land management practices contributed to an approximately 10% reduction in carbon emission. This implies that optimizing land management practices could greatly reduce the carbon emissions caused by cropland expansion and might be one of important climate mitigation options in Tropical Asia.

The results indicated that Cephalantheropsis is monophyletic, while both Phaius and Calanthe are polyphyletic. In Phaius, a total of three species, P. flavus, P. columnaris, and P. takeoi, were segregated to form a new genus, Paraphaius. In Calanthe, subgenus Preptanthe and sect.

Submergence caused by typhoons and floods is one of the major reasons for production losses. Because of the complexity of these ecosystems, the breeding framework necessitates adequate feedback and a more in-depth understanding of the ecological and socioeconomic conditions in these flood-prone areas. Within this purview, this study validated the performance in farmers’ fields of lines with the \{SUB1\} gene that confers tolerance of submergence for up to two weeks. The \{SUB1\} gene was incorporated through marker-assisted backcrossing, MABC. The evaluation was conducted through participatory approaches to gain understanding of the risks as well as farmers’ preferences for these varieties. A baseline survey of 658 farm households accomplished during 2008, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and adaptability trials were conducted, with focus on farmers commonly affected by submergence in four Southeast Asian countries: the Philippines, Lao PDR, Indonesia, and Southern Viet Nam. The study further examined farmers’ criteria in evaluating new varieties through the participatory varietal selection (PVS) process. Results showed that varying conditions of submergence can influence farmers’ criteria and preferences for rice cultivars. Depending on the timing of flood with respect to growth stage, shorter duration and shallow flashfloods can result in less than 10% production losses while deeper and stagnant water with two weeks’ duration and &gt;100 cm depth can cause damage ranging from 40% to 77%. Major findings of \{PVS\} trials and preference analysis indicated that farmers prefer rice cultivars that are tolerant of submergence, have early to medium maturity relative to their commonly grown varieties, are resistant to pests and diseases, and are resistant to lodging, among other traits. To enhance adoption, male and female farmers should be involved in the evaluation process. The results of this study can contribute to enhancing breeding programs to develop appropriate varieties that reduce production losses, improve income, and ultimately reduce poverty incidence in submergence-prone areas.

Gross nitrification rates varied with N addition rate in a manner that was entirely consistent with patterns of NO3− leaching and \{NO\} emissions that have been previously observed in field studies. Gross nitrification was elevated above controls in soils from a pine stand receiving 5 and 15 g N m−2 per year, and in soils from a hardwood stand receiving 15 g N m−2 per year. Gross nitrification tended to increase with decreasing soil pH, suggesting that acid-tolerant nitrifying bacteria predominate in these soils. Different patterns of inorganic N consumption in the two stands may provide some clues to understanding the more rapid onset of N saturation that has been historically observed in the pine stand.

Gross \{NO\} production rates increased in a manner that was consistent with nitrification rate increases, and represented up to 19% of gross nitrification. Production of \{N2O\} was generally ≤15% of \{NO\} production and &lt;1% of gross nitrification.

It is well known that rates of \{N2O\} release from soils are mainly determined by the availability of substrates and oxygen, but \{N2O\} source apportioning, highly needed to advance \{N2O\} mitigation strategies, still remains challenging. In this study, using an automated soil incubation system, the \{N2O\} site preference, i.e. the intramolecular 15N distribution, was analyzed to evaluate the progression in \{N2O\} source processes following organic soil amendment. Biogas fermentation residue (BGR; originating from food waste fermentation) was applied to repacked grassland soil cores and compared to ammonium sulfate (AS) application, both at rates equivalent to 160 kg NH4+–N ha−1, and to unamended soil (control). The soil cores were incubated in a helium–oxygen atmosphere with 20 kPa \{O2\} for 43 days at 80% water-filled pore space. 43-day cumulative \{N2O\} emissions were highest with \{BGR\} treated soil accounting for about 1.68 kg N2O–N ha−1 while application of \{AS\} caused much lower fluxes of c. 0.23 kg N2O–N ha−1. Also, after \{BGR\} application, carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes showed a pronounced initial peak with steep decline until day 21 whereas with ammonium addition they remained at the background level. \{N2O\} dual isotope and isotopomer analysis of gas samples collected from \{BGR\} treated soil indicated bacterial denitrification to be the main \{N2O\} generating process during the first three weeks when high \{CO2\} fluxes signified high carbon availability. In contrast, in the second half after all added labile carbon substrates had been consumed, nitrification, i.e. the generation of \{N2O\} via oxidation of hydroxylamine, gained in importance reaching roughly the same \{N2O\} production rate compared to bacterial denitrification as indicated by \{N2O\} SP. Overall in this study, bacterial denitrification seemed to be the main \{N2O\} forming process after application of biogas residues and fluxes were mainly driven by available organic carbon. "

As a case study, \{HISS\} at flowering stage was surveyed under field conditions using local popular varieties in Savannakhet, Laos, and Tamil Nadu, India, during the dry season. At the field site in Savannakhet, sterility in variety Thadokkham1 (TDK1) was 10.8% when the maximum average temperature at heading was 32.9 °C, which increased to 23.3% at 37.3 °C. When plots were covered with a shading net, solar radiation was reduced by 60% at heading, which significantly reduced sterility to 10.0%. Panicle temperature estimates produced with a micrometeorology model revealed that shading during the hours when flowering occurs decreased panicle temperature by 2.2–2.6 °C. At the field sites in Tamil Nadu, sterility of variety Coimbatore 51 (CO51) was highly correlated with the maximum temperature at heading; sterility was around 5–10% when maximum average temperature was below 36.5 °C, which increased to 33.4% at 38.0 °C. Marking of opened spikelets at hourly intervals allowed us to detect increases in sterility as temperature increased from early morning until noon. We conclude that \{HISS\} at flowering stage can occur in local popular varieties grown in Savannakhet and Tamil Nadu during the hot, dry season. Effective protocols such as using a shading net and hourly marking of open spikelets are useful approaches to quantifying \{HISS\} during flowering stage across hot and potential heat-vulnerable rice-growing regions.

One of the tenets of the new science is that pastoralists should not adhere to a single conservative stocking rate, but rather adopt an opportunistic strategy, where numbers will fluctuate widely in response to good and bad seasons. It is further argued that opportunistic strategies give higher economic returns compared to strategies based on conservative stocking rates. In the current paper we compare the economics of four cattle management scenarios. The analysis is based on a simulation model of the fluctuation over time of animal numbers, outputs and prices, using data from field surveys and the literature. Our results suggest that strategies based on conservative stocking rates would have higher net present values than strategies based on opportunistic stocking rates. Previous analyses have failed to account for losses due to drought and the costs of capital tied up in livestock, and the analyses have tended to compare commercial with communal production rather than considering different kinds of small holder production methods. To receive the full benefits of destocking, however, a decision to destock has to be made at the level of the community, as the benefits of improved outputs can only be achieved if the stocking rates of the communal grazing lands are reduced. Making collective decisions about managing numbers is a process with considerable transaction costs, and thus the likelihood of new institutions emerging are lessened. It is surprising that a tight tracking scenario (where numbers of cattle are managed by purchasing and selling so as to maintain numbers in equilibrium with the available feed resources) is being recommended in the most recent literature. Our results suggest that such a system would come with considerable economic losses. The costs of a current programme to reclaim small dams illustrate the environmental costs of the opportunistic scenario. A tight tracking policy is likely to further increase environmental degradation and its associated costs. We identify several serious flaws in the papers that elevate opportunistic pastoral systems as giving higher economic returns than other systems. "

We compared the financial returns for two crop production options (sesame and cotton) and forest use, in a dry forest area known for its frankincense production in northern Ethiopia. Net revenue was highest for sesame and lowest for cotton agricultural use. The forest based revenue was intermediate. The revenues from the crop production options were more sensitive to a range of uncertainties than the forest land use. Our results show that forest land use that includes commercial \{NTFPs\} is financially competitive to some commercial crop options and offers returns of better reliability. The hypothesis that forest based revenues are lower than crop based ones is not supported by our results. Therefore, the continued deforestation of dry forests cannot be explained by lower returns alone, but other factors such as awareness, market access, property right and institutional issues may also play a role to drive deforestation and conversion of dry forests to croplands.

Based on these findings, we fermented the sap to produce ethanol using the sake brewing yeast strain, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Kyokai no.7. Ethanol was produced from the sap without the addition of nutrients, at a comparable rate and yield to the reference fermentation on \{YPD\} medium with glucose as a carbon source. Likewise, we produced lactic acid, a promising material for bio-plastics, poly-lactate, from the sap using the homolactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus lactis ATCC19435. We confirmed that sugars contained in the sap were readily converted to lactic acid with almost the same efficiency as the reference fermentation on \{MSR\} medium with glucose as a substrate. These results indicate that oil palm trunks felled for replanting are a significant resource for the production of fuel ethanol and lactic acid in palm oil-producing countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia.

It analyzes the most prominent views and storylines around key REDD+ design features among policy actors and in policy documents. We focus on storylines related to four questions, namely: (1) What should REDD+ achieve: carbon or also non-carbon objectives? (2) Who should monitor REDD+ outcomes: only technical experts or also local communities? (3) At what level should REDD+ be governed: at national or sub-national level? and (4) How should REDD+ be financed: through market- or fund-based sources? The vast majority of policy actors and policy documents frame REDD+ as a mechanism that should also realize non-carbon benefits, yet non-carbon monitoring receives very little attention. In all but one country, policy documents contain plans to involve local communities in the design and/or execution of measuring, reporting and verifying REDD+ outcomes. With regard to the level at which REDD+ should be governed, while most policy documents contain elements of a nested approach to accounting, almost all countries envision a long-term transition to national accounting and benefit distribution. We found strikingly little discussion among policy actors and in policy documents of how to finance REDD+ and acquire results-based payments. In the conclusion we reflect on possible consequences of the prominence of REDD+ storylines in the seven countries, and argue that carbonization and centralization of forest governance are possible outcomes given the limited attention to non-carbon monitoring and the envisioned centralized approaches to REDD+.

Logging companies are often considered as homogeneous and rather static agents, which leads to sweeping generalisations about their performance and the subsequent technical and policy recommendations. This study covers 31 logging concessions in the five \{ITTO\} member countries of the Congo Basin. Based on a detailed questionnaire complemented by published statistics, the concessions are characterised by the country in which they operate, their legal status, age, size, origin of capital, and market focus. Concessions show patterns shaped by interactions between these factors, with different logging strategies associated with the resulting groupings. Our results lend partial support to some of the common generalisations about the performance of logging companies of different scales and geographic origin. For example, national concessions tend to have higher processing rates and often create more employment. However, the data also suggest nuances that can contradict some of the conventional views. Thus, some large concessions may well use better management tools than smaller ones while some national concessions may exert a higher pressure on their allocated forests. Some key parameters related to concessions’ performance (like species logged, productivity per hectare, percent of the concession logged per year and employment) work together in the specific environmental, economic and policy contexts of each country to produce a complex regional image that is sometimes oversimplified when submitted to anecdotal or special interest advocacy analyses.

Recent studies have suggested the co-occurrence of re-adsorption of the released Hg during the course of cinnabar dissolution. However, there is a lack of feasible techniques that can quantitatively assess the amount of Hg re-adsorbed on cinnabar when investigating cinnabar dissolution. In this study, a new method, based on isotope tracing and dilution techniques, was developed to study the role of Hg re-adsorption in cinnabar dissolution. The developed method includes two key components: (1) accurate measurement of both released and spiked Hg in aqueous phase and (2) estimation of re-adsorbed Hg on cinnabar surface via the reduction in spiked 202Hg2+. By adopting the developed method, it was found that the released Hg for trials purged with oxygen could reach several hundred μg L−1, while no significant cinnabar dissolution was detected under anaerobic condition. Cinnabar dissolution rate when considering Hg re-adsorption was approximately 2 times the value calculated solely with the Hg detected in the aqueous phase. These results suggest that ignoring the Hg re-adsorption process can significantly underestimate the importance of cinnabar dissolution, highlighting the necessity of applying the developed method in future cinnabar dissolution studies.

We summarize the findings of the articles that compose this special issue of Forest Ecology and Management, which focuses on a manipulative experiment (the Canopy Trimming Experiment, CTE) that simulates two key aspects of hurricane effects in a wet tropical forest. Although previous studies of tropical and subtropical forests have documented changes resulting from hurricanes, it is not clear which of the two simultaneously occurring direct effects of hurricanes—canopy openness or debris deposition—most influence responses. In the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) of Puerto Rico, a multi-disciplinary team of scientists used replicated factorial manipulations to determine the independent and interactive effects of canopy openness and debris deposition on structural and functional characteristics of the forest. The majority of responses were primarily driven by canopy openness rather than by debris deposition. Canopy openness resulted in significant increases in densities of and compositional changes in woody plants, ferns, and some litter arthropods, and significant decreases in coqui frog abundances, leaf decomposition, and litterfall. Debris deposition significantly increased tree basal area and microbial diversity on leaf litter, but these increases were relatively small and ephemeral. Several interactive effects of canopy openness and debris addition emerged, including those involving understory herbivory, canopy arthropod structure, terrestrial gastropod abundances and composition, and soil solution chemistry. Arguably, hurricanes are the most important natural disturbance that affect the LEF, and most characteristics that were measured in the \{CTE\} showed evidence of resistance or resilience. By identifying the causal factors affecting secondary successional trajectories of diverse taxa ranging from microbes to vertebrates, biogeochemical attributes, microclimatic characteristics, and measures of ecosystem processes following hurricane disturbance, we better understand tropical forest dynamics resulting from past hurricanes and are better able to predict mechanisms of change related to future hurricanes.

In this study, we present a global map of mean forest canopy height at 500 m spatial resolution obtained by combining Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data acquired from 2005 to 2006 and 13 ancillary variables, including seven climatic variables and six remote sensing variables (nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance at red and \{NIR\} bands, tree cover, anisotropic factor, accumulated Enhanced Vegetation Index, and elevation). The original contributions of this study include the following: (1) The wavelet method was applied to complement the \{GLA14\} product to identify the ground peak and the top-canopy peak. We found that it was useful for dealing with waveforms with low reconstruction accuracy. (2) \{GLAS\} data from the leafless season were not used for non-evergreen forest because the height retrieval results exhibited underestimation and strong variations. (3) The anisotropic factor (ANIF), an indicator related to surface structure, was included as an ancillary variable for the first time and was determined to be important for height modeling in the Asian and North American regions. (4) The balanced random forest (BRF) algorithm was applied to register \{GLAS\} mean forest canopy height to a 500 m grid considering the small proportion of extreme height classes (tall and short trees), and it achieved good performance in terms of modeling accuracy (RMSE = 2.75 to 4.45 m) and preserving data variation. An inter-comparison among three global forest height maps [the present study, Lefsky (2010), and Simard et al. (2011)] was implemented in a pixel-by-pixel manner. High agreement (R2 = 0.73, \{RMSE\} = 4.49 m) was determined between the present study and Simard et al., whereas the result from Lefsky was notably different from the other two results (R2 = 0.14, \{RMSE\} = 8.92 m, compared with the present study; \{R2\} = 0.11, \{RMSE\} = 11.19 m, compared with Simard et al.). Large disparities were generally associated with evergreen broadleaf forests in South America, deciduous needleleaf forests in Europe and Russian North Asia, and evergreen needleleaf forests on the West Coast of North America. Differences in the height metric were a main factor affecting the disparities among the three results. Validation against field survey data acquired from the Distributed Active Archive Center indicated the accuracy of our mean forest canopy height map (R2 = 0.63, \{RMSE\} = 4.68 m, n = 59). "

Paddy rice agriculture has expanded rapidly in northeastern China in the last decade, but there are no updated maps of paddy rice fields in the region. Existing algorithms for identifying paddy rice fields are based on the unique physical features of paddy rice during the flooding and transplanting phases and use vegetation indices that are sensitive to the dynamics of the canopy and surface water content. However, the flooding phenomena in high latitude area could also be from spring snowmelt flooding. We used land surface temperature (LST) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor to determine the temporal window of flooding and rice transplantation over a year to improve the existing phenology-based approach. Other land cover types (e.g., evergreen vegetation, permanent water bodies, and sparse vegetation) with potential influences on paddy rice identification were removed (masked out) due to their different temporal profiles. The accuracy assessment using high-resolution images showed that the resultant MODIS-derived paddy rice map of northeastern China in 2010 had a high accuracy (producer and user accuracies of 92% and 96%, respectively). The MODIS-based map also had a comparable accuracy to the 2010 Landsat-based National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) of China in terms of both area and spatial pattern. This study demonstrated that our improved algorithm by using both thermal and optical \{MODIS\} data, provides a robust, simple and automated approach to identify and map paddy rice fields in temperate and cold temperate zones, the northern frontier of rice planting.

In the adc2-1 mutant, free Put content was reduced to about 25% of that in the control plants and did not increase under salt stress. Furthermore, the adc2-1 mutant was more sensitive to salt stress than the control plants. The stress sensitivity of adc2-1 was recovered by the addition of exogenous Put.

The young microspore proembryos displayed defined features different to both, the in vivo gametophytic, and the in vitro non-responsive microspores. Reprogrammed microspores showed an absence of starch, the occurrence of a first symmetrical division and cytokinesis, the presence of an abundant ribosomal population, and changes in cellulosic and pectic cell wall components which constituted early markers of the embryogenic microspore process. They provided new insights on the molecular and cellular events associated with the microspore reprogramming of woody plants, and specifically in olive, providing interesting knowledge which could guide future selection and regeneration strategies in this fruit tree of high economic interest.

Hence, it is necessary to study inter-specific relationships, and the resulting yield in mixed stands, which may vary with stand development, site or stand density, etc. In Spain, the province of Navarra is considered one of the biodiversity reservoirs; however, mixed forests occupy only a small area, probably as a consequence of management plans, in which there is an excessive focus on the productivity aspect, favoring the presence of pure stands of the most marketable species. The aim of this paper is to study how growth efficiencies of beech (Fagus sylvatica) and pine (Pinus sylvestris) are modified by the admixture of the other species and to determine whether stand density modifies interspecific relationships and to what extent. Two models were fitted from Spanish National Forest Inventory data, for P. sylvestris and F. sylvatica respectively, which relate the growth efficiency of the species, i.e. the volume increment of the species divided by the species proportion by area, with dominant height, quadratic mean diameter, stocking degree, and the species proportions by area of each species. Growth efficiency of pine increased with the admixture of beech, decreasing this positive effect when stocking degree increased. However, the positive effect of pine admixture on beech growth was greater at higher stocking degrees. Growth efficiency of beech was also dependent on stand dominant height, resulting in a net negative mixing effect when stand dominant heights and stocking degrees were simultaneously low. There is a relatively large range of species proportions and stocking degrees which results in transgressive overyielding: higher volume increments in mixed stands than that of the most productive pure pine stands. We concluded that stocking degree is a key factor in between-species interactions, being the effects of mixing not always greater at higher stand densities, but it depends on species composition. "

The lack of genetic variability of stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) could limit the adaptation potential of the species to more severe droughts. However, information on intra-specific variability in adaptive traits that might confer potential drought tolerance is scant for stone pine. In this study, we explored the adaptation potential of stone pine to water deficit through variability of key functional traits. In particular, inter-clonal variation in whole plant performance in response to water deficit was studied. The role of inter-clonal variation in functional traits and phenotypic plasticity as determinants of whole plant performance under water deficit were also assessed. Relative growth rate (RGR) and key morphological and physiological traits were studied in ramets of 20 different clones of stone pine from a wide range of populations in the Iberian Peninsula. The plants were grown in climatic chamber under controlled environmental conditions and were submitted to an experimental water deficit of 20 days. The results showed significant inter-clonal variation in total dry mass, RGR, biomass partitioning specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area ratio (LAR), net photosynthetic rate (An), stomatal conductance (gs) and intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi). Significant phenotypic plasticity in response to drought was found for An, gs and \{WUEi\} but it did not differ among clones. The clones could be clustered into different groups according to the variability of the studied traits in a principal components analysis. LAR, \{SLA\} and net photosynthetic rates explained most of the variation. A combination of traits (high \{LAR\} and low WUEi) agreeing with a water spending strategy rather than with a water saving strategy seemed to underlie enhanced \{RGR\} under water deficit. Stone pine showed high phenotypic plasticity and significant intra-specific variation in functional traits in response to water deficit. The pattern of variation found in morphological and physiological traits might allow adaptation to short term water deficit in this species. "

abstract = "Abstract The ‘parklands’ that form the most widespread farming systems in the Sahelian zone of West Africa are farming systems in which annual crops are grown under scattered trees preserved from the natural vegetation by farmers following clearing the woodlands to make crop fields. Being mixed agricultural systems, the interactions between trees and crops have always been a key element determining the management options applied by farmers. This has also attracted the attention of scientists, with the first studies of this nature dating back to the 1960’s. A combination of field trials, observational studies and modeling has been deployed to understand soil–tree–crop interactions, including sharing of growth resources by the system components. Based on this understanding, management options have been discussed with farmers. The most common experimental designs used are transects from the base of tree trunk toward the open field, concentric zones around trees or sectors under trees where various experimental treatments are applied, depending on the objectives of the studies. Key findings disentangled the contributions of each component of the system to the island of high fertility around trees using isotopic techniques, tree effects on adjacent \{C4\} cultivated plants and alternative \{C3\} crops that tolerate tree shade. Tree management practices such as pruning have been tested to modify the crown architecture and the patterns of root distribution in order to improve light availability and resource use efficiency. Increases in land use intensity require more active management by farmers of tree regeneration. Despite scientific advances, there are still some methodological challenges in determining the “park effect”, the tradeoffs and synergies between and among goods and services, and how to boost the provisioning, supporting and regulating functions of such agroforestry systems. Providing such ecosystem service functions is critical in the quest for ensuring food security while achieving adaptation and mitigation goals in vulnerable environments like the drylands. "

Low temperature chars (TCHAR ≤ 350 °C) produced significant amounts of pyrolysis products of which the precursor biopolymer could be recognized, while high-temperature chars (TCHAR ≥ 400 °C) produced mainly phenols and monocyclic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are not specific for any biopolymer. Carbohydrate could hardly be recognized at \{TCHAR\} ≥ 350 °C. The thermal rearrangement of polyphenols, mainly lignin, was reflected in more detail (1) C3-side chain shortening and probably depolymerization (TCHAR 200–350 °C), (2) demethoxylation of syringyl and probably also some guaiacyl lignin (TCHAR 300–400 °C), (3) elimination of virtually all remaining methoxyl groups (TCHAR 350–400 °C), through dehydroxylation and demethoxylation, (4) almost complete dehydroxylation of lignin and other biopolymers (TCHAR 400–500 °C), (5) progressive condensation into polyaromatic structures (TCHAR 300–500 °C) and (6) partial elimination of alkyl bridges between (poly)aromatic moieties (TCHAR 450–500 °C). These results were supported by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of the same samples.

An on-farm experiment was established in 1996 in northern Viet Nam to examine the contribution of the leguminous bush Tephrosia candida (Roxb.) D.C. as a fallow or hedgerow species and as a mulch producer to improve nutrient cycling and prevent nutrient losses by erosion. The systems tested were upland rice monocropping (Mono), natural fallow (NaFa), fallow of Tephrosia (TepFa), hedgerow intercropping with upland rice (Oryza sativa L.) and internal mulching using pruned Tephrosia biomass (TepAl), and upland rice with external mulching using Tephrosia biomass (TepMu). Over two cropping seasons, from April 1996 to April 1998, nutrients recycled and inputs and exports were recorded, as well as changes in C-, N- and P-pools, and in pH in the 0–5 cm topsoil layer. The Tephrosia systems (TepFa, TepAl, TepMu) prevented nutrient losses by erosion effectively. Compared to the NaFa system, the TepFa system accumulated 34% more N in the above-ground plant parts and increased topsoil N by 20%, probably due to N-fixation. There was a trend that the less labile P-pools (NaOH-P) were reallocated into the more labile P-pools (Bicarb-P) in the soil of the TepFa system. Burning released significant amounts of the inorganic P-pools in both the NaFa and TepFa systems and this effect seemed to be more pronounced in the TepFa than in the NaFa. Organic input to crop export ratios for N and P were &gt;1 in the TepAl and TepMu treatments. This was due to a sufficient quantity and quality of the Tephrosia mulching material. However, moderately labile NaOH-extractable organic P seemed to be depleted in the topsoil due to high P uptake in the TepMu treatment. Thus, nutrient cycling and nutrient balances were improved under the Tephrosia systems. But for long-term P sustainability, there is a belief that a combined use of mulching and mineral P fertiliser is needed. "

A multi-level latent class framework is applied to simultaneously obtain those groups of people who choose similarly and are grouped locally, but are also defined by their location, assuming that their choices are representative of what they like and would choose. Groups from the mountains are classified into one specific grand class. Some individuals who live in urban areas have attitudes and beliefs similar to those who live in the mountains, and they also are classified into that same grand class.

The resin industry demands more efficient tapping methods and forest management plans as a way to increase competitiveness in a global market. Understanding the effects of environmental conditions on resin yield, especially under the current scenario of climate change, is key to improving techniques and plans in the resin industry. This study aims to evaluate the intra- and inter-annual effects of climate conditions and soil water availability on resin yield in tapped Pinus pinaster stands. The individual resin yield of 26 tapped trees growing at two locations with different stand densities and soil characteristics was measured fortnightly during the tapping season (June to October) for four years. The study was complemented with an analysis of changes in xylem anatomy over the four years, with a focus on axial resin canal traits, including 12 non-tapped trees as controls. Intra-annual variation in resin yield was strongly correlated with temperature, solar radiation, potential evapotranspiration and water deficit. Inter-annual variation in resin yield and resin canal abundance were correlated with temperature and water deficit in spring, but above a certain threshold of cumulated water deficit in summer rainfall favored resin yield. Under adverse climate scenarios where resource optimization is desirable, a reduced tapping season during the warmest months (June–September) would be advisable, assuming a very small production loss. Similarly, in years with a rainy summer and/or dry spring, a slightly longer tapping season could be suggested, as resin yield increases after these events. "

We also found a geographic gradient of decreasing diversity and increasing population divergence from northwest (central Europe and northern Iberian Peninsula) to southeast (Mediterranean Iberia and North Africa). The patterns revealed in this study probably reflect the combined effects of Quaternary climatic changes and recent impact of human activities, and potentially also more ancient events dating back to the Tertiary.

Conservationists increasingly recognize the need to measure the effectiveness of their interventions, using an indicator of biodiversity change, such as rate of deforestation, and a counterfactual approach that addresses a fundamental question: what would have happened had there been no intervention? This study examines how law enforcement can mitigate habitat loss from small-holder coffee growing by comparing 34 years of empirical data on deforestation rates and coffee prices across a zone of high law enforcement and a zone of low law enforcement using satellite imagery, ecological data, interviews, and \{GIS\} modeling. In the early 1980s strong law enforcement efforts were found to reduce deforestation inside Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (BBSNP), southwest Sumatra. However, law enforcement efforts were weak in remote areas of BBSNP, where high coffee prices spurred rapid deforestation. Furthermore, law enforcement efforts were reversed by the 1997–1998 Asian economic crisis, the fall of the national president, and by new regulations surrounding regional autonomy. These findings indicate that law enforcement is critical but insufficient alone. They also highlight that rising costs of agricultural commodities can be detrimental to tropical forests and their associated biodiversity. In the long run one must act to decrease the incentives for coffee cultivation. A multi-faceted strategy that includes law enforcement and incentives to reduce poverty around \{PAs\} is proposed. "

However, the effects of forest management on the carbon pools over the rotation period in Mediterranean areas are scarcely understood. The objective of this work is to assess the way in which two alternative management systems; one more intensive and the other more moderate (with less severe harvesting and more spread over time) affect the carbon stocks in the living tree biomass, coarse woody debris, forest floor and mineral soil in Mediterranean forests. For this purpose, two chronosequences were established covering the whole rotation period in two Pinus sylvestris L. forests. We conducted four forest inventories over a period of 15 years, measuring the diameter and the height of all the trees higher than 1.3 m in order to calculate the carbon stored in the living parts of the tree. Soil pits were excavated and we collected soil samples to estimate the soil organic carbon. We found that the temporal trends for living tree biomass were similar in both forests. However, the total living tree carbon stored at the end of the rotation period was greater in the forest with the longer rotation period and lighter thinning regime (345.5 Mg ha−1 of carbon) than in the intensively-managed forest (223.8 Mg ha−1 of carbon). On average, more carbon was found to be stored in the forest floor under the more intensive management system, whereas more carbon was present in the first 20 cm of mineral soil under the moderate management system. Moreover, in each forest, the carbon stocks of the forest floor and in the uppermost cm of the soil remained constant over the rotation period. Therefore, management systems with longer rotation periods and moderate harvesting intensities are recommended to increase carbon fixation in Mediterranean forests. "

There was an increase in grain yield of 1.6 t farm−1 and 0.7 t farm−1 for \{RG1\} and \{RG2\} respectively. Farmers without cattle (RG3 and RG4) may have a greater incentive for retaining their crop residues but they have to invest labour to keep the residues during the dry season. However, improved crop productivity for these farmers is limited by lack of access to fertiliser. The current practice of allocating all crop residues to animals results in average gross margin of US$7429 and US$4037 for \{RG1\} and \{RG2\} farmers respectively. Our results showed that from an economic perspective, it is logical that farmers prioritise the sustenance of cattle with crop residues over soil fertility management. We conclude that at current productivity levels, farmers who own cattle have limited scope to allocate crop residues for soil cover as it leads to significant loss in animal production and economic value.

Besides, sound is a component of ecosystems severely threatened by transportation noise disturbance which is related to negative effects on ecosystem functions. This study deals with aircraft noise impact on natural environments from a multiple innovative perspective. It complementarily combines: noise modeling, field measurements, soundscape audibility, human perception and spatial pattern tools for assessing the chronic growing outdoor noise pollution of ecosystems at landscape scale. Firstly, noticeable soundscape degradation from aircraft overflights has been found causing severe acoustic fragmentation and disruptions in the quietness of a national park in Spain (European Union). Air traffic caused sound pressure levels to increase by approximately 8 decibels from natural ambient levels. Secondly, spatial pattern tools together with noise mapping have been found to be useful in providing decision support for decisions-making through anthropogenic noise impact assessment on the natural environment. Finally, public opinion did not perceive aircraft noise-disruption as being as relevant as that quantified by technical procedures.

However, the status and trend of \{ES\} in \{CMF\} have not been assessed in many developing countries because of a lack of appropriate data, tools, appropriate policy or management framework. Using a case study of community-managed forested landscape in central Nepal, this paper aims to identify and map priority \{ES\} and assess the temporal change in the provision of \{ES\} between 1990 and 2013. Semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, transect walks and participatory mapping were used to identify and assess priority ES. The results indicated that community forestry has resulted in the substantial restoration of forests on degraded lands over the period of 1990–2013. Local community members and experts consider that this restoration has resulted in a positive impact on various \{ES\} beneficial for local, regional, national and international users. Priority \{ES\} identified in the study included timber, firewood, freshwater, carbon sequestration, water regulation, soil protection, landscape beauty as well as biodiversity. There were strong variations in the valuation of different \{ES\} between local people and experts, between genders and between different status and income classes in the local communities. In general, whereas \{CMF\} provide considerable benefits at larger scales, local people have yet to perceive the real value of these different \{ES\} provided by their forest management efforts. The study demonstrated that participatory tools, combined with free-access satellite images and repeat photography are suitable approaches to engage local communities in discussions regarding \{ES\} and to map and prioritise \{ES\} values.

However, most tree-ring-based reconstructions are derived from study sites in the high latitudes or high altitudes, paying very little attention to low elevation sites. Thus, a large gap in the geographical coverage of climate reconstructions from temperate low elevation sites in central Europe still exists. This motivated us to concentrate our efforts on the European oak (Quercus robur) in N-Poland. We developed a new robust tree-ring width chronology (TRW), as well as four wood anatomical chronologies (e.g. average vessel area and number of vessels) from Q. robur for the period 1810 to 2010. The chronologies were examined for their climatological responses. While \{TRW\} was found to have weak correlations with climate, the earlywood vessel parameters (EVP), especially average vessel area (AVA), revealed significant positive correlations to minimum winter temperatures. Based on stable climate–growth correlations, a reconstruction of minimum winter temperatures (29th November to 20th January) back to 1810 was performed for north Poland. The reconstruction indicates a promising potential to reveal low-frequency climate information. An additional extreme year analysis suggested that in cold winters, a cold–warm–cold pattern in the minimum temperatures was responsible for the relatively small earlywood vessels. Spatial field correlations imply that our reconstruction is more related to temperature variations towards the east of Europe. The reconstructed temperature compared well with two existing temperature reconstructions, especially during most of the 20th century, even though the temperature reconstructions differ spatially and temporally. Based on these findings, the relatively extensive resource of archeological oak material from this region may be useful to perform multicentennial climate reconstructions in the temperate climate zone.

The starting point is information gathered from two surveys of 740 owners of hunting estates (supply side) and 557 hunters (demand side) in Andalusian forests. The results show that 76% of the total driven hunt spots for big game were self-consumed by owners in the 2009–2010 hunting season. Regarding the traditional \{AAS\} framework, self-consumption is nearly one million euros less when the enlightenment approach is considered. This lower bound, compared to the upper bound imputed through market prices in the AAS, allows simulating a range of values for hunting self-consumption and expanding policy recommendations for hunting management.

Pinus pinea L. has significant environmental and socio-economic importance for the Iberian Peninsula, so a detailed understanding of its response to climate change is necessary to predict its status under future climatic conditions. However, variability of climate and uncertainties in dendroclimatological approach complicate the understanding of forest growth dynamics. We use an ensemble approach to analyze growth-climate responses of P. pinea trees from five sites along a latitudinal gradient in Spain over time. The growth responses to April-June precipitation totals were stronger in the north than in the south. Since the 1950s, the sensitivity of growth to April-June precipitation increased in the north and decreased in the south. Meteorological drought usually started in May in the southern sites, but in June-July in the northern sites. The water deficit in the southern sites is thus greater and more limiting for tree growth, and this likely accounts for the lower growth sensitivity during these months. Our results indicate that P. pinea has a high degree of plasticity, suggesting the species will withstand changing climatic conditions. However, growth response to drought regimes varies among P. pinea populations, suggesting that different populations have different capacities for acclimation to warmer and drier climate, and this may influence future vegetation composition.

abstract = "Abstract Fungi are important for maintaining fast rates of decomposition in low quality tropical leaf litter via immobilization and translocation of limiting nutrients from sources to sinks and conserving nutrients after disturbance. Tropical trees often have low nutrient to carbon ratios. Disturbances such as hurricanes and logging transfer a large mass of green leaves with high nutrient concentrations to the forest floor, but the associated opening of the canopy dries the litter, inhibiting basidiomycete fungi that play critical roles in lignin degradation and nutrient conservation. We conducted a replicated block factorial experiment designed to disentangle the individual and interactive effects of canopy opening and green debris deposition on phosphorus (P) content, mass loss and fungal connectivity in decomposing leaf cohorts in subtropical wet forest in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico. Though green leaves had higher P concentrations they did not decompose significantly faster than senesced leaves. Mass loss differed among treatments after 14, 40.5 and 53 weeks decomposition. Mass loss at 7 weeks was predicted by P concentration at 7 weeks; mass loss in senesced leaves at 14 weeks was predicted by abundance of fungal connections between the senesced litter cohort and forest floor at 7 weeks. Fungal connectivity and P accumulation at 7 weeks and mass loss of senesced leaves beginning at 14 weeks were significantly different from and lower in plots with trimmed canopy and no debris than in the untrimmed plots with debris. Litter moisture was previously found to be significantly lower under open than closed canopy, and we found that moisture was a significant predictor of fungal connectivity in both senesced and green leaves. Deposition of green leaves ameliorated the inhibitory effect of canopy opening on fungal connectivity between litter cohorts by retaining moisture; consequently fungal connectivity and mass loss in senescent leaves did not differ between the Trim + Debris and the control treatments. Phosphorus content of senesced leaves increased significantly by 7 weeks in both trimmed and untrimmed plots with added green debris and in the control plots. Based on mass balance calculations, both the underlying forest floor and overlying green leaves likely contributed P to the decomposing senesced leaf cohort. Fungal translocation of P through hyphal connections between litter cohorts explains some of the changes in P content. Though fungi were important in conserving P, most of the P that was likely leached from green leaves was not retained in the litter layer. "

Both \{N2O\} and \{CH4\} fluxes differed significantly between times of day of sampling. \{N2O\} fluxes differed significantly between sampling seasons as well as between sampling positions, while \{CH4\} fluxes had no significant differences between seasons or positions. Temporal variations of \{N2O\} emissions were probably related to the effects of vegetation (S. salsa) during summer and autumn and the frequent freeze/thaw cycle of sediment during spring and winter, while those of \{CH4\} fluxes were controlled by the interactions of thermal conditions and other abiotic factors (soil moisture and salinity). Spatial variations of \{N2O\} and \{CH4\} fluxes were primarily affected by soil moisture fluctuation derived from astronomic tide, sediment substrate and vegetation composition. \{N2O\} and \{CH4\} fluxes, expressed as CO2-equivaltent (CO2-e) emissions, showed that \{N2O\} comprised the principal part of total calculated CO2-e emissions during spring and winter, while the contributions of \{CH4\} could not be ignored during summer and autumn. This study highlights the importance of seasonal \{N2O\} and \{CH4\} contributions, particularly during times of significant \{CH4\} consumption. For the accurate up-scaling of \{N2O\} and \{CH4\} fluxes to annual rates, a careful sampling design at site-level is required to capture the potentially considerable temporal and spatial variations of \{N2O\} and \{CH4\} emissions.

We quantify changes in percent mass remaining (PMR), the concentration and absolute amounts of various chemical elements using fresh (green) and senesced leaf litter contained in litterbags of two different mesh sizes. Mass loss was significantly slowed by canopy trimming. There was no significant effect of debris treatment on the \{PMR\} of the litter. Canopy trimming increased the percent of initial N, Al, Ca, Fe, and Mg remaining and decreased the percent of initial Mn remaining compared with not trimmed plots. Debris addition increased the percent of initial N and P remaining and decreased the percent of initial Al, and Fe remaining in the decomposing litter compared to no debris added plots. Of the elements studied, only Al and Fe accumulated above 100% of initial. Accumulation of Al and Fe in the canopy trimmed and no debris plots is most likely dominated by the adsorption of these ions onto the surfaces of the decaying litter. Overall, P showed a rapid initial loss during the first 0.2 yr followed by steady loss. Nitrogen was lost steadily from leaf litter. The \{PMR\} of fresh and senesced litter was significantly affected by mesh size, with a higher mass remaining in small mesh bags. Fresh litter decayed faster than senesced litter; following patterns of initial N and P concentrations (higher in the former litter type). We found a significantly negative correlation between the Margalef index of diversity for the litter arthropods contained in the litterbags and the PMR, suggesting functional complexity is an important determinant of decay in this forest.

A two-stage process was used to establish the vitality index. The logarithms of height, diameter and height increment were regressed against age, to adjust for the wide range of ages present in our data (c. 10,000 saplings with ages spanning 4–50 years). Then principal component analysis was used to obtain coefficients, which were, in turn, standardized on each axis to provide a vitality index scaled in standard deviations. This standardized scale allows the rank of an individual in the population to be assessed, and draws attention to possible outliers. The use of age-adjusted residuals ensured that the estimator was independent of age, and stable over a wide age range. The first principal component indicates if a sapling is relatively tall (weight = 0.5), thick (w = 0.5) or fast-growing (w = 0.7) for its age. Most of the information is contained in the first principal component, but the second component, which explains about 10% of the variance, appears to offer some utility as an indicator of ‘acceleration’ due to changing conditions. The resulting measures of vitality have been useful for research and management in the dry lichen-moss pine forest in Russian Karelia, but are specific to this species, locality and ecotype. Further research and site-specific data are necessary to adapt the system to other situations. "

In freshwater, and under conditions of low salinity, hemolymph osmolality was maintained around 450 mOsm. Under high salinity, osmolality values increased in a time-wise manner until reaching levels of the surrounding rearing water. Changes in sodium concentration generally paralleled osmotic change, and potassium and magnesium concentrations increased upon exposure to extremely high salinity. In contrast, total calcium concentration was maintained at high levels regardless of salinity treatment. Examination of crystalline structure and ionic composition of the cuticle revealed that it was comprised principally of an α-chitin-like material, and calcite (calcium carbonate). Calcite accounted for 25% of total bulk weight in freshwater, while sodium, potassium and magnesium constituents combined comprised less than 2.5% of this total. Although sodium, potassium and magnesium contents increased nearly 2-fold in response to changing salinity, calcium levels remained relatively constant. "

Using these metrics, \{IMAR\} is compared with other Chinese regions, as well as the nation as a whole, with respect to the performance and stainability of their respective ecological-economic systems. Results show that more than 85% of the emergy in \{IMAR\} was derived from home region sources, indicating a strong capacity for self-sufficiency, even if this amount as a percentage of the total declined from about 93 to 87 percent over the 20 year period. These results also show, that the value of the emergy-based stainability index (1.86 in 2007) indicates that \{IMAR\} is a sustainable system over medium length time periods. However, the imbalance of trade, the over-dependence on nonrenewable resources, and the high amounts of waste produced per unit of emergy expended, will all hinder the stainability of the system in the longer term context. Suggestions for public policy choices, relevant to these findings, are discussed. "

Analysts commonly need to estimate site-specific effects for areas that lack data on the number of people who use the resource, intensity of use, and other relevant variables. Here, we address issues of applying transfer functions to sites that have sparse or missing data. We present options for estimating data to apply meta-regression models (MRMs) in ways that are scale-appropriate and sensitive to local conditions. Using a case study of the potential lost welfare to freshwater anglers as a result of mountain top coal mining within West Virginia, we integrate: 1) an empirical ecological model of fish community changes; 2) an \{MRM\} that relates changes in catch rates to changes in anglers' utility; and 3) a spatial participation analysis that maps trip distribution using multiple survey datasets. We evaluate two scenarios: partial (20%) and full use of existing mine permits. Our conservative estimates of annual welfare loss are $120,500 for the partial scenario and $627,800 for the full scenario, due to changes in recreational fishing catches. These results are sensitive to catch rate assumptions and socio-demographic characteristics that varied widely depending on the spatial scale of measurement. "

Conservation policies and practices also accelerate changes in swidden by restricting forest clearing and encouraging commercial agriculture. However, swidden remains important in many frontier areas where farmers have unequal or insecure access to investment and market opportunities, or where multi-functionality of land uses has been preserved as a strategy to adapt to current ecological, economic and political circumstances. In some areas swidden remains important simply because intensification is not a viable choice, for example when population densities and/or food market demands are low. The transformation of swidden landscapes into more intensive land uses has generally increased household incomes, but has also led to negative effects on the social and human capital of local communities to varying degrees. From an environmental perspective, the transition from swidden to other land uses often contributes to permanent deforestation, loss of biodiversity, increased weed pressure, declines in soil fertility, and accelerated soil erosion. Our prognosis is that, despite the global trend towards land use intensification, in many areas swidden will remain part of rural landscapes as the safety component of diversified systems, particularly in response to risks and uncertainties associated with more intensive land use systems.

In a second step, the results from \{G4M\} were used as input data to the engineering model BeWhere, which optimizes scaling and location of combined heat and power plants (CHP). The geographically explicit locations and capacities obtained for forest-based bioenergy plants were then overlaid with a geological suitability map for carbon storage. From this, a theoretical potential for in situ \{BECCS\} was derived. Results indicate that, given the abundant forest cover in South Korea, there is substantial potential for bioenergy production, which could contribute not only to substituting emissions from fossil fuels but also to meeting the targets of the country's commitments under any climate change mitigation agreement. However, there seems to be only limited potential for direct in situ carbon storage in South Korea. "

According to Hoffman–Weeks theory, the values of the equilibrium melting point ( T m 0 ) increased with an increase in the content of \{MBC\} in the composites. The spherulite growth rate, the overall crystallization rate, the activation energy and folding-surface free energy (σe) of PCL/MBC composites are markedly affected by the presence of MBC. According to Avrami theory, \{MBC\} accelerates the crystallization of \{PCL\} in the composites. However, as compared to neat PCL, all the composites of PCL/MBC had the higher σe value. This indicates that there exist constraints on the mobility of the \{PCL\} chains in the interspherulitic regions due to the presence of MBC. "

No study has quantified the effects of both deforestation and selective logging, separately and combined, on forest fragmentation and edge effects over large regions. The main objectives of this study were to: (1) quantify the rates and extent of forest fragmentation from deforestation and logging within the Brazilian Amazon, and (2) contextualize the spatio-temporal dynamics of this forest fragmentation through a literature review of potential ecological repercussions of edge creation. Using \{GIS\} and remote sensing, we quantified forest fragmentation – defined as both increases in the forest edge-to-area ratio and number of forest fragments – and edge-effected forest occurring from these activities across more than 1.1 million km2 of the Brazilian Amazon from 1999 to 2002. Annually, deforestation and logging generated ∼32,000 and 38,000 km of new forest edge while increasing the edge-to-area ratio of remaining forest by 0.14 and 0.15, respectively. Combined deforestation and logging increased the edge-to-area ratio of remaining forest by 65% over our study period, while generating 5539 and 3383 new forest fragments, respectively. Although we found that 90% of individual forest fragments were smaller than 4 km2, we also found that 50% of the remaining intact forests were located in contiguous forest areas greater than 35,000 km2. We then conducted a literature review documenting 146 edge effects and found that these penetrated to a median distance of 100 m, a distance encompassing 6.4% of all remaining forests in our study region in the year 2002, while 53% of forests were located within two km of an edge. Annually deforestation and logging increased the proportion of edge-forest by 0.8% and 3.1%, respectively. As a result of both activities, the total proportion of edge-forest increased by 2.6% per year, while the proportion within 100-m increased by 0.5%. Over our study period, deforestation resulted in an additional ∼3000 km2 of edge-forest, whereas logging generated ∼20,000 km2, as it extended deep into intact forest areas. These results show the large extent and rapid expansion of previously unquantified soft-edges throughout the Amazon and highlight the need for greater research into their ecological impacts. "

Population-level responses of common phyllostomids to \{RIL\} were minor, with 10 of 15 species evincing no change in mean abundance. Of those taxa responding to \{RIL\} (mean difference in number of individuals per site), three increased (Artibeus concolor [0.46 individuals], Artibeus lituratus [3.88], and Glossophaga soricina [0.71]) and two decreased (Carollia brevicauda [0.96] and Carollia perspicillata [14.04]) in abundance.

More specifically, bat assemblages in cut forest had increased diversity and decreased dominance compared to control forest. Nonetheless, the proportional abundance of the five most common species, as a group, was similar in cut (86%) and control forest (88%), and frugivores dominated assemblages in both management types. Mean abundance of frugivores decreased (10.59 individuals per site) in response to RIL; however, this response was driven by decreases in C. perspicillata, the most abundant species in terra firme forest.

We observed lower mean \{N2O\} (11.9 ng N cm−2 h−1) and \{NO\} (3.5 ng N cm−2 h−1) emissions from pastures in 1996 compared to 1992 (N2O: 39.9 ng N cm−2 h−1; NO: 5.8 ng N cm−2 h−1). Even so, \{N2O\} emissions in recently formed pastures (13.8 ng N cm−2 h−1) were still higher than previously measured emissions from forests (7.0 ng N cm−2 h−1). Indices of N cycling, such as net N mineralization, nitrification potential, and extractable soil nitrate, decreased with pasture age, which we attributed to a decrease in substrate availability. Denitrification enzyme activity did not change significantly with pasture age, indicating that denitrification occurs at least sporadically at all sites and the presence of denitrifying enzymes is not as strongly linked to N availability as is the presence of nitrifying enzymes. There were no significant correlations between \{N2O\} and \{NO\} emissions and indices of N cycling. While this may indicate that the processes are not closely related, we believe that sampling of nitrogen oxide emissions in 1996 was inadvertently biased towards exceptionally dry soil conditions. This sampling bias limited the probability of observing large nitrogen oxide emissions associated with episodic denitrification. Results from chronosequence studies should be interpreted with caution especially for variables which depend on local weather conditions at time of measurement. "

We analyze various waves of deliberative politics that emerged in different contexts related to the Himalayan crisis, the flow of international aid for conservation and development projects, civil conflict and democratic transition, and most recently the policy responses to climate change. The analysis shows how such deliberative politics contributed to the change or continuity of conventional authorities around forest policy and practice. It shows that despite notable participatory policy reform, the conventional authority has become further re-entrenched. Based on this analysis, we argue that efforts to understand forest policy change can be more meaningful if attention is paid to whether and how deliberative politics emerge to challenge the hegemonic claims to power and knowledge about resource governance practices. Such approach to policy analysis can open new possibilities for understanding democratic policy reform by explicating the nuances of deliberation and policy politics occurring at multiple scales. "

In this study, wetland ecosystem model (WEM) was enhanced by incorporating plant competition, and applied to a moderately phosphorus-enriched area in the Everglades with a mixed cattail (Typha domingensis) and sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense) community. The \{WEM\} model was first validated by comparing simulated results against field observations, and applied to evaluate the effects of multiple surface fires on phosphorus (P) dynamics and the structure of a mixed cattail and sawgrass community. The simulation results indicated that a single fire could substantially alter the P dynamics in surface water for nearly two months, while multiple fires within a two-year interval, regardless of season, could cause a shift of plant community structure, expressed as a desirable increase in sawgrass and a decrease in cattail. After the successive fires, the biomass and composition of recovering plant community did not reach the pre-fire level within six years. Regardless of season, the fires conducted under the low-water-depth condition, compared with the high-water-depth condition, yielded stronger effects on P dynamics in soil, surface water, porewater, and on the plant community composition. Regardless of water depths, February fires, compared to July fires, caused a stronger shift in plant community structure expressed as a decrease in cattail biomass and an increase in sawgrass biomass. Regardless of seasons and water depths, fires caused a short-term increase and long-term decline in total phosphorus (TP) concentration in soil, surface water, and porewater. These results might suggest that the winter fires, under low-water-depth appear to be the best fire management option for accelerating recovery of a cattail-dominated wetland to a sawgrass-dominated wetland. In the proposed fire and hydrological regimes, four fires at two-year intervals generated the maximum suppressing effect on cattail, and the maximum stimulating effect on sawgrass. The results of this study support the concept that fire could be used as an option to manage plant composition and dominance. However, further process-based studies are necessary to explore additional fire regimes and hydrological scenarios to maintain sawgrass over cattail. "

Detritus of these species were placed at three sites with different pollution intensities to investigate the contributions of plant species, site nutrient condition, and their interactions on detritus decomposition. Detritus decomposition was represented by detritus mass remaining at each sampling time. Results of this study suggest that although decomposition processes are species and site specific, and the effects of species are stronger than site conditions. Initial detritus phosphorus (P)-related indicators were proved to be effective controllers for detritus decay at the later stage of the experiment. Significant interactions between site and species indicate that plant species also influenced site controls on detritus mass loss. Site effects on decomposition were significant for submerged and floating species (P &lt; 0.01), and slightly significant for emergent species (P &lt; 0.05). A mathematic two-stage decomposition model was developed based on the experimental results using stepwise analysis to analyze effects of detritus quality and site conditions on decomposition. The detritus quality indicators were the main contributors for both early and later stages of detritus decomposition, while the site nutrients only affected decomposition at the later stage. "

In this study, we investigated the decomposition processes of these three plants using the litterbag method to demonstrate their roles in lake degradation. Decomposition rates of plant tissues (leaves, stems, and roots) and whole plants were determined at three sampling sites that had different nutrient levels. The litter samples displayed a wide range of decomposition rates. Of all samples, the leaves of N. nucifera decomposed the most rapidly, while the stems of P. australis had the lowest decomposition rates. The decomposition correlated significantly with the initial litter phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) content, and the ratios of carbon (C) to N (C:N) and C to P (C:P), especially the P-related indicators, implying a relative shortage of P in the sampled species. Although not as strong as litter quality, site chemistry effects also can be observed during decomposition. The site with a high nutrient level in the water body exhibited rapid decomposition and high decomposition rates. Interactions of plant tissues (expressed as the differences between observed and expected decomposition rates) were tested when we investigated the decomposition processes of the whole plants. Observed decomposition rates of the whole plant individuals significantly deviated from the expected rates that were calculated based on the mass losses of plant tissues of the corresponding species. The strengths of the interactions varied greatly with plant species. T. latifolia L displayed significantly positive interactions among plant tissues, while significantly negative interactions of plant tissues were observed for the other two species. Moreover, our results suggest that the interactions of plant tissues greatly vary among the three sampling sites, indicating that both the biotic and abiotic characteristics of an ecosystem can be important drivers controlling litter decomposition.

Moreover, evaluations of abundance or diversity may not be sufficient for a comprehensive understanding of faunal responses to human activities, especially in the short-term. We assessed the effects of \{RIL\} on the temporal activity patterns of abundant bats in lowland Amazonian rain forest. More specifically, we characterized temporal patterns of activity, overlap of temporal activity, and dispersion of activity modes for seven abundant bat species and for four common bat guilds in \{RIL\} forest and in undisturbed forest in Tapajós National Forest, Pará, Brazil. Temporal activity of aerial insectivores, nectarivores, and gleaning animalivores did not change in response to RIL. In contrast, three of five species of frugivores and frugivores as a group changed their patterns of temporal activity in response to RIL. \{RIL\} had a greater effect on temporal activity of frugivores that foraged in the understorey than on frugivores that foraged in multiple forest strata. Overlap of temporal activity of frugivores was greater than expected by chance in undisturbed forest, but was random in \{RIL\} forest. Changes in activity may be a response to a combination of increased predation risk and reduced distances of early evening flights between day roosts and feeding areas in \{RIL\} forest compared to undisturbed forest.

We find that the more cropland was retired, the more subsidy was received, and the more labor was set free from farming, which, in turn, led to a larger decrease in farming income but a much larger gain in off-farm income. Further, the area enrolled had a more positive effect during 1998–2004 than that during 2006–2011 on all households; and the positive effect was significant only on those households of the 0.25th and 0.50th income quantiles later. Also, the proportion of off-farm labor to total labor, the off-farm work time, and the local \{GDP\} per capita had a larger income effect in the later sub-period, especially for households in the 0.75th and 0.90th income quantiles.

To assess the greenhouse gases (GHG) emission from the deforested tropical peatlands, the amount of carbon released during a forest fire needs to be accounted for. The establishment of a fuel mass data set based on a field-based approach is essential to reduce the uncertainty in estimating \{GHG\} emissions during forest fires. We estimated the fuel mass (both living and deadwood) in tropical peat swamp forests and its loss during the fire event in 2009 in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. We also examined the relationship between the forest structure and the burning process by comparing the distribution of stem diameter in burnt and unburnt areas using a fallen wood simulation. We selected two types of peat swamp forests, mature forest and regenerated forest following a fire in 1997/98, and their neighboring burnt areas. The mean fuel mass values in mature and regenerated forest were 319.7 and 131.5 Mg ha−1, respectively. In burnt areas of mature and regenerated forest, the mean fuel mass values were 235.8 and 89.0 Mg ha−1, respectively, which corresponded to 73.8% and 67.7% of the values of unburnt areas, respectively. The fuel mass in burnt area comprised mainly solid deadwood. Due to the large amount of deadwood left on the ground, the estimated \{GHG\} emissions after the forest fire were larger than those during the forest fire in both forest types. The regenerated forest, which was dominated by small trees and contained a small stock of deadwood, was considered to produce a large amount of solid deadwood during the forest fire. In contrast, the mature forest, which contained many large standing trees and large amounts of deadwood, experienced a high-intensity fire over a long duration time, resulting in surface or deeply burnt deadwood. The development of a simple method to tally the surviving large trees in the burnt area (i.e., designing a study plot with a nested structure for different-sized trees) might reduce uncertainties in the estimation of fuel mass and \{GHG\} emissions in future forest fires.

The samples included four types of ESF: evergreen broad-leaved forest, coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest, pine (Pinus massoniana) forest, and Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) forest. The mean values of biomass in evergreen broad-leaved forest, coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest, pine forest, and Chinese fir forest were 89.19, 70.06, 51.25, and 54.15 t ha−1, respectively. The \{NPP\} for the four types of \{ESF\} ranged from 4.41 to 8.35 t ha−1 year−1. Carbon densities for the four types of \{ESF\} were lower than the mean values (36–57.07 t C ha−1) for China because the \{ESFs\} are relatively young in Zhejiang Province. Overall, biomass, litter production, NPP, and carbon density were all significantly lower in pine forest and Chinese fir forest than in evergreen broad-leaved forest, whereas the values for the coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest were intermediate. These results suggest that the evergreen broad-leaved forest has great potential for offsetting \{CO2\} emissions, and that promoting succession from coniferous forests to evergreen broad-leaved forest can enhance carbon sinks in the forests of subtropical China. The next 50 years (as these forests mature) will represent an important period to enhance the carbon sink in Zhejiang Province. "

The objectives of this study were to develop, improve and validate a scale independent biomass model. Field studies were conducted in Huimin County, Shandong Province of China, during the 2006–2007 growing season of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The field design had a multiscale set-up with four levels which differed in their management, such as nitrogen fertilizer inputs and cultivars, to create different biomass conditions: small experimental fields (L1), large experimental fields (L2), small farm fields (L3), and large farm fields (L4). L4, planted with different winter wheat varieties, was managed according to farmers’ practice while \{L1\} through \{L3\} represented controlled field experiments. Multitemporal spectral measurements were taken in the fields, and biomass was sampled for each spectral campaign. In addition, multitemporal Hyperion data were obtained in 2006 and 2007. \{L1\} field data were used to develop biomass models based on the relation between the winter wheat spectra and biomass: several published vegetation indices, including NRI, REP, OSAVI, TCI, and NDVI, were investigated. A new hyperspectral vegetation index, which uses a four-band combination in the \{NIR\} and \{SWIR\} domains, named GnyLi, was developed. Following the multiscale concept, the data of higher levels (L2 through L4) were used stepwise to validate and improve the models of the lower levels, and to transfer the improved models to the next level. Lastly, the models were transferred and validated at the regional scale using Hyperion images of 2006 and 2007. The results showed that the GnyLi and \{NRI\} models, which were based on the \{NIR\} and \{SWIR\} domains, performed best with \{R2\} &gt; 0.74. All the other indices explained less than 60% model variability. Using the Hyperion data for regionalization, GnyLi and \{NRI\} explained 81–89% of the biomass variability. These results highlighted that GnyLi and \{NRI\} can be used together with hyperspectral images for both plot and regional level biomass estimation. Nevertheless, additional studies and analyses are needed to test its replicability in other environmental conditions. "

Assessment of the impacts of livestock manure on terrestrial biogeochemistry requires a compilation and analysis of spatial and temporal patterns of manure nutrients. In this study, we reconstructed county-level manure nutrient data of the conterminous United States (U.S.) in 4- to 5-year increments from 1930 to 2012. Manure N and P were 5.89 ± 0.64 Tg N yr.− 1 (Mean ± Standard Deviation) and 1.73 ± 0.29 Tg P yr.− 1 (1 Tg = 1012 g), and increased by 46% and 92% from 1930 to 2012, respectively. Prior to 1970, manure provided more N to the U.S. lands than chemical fertilizer use. Since 1970, however, increasing chemical N fertilizer use has exceeded manure N production. Manure was the primary P source in the U.S. during 1930–1969 and 1987–2012, but was lower than P fertilizer use in 1974, 1978, and 1982. High-nutrient-production regions shifted towards eastern and western areas of the U.S. Decreasing small farms and increasing Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) induced concentrated spatial patterns in manure nutrient loads. Counties with cattle or poultry as the primary manure nutrient contributors expanded significantly from 1930 to 2012, whereas regions with sheep and hog as the primary contributors decreased. We identified regions facing environmental threats associated with livestock farming. Effective management of manure should consider the impacts of \{CAFOs\} in manure production, and changes in livestock population structure. The long-term county-level manure nutrient dataset provides improved spatial and temporal information on manure nutrients in the U.S. This dataset is expected to help advance research on nutrient cycling, ammonia volatilization, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from livestock husbandry, recovery and reuse of manure nutrients, and impacts of livestock feeding on human health in the context of global change.

Data from approximately 3000 households were analyzed and farming systems characterized. Plausible socio-economic scenarios of how Kenya might evolve, and their potential impacts on the agricultural sector, were developed with a range of stakeholders. We study how different types of farming systems might increase or diminish in importance under different scenarios using a land-use model sensitive to prices, opportunity cost of land and labour, and other variables. We then use a household model to determine the types of enterprises in which different types of households might engage under different socio-economic conditions. Trajectories of intensification, diversification, and stagnation for different farming systems are identified. Diversification with cash crops is found to be a key intensification strategy as farm size decreases and labour costs increase. Dairy expansion, while important for some trajectories, is mostly viable when land available is not a constraint, mainly due to the need for planting fodders at the expense of cropland areas. We discuss the results in relation to induced innovation theories of intensification. We outline how the methodology employed could be used for integrating global and regional change assessments with local-level studies on farming options, adaptation to global change, and upscaling of social, environmental and economic impacts of agricultural development investments and interventions.

Differentiation among provenances was found only for relative height growth rate (RHGR). The total years of apical attack by Hypsipyla grandella varied by a magnitude of 100% among families but showed little heritability. After 4 years, mean height per family ranged from 328 to 564 cm, 160 to 381 cm, and 253 to 390 cm at each site. Although heritabilities for height were too low for cross-site selection, sufficient heritability ( h I 2 = 0.26 ), additive genetic coefficients of variation (AGCV = 22%), and type B genetic correlations (rb(f) = 0.74) for \{RHGR\} across the two sites with poorer growth indicated that this trait might be used as a surrogate. This would yield an estimated gain of about 17% for the best 15% of trees. At the site with better growth, there was sufficient heritability ( h I 2 = 0.31 ) and \{AGCV\} (20%) for height at year 5 to obtain an estimated gain of 15% for the best 15% of trees.

Intensive nutrient inputs lead to an abundant community of microorganisms. These microbes are partially contained within suspended “biofloc” particles and contribute to water quality maintenance and provision of supplemental nutrition to the culture species. Optimal function of minimal-exchange, intensive systems is likely dependent on the structure of the microbial communities within them. This document offers a short review of microbial groups important for intensive marine aquaculture and descriptions of three methods for quantifying their abundance. The document also describes an experiment during which these methods were used to monitor the effects of partial biofloc removal on microbe abundance. The first method uses light microscopy, with the option of epifluorescence, along with a ranking system to enumerate the abundance of microbial taxa. The second method exclusively uses epifluorescence to illuminate chlorophyll and cyanobacteria pigments. Images are taken of each fluorescing group of pigments and processed using image analysis software to quantify the respective abundance of the two pigment types. Using the third method, changes in bacterial abundance were determined by gas chromatographic measurement of bacteria-specific fatty acids in solvent extracted water column lipids. Using these techniques, it was determined that removing solids from the culture water significantly (P ≤ 0.01) reduced the abundance of nematodes, rotifers, cyanobacteria, and bacteria. Understanding microbial composition and the effects that management protocols have on that composition may help system managers make better informed decisions. "

Further, because REDD+ remains a politically volatile issue, with both critics and supporters pointing to the impacts (or lack thereof) of these pre-REDD+ projects, it is important to critically examine the methods employed to assess those impacts. We review the body of literature that makes claims about the socioeconomic and biophysical impacts of pre-REDD+ projects. We find assessments of outcomes or impacts for only five pre-REDD projects. The design, data collection, and analysis methods for understanding the impacts of pre-REDD+ projects frequently lack rigor. In particular, the counterfactual scenarios for establishing socioeconomic impacts are vague, unscientific, or omitted completely. We conclude that drawing specific lessons from pre-REDD+ projects for the design or evaluation of current REDD+ projects is tenuous. Rigorous project evaluations are challenging, expensive, and time-consuming, but because they are so critical for learning about what works for people and forests, evaluations of current REDD+ projects must use improved methods. In particular, much better care should be taken to construct credible – and where possible, consistent – counterfactuals for both biophysical and socioeconomic outcomes. "

There is an emerging interest in mapping apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) as a surrogate spatial map for soil texture, providing the potential for \{ECa\} mapping as a practical tool to delineate soil-based management zones for variable rate application of agricultural inputs. Results from literature are mixed and inconsistent with the practical utility of \{ECa\} to map texture (or clay content) remaining elusive because of the complex interactions between \{ECa\} and soil transient properties. The objective of this study was to explore \{ECa\} relationships with soil properties and evaluate the usefulness of \{ECa\} mapping to infer soil texture as soil water content changed from one mapping date to the next. Measurements included multiple field-scale \{ECa\} mappings of a 110 ha dryland field of 12 alternating wheat and fallow strips from 2001 to 2003, complemented with extensive soil profile sampling (198 locations) and analysis. Soil \{ECa\} values changed across mapping dates and exhibited weak temporal associations. For instance, \{ECa\} values increased by three fold from 10 mS/m in September 2001 (after wheat harvest) to 30 mS/m in May 2003 (in the emerged wheat crop). Volumetric soil water content was the dominant factor affecting the spatial and temporal \{ECa\} variability, with other measured soil properties having nearly equal, but weak to moderate, correlations with ECa. For the dryland field examined herein and under relatively dry soil water contents, \{ECa\} maps represent overall soil variability with limited utility in providing zones of texture similarities for site-specific management.

Prior climate change analyses and modeling efforts have been reported at a global scale in a few developed countries, but relatively few national assessments have been successfully completed in developing countries. Under the auspices of the U.S. Country Studies Program, analysts from 55 countries employed a common set of methods and models to characterize current carbon (C) pools in forests, future impacts of global change on forest distribution, and management options for conserving and sequestering carbon dioxide (CO2) in forest systems. The analysis revealed that the response and feedbacks of forest systems to global climate change will be profound in the 55 countries studied on five continents. Globally, forest vegetation and soils contain about 1146 Pg C, with approximately 37% of this C in low-latitude forests, 14% in mid-latitudes, and 49% at high latitudes. The impacts of future global change on forest distribution and productivity will be most significant at high latitudes, with more modest changes in distribution and productivity at low latitudes. Future opportunities to conserve and sequester \{CO2\} in forest systems are potentially significant, but land-use practices and global change will influence the size of this C pool and \{CO2\} sink. In the future, a greater proportion of forests at all latitudes could become a greenhouse gas (GHG) source if sustained management and conservation policies are not employed. The timing and magnitude of future changes in forest systems are dependent on global environmental factors (for example, global change, biogeochemical Sulphur and Nitrogen cycles), as well as on human factors such as demographics, economic growth, technology, and resource management policies.

Our previous study of elaborate eddy covariance observations in a Siberian boreal larch forest, conducted both above the forest canopy and at the forest floor, revealed a significant contribution of latent heat flux (LE) from the cowberry understory to the whole ecosystem LE. Thus, in the present study, we examined what factors control the partitioning of whole ecosystem \{LE\} and \{CO2\} flux into the understory and overstory vegetation, using detailed leaf-level physiology (for both understory and overstory vegetation) and soil respiration property measurements as well as a multilayer soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) model. The modeling results showed that the larch overstory's leaf area index (LAI) and vertical profile of leaf photosynthetic capacity were major factors determining the flux partitioning in this boreal forest ecosystem. This is unlike other forest ecosystems that tend to have dense LAI. We concluded that control of the larch overstory's \{LAI\} had a relationship with both the coexistence of the larch with the cowberry understory and with the water resources available to the total forest ecosystem.

In order to overcome the drawbacks, the fresh aluminum hydroxide gels were proposed to prepare the polyaluminum chloride (PACG) in this study. The optimal preparation condition of \{PACG\} was obtained by optimizing the preparation conditions including temperature, time and acid concentration. The contents of the small/middle polymeric aluminum (Alb) in an optimized \{PACG\} could reach 80%. During preparation, high temperature significantly reduced the preparation time but led to a poor stability. Lower rate constants of reaction between hydroxyl-Al and Ferron, kb1 and kb2, were almost equal at high basicity value. It implied that the middle polymeric aluminum (Alb2) was dominant in Alb. Besides, the pseudo-first-order kinetics equation was rearranged. Coagulation by PACG2.0 was found to be the most effective for low-turbidity water treatment but limited to a narrowest optimum range of dosage compared with other PACG. The residual aluminum concentration of the water after coagulation by the PACG2.5 with fresh aluminum hydroxide gels was always low even overdosing. Charge neutralization was not the predominant coagulation mechanism in this treatment. "

Approximately 70,000 \{ASAR\} images at a pixel size of 0.01° were used to estimate \{GSV\} representative for the year 2010. The spatial distribution of the \{GSV\} across four ecological zones (polar, boreal, temperate, subtropical) was well captured by the ASAR-based estimates. The uncertainty of the retrieved \{GSV\} was smallest in boreal and temperate forest (&lt; 30% for approximately 80% of the forest area) and largest in subtropical forest. ASAR-derived \{GSV\} averages at the level of administrative units were mostly in agreement with inventory-derived estimates. Underestimation occurred in regions of very high \{GSV\} (&gt; 300 m3/ha) and fragmented forest landscapes. For the major forested countries within the study region, the relative \{RMSE\} between ASAR-derived \{GSV\} averages at provincial level and corresponding values from National Forest Inventory was between 12% and 45% (average: 29%).

Implementation of policies to reduce emissions from deforestation require effective deforestation monitoring systems that are reproducible, provide consistent results, meet standards for mapping accuracy, and can be implemented at the national level. Remotely sensed data supported by ground observations are key to effective monitoring. Capacity in developing countries for deforestation monitoring is well-advanced in a few countries and is a feasible goal in most others. Data sources exist to determine base periods in the 1990s as historical reference points. Forest degradation (e.g. from high impact logging and fragmentation) also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions but it is more technically challenging to measure than deforestation. Data on carbon stocks, which are needed to estimate emissions, cannot currently be observed directly over large areas with remote sensing. Guidelines for carbon accounting from deforestation exist and are available in approved Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports and can be applied at national scales in the absence of forest inventory or other data. Key constraints for implementing programs to monitor greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation are international commitment of resources to increase capacity, coordination of observations to ensure pan-tropical coverage, access to free or low-cost data, and standard and consensual protocols for data interpretation and analysis.

Soil \{NO\} emissions may also have impacts on local tropospheric ozone (O3) levels. During 2000–2001, we made first-time measurements of \{NO\} emissions in two paired watershed studies. In each study, one watershed had been amended with aerial applications of 2.5–3.5 g N m−2 per year above background atmospheric deposition rates since 1989, and an adjacent watershed served as a reference. In plots at the Fernow Experimental Forest (FEF) in West Virginia and the Bear Brook Watershed in Maine (BBWM), \{NO\} emissions in N-amended watersheds (0.61–6.8 μg NO-N m−2 h−1) were higher than in the reference watersheds (0.21–1.4 μg NO-N m−2 h−1). In the N-amended watershed at BBWM, \{NO\} fluxes in plots dominated by hardwood species were higher than in plots dominated by softwood species, in contrast to previous studies in other forests. Field \{NO\} fluxes were correlated with mineral soil nitrate (NO3−) concentrations (r2=0.65, P=0.016) across all plots, suggesting that \{NO\} emissions may be a reliable indicator of NO3− leaching potential. Laboratory experiments indicated that nitrification was the dominant source of \{NO\} at both sites. At BBWM, increased \{NO\} emissions in N-amended soil appeared to result from more rapid nitrification. In contrast, reduced soil pH in N-amended soil at \{FEF\} may have caused increased protonation of nitrification-derived nitrite, and the subsequent abiotic formation of NO, even though nitrification rates were not significantly higher than in unamended soil. The results suggest that enhanced soil \{NO\} emissions are a characteristic response in forests subjected to elevated N inputs. One possible consequence of higher \{NO\} emissions is an increase in O3-related phytotoxicity. This effect may mitigate the ability of forests to accumulate carbon in response to N inputs or increasing atmospheric CO2. "

We map these variables in the context of avian habitat studies, particularly for wintering habitat of an endangered Nearctic-Neotropical migrant bird, the Kirtland's Warbler (Dendroica kirtlandii). We also illustrate relationships between forest vertical structure, disturbance type and counts of forage species important to the Kirtland's Warbler. The \{ALI\} imagery and the Landsat time series are both critical to the result for forest height, which the strong relationship of forest height with disturbance type and age facilitates. Also unique to this study is that seven of the eight image time steps are cloud-cleared images: mosaics of the clear parts of several cloudy scenes. We created each cloud-cleared image, including a virtually seamless \{ALI\} image mosaic, with regression tree normalization. We also illustrate how viewing time series imagery as red–green–blue composites of tasseled cap wetness (RGB wetness composites) aids reference data collection for classifying tropical forest disturbance type and age. Our results strongly support current Landsat Program production of co-registered imagery, and they emphasize the value of seamless time series of cloud-cleared imagery. "

To assess the response of Dipteryx to logging, we conducted inventories in three logging areas in the Regions of Ucayali and Loreto, Peru. The size-class distributions of Dipteryx populations in recently logged sites showed that initial post-logging conditions enhance recruitment of residual seedlings. These conditions are created by a combination of logging gaps and the activities of farmers migrating into logged lands. Through protection and liberation of shihuahuaco seedlings in post-logged forest as well as within and around agricultural fields, local residents and timber companies could favor the recovery of this valued resource.

We examine four key indicators of recovery – basal area, mortality rate, diameter increment and changes in the balance of tree guilds (Pioneer Index) – to compare the forest directly affected by logging (the apparent extraction network, AEN), with adjacent, less damaged forest. Data are presented on gaps created by felling individuals of different species and diameter, with a view to refining existing yield allocation procedures. Our results indicate that forest recovery is slower than predicted by commonly used yield models. The basal area of \{AEN\} forest is below 23 m2 ha−1 in all 12 plots, even 30 years after logging, and is not obviously increasing. Initially elevated annual mortality rates return to normal rates of less than 2% after 15 years in the non-AEN forest, and after 22 years in the \{AEN\} forest. Diameter increments peak early for pioneers, and increase linearly for shade-bearers across the 10–30 year period, but are not translated into gains in basal area. Only in one plot does the Pioneer Index of the \{AEN\} approach that of the less disturbed surrounding forest, implying inertia against canopy closure, as pioneers replace pioneers. We conclude that Ghana’s commercial logging practices are not sustainable on the current 40-year felling cycle. A different approach is required to achieve a sustainable harvest. Yield models will need to account for reduced site productivity. We suggest improved yield allocation through: (i) the development and use of electronic stock-maps to plan yield allocation, and as a basis for monitoring, (ii) accounting for species–specific differences, and (iii) collecting further data on the varied productivity of old extraction routes. Future studies should try to relate soil type to logging-impacts and recovery. "

Binderless particleboard panels were made with a target density of 0.80 g/cm3 at a temperature of 180 °C and a pressure of 12 \{MPa\} in a computer controlled hot press. The modulus of rupture, the internal bond strength, the thickness swelling and the water absorption of the panels were evaluated. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the properties of the raw materials and the manufactured panels. The chemical composition of the oil palm biomass consisted of high holocellulose, lignin, starch and sugar contents that have been found to aid in the production of binderless particleboard. The core-part of the trunk contained the highest amount of starch and total sugar. Samples made from the core-parts and fronds had sufficient modulus of rupture and internal bond strength to meet the Japanese Industrial Standard. The internal bond strength of the mid-part panels also met the standard. However, binderless board prepared from bark and leaves showed poor modulus of rupture and internal bond strength. Samples from the core-parts had the lowest thickness swell and water absorption but did not meet the above standard. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra did not show any substantial difference between the raw materials and the manufactured panels. Field emission scanning electron microscopy indicated that the compressed cells varied between raw material types and showed the presence of compressed cells with some starch granules that facilitated adhesion.

The results suggested that \{PAC\} with the basicity values (OH/Al) of 2.5 and 2.0 synthesized by this method possessed the high content of middle polymeric aluminum (Alb2). And fresh aluminum hydroxide gels contributed to the formation of Alb2. Adding fresh aluminum hydroxide gels in the aging period temporarily increased the small/middle polymeric aluminum (Alb) content that rapidly reduced with the time extending since fresh aluminum hydroxide gels accelerated the aluminum hydrolysis. The excessive fresh aluminum hydroxide gels would aggravate the decrease of Alb content. The presence of fresh aluminum hydroxide gels in \{PAC\} slightly reduced the coagulation efficiency, but the performance deterioration resulted from overdosing was weakened in the cases. Besides, the residual aluminum concentrations in the treated water were always low as fresh aluminum hydroxide gels induced the generation of colloidal aluminum hydroxide particles.

abstract = "Abstract The prospect of changing climate has led to uncertainty about the resilience of forested mountain watersheds in the tropics. In watersheds where frequent, high rainfall provides ample runoff, we often lack understanding of how the system will respond under conditions of decreased rainfall or drought. Factors that govern water supply, such as recharge rates and groundwater storage capacity, may be poorly quantified. This paper describes 8-year data sets of water stable isotope composition (δ2H and δ18O) of precipitation (4 sites) and a stream (1 site), and four contemporaneous stream sample sets of solute chemistry and isotopes, used to investigate watershed response to precipitation inputs in the 1780-ha Río Mameyes basin in the Luquillo Mountains of northeastern Puerto Rico. Extreme δ2H and δ18O values from low-pressure storm systems and the deuterium excess (d-excess) were useful tracers of watershed response in this tropical system. A hydrograph separation experiment performed in June 2011 yielded different but complementary information from stable isotope and solute chemistry data. The hydrograph separation results indicated that 36% of the storm rain that reached the soil surface left the watershed in a very short time as runoff. Weathering-derived solutes indicated near-stream groundwater was displaced into the stream at the beginning of the event, followed by significant dilution. The more biologically active solutes exhibited a net flushing behavior. The d-excess analysis suggested that streamflow typically has a recent rainfall component (∼25%) with transit time less than the sampling resolution of 7 days, and a more well-mixed groundwater component (∼75%). The contemporaneous stream sample sets showed an overall increase in dissolved solute concentrations with decreasing elevation that may be related to groundwater inputs, different geology, and slope position. A considerable amount of water from rain events runs off as quickflow and bypasses subsurface watershed flowpaths, and better understanding of shallow hillslope and deeper groundwater processes in the watershed will require sub-weekly data and detailed transit time modeling. A combined isotopic and solute chemistry approach can guide further studies to a more comprehensive model of the hydrology, and inform decisions for managing water supply with future changes in climate and land use.

abstract = "Abstract The lowland tropical forests of Southeast Asia are dominated by a single family of canopy and emergent trees, the Dipterocarpaceae. The seeds of dipterocarps are gravity or gyration dispersed. Short distance and limited seed dispersal via these mechanisms result in the aggregation of related individuals and strong fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS). In logged and fragmented forests, where gene flow may be disrupted, tree species with strong \{FSGS\} are predicted to exhibit increased inbreeding, which consequently can erode genetic diversity, fitness and might limit the potential for natural regeneration of dipterocarps. Developing a set of indirect operational indicators for \{FSGS\} provides a solid basis for informing conservation and management of forest genetic resources in logged forests. Our main objective was to use an information theoretic approach to identify these indicators of \{FSGS\} in dipterocarps. We quantify \{FSGS\} in 19 dipterocarp species across four forest sites in Malaysian Borneo, India and the Seychelles. We detected \{FSGS\} in 15 (79%) of our study species, most of which displayed significant inbreeding. Our results suggest that wood density and flower size offer useful indicators of FSGS. We propose some simple guidelines to allow forest managers to account for \{FSGS\} when planning approaches to maintain genetically diverse stands in logged dipterocarp forests. The integration of improved understanding of genetic processes is essential for conserving forest tree genetic resources and ensuring the resilience of logged forests. "

Soil test-based fertilizer recommendations are difficult to use for smallholder farms because of constraints such as access, cost and timeliness in multiple cropping systems. In this study, we combined on-farm experiments from 2012 to 2014 in 20 farmers’ fields on spring maize in Northeast China with a simulation model (Hybrid Maize model), to test the continual performance in agronomic, economic and environmental aspects of the Nutrient Expert for Hybrid Maize decision support system. Six treatments were set as follows: Nutrient Expert (NE), farmers’ practice (FP), soil testing (OPTS) and nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) omission treatments based on NE. We estimated yield gaps as the difference between simulated yields with the Hybrid Maize model and measured yields; calculated economic benefit and nutrient use efficiency; and estimated greenhouse gas emissions using published equations approximating nitrous oxide emissions as a function of N fertilizer rate. On average, the NE, FP, and \{OPTS\} treatments attained yields of 80%, 74%, and 77% of the potential yield, respectively. The exploitable yield gap between the \{NE\} and \{FP\} treatments was 0.9 t ha−1, and between the \{NE\} and \{OPTS\} treatments was 0.5 t ha−1. On average, the \{NE\} treatment increased the gross return above fertilizer cost (GRF) by US$303 and US$167 compared with the \{FP\} and \{OPTS\} treatments across all sites, respectively, in which about 91% and 98% of increase \{GRF\} was attributed increase in grain yield rather than reduction in fertilizer cost. There were slightly higher nutrient use efficiencies under the \{NE\} treatment than under the \{OPTS\} treatment. Relative to the \{FP\} treatment, however, on average, the \{NE\} treatment increased recovery efficiency of N, P, and K by percentage point of 12, 15, and 10, respectively. Agronomic efficiency of N, P, and K were increased by 6, 35, and 10 kg kg−1, respectively. Finally, partial factor productivity increased by 14 kg kg−1 for N and 45 kg kg−1 for P while decreased by 29 kg kg−1 for K. Furthermore, the calculated soil inorganic N at harvest of maize crop, total greenhouse gas (GHG, kg \{CO2\} eq ha−1) emissions, and \{GHG\} emission intensity (kg \{CO2\} eq t−1 grain) were 42%, 17%, and 23% lower in the \{NE\} treatment than the \{FP\} treatment, respectively. We conclude that the Nutrient Expert for Hybrid Maize system has the potential to close existing yield gaps in the spring maize production systems of Northeast China by improving yield, nutrient use efficiency, and profitability with low environmental pollution.

Following on-going breeding programmes, provenance and progeny trials were established in some of the countries of the species’ range (France, Portugal and Spain) and quantitative traits were measured: growth, stem form, survival and pest and disease resistance, amongst others. Populations from the wide range of P. pinaster were recently screened with molecular markers in order to assess their genetic diversity. Data were obtained using allozymes, chloroplast (cpSSRs) and nuclear (nuSSRs) microsatellites and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). Based on mtDNA-RFLP analysis, three maternal lineages (named “western”, “eastern” and “Moroccan”) were identified and no population showed a mixed composition. In this study, the imprint that differentiation in putatively isolated glacial refugia (identified by the different maternal lineages) might have left on the nuclear genome was analysed using a wide range of molecular markers and adaptive traits. Multivariate ordination of populations based on nuclear molecular markers (allozymes and nuSSRs) showed a clear clustering of provenances sharing a given mtDNA lineage. However, that clustering was found to be less tight when only quantitative traits were investigated. In P. pinaster, the within-population estimates of gene diversity using different traits were not correlated. Therefore, caution is advisable when designing conservation strategies based on molecular marker studies or a limited number of populations. After these results, we recommend a conservation strategy characterised by gene flow consistent with the current population structure, careful seed transfer among maternal lineages (if any), selection of populations for conservation based on the originality of their allelic composition and definition of Management Units (MUs) based on adaptive traits.

The diameter distribution in undisturbed and logged stands indicated the presence of few young individuals, and a poor regeneration status in highly disturbed stands. Variance in diameter was larger in natural stands compared to managed ones. There was a seedling establishment pulse during the time period between 1910 and 1990 at three sites, but a lack of sapling and juveniles occurred at undisturbed and logged forests in the last century, which might be attributed to competition between C. atlantica and Quercus ilex. Nevertheless, cedar trees persistently recruited to all forests during the last 50 years, but cedar density was significantly higher in the highly disturbed forest areas. Spatial analysis shows a general trend toward aggregation for all species involved. This pattern was observed among C. atlantica trees in undisturbed and highly disturbed stands but was not significant in logged stands. Differences in management may promote variation in stand structure and regeneration dynamics of the subalpine cedar forests along the management gradient in the Middle Atlas, Morocco. "

In these forests, the main preventive action consists of forest compartmentalization by fuel break networks, which entail high costs and sometimes significant negative impacts. While many studies look at public preferences for fire suppression, this study analyses the heterogeneity of social preferences for fire prevention. The visual characteristics of fire prevention structures are very familiar to respondents, but their management is unfamiliar, which raises specific attention in terms of analysing preference heterogeneity. A random parameter logit model revealed large heterogeneity and preference for traditional heavy machinery, maintaining linear unshaded fuel breaks at a high density. A latent class model showed that this may be reflected by a third of the population preferring lighter machinery and shaded irregular fuel breaks; a quarter of the population not treating the budget constraint as limiting, another quarter only being worried about the area burnt and the remaining group being against everything. Finally, a discrete mixture model revealed extreme preference patterns for the density of fuel breaks. These results are important for designing fire prevention policies that are efficient and acceptable by the population. "

abstract = "Abstract Agroforestry has attracted considerable attention in recent years because of its potential to reduce poverty, improve food security, reduce land degradation and mitigate climate change. However, progress in promoting agroforestry is held back because decision-makers lack reliable tools to accurately predict yields from tree-crop mixtures. Amongst the key challenges faced in developing such tools are the complexity of agroforestry, including interactions between various system components, and the large spatial domains and timescales over which trees and crops interact. A model that is flexible enough to simulate any agroforestry system globally should be able to address competition and complementarity above and below ground between trees and crops for light, water and nutrients. Most agroforestry practices produce multiple products including food, fiber and fuel, as well as income, shade and other ecosystem services, all of which need to be simulated for a comprehensive understanding of the overall system to emerge. Several agroforestry models and model families have been developed, including SCUAF, HyPAR, Hi-SAFE/Yield-SAFE and WaNuLCAS, but as of 2015 their use has remained limited for reasons including insufficient flexibility, restricted ability to simulate interactions, extensive parameterization needs or lack of model maintenance. An efficient approach to improving the flexibility and durability of agroforestry models is to integrate them into a well-established modular crop modeling framework like APSIM. This framework currently focuses on field-scale crops and pastures, but has the capability to reuse or interoperate with existing models including tree, livestock and landscape models, it uses parameters that are intuitive and relatively easy to measure, and it allows scenario analysis that can include farm-scale economics. Various types of agroforestry systems are currently being promoted in many contexts, and the impacts of these innovations are often unclear. Rapid progress in reliable modeling of tree and crop performance for such systems is needed to ensure that agroforestry fulfills its potential to contribute to reducing poverty, improving food security and fostering sustainability.

The goal of the study was to quantify the effects of environmental variables on the C balance in a 70-year-old mixed-oak woodland forest over a 7-year period in northwest Ohio, USA. The net ecosystem exchanges (NEE) of C were measured using the eddy-covariance technique. Long-term mean NEE, ecosystem respiration (ER), and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) were −339 ± 34, 1213 ± 84, and 1552 ± 82 g C m−2 year−1, respectively. Warming increased \{ER\} more than \{GEP\} when the available water was not limited, but decreased \{GEP\} more than \{ER\} when the available water was limited, resulting in decreasing net C fluxes under both conditions. The decreasing net C sink in summer was associated with increasing air temperature (Ta) in spring. The leaf area index (LAI), photosynthetically-active radiation (PAR), and Ta were the most important determinants of \{NEE\} for spring, summer, and winter, respectively; however, these variables failed to explain \{NEE\} for autumn. The most important determinants of \{ER\} and \{GEP\} were soil temperature (Ts) in spring, Ta and \{PAR\} in summer, and Ta in autumn. Ta was the only control of \{ER\} in winter. The annual variation in \{NEE\} was larger than that of \{GEP\} or ER. The controls of \{GEP\} on \{NEE\} were more pronounced seasonally and annually than those of ER. The annual \{GEP\} was consistently more variable than the annual ER. \{GEP\} was also seasonally and annually correlated with ER. Practical models derived from different combinations of independent variables effectively predicted 87%, 80%, and 93% of the monthly variability in NEE, ER, and GEP, respectively. We concluded that the variability in C fluxes was more responsive to increasing Ta and Ts than to variations in seasonal and annual precipitation. The study implies that a warmer climate is likely to reduce the forest productivity and C-sink capacity of oak ecosystems in the future, especially in instances when water inputs become limiting. "

Questions related to provisioning, cultural/spiritual, regulating and supporting ecosystem services derived from forest, and attitudes towards forest conversion. We used boosted regression trees (BRTs) to combine interview data with social and environmental predictors to understand spatial variation of perceptions across Borneo. Our results show that people use a variety of products from intact and highly degraded forests. Perceptions of benefits from forests were strongest: in human-altered forest landscapes for cultural and spiritual benefits; in human-altered and intact forests landscapes for health benefits; intact forest for direct health benefits, such as medicinal plants; and in regions with little forest and extensive plantations, for environmental benefits, such as climatic impacts from deforestation. Forest clearing for small scale agriculture was predicted to be widely supported yet less so for large-scale agriculture.

However, the actual impacts of \{PES\} schemes, both in effectively protecting the environmental quality of an ecosystem, such as the water filtration capacity of a forest, and on improving local livelihoods, often remain unknown. Policy evaluation in general, and for newly established policies in particular, plays a critical role in providing essential feedback about what is actually happening on the ground. Thus, for \{PES\} to generate outcomes that are effective, efficient and equitable, policy makers must develop a functional evaluation system. As \{PES\} schemes around the world face similar problems in monitoring and evaluation, we draw on the case of Vietnam—the first country in Asia to introduce a nationwide \{PES\} scheme—and analyze the effectiveness of the monitoring and evaluation activities of the Payment for Forest Environmental Services program (PFES). We also offer practical policy recommendations for future \{PFES\} implementation. We find that monitoring and evaluation of \{PFES\} in Vietnam is still in its infancy. Although there is a strong accounting of revenues generated from ecosystem services buyers, there is a discernible lack of ability to assess the quantity and quality of ecosystem services being enhanced by the program; fulfillment of contractual obligations; the appropriateness of financial flows; or socio-economic impacts of the program. We argue that a functioning \{PES\} evaluation system must include an accessible grievance mechanism to ensure transparency and accountability in the distribution of \{PES\} revenues from central to local levels.

Using a split-plot design on two soils (clay, loam) we compared two crop types (annual, perennial) each unfertilized and fertilized. Both soils are of andic origin. Their properties include relatively low bulk density and high organic matter content, water retention capacity, and hydraulic conductivity. The top 2–3 cm of the soils consists of distinct small aggregates (dia. &lt;0.5 cm). We measured a strong gradient of bulk density and moisture within the top 7 cm of the clay soil. Using automated sampling and analysis systems we measured \{N2O\} emissions at 4.6 h intervals, meteorological variables, soil moisture, and temperature at 0.5 h intervals. Mean daily soil moisture content at 5 cm depth ranged from 46% water filled pore space (WFPS) on clay in April 1995 to near saturation on loam during a wet period in February 1996. On both soils the aggregated surface layer always remained unsaturated. Soils emitted \{N2O\} throughout the year. Mean \{N2O\} fluxes were 1.04±0.72 ng N2O-N cm−2 h−1 (mean±standard deviation) from unfertilized loam under annual crops compared to 3.54±4.31 ng N2O-N cm−2 h−1 from the fertilized plot (351 days measurement). Fertilization dominated the temporal variation of \{N2O\} emissions. Generally fluxes peaked shortly after fertilization and were increased for up to 6 weeks (‘post fertilization flux’). Emissions continued at a lower rate (‘background flux’) after fertilization effects faded. Mean post-fertilization fluxes were 6.3±6.5 ng N2O-N cm−2 h−1 while the background flux rate was 2.2±1.8 ng N2O-N cm−2 h−1. Soil moisture dynamics affected \{N2O\} emissions. Post fertilization fluxes were highest from wet soils; fluxes from relatively dry soils increased only after rain events. \{N2O\} emissions were weakly affected by soil moisture during phases of low N availability. Statistical modeling confirmed N availability and soil moisture as the major controls on \{N2O\} flux. Our data suggest that small-scale differences in soil structure and moisture content cause very different biogeochemical environments within the top 7 cm of soils, which is important for net \{N2O\} fluxes from soils.

In Burkina Faso forest management policies prohibit grazing while recommending annual early fire and selective tree cutting of 50% of the merchantable standing volume on a 20-year rotation period. These management prescriptions are not based on long-term experimental evidence, particularly the responses of saplings to these management regimes are not well known. A factorial experiment with two levels was designed to examine the effects of moderate level of grazing, early fire and selective tree cutting on the dynamics of sapling populations on two sites, Laba and Tiogo, in the savanna woodland of Burkina Faso and assessed for 10 years from 1992 to 2002. Species richness, sapling population density, structure and growth were analysed. The results provide evidence that fire, grazing and selective cutting acted independently to influence the population dynamics of saplings. Annual early fire significantly reduced species richness (p = 0.037 in Laba and p = 0.016 in Tiogo), population density (p &lt; 0.001 in Laba and p = 0.003 in Tiogo) and current annual increment (CAI) in basal area (p &lt; 0.001 in Laba and p = 0.016 in Tiogo). Grazing and fire affected sapling morphology but the response was site specific. Selective removal of trees did not affect any of the parameters studied, except the \{CAI\} in dominant height at the Tiogo site which was significantly (p = 0.028) reduced by the cutting treatment. Early fire also significantly reduced the \{CAI\} in dominant height at Laba. The height class distribution revealed that more than 93% of the saplings recorded were less than 400 cm tall, and fire significantly reduced the rate of change in density of saplings in the 200–400 cm height class. It can be concluded that annual early fire was the factor that most affected sapling recruitment. The sapling response to these management regimes was species specific. "

In order to stabilize crop production, it may be necessary to develop new water resources, such as soil moisture and groundwater, instead of rainfed resources. This is because rainfed agriculture has already been unsuccessfully tried in many areas of this region. In this study, we investigate the soil water content in rainfed fields in Khon Kaen in Northeast Thailand, where rice and sugarcane were planted, over a 1-year period that contained both dry and rainy seasons, and estimate the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) using micrometeorological data. In addition, we assess the water balance from the results of the soil water content investigation and the actual evapotranspiration. Although the soil water content at depths above 0.6 m in both the lower and the sloping fields gradually decreased during the dry season, the soil water content at a depth of 1.0 m was under almost constant wet conditions. Two-dimensional profiles of the soil water content demonstrated that at the end of the dry season, the soil layers below a depth of 0.4 m showed a soil water content of more than 0.10–0.15 m3 m−3, thus suggesting that water was supplied to the sugarcane from those layers. The range in \{ETa\} rates was almost the same as that in the previous study. The average \{ETa\} rates were 3.7 mm d−1 for the lower field and 4.2 mm d−1 for the sloping field. In the dry season, an upward water flow of 373 mm (equivalent to a flux of 1.9 mm d−1) was estimated from outside the profile. The source of this upward water flow was the sandy clay (SC) layer below a depth of 1 m. It was this soil water supply from the \{SC\} layer that allowed the sugarcane to grow without irrigation. "

The three mulching treatments with varying durations were applied: (1) M30: mulching for 30 days after sowing (DAS); (2) M60: mulching for 60 DAS; (3) Mw: mulching for the whole growth period, as well as the control; M0: without mulching. In 1999, seedlings from the three mulching treatments emerged 8 days earlier than those from unmulchingly treated. In 2000, a very dry year, emergence of seedlings in the mulching treatments occurred only 1–2 days earlier compared to control. Moreover, mulching treatments also significantly increased the total root biomass before 90 \{DAS\} in 1999 and before 30 \{DAS\} in 2000. There was a sharp increase in soil respiration in the mulching treatments. Soil microbial biomass nitrogen content in the Mw treatment was significantly lower at 43 \{DAS\} than that in control. Accumulation of total mineral nitrogen in the soil at harvest was clearly higher in Mw than in the other treatments and the control. Highest yields were recorded from wheat treated with \{M60\} (3305 and 1203 kg ha−1 in 1999 and 2000, respectively). By contrast, no significant difference in yield was found among the three-mulched treatments in 1999. In 1999 the water use efficiency in all mulching treatments was significantly higher than in control, while in 2000 it was significantly higher in \{M60\} and Mw than in \{M30\} and control. These findings therefore suggest that mulching for 60 \{DAS\} increased grain yield by increasing the mineral nitrogen, soil water and the efficiency of water use and avoiding the over-decomposition of organic matter and over-mineralization of organic nitrogen.

Ground damage (roads+skid trails+log decks) in the conventional logging treatments occupied 8.9–11.2% of total operational area. In contrast, ground damage in \{RIL\} treatments ranged from 4.6 to 4.8% of the total area. Forest canopy damage was assessed using gap fraction measurements collected with an automated optical canopy analyzer (LAI-2000; Licor Inc.) in March 1999. Canopy opening varied by time since logging. The recently logged (1998) blocks had integrated canopy gap fractions of 21.6 and 10.9% of total area for conventional and \{RIL\} blocks, respectively. The blocks logged in 1996 had more closed canopies with 16.5 and 4.9% gap fraction for conventional and \{RIL\} blocks, respectively.

Measurements of ground disturbance and gap fraction using the Licor LAI-2000 generally agree with other field evaluations of \{RIL\} and conventional logging.

Precision and implied accuracy appeared substantially better with the visual detection line-transect than with the fixed-width transect for equivalent costs and effort at all three landscapes but as the two methods provide different estimates there are questions of possible bias in both approaches. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the distance approach and suggest some recommendations concerning its application. We conclude that the distance method is suited to low density species that are easily identified, even when understorey vegetation and terrain severely impair visibility. However, due to the differences in detection probabilities, populations need to be stratified both by tree size and context. "

Bamboo sprouts provide a key food for conservation significant Mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) and African golden monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis kandti). We examined the impact of a localised harvest of mature bamboo on the production of new stems. We used a grid of 540 variable area plots to record and assess 9420 stems (including 1268 cut stems) and 1981 sprouts. Mean densities were 3.96 stems m−2 and 0.68 sprouts m−2. Densities and diameters were lower in areas with tree shade compared to those without. Densities of new stems were positively related to densities of older stems. Diameters of young stems were positively correlated with the diameters of older stems but younger stems were, in general, significantly larger. Cutting of mature stems had no detectable impact on either the density or diameter of subsequent new stems. Statistical power analysis adapted from pharmaceutical assessments indicates that a minor positive or negative impact remains possible (a positive effect appears more probable). We conclude that the bamboo is in a “building phase”, that densities and sizes of young stems are determined by the extent of the underground rhizome, and that this plot–scale relationship is not detectably influenced by harvesting older stems. Nonetheless, negative impacts may arise with repeated harvesting. Guidelines for any future harvest are suggested. "

Our field study encompassed measurements of ground damage and canopy gap fractions along a chronosequence of postharvest regrowth of 0.5–3.5 years. We found that canopy damage and regrowth rates varied according to the logging method used, either conventional logging or reduced impact logging. Areas used to stage felled trees prior to transport, log decks, had the largest gap fractions immediately following cutting. Log decks were quickly colonized by early successional plant species, resulting in significant gap fraction decreases within 1.5 years after site abandonment. Although log decks were the most obvious damage areas on the ground and in satellite imagery, they accounted for only 1–2% of the total harvested area of the blocks studied. Other forest damage features such as tree-fall gaps, skid trails, and roads were difficult to recognize in Landsat reflectance data or through textural analysis. These landscape features could be only crudely resolved in the most intensively logged forests and within about 0.5 years following harvest. We found that forest damage within any of the landscape strata (decks, roads, skids, tree falls) could not be resolved with Landsat reflectance or texture data when the canopy gap fraction was &lt;50%. The basic Landsat ETM+ imagery lacks the resolution of forest structural features required for quantitative studies of logging damage. Landsat textural analyses may be useful for broad delineation of logged forests, but detailed ecological and biogeochemical studies will probably need to rely on other remote sensing approaches. Until spatial gradients of canopy damage and regrowth resulting from selective logging operations in tropical forests in the Amazon region are resolved, the impacts of this land use on a continental scale will remain poorly understood.

Biophysical, process-based ecosystem models are powerful tools to study \{WUE\} at large spatial and temporal scales.

Despite high levels of research effort focused on understanding the dynamics of bushmeat trade and consumption, current research is largely site specific. Without synthesis and quantitative analysis of available case studies, the national and regional characteristics of bushmeat trade and consumption remain largely speculative, impeding efforts to inform national and regional policy on bushmeat trade. Here we describe the structure and content of the West and Central African bushmeat database which holds quantitative data on bushmeat sales, consumption and offtake for 177 species from 275 sites across 11 countries in two regions, spanning three decades of research. Despite this wealth of available data, we found important biases in research effort. The majority of studies in West and Central Africa have collected market data, which although providing a useful record of bushmeat sales, are limited in their ability to track changes in hunting offtake. In addition, few data exist for West Africa, and few studies have tracked changes over time, using repeat sampling. With new initiatives in the regions to track bushmeat hunting, this database represents an opportunity to synthesise current and future data on bushmeat hunting, consumption and trade in West and Central Africa, identify gaps in current understanding, and systematically target future monitoring efforts.

Currently, three exotic mangrove species have been introduced for large-scale afforestation since 1985. A reassessment of the overall status of the mangrove species, habitat change, population of introduced species, was conducted through a comprehensive literature review as well as field investigations covering 96 sites. The success of conservation efforts is also evaluated. Upstream and high intertidal habitats are more vulnerable than downstream and lower intertidal ones, with habitat alteration being the biggest threats. Five mangrove species have narrow distributional extents with small populations, which could incur regional extinction. With the introduced species having naturalized at 42 sites, their role in mangrove management needs to be reconsidered. These findings collectively suggest a need to manage latent species loss and habitat degradation beyond the apparent increase in mangrove area and protection. "

There were some observations with lower than predicted DCP, some of which were with diets containing browse. Therefore, observations with residuals &lt;1.58 were deleted, resulting in the equation: DCP=0.8831×CP (%DM)−2.67 (r2=0.952, root mean square error = 0.86; n=562); estimates of \{MFCP\} and true \{CP\} digestibility were considered the Y intercept and slope, respectively. To address variables of the entire database with less than expected DCP, the database was split into a subset to develop equations (60% of observations), with inclusion of additional variables such as \{DM\} intake and dietary concentrations of forage and browse, and one to evaluate. However, multiple regression equations did not greatly improve prediction, with lower than predicted \{DCP\} appearing a consequence of depressed true \{CP\} digestibility rather than increased MFCP. In conclusion, for goats consuming diets without browse, 0.88 and 2.67% \{DM\} appear appropriate estimates of true \{CP\} digestibility and MFCP, respectively, similar to values for other ruminant species.

The first database consisted of 22 observations in which urinary N (UN) was measured with nonlactating goats fed diets very low in N concentration (0.032–0.33% of DM). A log-log weighted linear regression of \{EUN\} (g) on \{BW\} (kg) indicated that 0.75 was an appropriate power of \{BW\} for which UN, the estimate of EUN, could be expressed. The intercept, which represented an estimate of EUN, was 0.122 g/kg BW0.75. The second database for nonlactating goats, with means from 186 treatment-experiment combinations, was split into two groups, one for equation development (n=121) and a second for evaluation of the equations (n=65). With the development set, \{UN\} (g/kg BW0.75) was regressed on total N intake (TNI; g/kg BW0.75) or apparently digested N intake (DNI; g/kg BW0.75). After removing observations with relatively high residual S.D. from the development set, equations were: UN=0.092 + (0.288×TNI) (n=79; R2=0.59) and UN=0.165+(0.340×DNI) (n=79; R2=0.59). The intercepts, 0.092 and 0.165 g/kg BW0.75, are estimates of \{EUN\} when \{TNI\} and \{DNI\} are zero, respectively. At zero DNI, truly digested N intake should equal metabolic fecal N; thus, the \{DNI\} estimate of \{EUN\} may be applicable to nonlactating goats in zero or positive N balance with feed intake above maintenance and appropriate to use in summation equations to predict N requirements without need for further adjustment factors. Prediction equations for lactating goats with feed intake above maintenance were: UN=0.182+(0.235×TNI) (n=33; R2=0.65) and UN=0.160+(0.354×DNI) (n=33; R2=0.72). In summary, based on databases from publications on goat feeding and nutrition, \{EUN\} of nonlactating goats with feed intake above maintenance was estimated at 0.165 g/kg BW0.75 by regressing \{UN\} against DNI; \{EUN\} of lactating goats based on \{DNI\} seemed similar to that for nonlactating goats.

With 50% of the global population living in urban areas, cities are transforming into hotspots for future sustainable energy systems in the context of a low-carbon society. Bioenergy feedstock from urban forests could contribute substantially to low-carbon energy supply, yet urban ecosystems also provide other services that have to be balanced against future energy needs. This study conducts a geo-spatial analysis of urban forests with respect to its potential of increasing feedstock production for urban bioenergy generation. At the same time, social and environmental constraints are considered and co-benefits discussed. In order to test the wider applicability of the methodology, the Vienna Woods Biosphere Reserve is chosen as a case study to determine the feedstock potential for local bioenergy provided to Viennese households. The theoretical biomass potential is modeled using biophysical growth and yield tables for individual tree species and then compared to the existing production area using \{GIS\} tools. Results show that the biomass use within the biosphere reserve can be increased by about 60% without violating any national or international law that protects multiple ecosystem services provided by the reserve, nor sustainability criteria of forest management. This indicates a high potential of peri-urban forest ecosystems to contribute to urban resilience – i.e. with respect to energy security and emissions reduction. The study concludes that urban forests require sensible management in order to minimize conflicts of multiple environmental, economic and social uses of the area. "

In recent decades, due to increasing population and food demand and the backdrop of global warming, croplands have been expanding into higher latitude regions. One such hotspot is paddy rice expansion in northeast China. However, there are no maps available for documenting the spatial and temporal patterns of continuous paddy rice expansion. In this study, we developed an automated, Landsat-based paddy rice mapping (Landsat-RICE) system that uses time series Landsat images and a phenology-based algorithm based on the unique spectral characteristics of paddy rice during the flooding/transplanting phase. As a pilot study, we analyzed all the available Landsat images from 1986 to 2010 (498 scenes) in one tile (path/row 113/27) of northeast China, which tracked paddy rice expansion in epochs with five-year increments (1986–1990, 1991–1995, 1996–2000, 2001–2005, and 2006–2010). Several maps of land cover types (barren land and built-up land; evergreen, deciduous and sparse vegetation types; and water-related land cover types such as permanent water body, mixed pixels of water and vegetation, spring flooded wetlands and summer flooded land) were generated as masks. Air temperature was used to define phenology timing and crop calendar, which were then used to select Landsat images in the phenology-based algorithms for paddy rice and masks. The resultant maps of paddy rice in the five epochs were evaluated using validation samples from multiple sources, and the overall accuracies and Kappa coefficients ranged from 84 to 95% and 0.6–0.9, respectively. The paddy rice area in the study area substantially increased from 1986 to 2010, particularly after the 1990s. This study demonstrates the potential of the Landsat-RICE system and time series Landsat images for tracking agricultural land use changes at 30-m resolution in the temperate zone with single crop cultivation.

abstract = "Many process-based models of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles have been developed for northern forest ecosystems. These models are widely used to evaluate the long-term decisions in forest management dealing with effects like particulate pollution, productivity and climate change. Regarding climate change, one of the key questions that have sensitive political implications is whether northern forests will sequester atmospheric C or not. Whilst many process-based models have been tested for accuracy by evaluating or validating against observed data, few have dealt with the complexity of the incorporated procedures to estimate uncertainties associated with model predictions or the sensitivity of these predictions to input factors in a systematic, inter-model comparison fashion. In general, models differ in their underlying attempts to match natural complexities with assumed or imposed model structure and process formulations to estimate model parameters, to gather data and to address issues on scope, scale and natural variations. Uncertainties may originate from model structure, estimation of model parameters, data input, representation of natural variation and scaling exercises. Model structure relates to the mathematical representation of the processes modelled and the type of state variables that a model contains. The modelling of partitioning among above- and below-ground C and N pools and the interdependence among these pools remain a major source of uncertainty in model structure and error propagation. For example, most soil C models use at least three state variables to represent the different types of soil organic matter (SOM). This approach results in creating three artificial \{SOM\} pools, assuming that each one contains C compounds with the same turnover rate. In reality, \{SOM\} consists of many different types of C compounds with widely different turnover rates. Uncertainty in data and parameter estimates are closely linked. Data uncertainties are associated with high variations in estimating forest biomass, productivity and soil organic matter and their estimates may be incomplete for model initialisation, calibration, validation and sensitivity analysis of generalised predictor models. The scale at which a model is being used also affects the level of uncertainty, as the errors in the prediction of the C and N dynamics differ from site to landscape levels and across climatic regions. If the spatial or temporal scale of a model application is changed, additional uncertainty arises from neglecting natural variability in system variables in time and space. Uncertainty issues are also intimately related to model validation and sensitivity analysis. The estimation of uncertainties is needed to inform decision processes in order to detect the possible corridor of development. Uncertainty in this context is an essential measure of quality for stakeholder and decision makers. "

Herbs, such as Artemisia and Asteraceae, were dominant just before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Low pollen accumulation rates (PARs) with little herb pollen indicate sparse herbaceous vegetation cover during the LGM. Picea expanded after the Bølling interval, suggesting expansion of riparian areas, and shrub Alnus rapidly increased during the following Allerød interval. Abies and Pinus subgen. Haploxylon began to increase at the beginning of the Holocene and Pinus subgen. Diploxylon has been highly dominant since the middle Holocene. The vegetation change after the \{LGM\} is similar to that from other sites in the Lake Baikal region, but the responses to short-term climate events are pronounced. Fluctuations in herb elements and vegetation cover as indicated by the \{PAR\} correspond to the Younger Dryas (YD) cooling event. The decline in the \{PAR\} and increase in herb taxa were remarkable at the beginning of the YD, but Larix and Picea trees were distributed in river valleys near Lake Baikal in the latter half. The rapid expansion of Betula and Artemisia following frequent fires in the early Holocene may have been in response to the 8.2 cal ka \{BP\} cooling event. From these findings, the southern Lake Baikal region, including the Selenga River basin, may possibly have been more sensitive than other parts of the region to abrupt climate changes. "

The aim of this study was to evaluate regional shrinkage within a light-cured composite during polymerization by microcomputed tomography and mechanical properties by nanoindentation in bonded or non-bonded class-I cavity. Methods Zirconium oxide spherical fillers (30 μm diameter) were added as markers to a composite resin, filled into a box-shaped class I cavity with or without a bonding agent. The marker fillers were traced in 3D scans obtained by micro-CT before and after polymerization using a software (TRI/3D-BON). The average hardness of the resin composites determined by nanoindentation at each 250 μm depth was plotted against depth. Results In the bonded cavity, the filler particles at the top region moved toward the bottom of cavity, but at deeper depths, the direction of vertical movement changed toward the top of cavity (irradiated surface). A significant linear regression was found between filler displacement and composite depth (R2 = 0.9761). In the unbounded cavity, all the fillers moved toward the light curing source, and a significant power-law regression was found between filler displacement and composite depth (R2 = 0.849). In both groups, the data scattering increased at regions deeper than 3.5 mm, where the hardness, representing degree of conversion of composite, significantly decreased compared to the surface region. Significance The magnitude and direction of regional polymerization shrinkage depends on boundary conditions, depth and conversion degree. Polymerization shrinkage effect is most significant at the deepest part of the cavity. The application of micro-CT combined with sophisticated image analysis is a novel approach to investigate shrinkage mechanisms of dental composites. "

Our specific objectives in this study were to determine winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) response to K fertilization on Haplic Luvisols in the North China Plain (NCP) as affected by conventional as well as high-yielding production practices. Four field experiments were conducted in the NCP. The factorial study compared three levels of K fertilization (K0 = no K; \{K1\} = medium K rate; \{K2\} = high K rate) and two levels of production practices: conventional (CP) and high yielding (HP). A significant positive wheat yield response to K fertilization was obtained under both \{CP\} and \{HP\} at all site-years. On average, K fertilization significantly increased all three yield components measured, namely kernel number per spike, spike number per hectare and kilo-grain weight. Overall, \{HP\} outperformed \{CP\} in terms of wheat grain and biomass yield. Nutrient use efficiency of N and P was increased by K application, especially under HP. Overall, \{HP\} surpassed \{CP\} with regard to partial factor productivity of N and K (PFPN and PFPK) across the four site-years, whereas the opposite trend was found for partial factor productivity of P (PFPP) due to increasing P input. Negative K balances were observed in all of the treatments in both years and under both production practices, especially under HP. Economic profits were achieved under both production practices, but there were no significant differences between \{CP\} and \{HP\} on average, across four site-years. Therefore, farmers who are planting wheat on Haplic Luvisols in the \{NCP\} must take account of the K fertility of their soils for sustainable crop production. "

A total of 158,555 reads from three metagenomic \{DNA\} replicates for each soil sample were classified into 1127 phylotypes, detected in triplicate and defined by 90% amino acid identity.

An urgent need therefore exists to budget key sinks of CH4, such as forests and grasslands. In this study, \{CH4\} uptake of forests and grasslands in China was first reviewed and then estimated based upon the review itself. Total uptake from the two \{CH4\} sinks were 1.323 Tg CH4 yr−1 in China (ranging from 0.567 to 2.078 Tg CH4 yr−1), lower than a previous estimate in China (2.56 Tg CH4 yr−1). Among the uptake, 0.650 Tg CH4 yr−1 (ranging from 0.168 to 1.132 Tg CH4 yr−1) was consumed by grasslands and 0.675 Tg CH4 yr−1 (ranging from 0.399 to 0.946 Tg CH4 yr−1) by forests. The largest \{CH4\} uptake of grasslands was found in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau High-Frigid Domain, which consumed 0.284 Tg CH4 yr−1, about 44% of the whole uptake of grasslands in China. The greatest \{CH4\} uptake (0.553 Tg CH4 yr−1) of forests took place in Eastern Humid and Semi-humid Domain of the country, which was about 82% of the total annual \{CH4\} uptake of forests in China. With forests and grasslands taken together, Eastern Humid and Semi-humid Domain was the largest \{CH4\} consumer, taking up about 0.715 Tg CH4 yr−1, accounting for 82% of the whole forest uptake and 25% of the whole grassland uptake in China. On the ecoregion scale, due to extensive forest distribution and longer growing season, Southern Asia monsoon broadleaf forest ecoregion was the greatest \{CH4\} uptake (0.320 Tg CH4 yr−1) of forests and grasslands in China, consuming more \{CH4\} than the Northeastern Arid and Semi-arid Domain combined.

However, there is limited data about carbon dynamics of alpine peatlands, like Zoige peatlands on the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau (QTP), which are sensitive to climate change and human disturbance. We studied the role of these peat deposits on the Zoige as a C reserve and sink by measuring peat depth, radiocarbon age and peat and C accumulation rates at 7 sites. The peat depths of the sample sites ranged from 0.20 to 6.0 m; the basal age on the plateau varied from 1635 to 14095 cal yr BP; the peat accumulation rates ranged from 0.12 to 0.85 mm yr−1, and the C accumulation rates from 5 to 48 g m−2 yr−1. Based on data of field studies and remote sensing, we regarded that with 3179 km2 of intact peatlands, about 1426 km2 of degraded peatlands, and the total area of Zoige peatlands was 4605 km2. The current peat C stock of Zoige peatlands was0.477 Pg (ranging from 0.206 to 0.672 Pg). We also estimated that peatlands covered an area of about 5091 km2on the \{QTP\} and sequestered 0.543 Pg C, 88% in Zoige and the rest in other parts of the plateau. Human activities, together with the ubiquitous warming on the plateau (temperature increased by 0.2 °C per decade over the past 50 years) not only shrank the area of intact peatlands, but also caused substantial carbon releasing from peatlands.

We synthesized flux and micrometeorological observations from 22 eddy covariance flux sites across China, and examined the carbon fluxes, evapotranspiration (ET), and water use efficiency (WUE) of terrestrial ecosystems at the annual scale. Our results show that annual carbon and water fluxes exhibited clear latitudinal patterns across sites. Both annual gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) declined with increasing latitude, leading to a declining pattern in net ecosystem productivity (NEP) with increasing latitude. Annual \{ET\} also generally declined with increasing latitude. The spatial patterns of annual carbon and water fluxes were mainly driven by annual temperature, precipitation, and growing season length. Carbon fluxes, ET, and water use efficiency (WUE) varied with vegetation type. Overall, forest and cropland sites had higher annual fluxes than grassland sites, and the annual fluxes of coastal wetland sites were similar to or slightly higher than those of forest sites. Annual \{WUE\} was associated with annual precipitation, GPP, and growing season length. Higher-productivity ecosystems (forests and coastal wetlands) also had higher \{WUE\} than lower-productivity ecosystems (grasslands and croplands). The strong relationships between annual \{GPP\} and \{ET\} demonstrated the coupling of the carbon and water cycles. Our results show that forest plantations had high annual \{NEP\} and WUE, and could provide larger carbon sequestration capacity than natural forests. The coastal salt marsh and mangrove ecosystems also had high carbon sequestration capacity. Efforts to strengthen China's terrestrial carbon sink should focus on ecosystems such as forest plantations in southern China where heat and water are ideal for maintaining high productivity. This strategy is especially important because efforts to increase carbon sequestration in areas of limited water may inadvertently contribute to the ongoing water crisis in northern China. "

Frequently, however, insufficient attention is paid to the historical development of \{NRM\} institutions. Instead, discussion largely focuses on models of economic efficiency at the expense of the cultural, historical, and ecological contexts within which institutions develop. Here we use the research program of historical ecology to explore the development, maintenance, and change of two contemporary fire management institutions in northern Australia and Colorado, USA, to demonstrate how social institutions and ecological systems change and resist change over time and how institutions interact across scales to negotiate contrasting goals and motivations. We argue that these \{NRM\} institutions are not strictly speaking evolutionary or adaptive, and that historical context is critical when evaluating how and why particular institutions and institutional relationships develop. As with ecosystems, the present characteristics of the \{NRM\} institutions are dependent on what has happened before and their efficacy can only be evaluated retrospectively. Therefore, an understanding of history is essential to questions of the desirability and feasibility of institutional change where such shifts are required from an ecological, social, or economic perspective. We further propose that institutional conflict arises from the differing goals and motives of resource management institutions at different scales. Our cases reveal that larger-scale institutions can be successful at achieving narrowly defined goals but often fall short of achieving socially desirable sustainable outcomes. Our findings support the use of narratives of community history, place, and being in considering the resilience and sustainability of social-ecological systems. We offer that historical ecology is complementary with institutional and economic approaches to the analysis of \{NRM\} institutions, and possesses a particular strength in linking ecology to the values and norms of small social groups.

Stakeholder involvement with participatory research and development programmes for farmers is an essential part of it. Currently, ecological engineering by habitat management and participatory programmes and mass media campaigns are developed to counteract the adverse effects of ongoing intensification of rice production in Southeast Asia. These schemes often suggest the establishment of flower strips. Flower strips are a common measure to promote biodiversity and ecosystem service conservation in industrialised countries, since they aesthetically enrich production landscapes and provide supplementary food resources and shelter for natural enemies and pollinators. We review management options for biological pest control, pollination and cultural services in rice production landscapes and evaluate the parallel development of participatory programmes and mass media campaigns for sustainable rice production. Biological pest control, pollination services and landscape aesthetics could benefit from the establishment of flower strips in rice production landscapes. However, more experimental studies are needed to test the benefits of different plant species, potential interactions between local and landscape scale and interactions between different ecosystem services. Rice farmers should better appreciate their benefits from regulating ecosystem services and should be involved in the development and implementation of ecological engineering. Mass media campaigns and participatory programmes can motivate farmers, but their efficiency needs to be tested in different regions. Combining participatory approaches and mass media campaigns with the establishment of flower strips and other beneficial habitats has potential to increase the sustainability of rice production in Asia.

Both drought stress and management factors (e.g., stand origin or reduced thinning) may induce decline by reducing the water available to trees but their relative importances have not been properly assessed. The role of stand origin – densely planted vs. naturally regenerated stands – as a decline driver can be assessed by comparing the growth and vigor responses to drought of similar natural vs. planted stands. Here, we compare these responses in natural and planted Black pine (Pinus nigra) stands located in southern Spain. We analyze how environmental factors – climatic (temperature and precipitation anomalies) and site conditions – and biotic factors – stand structure (age, tree size, density) and defoliation by the pine processionary moth – drive radial growth and crown condition at stand and tree levels. We also assess the climatic trends in the study area over the last 60 years. We use dendrochronology, linear mixed-effects models of basal area increment and structural equation models to determine how natural and planted stands respond to drought and current competition intensity. We observed that a temperature rise and a decrease in precipitation during the growing period led to increasing drought stress during the late 20th century. Trees from planted stands experienced stronger growth reductions and displayed more severe crown defoliation after severe droughts than those from natural stands. High stand density negatively drove growth and enhanced crown dieback, particularly in planted stands. Also pine processionary moth defoliation was more severe in the growth of natural than in planted stands but affected tree crown condition similarly in both stand types. In response to drought, sharp growth reduction and widespread defoliation of planted Mediterranean pine stands indicate that they are more vulnerable and less resilient to drought stress than natural stands. To mitigate forest decline of planted stands in xeric areas such as the Mediterranean Basin, less dense and more diverse stands should be created through selective thinning or by selecting species or provenances that are more drought tolerant.

Understanding local farmers’ land-use options in response to drought and policy intervention is crucial for future adaptation strategies. We assessed farmers’ land-use options and the socio-economic factors affecting decisions under drought and water policy scenarios using household surveys. From the total of 174 households surveyed, whether under a drought scenario or a drought scenario with water policy intervention, we found that respondents preferred land-use options focusing on four choices: keep current pattern; keep crops, but reduce areas; abandon farming; rent out farmlands. Findings suggest that there is a growing pattern of agricultural abandonment for urban jobs as a strategy to cope with climate change impacts. The results identified a total of five socio-economic factors that have a significant effect on the households’ land-use options. These factors are important for the households’ land-use decisions and could prevent people from altering their livelihood strategies. We provide some specific recommendations which could enhance local households’ potential adaptation to drought, as well as for effective management of water to prevent potential conflicts in the design or implementation of water policy with the local community.

abstract = "Abstract One of the strategies to ensure energy security and to mitigate climate change in the European Union (EU) is the establishment and the use of short rotation woody crops (SRWCs) for the production of renewable energy. \{SRWCs\} are cultivated in the \{EU\} under different management systems. Addressing the energy security problems through \{SRWCs\} requires management systems that maximize the net energy yield per unit land area. We assembled and evaluated on-farm data from within the EU, (i) to understand the relationship between the \{SRWC\} yields and spatial distribution of precipitation, as well as the relationship between \{SRWC\} yield and the planting density, and (ii) to investigate whether extensively managed \{SRWC\} systems are more energy efficient than their intensively managed counterparts. We found that \{SRWC\} yield ranged from 1.3 to 24 t ha−1 y−1 (mean 9.3±4.2 t ha−1 y−1) across sites. We looked for, but did not find a relationship between yield and annual precipitation as well as between yield and planting density. The energy inputs of extensively managed \{SRWC\} systems ranged from 3 to 8 \{GJ\} ha−1 y−1 whereas the energy ratio (i.e. energy output to energy input ratio) varied from 9 to 29. Although energy inputs (3–16 \{GJ\} ha−1y−1) were larger in most cases than those of extensively managed \{SRWC\} systems, intensively managed \{SRWC\} systems in the \{EU\} had higher energy ratios, i.e. between 15 and 62. The low energy ratio of extensively managed \{SRWC\} systems reflected their lower biomass yield per unit area. Switching from intensively managed \{SRWC\} systems to extensively managed ones thus creates an energy gap, and will require more arable land to be brought into production to compensate for the yield loss. Consequently, extensification is not the most appropriate path to the success of the wide scale deployment of \{SRWC\} for bioenergy production in the EU. "

abstract = "Land use change, natural disturbance, and climate change directly alter ecosystem productivity and carbon stock level. The estimation of ecosystem carbon dynamics depends on the quality of land cover change data and the effectiveness of the ecosystem models that represent the vegetation growth processes and disturbance effects. We used the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS) and a set of 30- to 60-m resolution fire and land cover change data to examine the carbon changes of California's forests, shrublands, and grasslands. Simulation results indicate that during 1951–2000, the net primary productivity (NPP) increased by 7%, from 72.2 to 77.1 Tg C yr−1 (1 teragram = 1012 g), mainly due to \{CO2\} fertilization, since the climate hardly changed during this period. Similarly, heterotrophic respiration increased by 5%, from 69.4 to 73.1 Tg C yr−1, mainly due to increased forest soil carbon and temperature. Net ecosystem production (NEP) was highly variable in the 50-year period but on average equalled 3.0 Tg C yr−1 (total of 149 Tg C). As with NEP, the net biome production (NBP) was also highly variable but averaged −0.55 Tg C yr−1 (total of –27.3 Tg C) because \{NBP\} in the 1980s was very low (–5.34 Tg C yr−1). During the study period, a total of 126 Tg carbon were removed by logging and land use change, and 50 Tg carbon were directly removed by wildland fires. For carbon pools, the estimated total living upper canopy (tree) biomass decreased from 928 to 834 Tg C, and the understory (including shrub and grass) biomass increased from 59 to 63 Tg C. Soil carbon and dead biomass carbon increased from 1136 to 1197 Tg C. Our analyses suggest that both natural and human processes have significant influence on the carbon change in California. During 1951–2000, climate interannual variability was the key driving force for the large interannual changes of ecosystem carbon source and sink at the state level, while logging and fire were the dominant driving forces for carbon balances in several specific ecoregions. From a long-term perspective, \{CO2\} fertilization plays a key role in maintaining higher NPP. However, our study shows that the increase in C sequestration by \{CO2\} fertilization is largely offset by logging/land use change and wildland fires. "

The plot data are from the \{USDA\} Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program. To scale these plot data to maps, we developed models relating field-measured response variables to plot attributes serving as the predictor variables. The plot attributes came from intersecting plot coordinates with geospatial datasets. Consequently, these models serve as mapping models. The geospatial predictor variables included Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS)-derived image composites and percent tree cover; land cover proportions and other data from the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD); topographic variables; monthly and annual climate parameters; and other ancillary variables. We segmented the mapping models for the U.S. into 65 ecologically similar mapping zones, plus Alaska and Puerto Rico. First, we developed a forest mask by modeling the forest vs. nonforest assignment of field plots as functions of the predictor layers using classification trees in See5©. Secondly, forest biomass models were built within the predicted forest areas using tree-based algorithms in Cubist©. To validate the models, we compared field-measured with model-predicted forest/nonforest classification and biomass from an independent test set, randomly selected from available plot data for each mapping zone. The estimated proportion of correctly classified pixels for the forest mask ranged from 0.79 in Puerto Rico to 0.94 in Alaska. For biomass, model correlation coefficients ranged from a high of 0.73 in the Pacific Northwest, to a low of 0.31 in the Southern region. There was a tendency in all regions for these models to over-predict areas of small biomass and under-predict areas of large biomass, not capturing the full range in variability. Map-based estimates of forest area and forest biomass compared well with traditional plot-based estimates for individual states and for four scales of spatial aggregation. Variable importance analyses revealed that MODIS-derived information could contribute more predictive power than other classes of information when used in isolation. However, the true contribution of each variable is confounded by high correlations. Consequently, excluding any one class of variables resulted in only small effects on overall map accuracy. An estimate of total C pools in live forest biomass of U.S. forests, derived from the nationwide biomass map, also compared well with previously published estimates. "

Eddy covariance (EC) flux towers measure continuous ecosystem-level exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) and provide a promising way to estimate GPP. We used the measurements from 32 \{EC\} sites to examine the performance of a light use efficiency model (i.e., EC-LUE) at various ecosystem types, including 23 sites in China and 9 sites in adjacent areas with the similar climate environments. No significant systematic error was found in the EC-LUE model predictions, which explained 79% and 62% of the \{GPP\} variation at the validation sites with \{C3\} and \{C4\} vegetation, respectively. Regional patterns of \{GPP\} at a spatial resolution of 10 km × 10 km from 2000 to 2009 were determined using the \{MERRA\} (Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications) reanalysis dataset and \{MODIS\} (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). China's terrestrial \{GPP\} decreased from southeast toward the northwest, with the highest values occurring over tropical forests areas, and the lowest values in dry regions. The annual \{GPP\} of land in China varied between 5.63 Pg C and 6.39 Pg C, with a mean value of 6.04 Pg C, which accounted for 4.90–6.29% of the world's total terrestrial GPP. The \{GPP\} densities of most vegetation types in China such as evergreen needleleaf forests, deciduous needleleaf forests, mixed forests, woody savannas, and permanent wetlands were much higher than the respective global \{GPP\} densities. However, a high proportion of sparsely vegetated area in China resulted in the overall low GPP. The inter-annual variability in \{GPP\} was significantly influenced by air temperature (R2 = 0.66, P &lt; 0.05), precipitation (R2 = 0.71, P &lt; 0.05), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (R2 = 0.83, P &lt; 0.05), respectively.

Milk protein yield (MkP) was calculated from milk yield and protein concentration. \{MP\} was estimated from dietary ingredient composition and a feedstuff database of \{CP\} degradability properties and ruminal fermentable energy concentration. \{MPl\} was estimated with a factorial method by subtracting \{MP\} used for maintenance, which was the sum of scurf (0.2 g/kg BW0.6), endogenous urinary (1.03 g/kg BW0.75) and metabolic fecal \{CP\} losses (2.67% \{DM\} intake) divided by an efficiency of use of \{MP\} for maintenance of 1.0. Also, \{MP\} was adjusted for \{BW\} change (14.3% protein), assuming an efficiency of \{MP\} use for protein accretion of 0.59 and that mobilized tissue protein was used for lactation with the same efficiency as \{MP\} from the diet or microbial cells. The equation for the regression of \{MPl\} (g/day) against MkP (g/day) was: MPl=15.2 (S.E.=7.77)+1.30 (S.E.=0.090)×MkP (n=163,adjusted-R2=0.56); the intercept was not different from zero (P&gt;0.05). The slope of a no-intercept equation (regression line forced through the origin) was 1.45 (S.E.=0.033). In conclusion, these results suggest a \{MPl\} requirement for goats of 1.45 g/g of MkP or a milk protein efficiency of 0.69. Because of the approach employed, application of this \{MPl\} requirement should not include provision of additional \{MP\} as a safety factor. With the large number of observations in this database, this requirement estimate should be of value in expressing protein needs and predicting performance of lactating goats, although future research to refine assumptions may improve accuracy.

Published \{CP\} degradation properties of feedstuffs and proportions of dietary ingredients were used to estimate \{MP\} intake (MPI, g/day), which was regressed against ADG, with both variables scaled by BW0.75. Goats were classified as meat (≥50% Boer; 60 observations), dairy (selected for milk production; 129 observations) and indigenous (160 observations) biotypes. Because of differences (P&lt;0.01) among biotypes in slopes, separate regressions were initially performed—meat: MPI=2.55(S.E.=0.360)+(0.441(S.E.=0.0276)×ADG) (n=58;R2=0.82); dairy: MPI=2.83(S.E.=0.344)+(0.299(S.E.=0.0238)×ADG) (n=123;R2=0.57); and indigenous: MPI=3.23(S.E.=0.212)+(0.281(S.E.=0.0304)×ADG) (n=152;R2=0.36). Intercepts did not differ among biotypes (P=0.37), but the slope for meat goats differed (P&lt;0.01) from those for dairy and indigenous goats; therefore, data sets for dairy and indigenous goats were pooled and split into development (n=150) and evaluation (n=125) subsets. Using the equation derived from the development data subset for dairy and indigenous goats (i.e., MPI=3.14(S.E.=0.189)+(0.285(S.E.=0.0168)×ADG) (n=144;R2=0.67)), \{MPI\} for the evaluation subset was predicted; regressing observed against predicted \{MPI\} of the evaluation data subset resulted in an intercept and slope not different from 0 and 1, respectively (P&gt;0.05). The equation from the development subset for dairy and indigenous goats was compared with the equation from the meat goat data set; there was a difference (P&lt;0.01) in slopes but not in intercepts (P=0.25). Therefore, a dummy variable (D=1 for meat goats and 0 otherwise) was used to develop a common intercept equation: MPI=3.07(S.E.=0.165)+(0.290(S.E.=0.0150)×ADG)+(0.114(S.E.=0.0162)×D×ADG) (n=202;R2=0.75). In conclusion, based on regression of \{MPI\} against ADG, \{MPm\} was 3.07 g/kg BW0.75 for all biotypes of growing goats, and \{MPg\} was 0.404 and 0.290 g/g \{ADG\} for meat and other (dairy and indigenous) goats, respectively.

Experiments entailed comparative slaughter, respiration calorimetry or \{CO2\} entry rate techniques. Goats were of eight breeds and five physiological states (preweaning; growing; mature and non-lactating; early and mid-pregnancy; and lactating). Assuming that heat increment was 40% of total heat energy, unweighted, and weighted (number of observations per treatment mean) log–log regressions (n = 74 following removal of observations to increase explained variation) of \{FHP\} against \{BW\} resulted in \{FHP\} (kJ) = 299 × BW0.762 (R2 = 0.82) and 244 × BW0.826 (R2 = 0.75), respectively.

The slope and intercept of a regression of recovered energy (RE) against \{ME\} intake (MEI) for preweaning goats differed (P &lt; 0.01) from those for other physiological states. A linear regression analysis of \{RE\} on \{MEI\} (both kJ/kg BW0.75) was conducted with the remaining 71 observations, after removing two observations with \{SD\} greater than 2.5 residual SD.

Predicted \{DM\} intake (DMIP) including an adjustment (DMIAP) for the ratio of ADG:FCM (ADGFCM) was: DMI=0.0964 (S.E.=0.0704)+(0.9334 (S.E.=0.9314)×DMIP)−(0.1237 (S.E.=0.05923)×ADGFCM) (R2=0.84;RMSE=0.2187;n=191). Mean k, estimated from a random development data set, resulted in unbiased prediction of intake for an evaluation data set without observations removed. Assumptions for Angora goats that differed from lactating goats were efficiency of \{ME\} use for tissue gain (TG; kg/day): 0.006+(0.0423×MEC); efficiency of use of \{ME\} (dietary and mobilized tissue) for clean fiber gain (FG): 0.151; TEC=4.972+(0.3274×kg BW); MEm: 0.473 MJ/kg BW0.75; \{ME\} used for FG: FG×157 MJ/kg; and all mobilized tissue energy used for FG. Mean k for Angora goats was 0.525 (S.E.=0.0112), and prediction accuracy was improved by adjusting for dietary \{CP\} concentration (PTCP, % DM): DMI=−0.1607 (S.E.=0.11430)+(0.8227 (S.E.=0.10851)×DMIP)+(0.0199 (S.E.=0.00697)×PTCP) (R2=0.65;RMSE=0.1239;n=54). Assumptions for growing goats included: kg: 0.006+(0.0423×MEC); efficiency of use of mobilized tissue energy for maintenance: km; and MEmREQ: 0.489, 0.580 and 0.489 MJ/kg BW0.75 for meat, dairy and indigenous goats, respectively. After removing observations with residuals greater than 2×RMSE, k was 0.634 (S.E.=0.0020). Prediction accuracy was improved by adjusting for ratios of \{ADG\} to \{BW\} (ADGBW), BW0.75 (ADGMBW) and ADGMBW2: DMI=−0.0047 (S.E.=0.1854)+(0.9637 (S.E.=0.04928)×DMIP)−(70.27 (S.E.=23.534)×ADGBW)+(38.71 (S.E.=12.224)×ADGMBW)−(243.4 (S.E.=121.73)×ADGMBW2) (R2=0.88;RMSE=0.1030;n=266). Mean k estimated from a random development data set resulted in unbiased prediction of intake for an evaluation data set without observations removed. Assumptions for mature goats were the same as those for growing goats except for a \{MEmREQ\} of 0.462 MJ/kg BW0.75. k was 0.632 (S.E.=0.00448), and prediction accuracy was improved by adjusting for PTCP, \{ADGBW\} and ADGMBW: DMI=−0.1241 (S.E.=0.07374)+(0.7915 (S.E.=0.06911)×DMIP)+(0.0214 (S.E.=0.00381)×PTCP)−(535.2 (S.E.=66.35)×ADGBW)+(247.3 (S.E.=29.53)×ADGMBW) (R2=0.85;RMSE=0.1537;n=99). Because of the relatively large number of observations in this study, these methods should be useful for predicting voluntary intake of different diets by a variety of goats in or near thermoneutral conditions fed in pens or stalls.

The \{ME\} requirement for maintenance (MEm) was 485, 489, 580, 489 and 462 kJ/kg BW0.75, and the \{ME\} requirement for gain (MEg) was 13.4, 23.1, 23.1, 19.8 and 28.5 kJ/g \{ADG\} for preweaning, growing meat (≥Boer), growing dairy, growing indigenous and mature goats (indigenous and dairy), respectively. The \{MEm\} of mature Angora goats from multiple regression analysis (at 0 tissue gain and clean fiber growth) was 473 kJ/kg BW0.75; \{ME\} requirements for tissue gain and clean fiber growth were 37.2 and 157 kJ/g, respectively. A factorial approach with linear regression was used to determine the dietary \{ME\} requirement for lactation of 5224 kJ/kg 4% fat-corrected milk, corresponding to an efficiency of \{ME\} use for lactation of 0.59. Metabolizable protein (MP) required for maintenance (MPm) by mature meat, dairy and indigenous goats was determined as the sum of metabolic fecal (0.0267 g/g \{DM\} intake for diets not containing appreciable browse), endogenous urinary (1.031 g/kg BW0.75) and scurf \{CP\} losses (0.2 g/kg BW0.6), with an assumed efficiency of \{MP\} use for maintenance protein of 1.0. Based on linear regression of \{MP\} intake against ADG, for growing goats \{MPm\} was 3.07 g/kg BW0.75; \{MP\} required for \{ADG\} (MPg) was 0.290 g/g \{ADG\} for dairy and indigenous goats and 0.404 g/g \{ADG\} for meat goats. The \{MP\} requirement for lactation was 1.45 g/g milk protein, equivalent to a milk protein efficiency of 0.69. The \{MPm\} of growing and mature Angora goats from multiple regression analysis (at 0 tissue gain and clean fiber growth) was 3.35 g/kg BW0.75, and \{MP\} requirements for tissue gain and clean fiber growth were 0.281 and 1.65 g/g, respectively. Identified areas of research that would yield knowledge allowing development of more accurate estimates of nutrient requirements include composition of accreted and mobilized tissue, effects of stage of maturity and nutritional plane on maintenance energy requirements, energy expenditure due to grazing activity, conditions influencing ruminally undegraded protein and efficiencies of \{MP\} utilization.

abstract = "Data from 44 studies with 243 treatment mean observations, representing 2476 goats in various stages of lactation, were used to estimate the requirement and efficiency of use of \{ME\} for milk production. Development and evaluation data subsets comprised, respectively, 68 and 32% of observations. \{ME\} intake was also adjusted for energy lost in excretion of excess nitrogenous compounds in urine (MEExN), as 62.21 kJ/g of N intake above endogenous urinary N (0.165 g/kg BW0.75). Adjusted \{ME\} intake was partitioned into that used for maintenance and activity in pen or stall settings (MEm; by two methods), \{ME\} secreted in milk and \{ME\} gained as BW. For Method 1, \{MEm\} = 1.1×315 kJ/kg BW0.75/km, with km or efficiency of \{ME\} use for maintenance = 0.503 + (0.019×ME,MJ/kg DM). For Method 2, estimates of \{MEm\} in a companion study for dairy (501.3 kJ/kg BW0.75) and other goat biotypes (422.7 kJ/kg BW0.75) were used. When \{BW\} increased, \{ME\} intake was adjusted for tissue accretion (efficiency = 0.75) to derive dietary \{ME\} used in milk secretion (MEl-d). Milk yield was corrected to 4% fat [4% FCM;MJ/kg = 1.4694 + (0.4025 × % milk fat)]. For does decreasing in BW, \{FCM\} from the diet (FCMd) was estimated by adjusting for use of mobilized tissue energy (23.9 kJ/g; efficiency = 0.84). No particular equations explained considerably more variability in observed \{FCM\} or \{NE\} for lactation than other equations. Based on no-intercept regressions (MEl-d against FCMd) with Method 1, the dietary \{ME\} requirement for lactation was 4598 (S.E. = 106.6) and 4937 (S.E. = 106.5) kJ/kg \{FCM\} with and without adjustment for MEExN, respectively. With Method 2 and no-intercept equations, the dietary \{ME\} requirement for lactation was 4882 (S.E. = 105.2) and 5224 (S.E. = 105.8) kJ/kg \{FCM\} with and without adjustment for MEExN, respectively. Prediction accuracy was similar between methods and improved slightly by correction for ADG. In conclusion, with the large amount of data employed in this study, these estimates and this factorial approach seem useful to predict energy requirements of lactating goats, with potential for future enhancements based on research of the factorial approach assumptions.

Goats were categorized as dairy, meat (≥ 50% Boer) or indigenous biotypes. The preweaning database included 98 treatment means representing 1016 goats and the growing goat database consisted of 333 treatment means. Because of differences among biotypes of growing goats in intercepts and slopes (P &lt; 0.05), separate regressions were performed. The meat subset included 60 observations from 11 publications, representing 548 goats; the dairy subset had 116 observations from 25 publications with 1851 goats; and the indigenous subset consisted of 157 observations from 34 publications and 1024 goats. Dairy and indigenous subsets were randomly split into independent sets for equation development and evaluation. The mature goat database included 69 treatment means from 23 publications and represented 495 goats. Small numbers of observations removed after initial regressions to improve fit did not markedly alter intercepts or slopes. Equations were as follows: preweaning: \{MEI\} (kJ/kg BW0.75) = 484.6 (S.E. = 61.46) + (13.37 [S.E. = 1.95] × \{ADG\} [g/kg BW0.75]) (n = 61; \{R2\} = 0.44); meat: \{MEI\} (kJ/kg BW0.75) = 457.0 (S.E. = 22.30) + (25.23 [S.E. = 1.74] × \{ADG\} [g/kg BW0.75]) (n = 57; \{R2\} = 0.79); dairy: \{MEI\} (kJ/kg BW0.75) = 573.7 (S.E. = 46.20) + (23.56 [S.E. = 3.10] × \{ADG\} [g/kg BW0.75]) (n = 56; \{R2\} = 0.52); indigenous: \{MEI\} (kJ/kg BW0.75) = 500.0 (S.E. = 11.94) + (18.59 [S.E. = 1.64] × \{ADG\} [g/kg BW0.75]) (n = 76; \{R2\} = 0.63); and mature: \{MEI\} (kJ/kg BW0.75) = 462.2 (S.E. = 24.95) + (28.52 (S.E. = 5.05) × \{ADG\} [g/kg BW0.75]) [n = 69; \{R2\} = 0.32]. Intercepts and slopes from regressions of observed against predicted \{MEI\} with evaluation data sets, based on equations for preweaning and growing dairy and indigenous goats, were not different from 0 to 1, respectively. When final equations for the different growing goat biotypes were tested, the intercept for dairy goats differed (P &lt; 0.05) from that of meat and indigenous goats, and the slope for indigenous goats tended (P = 0.16) to differ from that of meat and dairy goats. Therefore, the following dummy variable equation was obtained (I1 = 1 for dairy and 0 for others; \{I2\} = 1 for indigenous and 0 for others): \{MEI\} (kJ/kg BW0.75) = 488.5 (S.E. = 14.4) + (91.5 (S.E. = 18.69) × I1) + (23.09 (S.E. = 1.24) × \{ADG\} [g/kg BW0.75]) − (3.28 (S.E. = 1.98) × \{ADG\} [g/kg BW0.75] × I2) [n = 189; \{R2\} = 0.74]. In summary, based on treatment mean observations from available publications and regression of \{MEI\} against ADG, \{MEm\} was 485, 489, 580, 489 and 462 kJ/kg BW0.75, and \{MEg\} was 13.4, 23.1, 23.1, 19.8 and 28.5 kJ/g \{ADG\} for preweaning, growing meat, growing dairy, growing indigenous and mature goats, respectively.

This will affect ecosystem processes and the functioning of semi natural and natural ecosystems in many parts of the world. However, as various ecosystem processes may be affected to a different extent, balances between different ecosystem processes as well as between different ecosystems may shift and lead to major unpredicted changes. In this study four European shrubland ecosystems along a north–south temperature gradient were experimentally warmed by a novel nighttime warming technique. Biogeochemical cycling of both carbon and nitrogen was affected at the colder sites with increased carbon uptake for plant growth as well as increased carbon loss through soil respiration. Carbon uptake by plant growth was more sensitive to warming than expected from the temperature response across the sites while carbon loss through soil respiration reacted to warming in agreement with the overall \{Q10\} and response functions to temperature across the sites. Opposite to carbon, the nitrogen mineralization was relatively insensitive to the temperature increase and was mainly affected by changes in soil moisture. The results suggest that C and N cycles respond asymmetrically to warming, which may lead to progressive nitrogen limitation and thereby acclimation in plant production. This further suggests that in many temperate zones nitrogen deposition has to be accounted for, not only with respect to the impact on water quality through increased nitrogen leaching where N deposition is high, but also in predictions of carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems under future climatic conditions. Finally the results indicate that on the short term the above-ground processes are more sensitive to temperature changes than the below ground processes. "

Robust assessment of present-day water cycle dynamics at continental to global scales is confounded by shortcomings in the observed record. Modeled assessments also yield conflicting results which are linked to differences in model structure and simulation protocol. Here we compare simulated gridded (1° spatial resolution) runoff from six terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs), seven reanalysis products, and one gridded surface station product in the contiguous United States (CONUS) from 2001 to 2005. We evaluate the consistency of these 14 estimates with stream gauge data, both as depleted flow and corrected for net withdrawals (2005 only), at the \{CONUS\} and water resource region scale, as well as examining similarity across \{TBMs\} and reanalysis products at the grid cell scale. Mean runoff across all simulated products and regions varies widely (range: 71 to 356 mm yr−1) relative to observed continental-scale runoff (209 or 280 mm yr−1 when corrected for net withdrawals). Across all 14 products 8 exhibit Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency values in excess of 0.8 and three are within 10% of the observed value. Region-level mismatch exhibits a weak pattern of overestimation in western and underestimation in eastern regions—although two products are systematically biased across all regions—and largely scales with water use. Although gridded composite \{TBM\} and reanalysis runoff show some regional similarities, individual product values are highly variable. At the coarse scales used here we find that progress in better constraining simulated runoff requires standardized forcing data and the explicit incorporation of human effects (e.g., water withdrawals by source, fire, and land use change).

abstract = "Cysticercosis caused by the zoonotic pork tapeworm Taenia solium is emerging as a constraint for the nutritional and economic well-being of small-holder farming communities in many underdeveloped areas of Southeast Asia. It occurs mainly in impoverished regions with inadequate sanitation, poor pig management practices and lack of meat inspection and control. Neurocysticercosis, the most serious form of the disease, is considered the most common parasitic infection of the human nervous system and the most frequent preventable cause of epilepsy in the developing world. Although theoretically easy to control and declared eradicable, T. solium taeniosis/cysticercosis remains a neglected disease. There is a lack of information and awareness of the burden and transmission of the disease at the regional and global level, partially explained by the unavailability of good quality diagnostic tools in field-applicable formats. These factors are further compounded by a lack of validated simple and sustainable intervention packages as part of integrated helminth control programmes. To date, T. solium taeniosis/cysticercosis has not been eliminated from any region by a specific programme in Southeast Asia, and no national control programmes are yet in place except in parts of the People's Republic of China. The presence, distribution, public health importance and economic relevance of cysticercosis need to be better documented in Southeast Asia in order to bring it to the attention of affected communities, decision-makers and funding bodies. A number of proven cost-effective intervention tools for combating cysticercosis appear to be available but need to be field validated. The Regional Network for Asian Schistosomiasis and Other Helminth Zoonoses (RNAS+) serves as an important regional ‘driving force’ for managing research, capacity building, knowledge and stakeholder engagement essential for controlling cysticercosis in the Southeast Asian region while ensuring that research efforts are integrated with regional needs for surveillance and control.

The suborder Pleosporineae is emended to include four families, viz. Didymellaceae, Leptosphaeriaceae, Phaeosphaeriaceae and Pleosporaceae. In addition, two new families are introduced, i.e. Amniculicolaceae and Lentitheciaceae. Pleomassariaceae is treated as a synonym of Melanommataceae, and new circumscriptions of Lophiostomataceae s. str., Massarinaceae and Lophiotrema are proposed. Familial positions of Entodesmium and Setomelanomma in Phaeosphaeriaceae, Neophaeosphaeria in Leptosphaeriaceae, Leptosphaerulina, Macroventuria and Platychora in Didymellaceae, Pleomassaria in Melanommataceae and Bimuria, Didymocrea, Karstenula and Paraphaeosphaeria in Montagnulaceae are clarified. Both ecological and morphological characters show varying degrees of phylogenetic significance. Pleosporales is most likely derived from a saprobic ancestor with fissitunicate asci containing conspicuous ocular chambers and apical rings.

Thirteen separate mountain blocks comprise the Eastern Arc, supporting around 3300 km2 of sub-montane, montane and upper montane forest, less than 30% of the estimated original forested area. At least 96 vertebrate species are endemic, split as follows: 10 mammal, 19 bird, 29 reptile and 38 amphibian species. This includes four endemic or nearly endemic species of primate – the Sanje Mangabey, the Iringa Red Colobus, the Mountain Galago and the new Kipunji monkey that forms its own monotypic genus. A further 71 vertebrate species are near-endemic. At least 800 vascular plant species are endemic, almost 10% of these being trees. These endemics include the majority of the species of African violet –Saintpaulia, a well-known flowering plant in Western households. An additional 32 species of bryophytes are also endemic. Many hundreds of invertebrates are also likely to be endemic, with data for butterflies, millipedes and dragonflies indicating potential trends in importance. Seventy-one of the endemic or near-endemic vertebrates are threatened by extinction (8 critical, 27 endangered, 36 vulnerable), with an additional seven wide ranging threatened species. Hundreds of plant species are also threatened. Most Eastern Arc endemics are closed-forest specialists and comprise taxa with an ancient history and those of more recent origin, including some possessing ancient affinities with taxa from West Africa, Madagascar, and even South America and Southeast Asia. Mountain block prioritisation for biodiversity conservation shows that Udzungwas, East Usambaras and Ulugurus are the most important blocks, with other important blocks being the Ngurus and West Usambaras. Rankings are correlated closely with the area of remaining forest. Most of the remaining forest is found within nearly 150 Government Forest Reserves, with 106 of these managed nationally for water catchment, biodiversity and soil conservation and where forest exploitation is not allowed. Outside these areas most forest has been cleared, except in small village burial/sacred sites, a few Village Forest Reserves, and inaccessible areas. In most Eastern Arc Mountains the local populations have not encroached beyond the reserve boundaries to develop farms, but forest resources within the boundaries are used for fuel and building materials and some forests are heavily degraded. Fire is also a problem as it enters and destroys forests during the dry seasons. The future of the biodiversity on the Eastern Arc Mountains is closely tied to management policies and capacity of the Tanzania Forestry and Beekeeping Division, Tanzania National Parks Authority, and Kenya Forest Department. Supporting these agencies in their mandated job is an essential conservation investment over the longer term. "

Historical cohort studies have since 1990s consistently reported an association between the level of chromosomal aberrations (CA) in peripheral lymphocytes of healthy subjects and the risk of cancer. Only in few cases, have these results been transformed into a regulatory tool for improving occupational safety. The cytogenetic surveillance program adopted for more than two decades in the Republic of Croatia is one of these few examples. Croatian workers exposed to genotoxic agents were systematically screened for CA, to identify occupational settings needing a priority intervention. Significant increases of mean \{CA\} frequency were observed in groups exposed to ionizing radiation, chemical agents, and mixed exposures when compared with a group of unexposed referents. \{CA\} data on 736 men and 584 women, monitored between 1987 and 2000, have been associated with cancer incidence. Although the small size of the cohort did not allow for reaching statistical significance, the medium tertile of the \{CA\} frequency distribution was associated with a doubling of cancer incidence rate ratio (IRR = 2.40; 95% \{CI\} 0.85–6.77) when compared with the lowest tertile. For chromosome-type CA, \{IRR\} was non-significantly increased for both the medium (IRR 1.53, 95% \{CI\} 0.58–3.99) and high categories (IRR 1.69; 95% \{CI\} 0.61–4.72).

Moreover, there is currently no global forest map that is consistent with forest statistics from \{FAO\} (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). By combining these diverse data sources into a single forest cover product, it is possible to produce a global forest map that is more accurate than the individual input layers and to produce a map that is consistent with \{FAO\} statistics. In this paper we applied geographically weighted regression (GWR) to integrate eight different forest products into three global hybrid forest cover maps at a 1 km resolution for the reference year 2000. Input products included global land cover and forest maps at varying resolutions from 30 m to 1 km, mosaics of regional land use/land cover products where available, and the \{MODIS\} Vegetation Continuous Fields product. The \{GWR\} was trained using crowdsourced data collected via the Geo-Wiki platform and the hybrid maps were then validated using an independent dataset collected via the same system. Three different hybrid maps were produced: two consistent with \{FAO\} statistics, one at the country and one at the regional level, and a “best guess” forest cover map that is independent of FAO. Independent validation showed that the “best guess” hybrid product had the best overall accuracy of 93% when compared with the individual input datasets.

Samples were collected over seasonal cycles relatively close to the river mouths. Here we report the lignin phenol and p-hydroxybenzene composition of Arctic river \{DOC\} in order to identify major sources of carbon. Arctic river \{DOC\} represents an important carbon conduit linking the large pools of organic carbon in the Arctic/Subarctic watersheds to the Arctic Ocean. Most of the annual lignin discharge (&gt;75%) occurs during the two month of spring freshet with extremely high lignin concentrations and a lignin phenol composition indicative of fresh vegetation from boreal forests. The three large Siberian rivers, Lena, Yenisei, and Ob, which also have the highest proportion of forests within their watersheds, contribute about 90% of the total lignin discharge to the Arctic Ocean. The composition of river \{DOC\} is also characterized by elevated levels of p-hydroxybenzenes, particularly during the low flow season, which indicates a larger contribution from mosses and peat bogs. The lignin composition was strongly related to the average 14C-age of \{DOC\} supporting the abundance of young, boreal-vegetation-derived leachates during spring flood, and older, soil-, peat-, and wetland-derived \{DOC\} during groundwater dominated low flow conditions, particularly in the Ob and Yukon Rivers. We observed significant differences in \{DOC\} concentration and composition between the rivers over the seasonal cycles with the Mackenzie River being the most unique, the Lena River being similar to the Yenisei, and the Yukon being most similar to the Ob. The observed relationship between the lignin phenol composition and watershed characteristics suggests that \{DOC\} discharge from these rivers could increase in a warmer climate under otherwise undisturbed conditions.

Yet, to what extent the projects are guided by ecological restoration principles remains largely unknown. To analyse this issue, we built an on-line survey addressed to restoration practitioners. We analysed 36 restoration projects, mostly from drylands (86%). The projects used mainly soil from local sources. The need to comply with legislation was more important as a restoration motive for European Union (EU) than for non-EU countries, while public opinion and health had a greater importance in the latter. Non-EU countries relied more on non-native plant species than \{EU\} countries, thus deviating from ecological restoration guidelines. Nursery-grown plants used were mostly of local or regional provenance, whilst seeds were mostly of national provenance. Unexpected restoration results (e.g. inadequate biodiversity) were reported for 50% of the projects and restoration success was never evaluated in 22%. Long term evaluation (&gt; 6 years) was only performed in 31% of cases, and based primarily on plant diversity and cover. The use of non-native species and species of exogenous provenances may: i) entail the loss of local genetic and functional trait diversity, critical to cope with drought, particularly under the predicted climate change scenarios, and ii) lead to unexpected competition with native species and/or negatively impact local biotic interactions. Absent or inappropriate monitoring may prevent the understanding of restoration trajectories, precluding adaptive management strategies, often crucial to create functional ecosystems able to provide ecosystem services. The overview of ecological restoration projects in the Mediterranean Basin revealed high variability among practices and highlighted the need for improved scientific assistance and information exchange, greater use of native species of local provenance, and more long-term monitoring and evaluation, including functional and ecosystem services' indicators, to improve and spread the practice of ecological restoration.

The observed apparent carbon accumulation rate over the past 50 years was 75 (35–123) g C m−2 yr−1, nearly four times that of 19 (7–30) g C m−2 yr−1over the whole Holocene. With decomposition history included in consideration by using modeling approaches, the average expected peat carbon accumulation rate was still nearly 1.6 times that of the modeled net carbon uptake rate of peats accumulated over the whole Holocene, though exceptions were found for Denahequ and Hongyuan peat cores with extremely low water table levels. The newly accumulated peat carbon of the Zoige Plateau amounted to 0.4 Tg C yr−1 (1 Tg = 1012 g) during recent decades. Overall, the effect of climate warming on recent C accumulation of peatlands on the Zoige Plateau is dependent on their water conditions. The peat C storage on the alpine Plateau is threatened by human activities (drainage) and continuous climate change with increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation which cause dryness of peatlands.

Can this parameterization scheme be replaced with a vegetation-invariant set of parameters that can maintain or increase model applicability by reducing errors introduced from the uncertainty of land cover classification? Based on the measurements of ecosystem carbon fluxes from 168 globally distributed sites in a range of vegetation types, we examined the predictive capacity of seven light use efficiency (LUE) models. Two model experiments were conducted: (i) a constant set of parameters for various vegetation types and (ii) vegetation-specific parameters. The results showed no significant differences in model performance in simulating \{GPP\} while using both set of parameters. These results indicate that a universal of set of parameters, which is independent of vegetation cover type and characteristics can be adopted in prevalent \{LUE\} models. Availability of this well tested and universal set of parameters would help to improve the accuracy and applicability of \{LUE\} models in various biomes and geographic regions. "

Different bioactive constituents derived from bark extracts from 20 tree populations sampled throughout the species’ natural range in Africa were studied by means of GC–MSD. The average concentration [mg/kg w/w] in increasing order was: lauric acid (18), myristic acid (22), n-docosanol (25), ferulic acid (49), β-sitostenone (198), β-sitosterol (490), and ursolic acid (743). The concentrations of many bark constituents were significantly correlated and concentration of n-docosanol was highly significantly correlated with all other analytes. Estimates of variance components revealed the highest variation among populations for ursolic acid (66%) and the lowest for β-sitosterol (20%). In general, environmental parameters recorded (temperature, precipitation, altitude) for the samples sites were not correlated with the concentration of most constituents; however, concentration of ferulic acid was significantly correlated with annual precipitation. Because the concentration of compounds in bark extracts may be affected by tree size, the diameter of sampled plants at 1.3 m tree height (as proxy of age) was recorded. The only relationship with tree diameter was a negative correlation with ursolic acid. Under the assumption that genetically less variable populations have less variable concentrations of bark compounds, correlations between variation parameters of the concentration and the respective genetic composition based on chloroplast and nuclear \{DNA\} markers were assessed. Only variation of β-sitosterol concentration was significantly correlated with haplotypic diversity. The fixation index (FIS) was positively correlated with the variation in concentration of ferulic acid. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) indicated a weak geographic pattern. Mantel tests, however, revealed associations between the geographic patterns of bioactive constituents and the phylogenetic relationship among the populations sampled. This suggests an independent evolution of bark metabolism within different phylogeographical lineages, and the molecular phylogeographic pattern is partly reflected in the variation in concentration of bark constituents. The results have important implications for the design of strategies for the sustainable use and conservation of this important African tree species. "

For this purpose, terrestrial assessment systems such as forest inventory data in combination with carbon estimation methods are often used. In this study we analyze and compare terrestrial carbon estimation methods from 12 European countries. The country-specific methods are applied to five European tree species (Fagus sylvatica L., Quercus robur L., Betula pendula Roth, Picea abies (L.) Karst. and Pinus sylvestris L.), using a standardized theoretically-generated tree dataset. We avoid any bias due to data collection and/or sample design by using this approach. We are then able to demonstrate the conceptual differences in the resulting carbon estimates with regard to the applied country-specific method. In our study we analyze (i) allometric biomass functions, (ii) biomass expansion factors in combination with volume functions and (iii) a combination of both. The results of the analysis show discrepancies in the resulting estimates for total tree carbon and for single tree compartments across the countries analyzed of up to 140 t carbon/ha. After grouping the country-specific approaches by European Forest regions, the deviation within the results in each region is smaller but still remains. This indicates that part of the observed differences can be attributed to varying growing conditions and tree properties throughout Europe. However, the large remaining error is caused by differences in the conceptual approach, different tree allometry, the sample material used for developing the biomass estimation models and the definition of the tree compartments. These issues are currently not addressed and require consideration for reliable and consistent carbon estimates throughout Europe. "

Therefore, it is relevant to have robust information of the availability for wood supply. The main aim of this paper is to harmonize the concept of ‘forest available for wood supply’ (FAWS) at European level. The data employed in this study was acquired through two questionnaires. The first questionnaire, conducted under the framework of \{COST\} Action \{FP1001\} and a second questionnaire was completed by national correspondents and members of the UNECE/FAO. The analysis showed that reasons for the exclusion of forest from \{FAWS\} are diverse. Legal restrictions and specifically ´Protected areas´ are considered by 79% of the countries while very few countries consider economic restrictions. A new \{FAWS\} reference definition is provided and the consequences of using this new definition in eight European countries were analysed. Application of the proposed definition will increase consistency and comparability of data on \{FAWS\} and will result in decreasing the area of \{FAWS\} at a European level. "

By drawing together the experience of a global group of \{EDSS\} developers, we have identified and assessed key challenges in \{EDSS\} development and offer recommendations to resolve them. Challenges related to engaging end users in \{EDSS\} development emphasise the need for a participatory process that embraces end users and stakeholders throughout the design and development process. Adoption challenges concerned with individual and organisational capacities to use \{EDSS\} and the match between \{EDSS\} and organisational goals can be overcome through the use of an internal champion to promote the \{EDSS\} at different levels of a target organisation; co-ordinate and build capacity within the organisation, and; ensure that developers maintain focus on developing \{EDSS\} which are relatively easy and inexpensive to use and update (and which are perceived as such by the target users). Significant challenges exist in relation to ensuring \{EDSS\} longevity and financial sustainability. Such business challenges may be met through planning and design that considers the long-term costs of training, support, and maintenance; revenue generation and licensing by instituting processes which support communication and interactions; and by employing software technology which enables easy model expansion and re use to gain an economy of scale and reduce development costs. A final group of perhaps more problematic challenges relate to how the success of \{EDSS\} ought to be evaluated. Whilst success can be framed relatively easily in terms of interactions with end users, difficulties of definition and measurability emerge in relation to the extent to which \{EDSS\} achieve intended outcomes. To tackle the challenges described, the authors provide a set of best practice recommendations concerned with promoting design for ease of use, design for usefulness, establishing trust and credibility, promoting \{EDSS\} acceptance, and starting simple and small in functionality terms. Following these recommendations should enhance the achievement of successful \{EDSS\} adoption, but more importantly, help facilitate the achievement of desirable social and environmental outcomes.

Many different light use efficiency (LUE) models have been developed recently, but our understanding of the relative merits of different models remains limited. Using \{CO2\} flux measurements from multiple eddy covariance sites, we here compared and assessed major algorithms and performance of seven \{LUE\} models (CASA, CFix, CFlux, EC-LUE, MODIS, \{VPM\} and VPRM). Comparison between simulated \{GPP\} and estimated \{GPP\} from flux measurements showed that model performance differed substantially among ecosystem types. In general, most models performed better in capturing the temporal changes and magnitude of \{GPP\} in deciduous broadleaf forests and mixed forests than in evergreen broadleaf forests and shrublands. Six of the seven \{LUE\} models significantly underestimated \{GPP\} during cloudy days because the impacts of diffuse radiation on light use efficiency were ignored in the models. \{CFlux\} and EC-LUE exhibited the lowest root mean square error among all models at 80% and 75% of the sites, respectively. Moreover, these two models showed better performance than others in simulating interannual variability of GPP. Two pairwise comparisons revealed that the seven models differed substantially in algorithms describing the environmental regulations, particularly water stress, on GPP. This analysis highlights the need to improve representation of the impacts of diffuse radiation and water stress in the \{LUE\} models. "

To meet such a need, we developed a spatial classification framework and database — Great Lakes Aquatic Habitat Framework (GLAHF). \{GLAHF\} consists of catchments, coastal terrestrial, coastal margin, nearshore, and offshore zones that encompass the entire Great Lakes Basin. The catchments captured in the database as river pour points or coastline segments are attributed with data known to influence physicochemical and biological characteristics of the lakes from the catchments. The coastal terrestrial zone consists of 30-m grid cells attributed with data from the terrestrial region that has direct connection with the lakes. The coastal margin and nearshore zones consist of 30-m grid cells attributed with data describing the coastline conditions, coastal human disturbances, and moderately to highly variable physicochemical and biological characteristics. The offshore zone consists of 1.8-km grid cells attributed with data that are spatially less variable compared with the other aquatic zones. These spatial classification zones and their associated data are nested within lake sub-basins and political boundaries and allow the synthesis of information from grid cells to classification zones, within and among political boundaries, lake sub-basins, Great Lakes, or within the entire Great Lakes Basin. This spatially structured database could help the development of basin-wide management plans, prioritize locations for funding and specific management actions, track protection and restoration progress, and conduct research for science-based decision making.

However, the extent of these declines is rarely quantified, thereby weakening lessons learned and species-based management. This need not be the case as a proliferation of camera trap surveys for large-bodied mammals across Southeast Asia, which use a standardized sampling technique, presents a rich yet under-utilized wildlife data set. Furthermore, advances in statistical techniques for assessing species distribution provide new opportunities for conducting comparative regional analyses. Here, we focus on one of Southeast Asia’s least known species of megafauna, the Endangered Asian tapir (Tapirus indicus), to investigate the performance of a camera trap-based spatial modeling approach in conducting a range-wide species assessment. Detection data were collectively collated from 52,904 trap days and 1,128 camera traps located across 19 study areas drawn from the Asian tapir’s entire range. Considerable variation in tapir occurrence was found between study areas in: Malaysia (0.52–0.77); Sumatra, Indonesia (0.12–0.90); Thailand (0.00–0.65); and, Myanmar (0.00–0.26), with generally good levels of estimate precision. Although tapirs were widespread (recorded in 17 of the 19 study areas), their occurrence was significantly and negatively correlated with human disturbance. Thus, this study extends the previously known applicability of camera traps to include a threatened and cryptic species by identifying where and how tapirs persist (including new records of occurrence), where future surveys should be conducted and providing a benchmark for measuring future conservation management efforts.

It also requires an analysis of causal linkages and feedback loops between systems. These questions and the conceptual approach of the research design of the Climate–Land Interaction Project (CLIP) are rooted in the classical human–environment research tradition in Geography. This paper discusses a methodological framework to quantify the two-way interactions between land use and regional climate systems, using ongoing work by a team of multi-disciplinary scientists examining climate–land dynamics at multiple scales in East Africa. East Africa is a region that is undergoing rapid land use change, where changes in climate would have serious consequences for people’s livelihoods, and requiring new coping and land use strategies. The research involves exploration of linkages between two important foci of global change research, namely, land use/land cover (LULC) and climate change. These linkages are examined through modeling agricultural systems, land use driving forces and patterns, the physical properties of land cover, and the regional climate. Both qualitative and quantitative methods are being used to illustrate a diverse pluralism in scientific discovery. "

The estimated annual \{PS\} of nature-based tourism is ~US$195,000. In order to evaluate the future impact of different forest management regimes on \{PS\} over a 25 year period, we compare two alternative scenarios of land use. Under a ‘hopeful expectations’ scenario of no forest loss from protected areas, the present value of \{PS\} from nature-based tourism is ~US$1.9 million, compared with US$1.6 million under a ‘business-as-usual’ scenario. Although the value of nature-based tourism to the \{EAMs\} is lower than that generated by Tanzania׳s large game reserves, these revenues, together with other ecosystem services provided by the area, such as carbon storage and water regulation, may enhance the case for sustainable forest management.

Potential interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture were then compared among landscapes and domains. The approach combined literature review with expert judgment by researchers working in each landscape. Each landscape was described for land use, rural livelihoods and attitudes of social actors toward biodiversity and intensification of agriculture. Principal components analysis of 40 indicators of natural, human, social, financial and physical capital for the eight landscapes showed a loss of biodiversity associated with high-input agricultural intensification. High levels of natural capital (e.g. indicators of wildland biodiversity conservation and agrobiodiversity for human needs) were positively associated with indicators of human capital, including knowledge of the flora and fauna and knowledge sharing among farmers. Three social-ecological domains were identified across the eight landscapes (Tropical Agriculture-Forest Matrix, Tropical Degrading Agroecosystem, and Temperate High-Input Commodity Agriculture) using hierarchical clustering of the indicator values. Each domain shared a set of interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture and ecological intensification that could also increase food security in the impoverished landscapes. Implementation of interventions differed greatly among the landscapes, e.g. financial capital for new farming practices in the Intensive Agriculture domain vs. developing market value chains in the other domains. This exploratory study suggests that indicators of knowledge systems should receive greater emphasis in the monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and that inventories of assets at the landscape level can inform adaptive management of agrobiodiversity-based interventions.

The map was created using an on-screen visual interpretation technique and has an accuracy of 90%, as assessed using 15,565 ground control points. India has hitherto been using potential vegetation/forest type map prepared by Champion and Seth in 1968. We characterized and mapped further the vegetation type distribution in the country in terms of occurrence and distribution, area occupancy, percentage of protected area (PA) covered by each vegetation type, range of elevation, mean annual temperature and precipitation over the past 100 years. A remote sensing-amenable hierarchical classification scheme that accommodates natural and semi-natural systems was conceptualized, and the natural vegetation was classified into forests, scrub/shrub lands and grasslands on the basis of extent of vegetation cover. We discuss the distribution and potential utility of the vegetation type map in a broad range of ecological, climatic and conservation applications from global, national and local perspectives. We used 15,565 ground control points to assess the accuracy of products available globally (i.e., GlobCover, Holdridge’s life zone map and potential natural vegetation (PNV) maps). Hence we recommend that the map prepared herein be used widely. This vegetation type map is the most comprehensive one developed for India so far. It was prepared using 23.5 m seasonal satellite remote sensing data, field samples and information relating to the biogeography, climate and soil. The digital map is now available through a web portal (http://bis.iirs.gov.in). "

abstract = "AbstractObjective Extraovarian sex hormone production plays an important role in estrogen biosynthesis in postmenopausal women. We examined possible associations between serum sex hormone level and polymorphisms in CYP19A1, HSD17B1, and HSD17B2. We also assessed possible interaction between these polymorphisms and current overweight. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study. 785 Japanese natural postmenopausal women were randomly selected from the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) Study database. Information on lifestyle factors was obtained from a self-administered questionnaire. Serum estrogens and androgens levels were measured by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Four tag \{SNPs\} (single nucleotide polymorphisms) of CYP19A1, one missense \{SNP\} of \{HSD17B1\} and three tag \{SNPs\} of \{HSD17B2\} were examined by Invader assay. A trend test was conducted using linear regression. Results After adjustment for multiple comparisons, we found that rs4441215 and rs936306 in \{CYP19A1\} and rs4888202 and rs2955160 in \{HSD17B2\} were associated with differences in serum estrone level. Further, rs4441215 and rs936306 were associated with differences in serum estradiol level. None of these polymorphisms showed a significant interaction with current body mass index (BMI). Conclusions Our findings suggested that \{CYP19A1\} and \{HSD17B2\} polymorphisms might be associated with circulating sex hormone levels in Japanese postmenopausal women, independent of current BMI.

abstract = "Abstract A fundamental question connecting terrestrial ecology and global climate change is the sensitivity of key terrestrial biomes to climatic variability and change. The Amazon region is such a key biome: it contains unparalleled biological diversity, a globally significant store of organic carbon, and it is a potent engine driving global cycles of water and energy. The importance of understanding how land surface dynamics of the Amazon region respond to climatic variability and change is widely appreciated, but despite significant recent advances, large gaps in our understanding remain. Understanding of energy and carbon exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere can be improved through direct observations and experiments, as well as through modeling activities. Land surface/ecosystem models have become important tools for extrapolating local observations and understanding to much larger terrestrial regions. They are also valuable tools to test hypothesis on ecosystem functioning. Funded by \{NASA\} under the auspices of the \{LBA\} (the Large-Scale Biosphere–Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia), the \{LBA\} Data Model Intercomparison Project (LBA-DMIP) uses a comprehensive data set from an observational network of flux towers across the Amazon, and an ecosystem modeling community engaged in ongoing studies using a suite of different land surface and terrestrial ecosystem models to understand Amazon forest function. Here an overview of this project is presented accompanied by a description of the measurement sites, data, models and protocol. "

abstract = "Summary Gall-forming arthropods are highly specialized herbivores that, in combination with their hosts, produce extended phenotypes with unique morphologies [1]. Many are economically important, and others have improved our understanding of ecology and adaptive radiation [2]. However, the mechanisms that these arthropods use to induce plant galls are poorly understood. We sequenced the genome of the Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor; Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), a plant parasitic gall midge and a pest of wheat (Triticum spp.), with the aim of identifying genic modifications that contribute to its plant-parasitic lifestyle. Among several adaptive modifications, we discovered an expansive reservoir of potential effector proteins. Nearly 5% of the 20,163 predicted gene models matched putative effector gene transcripts present in the M. destructor larval salivary gland. Another 466 putative effectors were discovered among the genes that have no sequence similarities in other organisms. The largest known arthropod gene family (family SSGP-71) was also discovered within the effector reservoir. SSGP-71 proteins lack sequence homologies to other proteins, but their structures resemble both ubiquitin \{E3\} ligases in plants and E3-ligase-mimicking effectors in plant pathogenic bacteria. SSGP-71 proteins and wheat Skp proteins interact in vivo. Mutations in different SSGP-71 genes avoid the effector-triggered immunity that is directed by the wheat resistance genes \{H6\} and H9. Results point to effectors as the agents responsible for arthropod-induced plant gall formation. "

All currently accepted orders in the class are represented for the first time in addition to numerous previously unplaced lineages. Subclass Pleosporomycetidae is expanded to include the aquatic order Jahnulales. An ancestral reconstruction of basic nutritional modes supports numerous transitions from saprobic life histories to plant associated and lichenised modes and a transition from terrestrial to aquatic habitats are confirmed. Finally, a genomic comparison of 6 dothideomycete genomes with other fungi finds a high level of unique protein associated with the class, supporting its delineation as a separate taxon. "

Local studies of distributions along elevational gradients reveal small-scale patterns but do not allow generalizations among geographic regions or taxa. We critically assessed data from 249 studies of species elevational distributions in the American, African, and Asia-Pacific tropics. Of these, 150 had sufficient data quality, sampling intensity, elevational range, and freedom from serious habitat disturbance to permit robust across-study comparisons. We found four main patterns: (1) species classified as elevational specialists (upper- or lower-zone specialists) are relatively more frequent in the American than Asia-Pacific tropics, with African tropics being intermediate; (2) elevational specialists are rare on islands, especially oceanic and smaller continental islands, largely due to a paucity of upper-zone specialists; (3) a relatively high proportion of plants and ectothermic vertebrates (amphibians and reptiles) are upper-zone specialists; and (4) relatively few endothermic vertebrates (birds and mammals) are upper-zone specialists. Understanding these broad-scale trends will help identify taxa and geographic regions vulnerable to global warming and highlight future research priorities. "

abstract = "Abstract This paper reports the output of a consensus symposium organized by the International Union of Radioecology in November 2015. The symposium gathered an academically diverse group of 30 scientists to consider the still debated ecological impact of radiation on populations and ecosystems. Stimulated by the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters' accidental contamination of the environment, there is increasing interest in developing environmental radiation protection frameworks. Scientific research conducted in a variety of laboratory and field settings has improved our knowledge of the effects of ionizing radiation on the environment. However, the results from such studies sometimes appear contradictory and there is disagreement about the implications for risk assessment. The Symposium discussions therefore focused on issues that might lead to different interpretations of the results, such as laboratory versus field approaches, organism versus population and ecosystemic inference strategies, dose estimation approaches and their significance under chronic exposure conditions. The participating scientists, from across the spectrum of disciplines and research areas, extending also beyond the traditional radioecology community, successfully developed a constructive spirit directed at understanding discrepancies. From the discussions, the group has derived seven consensus statements related to environmental protection against radiation, which are supplemented with some recommendations. Each of these statements is contextualized and discussed in view of contributing to the orientation and integration of future research, the results of which should yield better consensus on the ecological impact of radiation and consolidate suitable approaches for efficient radiological protection of the environment.
