Mixed infections involving sweetpotato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV; genus Crinivirus), on the other hand, lead to severe disease complexes, causing yield losses of up to 99%. The most important among these is termed sweetpotato virus disease and caused by dual infection of \{SPCSV\} and sweetpotato feathery mottle virus (genus Potyvirus). Recent evidence suggests that it is a general property of \{SPCSV\} to be able to cause synergistic disease with co-infecting viruses, probably through suppression of host defense mechanisms. Other widespread viruses infecting sweetpotato include several potyviruses and begomoviruses as well as ipomoviruses and carlaviruses. "

However, questions remain as to the effect of the water restriction initiation timing and the level of alternate water restriction on the response of the potato crop. In this study, we tested: two \{PRD\} treatments with 25% (PRD25) and 50% (PRD50) of total water used in full irrigation (FI, as control), and a deficit irrigation treatment with 50% of water restriction (DI50). Two water restriction initiation timings were tested at: 6 weeks (WRIT6w) and 8 weeks (WRIT8w) after planting. Osmotic potential (π), osmotic adjustment, relative water content and chlorophyll concentration were assessed in four dates during the growing period. \{PRD50\} initiated at \{WRIT6w\} showed the highest \{WUE\} without a tuber yield reduction respect to the control. While plants under \{PRDs\} and \{DI50\} showed lower π than FI, \{PRDs\} treatments promoted higher osmotic adjustment particularly in WRIT6w. Our study suggests that early \{PRDs\} with mild water restriction allow drought hardiness (improving water stress response) and water saving avoiding a dramatic yield tuber reduction. "

Ecological conditions and farm type strongly influenced farmers' production methods and technological requirements. 2. 2. Small farmers were eager to improve their methods. 3. 3. The recommended ‘technological packages’ had many deficiencies. 4. 4. Technical knowledge was available to solve some farmers' problems. 5. 5. Most technologies could not be directly ‘transferred’ to farmers, but needed to be tailored to their specific needs. 6. 6. Scientific specialization presented several barriers to interdisciplinary research. 7. 7. The project was costly, in terms of operating capital. 8. 8. The project's most valuable result was an institutional innovation, not an impact on potato production. 9. 9. Informal surveys and simple on-farm trials had many advantages over more ‘respectable’, formal methods. 10. 10. Anthropologists played many useful roles. 11. 11.

A series of laboratory experiments was conducted to test the hypothesis that a vigorous plantlet surviving in a saline medium would be tolerant owing to a higher competitive ability and a lower growth retardation. The results showed significant variations among the existing cutivated Ipomoea germplasm and some breeding lines for salt tolerance based on plant growth characters, percentage of survival and fibrous root formation. In-vitro techniques were shown to be useful in identifying relatively salt-tolerant genotypes.

This is particularly relevant at the end of the growth cycle, when delayed senescence a.k.a. stay-green may reflect maintenance of photosynthetic activity during the re-mobilization of carbon products to the harvested plant organs. In the present study, we analyzed the temporal trends of chlorophyll concentration or greenness measured using a \{SPAD\} meter (ChlSPAD), maximum net photosynthesis (Amax), stomatal conductance (gs), intrinsic water-use efficiency (Amax/E), nitrogen content per area (Narea), leaf length, plant cover and tuber and aboveground dry biomass in three potato varieties (Désirée, Unica and Sarnav). We compared plants grown at field capacity and under water restriction of 50% of field capacity. Watering treatments were imposed at tuber initiation onset. One week after water restriction initiation, a temporary rise of ChlSPAD was observed in the three genotypes. This increased leaf greenness under water restriction coincided with a decrease in leaf growth. Sarnav, which had the lowest drought susceptibility index, showed the lowest increase of ChlSPAD after water restriction as well as the higher average gs biomass accumulation, and lower Amax/E from tuber initiation onset through the initiation of senescence. We suggest that the highest greenness increase following water restriction in the most drought susceptible varieties is an expression of more conservative strategies under drought, which under moderate water stress (the most common water stresses in agriculture), are not useful from a productive point of view. Under this moderate stress, long growing cycle genotypes showed higher tuber yield driven by the longer period of biomass accumulation. Thus, lower chlorophyll loss rate and later onset of senescence was related to higher yield under water restriction. This study provides more insights on the mechanisms linking ChlSPAD temporal responses to moderate drought tolerance in potato. "

Potatoes processed as chuño have a lower concentration of protein and zinc than unprocessed tubers, and a higher content of calcium, while iron concentration may be expected not to be subjected to changes. Water used in preparing the chuño is suggested to be the cause for an increased calcium concentration in the final product, as the water used had higher calcium content before (1.35 mequiv./l) than after (0.84 mequiv./l) use in the preparation. Thus, water seems to be source of the increased calcium concentration. "

Significant variability was revealed for total and all individual carotenoids measured. Two varieties with significant zeaxanthin concentrations (above 1000 μg 100 g−1 FW) and a group of 43 accessions with relatively high β-carotene concentrations (above 10 μg 100 g−1 FW) were identified. The positive relation between total carotenoids and zeaxanthin as well as their negative relation with β-carotene reported for 23 accessions in the companion manuscript was upheld. The use of \{NIRS\} in estimating and characterizing a large germplasm collection has permitted the identification of accessions with high total carotenoids and zeaxanthin and relatively high β-carotene concentrations at low cost and in reduced time compared to HPLC.

The interaction between PoGV infection and incubation temperature on P. operculella was studied in laboratory bioassays by determining the survival, yield of virus-infected larvae, and the kinetics of virus in vivo increase. Bioassays for \{LC50\} determination by using the egg-dip method were repeated over a period of six years in controlled incubation chambers at six constant temperatures ranging from 16 to 28 °C. Additionally, at temperatures of 17 and 24 °C the kinetics of virus development and increase in larva were assessed in destructive time-series experiments. Three different virus concentrations were used for inoculation. Control mortality was significantly temperature-dependent and was well described by a second-order polynomial function, with lowest mortality at 25 °C (∼20%) and highest at 16 °C (&gt;60%). \{LC50\} values and slopes of probit-mortality curves were not significantly different between temperatures. Numbers of virus-infected larvae increased exponentially with increasing log-concentration of virus inoculum; an effect of temperature was not evident. Virus granules per larva correlated highly with larval age and larval weight. Multiple regression revealed minor direct effects of temperature on virus numbers; however, with decreasing temperature, larval weight and hence virus numbers increased. As a result, temperature is an important factor to be considered in virus-production facilities. Rearing temperature in virus-production facilities should be maintained at temperatures around 24 °C.

The poverty content of 10 CIP-related success stories of technological change was qualitatively assessed with a checklist of key questions. With this admittedly crude method, the size of project Net Present Value (NPV) appears to be an informative guide to the magnitude of poverty effects. Hence, projects that generate widespread benefits to many people, particularly to net consumers of food crops, remain likely to be the most effective vehicles to contribute to poverty alleviation from public sector investments in the improvement of food crops in developing countries.

The growing utilization of root and tuber crops in these expanding markets depends critically on their price competitiveness relative to other commodities, especially maize. In this paper, price relationships among commodities in Asia are examined to assess the potential of cassava and sweet potato in starch and feed markets. For starch, cassava is currently competitive in Southeast Asia. Sweet potato is only competitive in markets that require the special starch traits found in this crop. Plant breeding to increase starch yield from cassava and sweet potato would improve their competitiveness in Asian markets. In the manufacture of least-cost animal feed mixes, the results of a linear-programming model show that most millers are likely to prefer maize over root and tuber crops due in part to the higher cost of protein supplements when using starchy roots and tubers. However, a cassava–soybean compound feed appears to be currently economically viable in Thailand. Sweet potato and cassava are also viable feed options for many small farmers who grow their own feed so long as the protein-rich foliage can be effectively incorporated along with starchy roots in feed rations.

This “second generation” of impact studies can draw on earlier assessments of the production impacts of new, high-yielding rice and wheat varieties, particularly in Asia. New approaches and new data are needed, however, to assess the production impacts of other types of new technology (e.g., pest control methods, seed systems, and post-harvest technology) that are used with other crops and livestock, particularly in Africa and Latin America. Innovative study approaches are also needed to assess the institutional impacts of international programs. Given the high degree of institutional interdependence which characterizes agricultural research and extension it is inappropriate to attribute production impacts at the farm or consumer levels to specific international programs, as has sometimes been done. As an alternative to the narrow production economics framework employed in most previous impact studies, an interdisciplinary approach is outlined. "

High quality was achieved with a constant pressure valve and a new nozzle, while for low quality, fungicide was applied without a valve and using a damaged nozzle. All treatment combinations gave adequate disease control and no consistent effect of application strategy or application quality could be measured on disease severity or yield.

To fill this gap, the strategy of Illumina deep sequencing of small \{RNAs\} was used to obtain complete or near complete genome sequence of \{PVX\} from 5 symptomatically infected greenhouse and 3 field samples (Solanum tuberosum) from Peru. \{PVX\} sequences determined in this study were assigned into three different phylogenetic groups of isolates. Notably, a complete genome sequence of a representative of a new \{PVX\} phylogenetic lineage was obtained, which shows a high level of sequence dissimilarity to other completely sequenced isolates (∼17%). The new \{PVX\} genotype was detected in greenhouse and field samples. One of the field samples was infected with the mixture of two \{PVX\} strains, which were efficiently discriminated using small \{RNA\} sequencing approach. The study confirms the utility of small \{RNAs\} deep sequencing for successful viral strain differentiation and discovery of new viral strains and indicates a high diversity of \{PVX\} in the Andean region of South America, a pattern which may be expected also for other potato pathogens.

The effects of foliar injury during different growth stages of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), caused by natural populations of the leafminer fly Liriomyza huidobrensis (Blanchard) on potato yield, and the economic injury level for potato varieties with different maturity times were studied in the Cañete valley on the central coast of Peru. Field experiments were carried out during the potato cropping season (July–November) in the years 2005, 2007 and 2008 using early, middle-late and late potato varieties. Insecticides with different control efficiencies or the use of varying numbers of insecticide applications obtained various levels of leafminer fly infestation intensities. Leafminer fly infestation caused foliar injury in all potato varieties resulting in yield losses, which varied, according to the seasonal adult flight activity in each year of evaluation, between 22% in 2007 (2508 adults/trap/season) and 51% in 2005 (3147 adults/trap/season). Foliar injury increased with the development and growth of the potato plant, with the highest injury registered at the end of the cropping period. Early varieties showed higher foliar injury and yield loss than late potato varieties with the exception of Maria Tambeña, which is considered partially resistant to leafminer fly infestation. Yield losses increased linearly by each percentage of foliar injury in all potato varieties. Critical point and multiple point models made it possible to identify the potato growth stage at which leafminer infestation had the greatest effect on yield. Pest infestation-crop loss relationships indicated that the accumulated foliar injury up to the growth stages of flowering and berry formation produced the highest yield losses in the different potato varieties. Economic injury levels varied according to control costs and commodity values in each potato variety (Desiree: 21–28%, Revolucion: 34–47%, Canchan: 31–40%, Maria Tambeña: 40–53%, Tomasa: 55–74%, and Yungay: 40–54% of foliar injury). Potato varieties can tolerate considerable levels of foliar injury by the leafminer fly before control measures are needed. The use of the economic injury levels is suggested as a decision support tool for managing the leafminer fly at reduced pest management costs. "

The adults are flightless insects that migrate to potato fields during the potato-growing season, where the larvae damage a high proportion of the tuber harvest. We tested the hypothesis that plastic barriers established at field borders at sowing time are effective management tools to stop Andean potato weevil migration into potato fields, with a consequent reduction in Andean potato weevil tuber damage. In addition, we studied the effect of barriers on carabids, which represent an important insect family in the Andes and are natural enemies of Andean potato weevils. The studies were carried out in 21 on-farm experiments in two villages in the Central Highlands of Peru. The effect of plastic barriers was compared to farmers' practice, consisting of 1–4 insecticide applications per potato-growing season, in participatory research in fallow–potato and potato–potato rotation systems in which the Andean potato weevil Premnotrypes suturicallus Kuschel is endemic. Plastic barriers proved to be highly effective in stopping weevil migration. In screen house experiments only a small proportion (13%) of weevils was able to escape from plastic heights of 25 cm. A height of 50 cm could not be overcome, which was the height used in the on-farm field experiments. The combination of plastic barriers with pitfall traps installed close to the plastic significantly increased the number of Andean potato weevil catches, and proved an effective technology for mass trapping of Andean potato weevil adults. Plastic barriers also affected and increased the number of carabids, mainly of the genus Blennidus, in the pitfall traps. The proportion of carabids was 4–5 times higher in the location in which a lower number of Andean potato weevils and damaged tubers were observed. The results suggest that carabids are important predators of Andean potato weevils. The plastic barriers effectively reduced Andean potato weevils-caused potato tuber damage at harvest. Compared to the farmers' practice of using insecticides, the barriers were equally effective in fallow–potato rotation systems. In potato–potato rotation systems the combination of plastic barrier with one application of insecticide was superior to farmers' practice using 3–4 insecticide applications. The costs for plastic barriers were calculated to be equivalent to two or three insecticide applications per hectare. Plastic barriers are proposed as a new effective component for Integrated Pest Management of Andean potato weevils. "

The soil reflectant reduced day time soil temperatures (at 5 cm depth) by a maximum of 7°C (e.g. 37°C control reduced to 30°C), and polyethylene increased it by 3–5°C. During the night soil temperature of reflectant treatments was generally cooler than the control, with little difference apparent by dawn, whereas polyehtylene maintained a temperature differential of approximately 2–3°C throughout the night. Treatments that reduced soil temperature hastened emergence, foliage development and canopy cover of the soil, the latter in turn further reduced day time soil temperature and favoured tuber initiation. The rapid rate of increase in leaf area observed in cooler soil treatments more than compensated for their early tuber initiation such that at early tuber initiation leaf area indexes were greater than those of later initiating treatments. Soil heating delayed emergence and reduced the final number of plants emerging, but tuber initiation, although delayed, was never inhibited. Tuber growth rates and final yields were markedly greater for cool soil treatments. Although the heating/cooling effect was negligible for the main bulking period (due to self shading), during the last 3–4 weeks of bulking, lodging of stems and branches caused the soil surface to become exposed and soil cooling in reflectant plots was again evident. Tuber yield ranged from 5 to 37 t/ha; for non-adapted clones yields were improved more than 100% by treatments effecting soil cooling whereas for those heating the soil yields were reduced by approximately 50%. The treatment influence on tuber yields was less notable for the clone DTO-33, selected for its heat tolerance. Tuber deformities were reduced in cooler soil treatments and tuber dry matter content was marginally greater, both indicative of less heat stress. Reduction of day, rather than night, soil temperature would appear to have a more practical application for yield improvement within the range of temperatures recorded in these experiments. Criteria for the selection of better adapted clones, on the basis of results from these experiments, are presented. "

Mulch always enhanced soil moisture retention, but the improvement was less evident under increasing shade. Daily soil temperature fluctuations at tuber depth were damped by mulch, and maximum reduction of daytime soil temperature was recorded immediately following planting, before the crop emerged. Reductions of daytime soil heating and retention of heat within the soil at night by mulch were influenced by various edaphic and weather conditions. Maximum reduction during the day was achieved under conditions favouring soil heating (e.g. high irradiance, low soil moisture content, ridged soil, soil of low albedo) whereas heat retention at night by mulch, although greater in shaded than non-shaded plots, in general was relatively greater under conditions that favoured longwave re-radiation from the soil (e.g. ridged and dry soil).

In general, tuber yield increased linearly with increases in planted population over the range studied (2.7–12.5 plants m−2, and in one experiment to 31.7 plants m−2), and was proportional to increases in the amount of intercepted radiation. Tuber yields ranged from 8 to 60 t ha−1 over sites and populations. Vigorous clones with Solanum tuberosum spp. andigena in their genetic background constituted the exceptions to this linear trend, and for these clones yields declined at the highest populations, particularly when the rectangularity of planting vastly deviated from square patterns. Tuber yield of Solanum tuberosum spp. tuberosum and Neotuberosum (S. tuberosum spp. andigena selected for tuberization under long-day conditions) clones did not respond to variations in rectangularity of planting and, probably due to their small stature and early maturity, did not demonstrate signs of intense between-plant competition for tuber yield as measured with the Kira competition density index. In contrast, for clones with Solanum tuberosum ssp. andigena in their genetic background, maximum tuber yield at populations greater than 5.5 plants m−2 was dependent on the rectangularity of planting, and declined as the latter deviated from squareness. Since the proportion of marketable tubers was scarcely affected by the planting densities, plant population of S. tuberosum ssp. tuberosum clones planted in hot climates should be as close as possible without limiting the amount of soil available for hilling-up.

Farmers' rationales for mixed-cropping potato are then studied in four areas along the eastern slopes of the Andes from 4000 to 800 meters above sea level. Four tendencies were identified in the Peru transect: (1) intercropping increases with decreasing altitude and higher temperatures; (2) main agronomic benefit of intercropping at lower elevations is shading; (3) farmers tend not to mix-crop for commercial production, but to mix for subsistence; and (4) farmers attempt to increase both land and labour efficiency through intercropping. Adaptive research and technology development programs must take into account that farmers make intercropping decisions based on farm-level, location-specific demands. "

abstract = "The intercropping of potato with other crop species in the tropics is a prevalent practice of increasing importance, but largely based upon non-documented farmer experience. Improvement of indigenous systems and the creation of systems appropriate to future potato-production zones in hot areas require a clear understanding of their physical and biological interactions. This knowledge may be obtained from research on temporal and spatial demands by intercrops. In this paper, the benefits of intercropping potato with annual or perennial crops with respect to total resource use, particularly of solar energy, are presented. Four systems which minimize the influence of interspecific competition, yet maximize the utilization of wasted resources by one or other component crops, and which are suitable for the potato, are presented as follows: (I) Relay-cropping potato into an existing annual shade crop; (II) Intercropping with perennials; (III) Intercropping with annuals; and (IV) Relay-cropping an annual shade crop into an existing potato crop. Crop cultural practices such as relative planting dates, component-crop densities, and spatial distributions at planting are discussed in relation to climate, soil cooling, efficiency of interception of irradiance, and ease of management, with particular emphasis on maize/potato associations. The specific cooling effect of shaded soil on crop emergence under conditions of high soil temperature in system I, and on the detrimental effect of high temperature late in the potato cycle in system IV, are highlighted. In addition, utilization of available solar energy is enhanced. Intercropping with perennials (system II) and annuals (system III) represent systems with possibilities for manipulation of crop cultural practices in the dominant crop. These range from limited (e.g. in plantation tree crops) to almost limitless possibilities (e.g. in pruned alley crops) with a concomitant range of management decisions. The potato crop in the tropics may withstand reductions in the receipt of irradiance of up to 25% for extended periods with negligible yield decline. Selection of clones adapted to this level of reduction may be made under sole-crop conditions. With further reduction in irradiance, differences in genotypic ability to tolerate shade are expressed. Therefore it is suggested that, to increase total productivity beyond that attribute to temporal complementarity and efficient use of photosynthetically active radiation, then incorporation of shade tolerance will be necessary.

In perishable vegetatively propagated crops like the potato, appropriate post-harvest technology is not only required to reduce food losses, but also to maintain the perishable planting material from one growing season to the next. Extensive knowledge on basic post-harvest technologies and principles exists for potatoes. The future emphasis in tropical developing countries should be in their low-cost application to specific local problems. In attempting to use known technologies to solve these problems, lessons should be learnt from many past failures where attempts concentrated on the direct transfer of technologies which were successfully used in one location to a similar problem in another location. Basic technologies and principles are universal but their application is location-specific and requires a good understanding of the socio-economic as well as technical needs of each location. The best use of limited resources in the transfer and application of known technologies could be achieved through the use of interdisciplinary research teams which involve their final client — farmer, merchant or consumer — in their efforts at an early stage, rather than relying on traditional disciplinary research and extension approaches. As an alternative to trying to copy the development path of countries which use high-input technologies, the authors suggest that developing countries, in an effort to reduce post-harvest potato losses and to make potatoes available to an increasing number of their peoples by the year 2000, should investigate alternative low-cost application of basic principles.

The model predicts that after 10 years, a representative pioneer farmer who produces charcoal would earn 17% higher net income and clear 17% less forested area. A sensitivity analysis predicts that any additional labor would be chiefly devoted to charcoal production, reinforcing the conservation effect. "

However, the dynamics of these characters depend on crop phenology, levels of water shortage, and other factors that affect their relationship with yield and limit their capacity to be used for predictive purposes. In this work, we compared tuber yield with the temporal trend (using accumulated thermal time) of chlorophyll concentration (ChlSPAD), osmotic potential, and relative water content under water restriction. UNICA, a potato variety characterized by its low drought susceptibility was tested under full irrigation (as a control) and different treatments of partial root-zone drying and deficit irrigation in greenhouse and field conditions. ChlSPAD was the only trait showing a concurrent changing trend (slope) with yields, particularly in field conditions. The rate of greenness loss or senescence was slower in the higher water restriction treatments, which indicates that the stay-green effect (delayed senescence) occurs in some potato varieties. ChlSPAD at the loss of half the maximum plant cover during senescence (between 1040 and 1170 °C days) was high and negatively correlated with final yield in all irrigation treatments. Our findings suggest that during senescence, chlorophyll increment is not related to a rise of carbon assimilation (non-functional stay-green), but could be associated with an oxidative stress occurrence, ultimately reducing yield.

Two on-farm experiments were conducted to: (i) determine the effect of shaded, short-term storage at 1990 and 2930 m a.s.l. in the Andean highlands; and (ii) address the effects of a traditional sunlight exposure (‘sunning’) on the carbohydrate composition in the \{DM\} of tuberous yacon roots. After a 6-day shade storage \{FOS\} concentrations were smaller at the lower (36–48% of DM) than at the higher altitude (39–58% of DM). After 12 days \{FOS\} concentrations were nearly equal at both sites (27–39% of DM). The concentration of free sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose) increased accordingly from 29–34 to 48–52%. During the 6-day sunning experiment \{FOS\} concentrations decreased from 50–62 to 29–44% and free sugars increased from 29–34 to 45–51%. The results indicate that partial hydrolysis of oligofructans starts shortly after harvest. Storage in highland environments should wherever possible exploit the cooler temperatures at higher altitudes. Sunning of yacon’s tuberous roots effectively reduces much of the roots’ water content, in this experiment 40%, and thus allows energy to be saved if yacon is processed into dehydrated products. "

Quantitative modeling is contrasted with conceptual or physical modeling, and four categories of model studies are presented. Procedural studies focus on model experimentation. Descriptive studies use models to learn about landscapes in general. Postdictive and predictive try to correctly simulate the evolution of real landscapes, respectively in the past (with calibration) or in the future (with calibrated models). The geomorphic process is a central concept in landscape evolution modeling. We discuss problems with the field-based definition of these processes from a modelling perspective. After the classification of 117 landscape evolution studies in these categories, we find that descriptive studies are most common, and predictive studies are least common. In the remainder of the chapter, we list and review the 117 studies. In procedural studies, attention has been focussed at production methods for digital landscapes, spatial resolution and the role of sinks and depressions. Descriptive studies focussed mainly on surface–tectonic interactions, sensitivity to external forcing, and the definition of crucial field observations from model results. Postdictive and predictive studies operate mainly in time-forward mode and are sometimes validated (postdictive studies of soil redistribution over centennial to millennial timescales). Finally, we look ahead to the future of landscape evolution modeling, arguing for a larger role for complexity research, predictive studies and uncertainty analysis, process definition and feedbacks to and from other fields (including ecology).

In the present study, long-term stress memory was tested on tuber yield and drought tolerance related traits in three potato varieties (Unica, Désirée and Sarnav) with contrasted yields under water restriction. Seed tubers produced by plants grown under non-restricted (non-primed tubers) and restricted (primed tubers) water conditions were sown and exposed to similar watering treatments. Tuber yield and leaf greenness of plants from primed and non-primed seeds as well as tuber carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C) and antioxidant activity (AA) responses to watering treatments were compared. Higher tuber yield, both under non-restricted and restricted water regimes, was produced by primed Sarnav plants. The decrease of tuber yield and Δ13C with water restriction was lower in primed Unica plants. Long-term stress memory consequently appears to be highly genotype-dependent in potato. Its expression in plants originated from primed tubers and facing water restriction seems to be positively associated to the degree of inherent capability of the cultivar to yield under water restriction. However, other effects of priming appear to be genotype-independent as priming enhanced the tuber \{AA\} in response to water restriction in the three varieties. "

Reducing the supplementary water to one half, under both soil-climate conditions tested, did not affect fresh tuber yield; whereas water use efficiency (WUE) was equally incremented by all the reduced water treatments. When this reduction in the amount of supplementary water was managed through the \{PRD\} system, the distribution of moisture in the soil seemed to be improved and the potential evaporation was decreased due to the reduced evaporative surface exposed by PRD. The results showed that application of irrigation water per unit area can be reduced relative to common practice in Inner Mongolia and Gansu, maintaining the tuber yields currently obtained by local farmers. A further reduction in the amount of supplemental water, without a substantial decrease in yield, might be feasible with the \{PRD\} technique but this may require a more sophisticated irrigation management; and further research to estimate the cost-benefit ratio of such sophistication is needed. Results also showed that under low precipitation and low water retention capacity, the use of plastic mulching and a potato variety selected for drought-prone environments can make the difference for maintaining a high yield while reducing the wasteful use of the water resources.

abstract = "Abstract Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is a major food commodity becoming increasingly important for food security, especially in the developing world. The rising demand for potatoes combined with yield gaps and potential adverse impacts from climate change call for strategies for yield improvement and environmental adaptation. Crop growth models can help identify and assess such strategies. In this study, the \{SUBSTOR\} potato model was used in a systematic assessment of all cultivar parameters in the model in a range of environments including temperate, subtropical, and tropical regions to identify options for future crop improvement and to develop strategies for climate change adaptation in potato production. Our results show that yield responses to changes in cultivar parameters are specific to the environment. Some changes are less effective in subtropical and tropical environments and more effective in increasing yields in temperate environments. Solar radiation, day length, and temperature are the environmental factors that constrain the effectiveness of cultivar parameters in changing yields. The simulated variation in yields among environments was larger than the variation from changes in cultivar parameters. The impact of cultivar parameter changes on yield also varied with the cultivar parameter. The potential tuber growth rate was the cultivar parameter with the strongest effect on yields. Changes in the potential tuber growth rate parameter can lead to large yield changes in tropical highlands and temperate environments that have high solar radiation to ensure sufficient assimilate production for a larger sink. Results also suggest that improving crop management (e.g., N input) is more important for increasing yields than the potential in cultivar improvement. The study showed that crop modeling can help assess alternative strategies of yield improvement and support targeting and prioritization of efforts to improve crop productivity across different environments, based on an improved understanding of genotype by environment by management interactions. Results also showed how crop models can yield insights relevant for climate change adaptation even when only using weather data of the current climate. "

It is estimated that 250 million children under the age of five years suffer from clinical VAD. The effects of \{VAD\} include eye damage, weakened immunity and general increases in the incidence and severity of infectious diseases and mortality associated with e.g. birth-related complications, measles and diarrhoea among children. Biofortification is an essential strategy to alleviate \{VAD\} by incorporation of micronutrients into food staples through conventional breeding processes. However, vitamin A biofortification involves changes in other product attributes such as colour and taste that may be undesirable to some consumers. This study investigated how information about vitamin A biofortification influences the expected and actual sensory evaluation and the emotions evoked through actual tasting. For this, 501 randomly selected caregivers of children aged less than five years or pregnant women in western Kenya participated in a field information experiment combined with sensory testing of vitamin A-biofortified orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP). Surprisingly, the results showed that detailed information about nutritional benefits decreased consumer acceptance. Information about attribute drawbacks had discriminatory effects only in relation to expected taste and experienced texture. The findings indicated that the appropriateness of the nutritional aspect of \{OFSP\} was related to the information treatment and to household food insecurity status, but not to income or age of participants. An EmoSemio profile indicated a positive effect of nutrition information on emotions that did not correspond to the sensory assessment. These results raise important questions relating to how nutrition information should be provided to generate consumer acceptance and adoption of OFSP. "

Yet planning such multi-sectoral programs and designing appropriate evaluations, to respond to different disciplinary cultures of evidence, remain a challenge. We describe the context, program development process, and evaluation design of the Mama \{SASHA\} project (Sweetpotato Action for Security and Health in Africa) which promoted production and consumption of a bio-fortified, orange-fleshed sweetpotato (OFSP). In planning the program we drew upon information from needs assessments, stakeholder consultations, and a first round of the implementation evaluation of a pilot project. The multi-disciplinary team worked with partner organizations to develop a program theory of change and an impact pathway which identified aspects of the program that would be monitored and established evaluation methods. Responding to the growing demand for greater rigour in impact evaluations, we carried out quasi-experimental allocation by health facility catchment area, repeat village surveys for assessment of change in intervention and control areas, and longitudinal tracking of individual mother-child pairs. Mid-course corrections in program implementation were informed by program monitoring, regular feedback from implementers and partners’ meetings. To assess economic efficiency and provide evidence for scaling we collected data on resources used and project expenses. Managing the multi-sectoral program and the mixed methods evaluation involved bargaining and trade-offs that were deemed essential to respond to the array of stakeholders, program funders and disciplines involved.

Mulch, although suppressing weed growth, favoured both crop emergence and the stand of tuber-bearing plants at final harvest. Canopy development, crop cover and light interception over the season were almost invariably improved by mulch. Tuber initiation, when measured, was earlier and tuber growth rates greater for mulched plants. Tuber yield was consistently increased by mulch in all but two experiments, averaging 25% over all experiments. Yield improvements due to mulch were less evident at the hottest site, where high soil temperature (&gt; 25 °C) during the night at tuber depth, high natural reflectivity of the soil (0.18), a large sand fraction in the soil, and cloudy days and nights, were considered responsible for inconsistent benefits of mulch on tuber yield. At another site, where mulch was also tested during the rainy season, yield was on average improved by mulch in a proportion similar to that during the dry season at the same site. Mulch was particularly beneficial in improving all measured aspects of crop growth and yield when combined with agronomic treatments that, on their own, predisposed plants to greater heat stress. For example, mulch was more effective in ridge than on the flat plantings, at planting depth less than 7 cm, at lower plant populations and for small-canopied determinate clones. Environmental and biological criteria for the successful use of mulch for potato cultivation in hot climates are discussed. "

Shade treatments comprised (a) artificial screens imposed throughout the season of the potato crop; (b) relay-cropping with maize for a short (10–30-day) period following planting of potato; and (c) planting maize and potato simultaneously such that maize shaded potato from 40 days after planting onwards. Variables tested included periodicity of shading throughout the day, duration of shade, and density of shade, the last-mentioned accomplished by variations in population and rectangularity of maize plantings. Artificial shade (50% reduction of light transmission) during midday or in the afternoon favoured tuber yield more than morning shade, and shaded plants were in general 35–39% more efficient than non-shaded plants in their conversion of available solar energy to tuber fresh weight. When relay-cropped with maize, potato plant population at harvest was superior to that of a sole crop of potato, an effect mediated through faster emergence and achievement of a greater maximum population and not through differential survival of shaded or sole potato plants. Enhanced final population was often offset by reduced individual yield per plant, particularly at dense or extended periods of shade, and shade for 20 days appeared optimal, although during the dry season 30-day periods were not always detrimental to yield. Tuber yields of relay-cropped plots ranged from +89% to −53% those of sole potato plots, the latter following a 31-day period of shade at a density of 4.76 maize plants m−2 during the rainy season. Yields of maize increased with increase of maize planting population, and at a given population were greater for square than for rectangular plantings. Tuber yield of potato planted simultaneously with maize was not significantly less than potato yield of sole crops until maize population exceeded 0.6 plants m−2, i.e. the population reducing transmission by more than 30% to the understory potato crop. In a replacement-series experiment, at the hottest site, tuber yield was greater in mixed than in sole plots at 1:11 and 1:9 maize:potato proportions (375 and 391 g m−2 vs 273 g m−2 for sole plots) and the maximum reduction in tuber yield at the densest maize population (1:6) at any site was 34% (1030 and 1563 g m−2 for mixed and sole plot). However, land equivalent ratios always exceeded unity since maize yield in mixtures was disproportionally greater than yield based on per-plant yields of sole-maize plots. In relay cropping treatments, and those in which maize and potato were simultaneously planted, a delicate balance existed between the ability of shade to reduce air and soil temperatures, without causing reductions in tuberization and photosynthesis. Our results indicate that there would appear to be potential for intercropping potato and maize in the hot tropics. "

Shade was provided (a) artificially throughout the potato crop, (b) by a maize crop for a short (10–30-day) period following planting (relay cropping), or (c) by a maize crop during the last 30 days of the potato crop (mixed cropping). Increase of shade effected a linear reduction of soil temperature (7-cm depth) and significantly hastened emergence in all artificial-shade and relay experiments but one. Irrespective of sites, experiments, or cultivars, days to 50% emergence (y) was closely related to the accumulated heat sum at tuber depth during the day (x,Σ°h&gt;20°C, 08.00–18.00 h) through the quadratic relationship y=17.65−0.215x+0.00196x2(r2=0.704). Marked delay of emergence was noted when the weighted daytime soil temperature exceeded 30°C. Shade treatments also resulted in conservation of soil moisture, which may have contributed to improved emergence. Plant height was positively related to intensity and duration of shade in relay and artificial shade treatments, and tuber initiation was delayed by shade, despite the earlier emergence. Branching and dry-matter production were reduced by shade, in a quantitative manner depending upon shade intensity, except in one apparently shade-tolerant clone, DTO-33. Later-season shading in mixed-cropping experiments resulted in a reduction of up to 40% transmission of irradiance to understorey potato plants. "

The sex pheromone of this pest consists of two substances. The first is trans-4, cis-7, tridecadien-1-ol acetate (also called \{PTM\} 1) and the second active substance is trans-4, cis-7, cis-10-tridecatrien-1-ol acetate (also called \{PTM\} 2). Results on monitoring, mass trapping and mating disruption using this pheromone are reported. Of the trap designs tested, no significant differences (P&gt;0.05) in trap capture were observed between the water-pan trap and the funnel trap set at ground level and at 40 and 80 cm of elevation. Of the eight ratios of \{PTM\} 1 and \{PTM\} 2 tested, all were significantly superior to the use of virgin-female traps. Highest captures were obtained by using a 9:1 or 1:1.5 ratio of \{PTM\} 1:2. The attractiveness of 9:1 ratio appears to drop after 90 days of field use. The 1:1.5 ratio remained attractive for 90 days and beyond. Storage at −5°C for 2 months did not diminish the attractiveness of this pheromone blend. The presence of impurities \{EZ\} 4,7–13: \{OH\} or \{EZZ\} 4,7,10–13: \{OH\} reduced trap captures. Unpurified pheromone 1:1.5 at 15-mg loading was as effective as the pure pheromone. In monitoring studies, tuber damage of clone \{DTO\} 33 was related to trap catches. Mass trapping demonstrated the feasibility of direct control in field and stores. In field studies, the presence of synthetic pheromones reduced the catch in surrounding water-pan traps baited with virgin females by 97%. Trap densities of one funnel trap per 225 m2 reduced tuber damage by 45% when compared with plots receiving normal insecticidal application with no pheromones. In storage trials, both water-pan and funnel trap were effective in reducing tuber damage. Microencapsulated pheromone spray significantly reduced larval infestation in stored tubers. "

Somatic embryogenesis is the most efficient method for regenerating genetically transformed sweetpotato plants, but is still limited by low efficiency and strong genotype dependency. In this study, based on a review of previous work, various growth regulators and gelling agents were assessed for an optimized three-stage protocol. Lateral meristems of sweetpotato cultivars ‘Jonathan’ and ‘Jewel’ were used to investigate: (i) the influence of the auxins 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) on the induction of sweetpotato somatic embryogenesis, (ii) the effect of the abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic acid (GA3) on the development and maturation of somatic embryos, (iii) the effect of \{GA3\} on development of mature embryos into plantlets, and (iv) the influence of two gelling agents (agar and Gelrite) on different embryogenic phases during all stages of the protocol. Among the treatments evaluated, best results were obtained when growing the explants on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 1.3 mg/l 2,4,5-T (in the dark) during the first stage, transferring the calli to media with 1 mg/l \{ABA\} at the second stage and then cultivating them on 0.424 mg/l \{GA3\} for plant development. However, no significant differences were found between gelling agents. "

It does this by examining how social and gender norms in communities, including the distribution of power, resources and responsibilities, may have an impact on the ability of farmer groups to empower female group participants. In total, 35 sex-disaggregated focus group discussions with farmers, and 4 interviews with extension officers were conducted in Dedza and Ntcheu districts. Data on social and gender norms that may promote or constrain the participation of both men and women in groups and limit their benefits were collected and analyzed. A social relations approach, focusing on gender relations, was used to analyze the data. A key finding was that, underlying gender and cultural norms may affect the ability of women to participate actively in groups as well as to take advantage of the empowerment potential of groups. Findings suggest that while farmer groups have the potential to empower women, reproduction of societal gender roles within groups may result in male bias, constraining the ability of groups to empower women. Key implications are that agricultural research organizations interested in women's empowerment should work closely with partners who have experience in women's empowerment because farmer group participation may not empower women if underlying social issues that result in gender inequality are not addressed.

The paper argues that this is due to the neglect of market opportunity as a driving force for lowland use and the agro-ecological gradient as an important modifier. The gradient is linked to three modifiers of lowland use: the relative value of lowland cropping with respect to other livelihood strategies; the biophysical productivity of lowland cropping; and the access rights to lowlands. The paper applies a regression-based decomposition framework to analyze the factors affecting lowland use in West Africa. It uses community-level data from 1014 geo-referenced lowland units around four urban centers along an agro-ecological gradient in Côte d’Ivoire and Mali. Tobit models are used to explain the extent of lowland non-use in terms of seasonal fallow, its diversity in terms of rice and other crop cultivation and its land use intensity in terms of double cropping. A multinomial logit model is used to explain lowland cropping systems. Results highlight a positive link between closeness to urban markets and the extent, diversity and intensity of lowland use. The agro-ecological gradient in West Africa has a pronounced influence on agricultural lowland use, which tends to be more widespread, diverse and intensive proceeding towards the drier ecologies. Lowland development did increase the extent and intensity of lowland use, but by favoring the cultivation of rice, had a negative impact on the diversity of lowland use. Lowland use is also associated with migrants, particularly in the more humid ecologies. Research, policy and development implications are explored. An important lesson for scaling out is that it is not proximity to urban markets per se, but the associated market access which is the key driver for more significant lowland use. "

This study assessed trait relationships among 196 common bean genotypes exposed to stresses for drought and field infestation of bean fly or bean stem maggot (BSM). The study was carried out at two locations and data was analyzed with linear correlation, path coefficient and genotype × trait biplot analyses. Multiple trait data related to mechanisms of drought and bean fly tolerance were collected on 196 genotypes grown under i) water deficit at mid-pod fill, or ii) unprotected against bean fly; iii) irrigated, well watered conditions, or iv) bean fly protection with chemicals. Seed yield exhibited positive and significant correlations with leaf chlorophyll content, vertical root pulling resistance, pod harvest index, pods per plant and seeds per pod at both phenotypic and genotypic levels under stress and non-stress conditions. Genotypic correlations of traits with seed yield were greater than their respective phenotypic correlations across environments indicating the greater contribution of genotypic factors to the trait correlation. Pods per plant and seeds per pod had high positive direct effects on seed yield both under stress and non-stress whereas pods per plant had the highest indirect effect on seed yield through pod harvest index under stress. In general, our results suggest that vertical root pulling resistance and pod harvest index are important selection objectives for improving seed yield in common beans under non-stress and stress conditions, and particularly useful for drought and \{BSM\} tolerance evaluation.

The effect of farming site on total carotenoids was significant; however, the amount of β-carotene was not different over three testing sites. Boiling of roots for 30 min caused a reduction in total carotenoids which varied by cultivar; however, further boiling for up to 60 min did not exacerbate the reduction in total carotenoids. "

Mitigating this constraint requires the selection of resilient varieties that withstand drought threats to common bean production. This study assessed the drought response of 64 small red-seeded genotypes of common bean grown in a lattice design replicated twice under contrasting moisture regimes, terminal drought stress and non-stress, in Ethiopia during the dry season from November 2014 to March 2015. Multiple plant traits associated with drought were assessed for their contribution to drought adaptation of the genotypes. Drought stress determined by a drought intensity index was moderate (0.3). All the assessed traits showed significantly different genotypic responses under drought stress and non-stress conditions. Eleven genotypes significantly (P ≤ 0.05) outperformed the drought check cultivar under both drought stress and non-stress conditions in seed yielding potential. Seed yield showed positive and significant correlations with chlorophyll meter reading, vertical root pulling resistance force, number of pods per plant, and seeds per pod under both soil moisture regimes, indicating their potential use in selection of genotypes yielding well under drought stress and non-stress conditions. Clustering analysis using Mahalanobis distance grouped the genotypes into four groups showing high and significant inter-cluster distance, suggesting that hybridization between drought-adapted parents from the groups will provide the maximum genetic recombination for drought tolerance in subsequent generations.

Sweet potato is seen as a potential remedial crop for these farmers because of its high productivity and low input requirements, while its usefulness for both food and feed (dual-purpose) make it attractive in areas where land availability is declining. In this paper, we develop and apply a ‘minimum-data’ methodology to assess ex ante the economic viability of adopting dual-purpose sweet potato in Vihiga district, western Kenya. The methodology uses and integrates available socio-economic and bio-physical data on farmers’ land use allocation, production, and input and output use. Spatially heterogeneous characteristics of the current system regarding resources and productivity are analyzed to assess the profitability of substituting dual-purpose sweet potato for other crops currently grown for food and feed. Results indicate that a substantial number of farmers in the study area could benefit economically from adopting dual-purpose sweet potato. Depending on assumptions made, the adoption rate, expressed as the percentage of the total land under adopting farms, is between 55% and 80%. The analysis shows that the adoption rate is likely to vary positively with the average total yield of dual-purpose sweet potato, the harvest index (the ratio between tuber and fodder yields), the price of milk, and the nutritional value of available fodder. This study demonstrates the usefulness of the minimum-data methodology and provides evidence to support the hypothesis that dissemination of the dual-purpose sweet potato could help improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers operating in mixed crop–livestock systems in east Africa.

With the aim of increasing production and productivity, new irrigation systems are required. This is causing problems, because the standard \{FAO\} formula for calculating reference evapotranspiration \{ET0\} (Penman–Monteith) has not been calibrated for altitudes above 3000 m, so that the crop coefficient Kc values for quinoa must be adapted from other crops such as barley and wheat. Additionally, in cases where water availability for quinoa does not reach the levels of crop evapotranspiration ETc, the reaction to drought stress and water use efficiency has not been quantified. In order to estimate irrigation requirements of quinoa in a representative site of the Bolivian Altiplano, the crop water requirement, the crop coefficient (Kc), the yield response factor (Ky), and the relative yield, was derived from lysimeter and field data. The Penman–Monteith formula for the conditions of a representative site of the Bolivian Altiplano was calibrated in relation to grass evapotranspiration data, used as reference crop, from lysimeters. The results showed that an excellent agreement exists between measured and calculated \{ET0\} values when an estimate of dew point temperature, derived from minimum air temperature, was used in the calculation instead of recorded humidity data. The Kc for quinoa, obtained from lysimeter data, varied over the growing season being 0.5 in the initial growth stage, 1.00 in the mid-season stage and 0.70 at harvest. The seasonal yield response factor (Ky) of 0.67 was estimated from data on grain yield and crop evapotranspiration obtained in lysimeters. Relative yields obtained from lysimeters, sparsely irrigated and non-irrigated fields, indicate that it may be more profitable to irrigate larger extensions of land using the maximum water use efficiency approach than to irrigate with the same total amount of water to a much smaller area applying maximum water use.

Between 1000 ka and 345 ka the time-averaged uplift rate was 0.072 mm a− 1, between 345 ka and 50 ka it increased to 0.278 mm a− 1, accelerating to 0.42 mm a− 1 since 50 ka. The fluvial terrace sequence did not yield clear sedimentary records or other datable material. However, although others have disputed the existence of marine terraces in this study region, a pattern of accelerating regional uplift, superimposed onto glacio-eustatic sea-level changes, is substantiated as the only possible mechanism for maintaining the considerable relief and the active denudation processes inland. The observed uplift is similar to that in other regions where the uplift has been attributed to coupling between surface processes and lower-crustal flow, making this a likely mechanism in the North Island of New Zealand. Regarding the fluvial terrace sequence, the proposed general model is of an actively incising river, carving out on average one strath terrace every ~ 16,000 years. The incision phases are reactivated by sea-level lowering and interrupted by net aggradation events due to landslides triggered by cyclones and/or fires within the catchment; volcanic ash falls also cause transient increases in sediment supply.

Average cereal grain yield of the crop-production-oriented rotation was 5% higher than that in the animal-production-oriented one. However, this difference was not significant. Conventional nutrient management systems produced 6% and 32% more cereal grain than the integrated and ecological nutrient management systems, respectively. Difference to the ecological nutrient management system was significant.

However, by taking into account 30% surcharge on the ecologically produced products, the greatest gross margin/crop was achieved under ecological nutrient management. Gross margin/crop in the conventional and the integrated nutrient management systems did not differ significantly. A significant part of the mineral fertilizers can be replaced with animal manures, legume undercropping or green fallowing. Grass-legume leys also enabled succcessful reduction in mineral fertilization. "

In four on-station trials of season-long mass-trapping of both species of weevil in 0.5 ha sweetpotato plots with 100 jerry can traps ha−1 (50 traps for each species placed alternately), populations of male weevils were reduced by up to 89%, compared to un-trapped control plots.

The energy cost of the various activities involved in the process of harvesting the pasture to transform it into animal product can be estimated through an energy balance. This cost would be the difference between the metabolizable energy intake (MEI) and the energy expenditures for maintenance (MEm), temperature regulation (MEtr), and the energy for production (MEp). Each of the \{ME\} has its own net energy (NE) and its associated efficiency (K). When MEI&gt;MEm+MEtr+MEp, the difference is attributable to the energy dissipated during grazing. The efficiency of converting the energy consumed into animal products depends on the magnitude of the dissipation. The inefficiency is associated with the energy spent in locomotion and the stress produced when there is low availability of energy in the pasture. This paper presents a method to quantify the dissipation of energy by grazing animals by considering it as a function of available energy. Such an understanding is required in order to develop management strategies to increase conversion efficiency. "

This paper presents the biomass, nutrient content, and persistence results of farmer managed trials with late maturing M. pruriens var. utilis (L.) D.C. and an early maturing unclassified Mucuna cultivar relative to a short season natural fallow (control). From August until December 1998 and from June 1999 until March 2000, research was conducted at different farm locations in the Forest–Savannah Transitional Zone and in the Guinea Savannah Zone of Ghana. The following parameters were evaluated: (1) accumulation of above-ground Mucuna biomass during the short rainy season; (2) atmospheric \{N2\} fixation during the same period; (3) Mucuna seed yield components; (4) persistence of above-ground Mucuna and natural fallow biomass throughout the dry season; (5) nutrient concentration and nutrient accumulation of Mucuna and natural fallow at the beginning and the end of the dry season; and (6) percentage ground cover by various biomass components throughout the dry season. During the first 2 months of establishment, M. pruriens grew slowly, producing 163 kg ha−1 above-ground biomass after 30 days and 1472 kg ha−1 after 60 days, but produced 4003 kg dry matter ha−1 after 90 days. Atmospheric nitrogen (N2) fixed by late maturing M. pruriens was estimated at 107.7 kg ha−1 but only 46.1 kg ha−1 for the early maturing Mucuna cultivar. The estimated amount of \{N2\} fixed was significantly correlated with the amount of Mucuna biomass produced with \{R2\} = 0.75 for the early maturing cultivar and \{R2\} = 0.69 for M. pruriens. The nutrient uptake of macronutrients other than N in the Mucuna fallow did not differ significantly from that of the natural fallow treatment for either cultivar. Following a linear regression model, total above-ground biomass on M. pruriens plots declined by 503 kg ha−1 every 4 weeks from November until March, while the biomass on plots planted with the early maturing Mucuna cultivar declined by 911 kg ha−1. While ground coverage (including weeds and crop residues) on fields planted with M. pruriens was still 89.7% at the end of the dry season, coverage on fields planted with the early maturing Mucuna variety averaged only 72%. It was concluded that late maturing Mucuna varieties planted as a relay intercrop in maize (Zea mays) in June can be more easily integrated into existing farming systems than early maturing ones planted in August/September because Mucuna planting does not compete with other farming activities but can be combined with the second weeding of maize. Moreover, it is suggested that the major advantage of a Mucuna fallow is based on the option of not having to burn vegetation in preparation for the next cropping season. The few emerging weeds can be easily slashed as compared to a natural fallow which produces large amounts of lignified plant material. Therefore, this slash-and-mulch technology leads to reduced nutrient losses. "

Storage trials conducted under simulated tropical marketing conditions showed that root shrivelling due to weight loss and rotting are the two major forms of deterioration. Measurement of respiration rates indicated that under these conditions weight loss is primarily (86%) due to water loss. Under these environmental conditions rotting is promoted by water loss, which is therefore the driving force of deterioration. For the cultivars studied, a large range in rates of weight loss was found, which was consistent between seasons, suggesting that breeding for extended shelf-life is feasible. A range of root quality characteristics were assessed, including dry matter content, sugar content, surface area, initial weight, rough weevil (Blosyrus spp.) damage, latex production, cortex thickness and hardness of the tissue. Multiple regression models for rates of weight loss indicated that dry matter content and root monosaccharide content were important controlling factors. Cultivars with low dry matter content and with high monosaccharide levels lose less weight. The two characteristics are related, and we do not know which more directly affects rates of weight loss. Other root characteristics were less important, although it was found that root size and pre-harvest rough weevil damage had significant effects. "

The capabilities of the model are explored through an application for a forested 17 km2 study catchment in Northern New Zealand for which digital elevation data are available with a grid resolution of 25 × 25 m. The model predicts the spatial pattern of landslide susceptibility within the simulated catchment and subsequently applies a spatial algorithm for the redistribution of failed material by effectively changing the corresponding digital elevation data after each timestep on the basis of a scenario of triggering rainfall events, relative landslide hazard and trajectories with runout criteria for failed slope material. The resulting model will form a landslide module within the dynamic landscape evolution model LAPSUS. The model forms a spatially explicit method to address the effects of shallow landslide erosion and sedimentation because digital elevation data are adapted between timesteps and on- and off-site effects over the years can be simulated in this way. By visualization of the modelling results in a \{GIS\} environment, the shifting pattern of upslope and downslope (in) stability, triggering of new landslides and the resulting slope retreat by soil material redistribution due to former mass movements can be simulated and assessed.

This study was undertaken to help understand quinoa’s response to various intensities and durations of frost under different levels of relative humidity (RH). The effect of frost on seed yield and plant death rate was studied, and content of soluble sugars, proteins, and free proline, was analyzed, in order to develop criteria for the selection of cultivars with improved resistance to frost. On the basis of greenhouse and phytotron experiments, it was concluded that at the two-leaf stage, cultivars from the altiplano of Peru, 3800 m above sea level, tolerated −8 °C for 4 h, whereas a cultivar from the Andean valleys tolerated the same temperature for only 2 h. At −4 °C, plant death rate increased from 25% at high relative humidity to 56% at low \{RH\} After a frost treatment of −4 °C applied at the two-leaf stage, final seed yield was reduced by 9% compared to control plants not exposed to frost. For the same treatment applied at the 12-leaf and flowering stages, yield reductions were 51 and 66%, respectively, indicating that frost for 2 h or more during anthesis caused significant damage to the plants. In general, an increased level of soluble sugars implied a greater tolerance to frost, resulting in higher yields. "

Mean minimum air temperature ranged from 22°C in late November and in March to 20°C in January. Mean maximum temperatures ranged from 27 to 30°C. Larger-sized seed gave superior tuber yields averaging over 21 t ha−1 for the best treatments in five experiments. Highland seed constantly produced superior yields primarily because of better plant survival. All three cultivars evaluated in this respect (Sequoia, Desiree and LT-5) had similar responses to seed size. Desprouting did not improve yields of well-sprouted highland seed. Seed rates from 1.5 to 2.5 t ha−1 gave similar yields regardless of seed size from 20 to 50 mm diameter. Seed rates of 1.0 and 3.0 t ha−1 significantly reduced and increased yields, respectively. Increased plant densities of up to 80 000 plants ha−1 improved tuber yields. This coincided with a stem ha−1 population of over 200 000. The most important factor in obtaining maximum yields was canopy duration. In five experiments, yield = −1.98 + 0.05x canopy duration with \{R2\} = 0.67. Increased branching provided good canopy development at lower plant populations. Double-row beds enhanced yields by up to 3 t ha−1 over single-row ridges. Shallow planting gave faster emergence and canopy development but it did not improve yields. It resulted in more tuber greening. Hilling reduced greening at shallow planting. Results of the twelve experiments show the possibility of producing potatoes in an isohyperthermic environment. With optimum agronomic practices, yields of over 20 t ha−1 can be obtained with cultivars such as Cosima. "

They were planted on five dates from early to late dry season (October-January) during two years, at 14° N lat. in The Philippines. Another objective, studied during the second year, was to compare seed produced under hot lowland conditions and stored for 8 months, with newly sprouted seed grown under cool highland temperatures. Potato plants grew faster and tuberized earlier for later planting dates. Physiologically young seed of Cosima and DTO-2 always produced plants with superior canopies. Tuber bulking was linear up to about 70 days after planting. Total dry-matter production was highest with young Cosima seed, exceeding 100 g plant−1 for all planting dates except the last. Old Cosima and DTO-2 seed generally produced between 80 and 100 g dry matter plant−1. Final tuber yields were highest with the mid dry-season planting (December) during both years with highland seed Cosima yielding 30 t ha−1. Lowland seed of Cosima yielded over 21 t ha−1 for the first 4 planting dates, significantly less than yields from highland seed. Yield differences increased with later planting. Although highland seed is recommended, lowland seed is an alternative for poor farmers. The final tuber yield of Cosima decreased by 12% with a minimum air temperature rise from 18.5 to 21° C, while DTO-2 was more adversely affected. Based on these results, minimum ait temperatures above 21 °C are unsuitable for potato production. Total intercepted solar radiation was positively correlated with final tuber yields and total dry-matter production. Efficiency of conversion into dry matter was about 70% of that in cool temperate climates. "

The study concludes that there are three possible main scenarios of changes that may simultaneously occur: (1) the P. operculella damage potential will progressively increase in all regions where the pest already prevails today with an excessive increase in warmer cropping regions of the tropics and subtropics. In regions where P. operculella is established and develops &gt;4 generations per year, economic losses are likely to occur; under the current climate, &gt;4 generations are developed on 30.1% of the total potato production area worldwide, which will increase until the year 2050 to 42.4%, equal to an increase of 2,409,974 ha of potato under new infestation. (2) A range expansion in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere with additionally 8.6% (699,680 ha), 4.2% (32,873 ha), and 2.7% (234,404 ha) of the potato production area under higher risk in Asia, North America, and Europe, with moderate increases of its damage potential. (3) A range expansion in tropical temperate mountainous regions with a moderate increase of its damage potential; e.g., in Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru 44,281 ha, 9569 ha, and 39,646 ha of potato will be under new risk of infestation. The \{ILCYM\} software allowed a detailed analysis of possible climate-change-induced changes in temperature on P. operculella distribution and damage potential. Further, this tool offers means of overcoming limitations in predictions and mapping experienced with climate data interpolation and resolution by spatial point-by-point simulations at locations of interest. The methodology is proposed as a very helpful tool for adaptation planning in integrated pest management. "

Overgrazing and range species loss are increased by herd size (a measure of wealth) but reduced by rotational grazing, which is size-neutral. Deforestation––the only case of a clear poverty–environment link––results from fuel wood harvesting by the poorest households. Social and human capital variables favor the choice of more sustainable practices. When government investment is unavailable, change agents in poor areas can limit natural resource degradation by diffusing knowledge about natural resource stewardship using affordable practices. "

The overall aim of the practice is to maintain a supply of roots in the ground for the longest possible period. In a series of four trials, once-over harvests at different intervals after planting and a simulated piecemeal harvesting treatment are compared for yield and quality losses caused by sweetpotato weevils (Cylas puncticollis and C. brunneus). For the once-over harvests, the percentage of damaged roots increased linearly the longer the harvest was delayed. Losses ranged between 3% at a harvest 3.5 months after planting (MAP) and 73% at 9.5 MAP. The total yield and undamaged yield for the piecemeal harvesting treatments were comparable to the yields at the optimum harvest times for once-over harvesting at 6–7.5 MAP.

The respective performance of transplanted materials (i.e., true potato seed (TPS) seedlings or rooted stem cuttings) produced in situ in the warm tropics were compared with that of genetically identical seedling tubers (tubers produced from seedlings) or seed tubers. Seed and seedling tubers had been previously produced under optimal cool conditions. Transplanted materials achieved lower maximum leaf area index than did tuber materials (1.3–2.2 vs. 2.7) but relative growth rates of cuttings and seedlings were greater. This was in part due to the greater net assimilation rate of cuttings and to greater leaf:stem ratio for both compared with plants originating from tubers. Stolon and tuber formation were greater in seed tubers than in cuttings and in seedlings versus seedling tubers. On average, seedlings produced 14 tubers per plant, apical cuttings 12, seedling tubers 8, and stem cuttings 6. Tuber yields within a genotype were statistically similar for crops from seed tubers or cuttings and for crops from seedling tubers or seedlings. However, the proportion of marketable (i.e., &gt; 3.5 cm diameter) tubers was approximately 12% less in the crops from seed tuber and seedlings compared with those from cuttings and seedling tubers, respectively. Within a genotype, the crop duration in the field was similar whatever the type of planting material. Maximum yields, at 23 t/ha in warm sites, were still below those of temperate potato crops, but could be achieved equally well with transplanted in situ-produced materials or imported cool-climate seed tubers.

C’est également une source d’amidon très résistant, pouvant être optimisée selon la méthode de cuisson. La pomme de terre présente des niveaux significatifs de vitamine C, réduits à différents degrés par la cuisson, selon la variété et le mode de cuisson. C’est également une source de minéraux, avec une prédominance du potassium, le fer et le zinc étant les minéraux revêtant le plus d’intérêt, car le choix de la variété et la sélection visant à accroître les concentrations de ces micronutriments pourraient contribuer à réduire la malnutrition dans les régions où la pomme de terre est très consommée. Selon la variété consommée, la pomme de terre peut constituer une bonne source d’antioxydants, tels que les caroténoïdes et les polyphénols, susceptibles de participer à la prévention des maladies dégénératives et liées à l’âge. Les variétés à la chair très jaune contiennent des concentrations élevées de zéaxanthine, un caroténoïde participant à la protection contre la dégénérescence maculaire. Les pommes de terre à chair violette sont une source importante d’anthocyanes, un pigment naturel possédant des propriétés antioxydantes. Une méthode rapide et peu coûteuse utilisant la spectroscopie proche infrarouge a été utilisée avec succès pour une évaluation massive des macronutriments et des micronutriments, facilitant ainsi l’évaluation des ressources génétiques de pommes de terre et la sélection de lignées parentales au sein d’un programme de sélection visant à améliorer les qualités nutritionnelles de la pomme de terre. Summary Potato is a carbohydrate-rich, energy-providing food with little fat. It is also a source of high resistant starch that can be optimized depending on the preparation method. Potato has significant levels of vitamin C that are reduced after cooking to different extents depending on the variety and type of cooking. It is also a source of minerals, potassium being the predominant one and iron and zinc those of major interest since varietal choice or breeding for higher concentration of these micronutrients can contribute to reduce malnutrition in places where potato consumption is high. Depending on the variety consumed, potato can be a good source of antioxidants like carotenoids and polyphenols that can contribute to preventing both degenerative and age-related diseases. Deep yellow fleshed varieties contain high concentrations of zeaxanthin, a carotenoid involved in protection against macular degeneration. Purple fleshed potatoes are a source of anthocyanins, a natural pigment with anti-oxidative properties. A fast and non-expensive method based on \{NIRS\} analysis has been successfully applied for massive evaluation of potato macro and micronutrients, facilitating the evaluation of potato genetic resources and the selection of parental lines in a breeding program oriented to the improvement of the nutritional quality of potato.

We used multiple methods and data sources, principally a survey of 621 households spread across nine districts, and in-depth interviews with farmers in three villages located in three different districts. Our study revealed four main findings. Firstly, we found that although farmers were able to identify unhealthy \{SP\} plants, they were unable to tell the specific type of disease affecting the plants both from direct and photographic observations. Secondly, there exists considerable heterogeneity in the way farmers manage unhealthy plants in the field; some farmers were observed to follow management methods prescribed by plant pathologists, while others used traditional methods of managing a diseased plant. Thirdly, the following three factors were found to be the determinants of farmers' knowledge and management of \{SP\} diseases and plant root damage: (i) farmers' training in \{SP\} production and management; (ii) the number of plots which the woman of the household has control over; and (iii) household membership to a crop production association. Lastly, the location of farms is a strong determinant of farmers' satisfaction with \{SP\} vines; residing in areas in which sweet potato vines are widely available and in a village that is accessible by a primary road or tarmac road increases a farmer's satisfaction with sweet potato vines that are available in the farmers' farm during planting time.

Addressing adaptation in the context of small-scale, semi-subsistence agriculture raises special challenges. High data demands including site-specific bio-physical and economic data are an important constraint. This paper applies a new approach to impact assessment, the Tradeoff Analysis model for Multi-Dimensional Impact Assessment (TOA-MD), which simulates technology adoption and associated economic, environmental and social outcomes in a heterogeneous farm population for a regional impact assessment. The methodology uses the kinds of survey, experimental and modeled data that are typically available in countries where semi-subsistence systems are important, combined with future socio-economic scenarios based on new scenario pathway concepts being developed by the climate change and impact assessment modeling communities. Characteristics of current and future agricultural systems, including land use, output, output price, cost of production, and farm and household size are analyzed and compared for both current and projected future climate (2030), with and without adaptation, and for different socio-economic scenarios. The methodology is applied to two study areas in Kenya. These case studies show the potential of this approach to provide a flexible, generic framework that can use available and modeled data to evaluate climate impact and adaptation strategies under a range of socio-economic scenarios.

To understand why the rate of uptake of new technologies is so low, requires a strong understanding of what makes a good routine diagnostic tool to begin. This can be done by looking at the two most successfully established plant virus detection methods: enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and more recently introduced real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). By examining the characteristics of this pair of technologies, it becomes clear that they share many benefits, such as an industry standard format and high levels of repeatability and reproducibility. These combine to make methods that are accessible to testing labs, which are easy to establish and robust in their use, even with new and inexperienced users. Hence, to ensure the establishment of new techniques it is necessary to not only provide benefits not found with \{ELISA\} or real-time PCR, but also to provide a platform that is easy to establish and use. In plant virus diagnostics, recent developments can be clustered into three core areas: (1) techniques that can be performed in the field or resource poor locations (e.g., loop-mediated isothermal amplification LAMP); (2) multiplex methods that are able to detect many viruses in a single test (e.g., Luminex bead arrays); and (3) methods suited to virus discovery (e.g., next generation sequencing, NGS). Field based methods are not new, with Lateral Flow Devices (LFDs) for the detection being available for a number of years now. However, the widespread uptake of this technology remains poor. \{LAMP\} does offer significant advantages over LFDs, in terms of sensitivity and generic application, but still faces challenges in terms of establishment. It is likely that the main barrier to the uptake of field-based technologies is behavioural influences, rather than specific concerns about the performance of the technologies themselves. To overcome this, a new relationship will need to develop between centralised testing laboratories offering services and those requiring tests; a relationship which is currently in its infancy. Looking further into the future, virus discovery and multiplex methods seem to converge as \{NGS\} becomes ever cheaper, easier to perform and can provide high levels of multiplexing without the use of virus specific reagents. So ultimately the key challenge from a routine testing lab perspective will not be one of investment in platforms–which could even be outsourced to commercial sequencing services–but one of having the skills and expertise to analyse the large datasets generated and their subsequent interpretation. In conclusion, only time will tell which of the next-generation of methods currently in development will become the routine diagnostics of the future. This will be determined through a combination of factors. And while the technology itself will have to offer performance advantages over existing methods in order to supplant them, it is likely to be human factors e.g., the behaviours of end users, laboratories and policy makers, the availability of appropriate expertise, that ultimately determine which ones become established. Hence factors cannot be ignored and early engagement with diagnostic stakeholders is essential. "

Three examples of rice–vegetable integration are then explored in the light of this framework. These examples illustrate varying degrees of spatial and management integration, but little temporal integration. Temporal integration is constrained in large part by the limited degree of water control found in most West African lowlands. Research, policy and development implications are then explored. A major conclusion is that in the short-term integrated rice–vegetable production is unlikely to be an important part of a pro-poor development agenda. "

We have analyzed concentrations of iron, zinc, calcium, and phytic acid (as hexa- and penta-inositol phosphates) in 57 cereal-based \{CFs\} purchased in five countries each in Africa and Asia. Molar ratios of phytate:iron, phytate:zinc, and phytate:calcium were also calculated.

Despite fortification, only ∼4% of the \{CFs\} met the \{WHO\} estimated needs for breast-fed infants aged 9–11 months for iron, 2% for zinc, and ∼4% for calcium.

The boiling and roasting procedures were similar to traditional methods used in Kenya. Dried products, chips and flour, of the variety Zapallo were also analysed. The varieties differed in dry matter and β-carotene content (1240–10,800 μg/100 g fresh weight (FW)) and thus in vitamin A content (100–830 RE/100 g FW). As sweet potato roots are consumed after heating, the loss of all-trans-β-carotene during preparation should be taken into account. Boiling of roots of the selected varieties seemed to result in a higher true retention (TR) of all-trans-β-carotene than roasting and \{TR\} of all-trans-β-carotene seemed to be dependent on the variety (42–128%). Preparation of chips by drying resulted in a significant reduction of the all-trans-β-carotene content of approximately 21%, which was further reduced when flour was produced from chips. The varieties Tainung and SPK-004 can be recommended for consumption especially after boiling in order to enhance the vitamin A intake in Kenya. Both varieties have a high content of vitamin A, the losses after boiling are rather low and both varieties have high consumer acceptability. Industrial relevance The content and stability of β-carotene in sweet potato is an issue that is particularly important for developing countries with high prevalence of vitamin A deficiency. In order to prolong the shelf life of sweet potato, it is necessary to implement and develop industrial or small scale processing methods so that it is possible to produce sweet potato products with highest possible vitamin A values in these countries. In developed countries, focus is on innovation of new products with a good taste and a high health value. Consequently, sweet potato and sweet potato products might have a future as healthy foods in developed countries, and therefore there is a need to build up an industry that can provide the people in these countries with high quality sweet potato foods.

In this scenario, it is the private sector – for instance the insurance sector – and the ecological community that have the highest potential of upscaling geomorphological mapping efforts.

The modelling approach uses object-oriented language, describes the objects and their relations with a unified modelling language formalism and manages time as illustrated by a sample potato crop. To demonstrate this methodology, one-farm observed and simulated data are compared within two frameworks: the cattle-feeding system, and the labour allocation system detailed by task and by gender. Results show good reliance in the first case study and, in the second case, a satisfactory overview of the agro pastoral calendar of household member workers, regarding the priorities given by peasants according to climate, land-use constraints, social organisation and out-farm activities. Due to its modularity, the object-oriented modelling approach appears to improve understanding of the general functioning of agro pastoral households by allowing multi-purpose simulations and exploring the links between social and productive activities.

The \{LINTUL\} potato growth simulation model was adapted to incorporate the effect of frost damage on yield. High-resolution grids of monthly climate data were created for a number of variables, including absolute minimum temperature and its standard deviation, and used as input for the simulation model. The model was run for each grid cell, using a standard potato cultivar for which frost resistance parameters were changed in increments of 1 °C. A geo-referenced database of potato distribution was used to process the output of the simulation model to calculate potato-area weighted results. When frost resistance increases from −1 °C (current level) to −2 or −3 °C, average potato yield increases by 26 and 40%, respectively. After that, the effect tapers off and a further increase in resistance leads to only a small increase in simulated potato yield. "

Manjiya County is a densely populated mountainous area where landslides have been reported since the beginning of the twentieth century. To better understand the causal factors of landsliding, 81 recent landslides have been mapped and investigated. Through statistical analysis it was shown that steep concave slopes, high rainfall, soil properties and layering as well as human interference were the main factors responsible for landslides in the study area. LAPSUS-LS is used to construct a landslide hazard map, and to confirm or reject the main factors for landsliding in the area. The model is specifically designed for the analysis of shallow landslide hazard by combining a steady state hydrologic model with a deterministic infinite slope stability model. In addition, soil redistribution algorithms can be applied, whereby erosion and sedimentation by landsliding can be visualized and quantified by applying a threshold critical rainfall scenario. The model is tested in the Manjiya study area for its ability to delineate zones that are prone to shallow landsliding in general and to group the recent landslides into a specific landslide hazard category. The digital terrain analysis confirms most of the causal topographic factors for shallow landsliding in the study area. In general, shallow landslides occur at a relatively large distance from the water divide, on the transition between steep concave and more gentle convex slope positions, which points to concentration of (sub)surface flow as the main hydrological triggering mechanism. In addition, LAPSUS-LS is capable to group the recent shallow landslides in a specific landslide hazard class (critical rainfall values of 0.03–0.05 m day− 1). By constructing a landslide hazard map and simulating future landslide scenarios with the model, slopes in Manjiya County can be identified as inherently unstable and volumes of soil redistribution can yield four times higher than currently observed. More than half of this quantity can end up in the stream network, possibly damming rivers and causing major damage to infrastructure or siltation and pollution of streams. The combination of a high population density, land shortage and a high vulnerability to landslides will likely continue to create a major sustainability problem. "

We first discuss which simplifications must be made to set up LEMs. Then, simplifications of particular interest to the modelling of multiple processes are identified. Finally, case studies from New Zealand, Belgium and Croatia explore the performance of different model versions under several common choices for model and data simplifications. In these case studies we illustrate methods to make the choices, typically by i) comparing the results of different model versions, ii) assessing model validity or iii) indicating the sensitivity of models for different simplifications. The results indicate that \{LEM\} performance is strongly dependent on multi-process related choices, and that performance indicators can be used for ex-post testing of the influence of these choices. In particular, we demonstrate the significance of simplifications regarding the number of processes, presence of sinks and temporal resolution. "

However, the physiological mechanisms responsible for the frost resistance observed in quinoa are largely unknown.

Frost tolerance was determined by measuring the average lethal temperature of 50% of the leaf tissues (LT50) by ion leakage, and supercooling activity was assessed by thermal analysis using thermocouples. Quinoa demonstrated supercooling capacity (a mechanism that prevents immediate damage by freezing temperatures) of 5 °C. Ice nucleation temperature was always lower than the LT50. This indicates that the main survival mechanism of quinoa to frost is avoidance of ice formation by moderate supercooling. The study revealed that quinoa has a high soluble sugar content, which may cause a lowering of the freezing point and therefore contributing to lower the LT50. It is suggested that the content of proline and soluble sugars, such as sucrose, may serve as indicators of frost tolerance in quinoa breeding material. "

Midday values of leaf water potential (ψl), leaf osmotic potential (ψπ), relative water content (RWC), leaf conductance (gl), light saturated net photosynthesis (Asat), and specific leaf area (SLA) were determined in fully watered and droughted plants. At branching, flowering and grain filling gl in leaves of fully watered plants varied from 0.3 to 1.0, 0.3 to 0.6 and 0.2 to 0.7 mol m2 s−1 and Asat varied from 18 to 34, 14 to 24 and 8 to 26 μmol m2 s−1. In droughted plants stomatal closure began when leaf water potential (ψl) decreased below −1.2 to −1.6 \{MPa\} and Asat was reduced to 5–10 μmol m2 s−1 as a result of stomatal closure, when ψl decreased to −1.5 to −2.0 MPa. The osmotic potential at full turgor (ψπ100) decreased by age from −1.0 to −1.4 MPa. During severe water stress quinoa maintained positive turgor down to a zero turgor leaf water potential value (ψl0) of −1.8 MPa. Quinoa had a limited osmotic adjustment ψπ100 between fully watered and droughted plants being 0.3–0.4 \{MPa\} at the most. During branching the turgid weight/dry weight (TW/DW) ratio decreased from 9 to 5. At flowering and grain filling the TW/DW ratio was low (4–6). The bulk elastic modulus (εmax) determined at the beginning of the grain filling period was medium to high (18–22 MPa). \{SLA\} was high (23–21 m2 kg−1) during branching and decreased during the later growth stages. Conclusively, both high net photosynthesis rates and \{SLA\} values during early vegetative growth probably result in early vigour of quinoa supporting early water uptake and thus tolerance to a following drought. The stomatal response of quinoa was insensitive to drought induced decrease of leaf water status. The leaf water relations were characterised by low osmotic potentials and low TW/DW ratios during later growth stages sustaining a potential gradient for water uptake and turgor maintenance during soil drying.

Each step was included in the validation protocol and the accuracy profiles methodology was used to fully validate the method. The method was fully validated between 0.25 mg and 5 mg pachyrrhizin per gram of seeds and between 0.58 mg/g and 4 mg/g for rotenone. More than one hundred samples from different accessions, locations of growth and harvest dates were screened. Pachyrrhizine concentrations ranged from 3.29 mg/g to lower than 0.25 mg/g while rotenone concentrations ranged from 3.53 mg/g to lower than 0.58 mg/g. This screening along with principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant analysis (DA) analyses allowed the selection of the more interesting genotypes in terms of low concentrations of these two toxic polyphenols.

Cytological investigations using light and transmission electron microscopy were performed to assess the pattern and extent of colonization of sorghum roots and shoots by Foxy 2, applied as film-coat on seeds. Germination of Foxy 2-treated plants was similar to un-treated plants. During sorghum root development, mycelia of Foxy 2 started from seed coat colonizing root surfaces. The intensity of root colonization increased with time. However, hyphae were not found in the apical zone of the roots. Hyphae growing on the surface of the roots were observed penetrating rhizodermal cells including root hairs, and colonizing the intercellular space and the cells of the cortical parenchyma. Even after four weeks, hyphae were not penetrating the endodermal layer to invade the tissues of the central cylinder. In addition, hyphae of Foxy 2 were also completely absent in the xylem vessels in sorghum shoots even after 11 weeks of sowing, which further proves the non-pathogenicity of the fungus to sorghum. Foxy 2 showed high efficacy in controlling Striga in combination with both tolerant and susceptible sorghum varieties in a root chamber experiment, as reflected by the high percentage of diseased Striga seedlings (95% and 86%, respectively), recorded after 26 days of sowing. The intensity of fungal root colonization, which coincides with the peak of Striga attachments to its host root, will ensure high fungal efficacy and will facilitate the practical use of Foxy 2 against Striga using seed treatment delivery. Indeed, this proof of sorghum non-pathogenicity of the fungus will encourage the acceptance of Foxy 2 by authorities and farmers in Africa. "

Based on a study of four cases, this paper examines the fidelity of implementation, the factors that influenced implementation and results, and the \{PMCA\} change model. We identify three types of deviation from the intervention protocol (lapses, creative adaptations, and true infidelities) and five groups of variables that influenced \{PMCA\} implementation and results (attributes of the macro context, the market chain, the key actors, rules in use, and the capacity development strategy). There was insufficient information to test the validity of the \{PMCA\} change model, but results were greatest where the \{PMCA\} was implemented with highest fidelity. Our analysis suggests that the single most critical component of the \{PMCA\} is engagement of market agents – not just farmers – throughout the exercise. We present four lessons for planning and evaluating participatory approaches related to the use of action and change models, the importance of monitoring implementation fidelity, the limits of baseline survey data for outcome evaluation, and the importance of capacity development for implementers.

The review compares these crops for indirect selection methods available for assessment of drought tolerance related traits, use of genetic resources, progress in genomics, application of water saving techniques and availability of models to anticipate the effects of climate change on yield. It is concluded that drought tolerance improvement in potato could greatly benefit from the transfer of research achievements in cereals. Several promising research directions are presented, such as the use of fluorescence, reflectance, color and thermal imaging and stable isotope techniques to assess drought tolerance related traits, the application of the partial root-zone drying technique to improve efficiency of water supply and the exploitation of stressful memory to enhance hardiness.

To account for these number type effects Fischbein, Deri, Nello &amp; Marino (1985) have put forward the theory of the primitive intuitive models of arithmetic operations. This theory specifies that every arithmetic operation (e.g., multiplication) is associated with a primitive intuitive model (e.g., repeated addition), which intervenes in the process of selecting the operation needed to solve a word problem. In an attempt to unravel the number type effects on solving multiplicative problems, a study was carried out in which student-generated word problems for given number sentences were used as data to test a series of hypotheses and predictions that were derived in a straightforward way from the theory of the intuitive models. Although the results are fairly consistent with the basic hypothesis of the theory, the investigation also shows that at a more specific level this theory cannot sufficiently account for a number of empirical observations. The study also points to the necessity of continued research aimed at a better understanding of the cognitive processes involved in students' modeling of situations by multiplicative operations. "

The most promising precursors were identified as bis(isopropylcyclopentadienyl)ruthenium ((iPrCp)2Ru) and bis(isobutylcyclopentadienyl)ruthenium ((iBuCp)2Ru) due to their superior volatility and stability.

Many farmers cannot apply irrigation schedules that fully respond to the water demand because of reduced water availability throughout the Aral Sea basin, caused by global warming, and the competing use of irrigation by the cotton crop. The effects of different irrigation regimes were evaluated on ten potato clones in the lowlands of Tashkent, Uzbekistan, during the summer cropping season (July–October) of three consecutive years (2008, 2009 and 2010). The applicability of a growth model to predict yield under the different water regimes was tested. Significant treatment and genotype effects on yield and yield components were observed. The significant correlation for tuber yield among treatments suggested that yield under water limitation was driven more by potential yield than water restriction tolerance. Tuber yield was more associated to tuber weight than to tuber number, a component already largely determined when the different water treatments were initiated. The reduction of water supply after tuberization had a limited effect on yield and consequently drastically enhanced water use efficiency. It increased starch and dry matter content, but decreased vitamin C content. Some clones maintained high yield across years and treatments and appeared as good candidates for being recommended to farmers. Others showed interesting quality traits and are proposed for use as progenitors in breeding programs targeting at the improvement of the nutritional value of potato. A good prediction of yield was obtained using the growth model except for year 2009 when trials were heavily affected by weed infestation. The present study contributes to the improvement of water management and the identification of clones with high tuber yield and quality for the lowlands of Tashkent. Additional experiments are required to address the constraints to potato cultivation in other agro-climatic zones of Central Asia. "

The approach discusses possible cropping system improvements and alternatives in terms of crop combinations, external mineral supply, additional crops, and the potential for breeding staples in order to enhance their nutritional balance while maintaining or improving the sustainability and dietary, agronomic, and societal acceptability of the system. The conceptual framework calls for attention first to balancing crop nutrition that in nearly every case will also increase crop productivity, allowing sufficient staple to be produced on less land so that the remaining land can be devoted to more nutrient‐dense and nutrient‐balancing crops. Once this is achieved, the additional requirements of humans and animals (vitamins, selenium, and iodine) can be addressed. Case studies illustrate principles and strategies. This chapter is a proposal to widen the range of tools and strategies that could be adopted in the HarvestPlus Challenge Program to achieve its goals of eliminating micronutrient deficiencies in the food systems of resource‐poor countries.

A factorial experiment with five fungicide application intervals (weekly, fortnightly, IPM, no spray and farmers’ practice) and six potato varieties was established. Late blight infection was prevalent in both years, and a significant amount of disease was detected (P&lt;0.05). Application of fungicide treatments considerably reduced late blight progress, with a corresponding increase in tuber yield. Based on monitoring of late blight disease occurrence and weather variables, two applications of the contact fungicide mancozeb on a moderately resistant variety was the most economical.

Exponential curve of death, i.e. constant force of mortality functions were used in a case study on a cohort time basis. The additive property of crude cause-specific forces of mortality is used to combine mortality factors, which permits to judge different control strategies. In an integrated pest management perspective, the effect of basic mortalities, i.e innate and dispersal related mortalities is recombined with native natural enemies. Thereafter, we calculate the force of additional comptatible control factors needed to reduce the proportion of infested tubers below an economically relevant level. Control strategies based on native natural enemies are shown to have variable effects which put farmers at economic risks. The general importance of integrating compatible control factors is recognized in the evaluation of virus applications. Based on risk analyses, Tunisian potato growers were recommended, in the case of standard initial infestations of five eggs per tuber, to use virus preparations at a higher dosage than the 0.0015 larval equivalent/kg as used in this study. Moreover, the study confirms the general importance of entering potatoes with low infestation levels into rustic shelters. This considerably decreases the risk of exceeding the economic threshold and make virus based control efficient even at low dosages. If the initial infestation considerably exceeds five eggs per tuber, the integration of a compatible control factor becomes more difficult. Nevertheless, even in absence of additional control factors the infestation of tubers does not exceed 50%. "

Storage root fresh weight was significantly (P &lt; 0.001) reduced due to virus infection with high reduction recorded for \{SPFMV\} infection followed by co-infection of \{SPFMV\} with SPCSV. The same case was for sweetpotato vine length. However, no major reductions were observed in the vine weights. Co-infection of \{SPFMV\} with \{SPCSV\} caused more severe symptoms than single infections of the two viruses and each isolate caused distinct disease symptoms on the infected sweetpotato plants.

First, both models are run independently for a baseline scenario of land use change. Secondly, different feedbacks are added to the coupled model framework as ‘interaction scenarios’. Firstly effects of land use change on landscape processes are introduced by means of a ‘changed erodibility feedback’. Secondly effects of landscape processes on land use are introduced stepwise: (i) an ‘observed erosion feedback’ where reallocation of land use results from farmers’ perception of erosion features, and (ii) a ‘reduced productivity feedback’ whereby changes in soil depth result in a land use relocation. Quantities and spatial patterns of both land use change and soil redistribution are compared with the baseline scenario to assess the cumulative effect of including each of the interaction mechanisms in the modelling framework. Overall, total quantities of land use change (areas) and soil redistribution do not differ much for the different interaction scenarios. However, there are important differences in the spatial patterns of both land use and soil redistribution. In addition, by incorporating the perception and bio-physical feedback mechanisms, land use types with stable or increasing acreages are increasingly relocated from their original positions, suggesting a current location on landscape positions prone to soil erosion and sedimentation. Implementing the ‘reduced productivity feedback’ causes most of these effects. Another important outcome is that on-site land use changes trigger major off-site soil redistribution dynamics. These off-site effects are attributed to down slope or downstream changes in sediment transport rates and/or discharge caused by changes in land surface characteristics. The results of this study provide insight into the interactions between different processes occurring within landscapes and the influence of feedbacks on the development of the landscape. The interaction between processes goes across various spatial and temporal scales, leading to difficulties in linked model representation and calibration and validation of the coupled modelling system.

Key implications include a greater capability of the \{US\} court system to manage F/RAND disputes, false reification of patent holdup as a systemic problem, and a potentially normative, negative impact on patent value, where the total impact on both static and dynamic efficiency requires further research and potentially new knowledge-based economic theories.

The lm-def gene has been isolated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using degenerate primers corresponding to conserved regions of 13 plant defensin genes of the Brassicaceae family assuming that defensin genes are highly conserved among cruciferous species. The lm-def gene belongs to a small multigene family of at least 10 members possibly including pseudogenes as assessed by genomic hybridization and nucleotide sequence analyses. The deduced mature Lm-Def peptide is 51 amino acids in length and has 74–94% sequence identity with other plant defensins of the Brassicaceae family. The Lm-Def peptide was produced as a fusion protein using the pET-44a expression vector and purified using an immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. The recombinant protein (NusA:Lm-Def) exhibited in vitro activity against P. infestans. The NusA:Lm-Def protein caused growth inhibition and hyphal damage at concentration not greater than 0.4 μM. In contrast, the NusA protein alone expressed and purified similarly did not show any activity against P. infestans. Therefore, these results indicate that the lm-def gene isolated from maca belong to the plant defensin family with activity against P. infestans. Its expression in potato, as a transgene, might help to control the late blight disease caused by P. infestans with the advantage of being of plant origin. "

Most of these properties were mapped using geostatistical techniques. Soil pH in the Gikongoro and Byumba regions was usually less than 5.0 and high levels of extractable Al were measured.

Some potato models have been applied to studies of nitrogen fertilizer, irrigation management, and climate change impact, but most of these models have never been validated with field measurements. The nitrogen dynamics of potato models CROPSYSTVB-CSPOTATO, EXpert-N-SPASS, and LINTUL-NPOTATO have been tested with some field data. \{LPOTCO\} and \{AQUACROP\} are two potato models that have been tested under elevated atmospheric \{CO2\} conditions. None of the models have ever been tested with high temperature or heat stress data. The most tested and applied potato models include versions of \{LINTUL\} and SUBSTOR-Potato. Two sweet potato models, \{MADHURAM\} and SPOTCOMS, and two yam models, CROPSYSTVB-Yam and EPIC-Yam had limited field-testing under current climate conditions; however, these sweet potato and yam models are not ready for climate change impact assessments. To prepare potato, sweet potato, and yam models for climate change impact assessments, they need to be (i) calibrated with modern cultivars across agro-climatic zones; (ii) tested and improved with crop physiology and dynamic measurements of phenology, growth, partitioning, and water and nitrogen uptake under different crop management and environments; and (iii) tested and improved with field studies of crop responses to climate factors, including elevated CO2, water stress, increased temperature, heat stress, and combinations of these. Such extensive model testing and improvement with field experiments require a coordinated international effort and long-term commitment to potato, sweet potato, and yam research. "

Three field experiments were conducted in the Philippines to determine the yields of 27 diverse clonal lines with variations in moisture supply. Differences among lines in yield were interpreted in terms of intercepted radiation (Ri) and radiation-use efficiency (RUE). The effects of irrigation regimes on these functions were associated with the maturity classification of the clonal lines. Relative reduction in tuber yield was less for early lines (15%) than for the medium- or late-maturing lines (30–35%). Low moisture supply significantly reduced tuber and total plant dry matter (DM) but not harvest index (HI). The reduction in total plant and tuber \{DM\} was attributed to low Ri due to the restricted canopy size and accelerated senescence of the canopy and to small RUEtuber. The low \{RUEtuber\} (0.30–1.04 g MJ−1), particularly for late, unadapted, lines, was associated with late tuber formation and low HI. The results indicated that a favorable balance between time to tuber formation and achievement of a relatively large and long-lived canopy is important for satisfactory yields under moisture-limiting conditions in hot tropical environments.

Cane yield was enhanced when intercropped with potato, and the benefit was related to the use of residual P and K, and to a lesser extent N. In all experiments, net returns from cane intercropped with potato were greater than from sole cane, and were further increased by the use of mulch. Potato yield increased to the maximum population tested as an intercrop (10 plants m−2), but maximum net economic benefits were not always derived from the greatest populations. Changing the traditional single-row planting system of sugarcane for a double-row system, in which more space was available for the intercrop, did not reduce cane yield but facilitated the planting of high potato plant populations. It is concluded that the practice of intercropping potato with sugarcane exploits the temporal complementarity between crops to the benefit of the farmer. "

Two levels of downy mildew were established by means of fungicide treatments. Area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) values were calculated for each method and correlated to the grain yield. In addition to the severity measurements, spectral reflectance was measured throughout the growth season in Huancayo and area under reflectance curve (AURC) values calculated and correlated to yield. The disease level was ten-fold higher in Huancayo compared to Lima. \{AUDPC\} based on the Three-leaf method (mean disease severity of three leaves per plant selected randomly from the lower, middle and upper part of the plant), showed the highest negative correlation to yield (r=−0.736) and is regarded as the best method to predict yield loss caused by downy mildew. In addition, this method proved to be the quickest and easiest compared to the other six methods included in the study, which were based on assessments of disease severity of the entire plant or parts of the plant. Yield losses recorded in the tested cultivars ranged from 33% to 99% under the high-disease conditions. The reflectance method was superior to all other methods by showing a higher correlation between \{AURC\} and yield (r=0.853), which is explained by its ability to measure pathogen-induced defoliation. Remote sensing is an excellent tool to compare the effect of treatments on disease severity within a cultivar. However, the method does not allow for comparison of disease severity among cultivars as the spectral reflectance is determined by size, shape and colour of the plant. The Three-leaf method provides an easy, cheap and readily applicable tool for researchers and plant breeders to study downy mildew of quinoa, characterise germplasm for resistance and compare results across regions and years.

Biofortified varieties and increased use of fertilizers have been studied to improve the nutrient profile of staple foods and thereby reduce micronutrient malnutrition. To understand where and for which crops this is appropriate, a better understanding of population-level consumption patterns is needed. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach to understanding the role of the potato in the Peruvian diet, and how it varies by geographic and socio-economic group. We combine readily available data on household expenditures from a Peruvian living conditions survey (ENAHO) with food composition data to derive estimates on the amount of potatoes consumed per adult equivalent, and the contribution of potatoes to meeting the energy, protein, calcium, iron, and vitamin C needs of Peruvians. Households in the highlands, where potatoes are often the basis of cropping systems, consume the greatest quantities of potatoes, averaging 421 g/adult equivalent/day (g/ae/d). In this region, potatoes contribute 18%, 16%, 17%, and 97% of the recommended needs for energy, protein, iron, and vitamin C, respectively. Sensitivity testing using different cultivars previously examined from the Peruvian highlands shows that potatoes could supply a range from 7–31% of the recommended intakes for iron in this population. This work gives support for continuing agricultural research to reduce micronutrient malnutrition and provides guidance for where and with whom such research might have the greatest impact. "

We applied digital soil mapping in a 13,500 km2 study area in Kenya with the main aim to create a reconnaissance soil map to assess clay and soil organic carbon contents in terraced maize fields. Soil spatial variability prediction was based on environmental correlation using the concepts of the soil forming factors equation. During field work, 95 composite soil samples were collected. Auxiliary spatially exhaustive data provided insight on the spatial variation of climate, land cover, topography and parent material. The final digital soil maps were elaborated using regression kriging. The variance explained by the regression kriging models was estimated as 13% and 37% for soil organic carbon and clay respectively. These results were confirmed by cross-validation and provide a significant improvement compared to the existing soil survey. "

A natural enemy, an undescribed entomopathogenic nematode from the genus Heterorhabditis designated Alcázar-1, was isolated from potato weevils in a potato storage unit in Peru. Our objective was to characterize the potential of this nematode to suppress Premnotrypes suturicallus populations. We evaluated the tolerance of this nematode to the cold Andean temperatures, its infectivity against different stages of P. suturicallus, and its recycling potential within this host. Heterorhabditis sp. Alcázar-1 was infectious to Galleria mellonella larvae at temperatures (mean 11.1 °C; range 8.6–14 °C) similar to those recorded for daily fluctuations in the Andes. In laboratory bioassays, the nematode protected potato tubers from infestations by neonate P. suturicallus larvae and killed weevil larvae within the tubers before significant damage was incurred. Median lethal concentration (LC50) for P. suturicallus pre-pupae was 5.9 infective juveniles/host reflecting high susceptibility. At this concentration, mortality increased over a 7-day period, resulting in 66% pre-pupae, 65% pupae and 52% teneral adults killed by the nematode. Alcázar-1 has a high reproductive potential in P. suturicallus pre-pupae, producing an average of 97,817 infective juveniles per host. These results suggest that Alcázar-1 has excellent potential for biological control of the Andean potato weevil. "

We investigated the physiological and growth responses of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) to approximate present-day ambient (390 μL L−1) and elevated (750 μL L−1) atmospheric \{CO2\} concentrations under well-watered and water deficit conditions, aiming at understanding how cassava would face those problems. Water deficits led to reductions in the Leaf Elongation Rate of plants grown at ambient as well as CO2-enriched concentrations. However, plants grown at 750 μL L−1 of \{CO2\} maintained leaf growth two days longer than plants grown at 390 μL L−1. Three Days After Withholding Water (DAWW), photosynthesis and stomatal conductance were reduced in plants grown under ambient CO2, while in plants under an elevated \{CO2\} concentration, these physiological functions remained similar to that of control plants grown under good water availability. Five \{DAWW\} plants grown with 750 μL L−1 continued to have enhanced gas exchange compared with plants grown under 390 μL L−1. Under drought stress, the instantaneous transpiration efficiency was always greatest for plants grown under elevated CO2. The positive response of elevated \{CO2\} levels on total dry mass was 61% in the water-stressed plants and only 20% for the plants grown under good water availability. Stomatal limitation was an important factor reducing \{CO2\} assimilation in cassava growing under drought conditions. "

The field experiments varied in potato species and cultivars, N fertilizer application, water supply, sowing dates, soil types, temperature environments, and atmospheric \{CO2\} concentrations, and included open top chamber and Free-Air-CO2-Enrichment (FACE) experiments. Tuber yields were generally well simulated with the SUBSTOR-potato model across a wide range of current growing conditions and for diverse potato species and cultivars, including Solanum tuberosum, Solanum andigenum, Solanum juzepczukii species, as well as modern, traditional, early, medium, and late maturity-type cultivars, with a relative \{RMSE\} of 37.2% for tuber dry weight and 21.4% for tuber fresh weight. Cultivars ‘Desiree’ and ‘Atlantic’ were grown in experiments across the globe and well simulated using consistent cultivar parameters. However, the model underestimated the impact of elevated atmospheric \{CO2\} concentrations and poorly simulated high temperature effects on crop growth. Other simulated crop variables, including leaf area, stem weight, crop N, and soil water, differed frequently from measurements; some of these variables had significant large measurement errors. The SUBSTOR-potato model was shown to be suitable to simulate tuber growth and yields over a wide range of current growing conditions and crop management practices across many geographic regions. However, before the model can be used effectively in climate change impact assessments, it requires improved model routines to capture the impacts of elevated atmospheric \{CO2\} and high temperatures on crop growth.

DC. cv.-group utilis) is widely promoted in tropical and sub-tropical regions as a green manure cover crop that can reduce weed growth and soil erosion and enhance soil fertility. To provide these benefits, the crop must attain rapid ground cover and develop substantial aboveground biomass. To assist biophysical targeting of the crop to environments that can provide adequate growth conditions, the \{CROPGRO\} model was adapted to simulate velvet bean growth and development. This paper evaluates the performance of the model for phenology, growth, senescence and N accumulation for multiple locations that represent a range of environmental and agronomic management scenarios. Vegetative development, as described by main stem leaf appearance rate, varied linearly with thermal time. Time to flowering showed departures from the linear photoperiod response used in the model. Additional research is required to determine whether the crop is influenced by factors besides photoperiod and air temperature, especially water and nutrient deficits. The linear response to photoperiod did, however, provide reasonable values for partitioning to vegetative, reproductive and senesced materials. Simulation of nitrogen concentration for various plant components matched observed data. Sensitivity analyses evaluating the ability of the crop to provide ground cover, intercept light and develop adequate growth for soil protection and weed suppression indicated that a mean temperature of over 22 °C and a soil moisture holding capacity of at least 100 mm are required. The \{CROPGRO\} model proved to be a reliable decision support tool for guiding analyses of velvet bean response to crop management and environmental conditions. Further research, however, is warranted to improve its predictive capability, especially for phenology. "

One such approach integrates biophysical modeling with economic modeling to explore the combined effects of climate stresses and future socioeconomic trends, thus providing a more accurate picture of how agriculture and the food system may be affected in the coming decades. We review and analyze the literature on this structural approach and present a case study that follows this methodology, explicitly modeling drought and heat tolerant crop varieties. We show that yield gains from adoption of these varieties differ by technology and region, but are generally comparable in scale to (and thus able to offset) adverse effects of climate change. However, yield increases over the projection period are dominated by the effects of growth in population, income, and general productivity, highlighting the importance of joint assessment of biophysical and socioeconomic drivers to better understand climate impacts and responses.

They argue that multi-disciplinary and -institutional efforts on soil health that link research, practice, and political action will be needed for improved agriculture and more promising futures. During this century soil research has concentrated on soil chemical and physical factors, with comparative neglect of biological factors. Consequently, there is relatively limited understanding of how best to capitalize on the dynamics and potentials of soil biology so as to enhance the regenerative capacity of soil systems for agriculture. More agronomic research and empirical experience for biologically-based agriculture are called for. Although better understanding and practices can serve immediate on-farm needs, they alone would unlikely achieve the desirable changes in farming systems. Policies and institutional arrangements profoundly influence agricultural research and practice, so effective soil health initiatives must also engage broader social and political considerations. In particular, the author’s argue for greater balance in research and teaching to emphasize biology and ecology, enhanced linkages between research and extension, new inter-institutional partnerships and collaboration, and increased stakeholder involvement in policy formulation and implementation.

However, cassava seeds are known to be rich in oils and fats, there are scant reports on the content and properties of oil from cassava seeds and its wild relatives. Wild Manihot species usually produce a higher number of seeds with a large diversity in shape and weight. Seeds of 106 accessions belonging to 12 species of Manihot from the collection of Embrapa Cassava and Fruits were evaluated for oil content by \{NMR\} and fatty acids composition by gas chromatography. The oil content ranged from 17.2% (M. caerulescens) to 30.7% (M. flabellifolia) and the species clustered into eight different groups based on the oil content. Five fatty acids were found in all species with the average content of the fatty acids being: linoleic (C18:2) 61.5%; oleic (C18:1) 20.0%; palmitic (C16:0) 12.3%; stearic (C18:0) 4.5%; and linolenic (C18:3) 1.7%. The content of fatty acids varied significantly between species as well as between accessions within a species. The highest content of linoleic acid was in seeds of M. peruviana, M. pseudoglaziovii, M. cecropiaefolia, M. flabellifolia, M. glaziovii and M. carthaginensis (average of 65%); and the highest level of oleic acid was in M. caerulescens, M. esculenta, M. anomala, M. dichotoma and M. tomentosa (average of 23%). The collection of Embrapa's Manihot germplasm is a valuable source for cassava breeding programs, containing a large variability in seed size, oil content and fatty acid composition. The oil from seeds of wild Manihot species may be equally valuable for industrial uses as oil from seeds of other Euphorbiaceae species. "

The influence of parameters such as initial concentration and dissolved oxygen were investigated. The analysis of the first organic by-products suggests that a hydroxyl radical attack occurs on the phenyl ring, the methyl groups and the carbon \{C1\} of the cyproconazole. The fate of heteroatoms has been investigated. The nitrogen atoms in the triazole moiety of the molecule are partially transformed into NH4+ and NO3−. The potential formation of \{N2\} and cyanuric acid could explain the lack of stoichiometric nitrogen balance. The chlorine atoms were completely released as chloride ions. The oxidative and reductive pathways are both involved in the chlorine release mechanism. The study of the influence of the oxygen concentration showed the importance of the oxygen mass transfer when designing an industrial photocatalytic reactor. For the second time, an original calculation process was carried out to evaluate the adsorption constant of oxygen over the whole photocatalysis period and confirmed the validity of the method for cyproconazole pesticide.

This value is named the standard or stability value. The standard value is reached irrespective of sequences and 3D folds. Peptides are too short to follow the rule and frequently exist as populations of conformers; one exception is peptides in amyloid fibrils. Fibrils surpass the standard value in accordance with their uppermost stability. In parallel, we calculate median \{MFP\} values of amino acids in stably folded \{PDB\} models of proteins: median values vary from –25 for Gly to –115 kcal/aa for Trp. These median values are used to score primary sequences of proteins: all sequences converge to a mean value of −63.5 ± 2.5 kcal/aa, i.e., only 1.5 kcal less than the folded model standard. Sequences from unfolded proteins have lower values. This supports the conclusion that sequences carry in an important message and more specifically that diversity of amino acids in sequences is mandatory for stability. We also use the median amino acid \{MFP\} to score residue stability in 3D folds. This demonstrates that 3D folds are compromises between fragments of high and fragments of low scores and that functional residues are often but not always in the extreme score values. The approach opens to possibilities of evaluating any 3D model and of detecting functional residues and should help in conducting mutation assays. "

Previously we observed that the cell wall peptidoglycan hydrolases of Lactobacillus helveticus were highly conserved enzymes; the aim of the present work was to determine whether peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns obtained by renaturing SDS-PAGE could be of interest in the identification of lactobacilli species. For that purpose, the peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns of 94 strains of lactobacilli belonging to 10 different species were determined; most of the species studied are used either in dairy, meat, bakery or vegetable fermentations: L. helveticus, L. acidophilus, L. delbrueckii, L. brevis, L. fermentum, L. jensenii, L. plantarum, L. sake, L. curvatus and L. reuteri. Within a species, the strains exhibited highly similar patterns: the apparent molecular weights of the lytic bands were identical, with only slight variations of intensity. Moreover, each species, including phylogenetically close species such as L. sake and L. curvatus, or L. acidophilus and L. helveticus, gave a different pattern. Interestingly, the closer the species were phylogenetically, the more related were their patterns. The sensitivity of the method was checked using various quantities of L. acidophilus cells: a peptidoglycan hydrolase extract of 5 × 106 cells was sufficient to obtain an informative pattern, as was a single colony. Finally, the method was also successfully applied to distinguish two Carnobacterium species. In conclusion, the electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases is proposed as a new tool for lactobacilli identification: it is rapid, sensitive and effective even for phylogenetically close species. Furthermore, this work provides the first evidence of the potential overall taxonomic value of bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases. "

Hence, an improved understanding of the production, utilization, trade, and estimated future economic importance of these crops has potentially far-reaching implications for investments in agricultural research at both the international and, perhaps even more importantly, national levels. Previous projections for the evolution of global supply, demand, and trade into the 21st century, however, have focused on grains, oilseeds, and livestock. This paper presents global projections of supply, demand, and trade for root and tuber crops to the year 2020. According to the baseline scenario, roots and tubers will decline in relative economic importance only marginally vis-à-vis the other major food and feed crops over the next three decades. According to an alternative, high demand and production growth scenario, the economic importance of roots and tubers versus the same commodities will increase slightly. The results of this scenario contrast with earlier projections that predicted a decline in importance for roots and tubers. Policymakers should take cognizance of and act on the growth prospects for these crops. In the past, root and tuber crops have often been overlooked in policy deliberations precisely because their potential was considered more limited than actual growth rates clearly indicate, or that current projections foresee.

Field emergence and haulm development were compared in crops from seedling tubers ranging in weight from 0.5 to 35 g at different planting densities. The number of eyes per tuber increased with the seedling-tuber size, but the number of eyes per g tuber was more than 7 times higher in small (1–5 g) seedling tubers than in large (&gt;20 g) ones. Despite these large differences in the number of eyes, sprout weight per g tuber weight after storage in a non-cooled store was similar in tubers from different size grades. Field emergence was generally faster with large than with small tubers, but the final emergence was about 90% regardless of seedling-tuber size. The number of above-ground stems increased with increasing seedling-tuber size. However, on a per weight basis, 1–5-g tubers were about five times more effective in producing stems than tubers &gt;20 g. Initial foliage development was much faster from large than from small tubers. Plants grown from small tubers at low planting density developed more and larger axillary branches and tended to senesce later than plants from large tubers. Ground-cover duration increased with stem density, but a ssimilar stem densities (obtained by the varying planting density) the ground cover was lower in crops from small than large tubers. It is concluded that the higher efficiency per unit weight of small seedling tubers to produce stems is offset by the lower capacity of these stems to produce foliage, which would result in a lower capacity for Photosynthesis.

Tuber yield and mean weights per tuber were compared in crops from seedling tubers of different size grades (0.5–1 g to &gt;20 g) and at different planting densities (5.3 to 21.2 seedling tubers per m2). At a planting density of 5.3 seedling tubers per m2 tuber yield significantly increased with seedling-tuber size. This was closely correlated with higher stem densities and ground-cover duration in crops from large seedling tubers. Differences in tuber yield from small and large seedling tubers were particularly distinct, when foliage development was decreased by low temperatures and short daylengths, or when high temperatures at the end of the growing period reduced tuber bulking. Tuber yields from small seedling tubers were increased at higher planting densities. However, tuber yield per stem decreased with increasing planting density for small seedling tubers. Furthermore, at a certain stem density, tuber yields were always lower in plants grown from small seedling tubers than from large ones, indicating a lower potential for tuber bulking on a per stem basis in the case of small seedling tubers. Mean weight per tuber was lower in plants from small seedling tubers. The number of tubers per stem was negatively correlated with stem density and this relationship was independent of seedling-tuber size. Tuber yield per stem was also negatively correlated with stem density, but at a certain stem density tuber yield per stem was always lower in plants from small than from large seedling tubers. This indicates that the low mean weights per tuber in plants from small seedling tubers were not due to an unusually high number of tubers per stem, but were caused by the low tuber bulking per stem. It is concluded that under the prevailing environmental conditions in Egypt, which are characterized by a relatively short period of optimal growing conditions, the potential of seedling tubers to produce tubers of marketable weight, even on a per stem basis, decreases with decreasing seedling-tuber size.

Information on patterns of genetic variation is useful in informing both reforestation and genetic conservation activities. However, to date, no such information is available in Peru or elsewhere in South America. In the present study, genetic diversity between and within nine Peruvian populations of the species, based on amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers, is reported. Overall diversity level was high (Ht = 0.22), as expected for a widespread, long-lived tropical species, and consistent with previous studies carried out in Central America. Levels of intrapopulation diversity were higher than those previously reported for the species (Hs = 0.13–0.21). Analysis of molecular variation revealed genetic differences between two population groups located on different rivers and between populations located on the same rivers. Differences between groups were greater than those within groups. Genetic and geographical distances were significantly correlated. The relatively strong genetic differences between populations may be related to the riparian, essentially one-dimensional spatial distribution pattern of the populations studied. No difference was found in percentage of polymorphic loci between relatively undisturbed and logged populations. The existence of appreciable genetic differentiation over a relatively small part of the species range in the Peruvian Amazon suggests the need for caution in use of seed outside its zone of origin. For genetic conservation purposes, it would probably be prudent to sample (ex situ) or conserve (in situ) populations in each of the major watersheds of the Peruvian Amazon. "

This study enters this debate in the context of nostalgic websites which allow members to find and meet up with their old friends. We examined the influence of extroversion–introversion personality traits of surfers through their use of HEVREA, a nostalgic website, and on their use of social services available on the Internet, that is websites designed for social interaction (e.g. chat, ICQ). One hundred students participated in the study: 50 were heavy users of \{HEVREA\} and 50 were not users of \{HEVREA\} or any other nostalgic website. Participants filled out a questionnaire relating to the different social services they use on the net. The questionnaire also ascertained the level of extroversion of the participant using the Eysenck personality questionnaire-revised (EPQ-R) [Eysenck, H. J. (1988). Eysenck personality inventory/questionnaires. In M. Hersen &amp; A. Bellack (Eds.), Dictionary of behavioural assessment techniques (pp. 206–209). Oxford, UK: Pregamon Press]. A two-way \{ANOVA\} was used to analyze the data. No main effects were found, either pertaining to the use of the \{HEVREA\} website or to extroversion-introversion. However, an interaction between the two variables was found to be significant. These results are discussed in light of the two theories: the poor get richer and the rich get richer. "

The fact that the costs of preventive measures are 10–20 times lower than the funds needed to clean up and revitalize polluted aquifers, as well as the fact that the area to be occupied with transport communications and other infrastructure facilities will aggravate protection, both call for an urgent introduction of modern methods of monitoring and preserving all the existing and potential groundwater resources. The basic principle of groundwater protection against pollution means constant control and preventive measures of protection, namely prevention of incidental and other kinds of pollution. The very construction of communications and all accompanying facilities changes and degrades the existent natural geological environment, and when in use they may become structures in whose immediate surrounds surface and ground waters may be polluted by the toxic and waste substances transported. The experience gained through the following activities: the ‘pilot model’ for groundwater monitoring in the zone of Makis, the investigations and monitoring of critical sites polluted with xylene (CIP, Belgrade, 1994/95), and information on the latest achievements in this field in the world (obtained while working on the study of methodology of hydrogeological investigations needed for groundwater quality monitoring system — Jaroslav Cerni Institute for the Development of Water Resources, Belgrade, 1998), stresses a necessity to obligatory design and construct operational systems for groundwater quality monitoring, particularly in the zones of infrastructure facilities (roads, railway, gas pipelines, oil pipelines), which can be considered as potential linear polluters. In that light, this paper is a contribution to developing hydrogeological investigation methodology for designing and operating a monitoring system in the zones of roads, and its legal and practical incorporation in the technical documents of each project. Besides, an emphasis is put on multidisciplinary approach to system implementation, its full automation, rational management, and effective and optimal measures for groundwater protection. "

The fitting of experimental results with the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L-H) model emphasized that the corresponding “apparent adsorption constant”, KR, could not be considered as an equilibrium constant in the dark since the value of \{KR\} varied with regard to the photon flow. The assumption of a pseudo-steady-state for the concentration of hydroxyl radicals associated either with L-H model (under certain conditions) or Eley–Rideal model explains consistently the dependence of the apparent kinetic parameter, kobs, and \{KR\} with the light intensity.

With a view to treating real agricultural effluents, this paper deals with the degradation of the chlortoluron and cyproconazole pesticides in pure water and the treatment of commercial solutions by photocatalysis on TiO2 coated media. The process was effective in degrading and mineralizing the pesticides. The changes of the fate of heteroatoms showed that during irradiation of the chlortoluron and cyproconazole, \{NH\} 4 + and \{NO\} 3 - ions were produced. A release of chloride ions was observed from the beginning of the irradiation and stoichiometry was achieved. The photodegradation of chlortoluton and cyproconazole in commercial solutions was studied. For the degradation of chlortoluton in a commercial solution, the mineralization was completely achieved whereas in the case of the commercial cyproconazole solution, the degradation kinetic was lower. These results highlight the fact that the chemical nature of the additives in the commercial pesticide solutions does significantly affect the degradation yield of the target compound by photocatalysis.

abstract = "Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on plasticized sodium caseinate films. Sodium caseinate (NaCAS) is a commercially available protein obtained by acid precipitation of casein, which is the main protein in cow's milk. This protein is obtained with good purity (up to 90%), and its thermoplastic and film-forming properties are because of its random coil nature and its ability to form weak intermolecular interactions. Such films have good elongation at break points (from 150 to ∼400%) and a rather low tensile strength ranging from 20 to 30 MPa. However, compared with synthetic films, casein-based films have two major drawbacks: poor mechanical properties such as lower tensile strength and elongation at break point and a high water sensitivity in the form of high water solubility and water vapor permeability. A chemical crosslinking of NaCAS with \{HCHO\} increases the tensile properties and overcomes the water sensitivity problem of the protein film. The specific solubility of NaCAS obtained from a \{UV\} absorbance method shows that the improvement in the NaCAS film water resistance is closely related to the cross-linker content. However, it is also observed that during water immersion, the triethanolamine (TEA) plasticizer extensively migrates out of the films to the surrounding solution, irrespective of the cross-linker-to-reactive-groups ratio.

For example in the district of Haquira, which is located in the province of Cotabambas, Apurimac, many young farmers abandon agriculture to work in the mines or migrate to search for more income attractive options in larger towns. The precise impact of these tendencies on agrobiodiversity has not been assessed and it remains difficult to establish timelines that reflect changes as no reference data exist that is useful for comparison. A cost efficient and easy applicable method to assess local crop diversity based on traditional names and establish a baseline for red-listing of landraces is the five cell analysis (FCA). In a case study, three communities in Haquira – Pauchi, Queuñapampa and Huancacalla Chico have been surveyed to determine the actual state of potato landrace, collective knowledge, potential threats of agrobiodiversity and to establish a long term monitoring system. It was registered by focus groups familiar (n=61). The results provide us information systematization of landraces of potatoes to prepare a master list that can be contrasted with genetic information. Based on farmer's perception in all the communities it was identified 42 landraces with 71 synonyms; 13 threatened landraces, 8 conservation dependant landraces and 3 no risk landraces. The methodologies used to contributing to data base for monitoring of landraces of potatoes should be applicable to other landscapes on similar conditions. "

Afforestation with Pinus species is widespread in the high altitudinal grasslands known as páramos. The impact of Pinus patula afforestation on the water yield is studied and compared to the more common practice of intensive grazing and potato cultivation in four microcatchments in the Paute river basin in south Ecuador. Two catchments are covered with natural grassland vegetation, one is converted to pine forest, and one is drained, partly intensively grazed, and partly cultivated with potatoes. The results indicate that afforestation with P. patula reduces the water yield by about 50%, or an average of 242 mm year−1. The water yield of the cultivated catchment is very similar to that of the natural catchments, but analysis of the flow duration curves suggests a faster response and a loss of base flow. These effects may have important implications for a sustainable management of the páramo ecosystem, given that the páramo is the major water supplier for the Andean highlands. "

The concentration of methanol strongly influenced the extraction of \{TP\} and antioxidants to be evaluated for AA, with 80% and 60% methanol, being more efficient for raw and for boiled potato samples, respectively. The predominant \{PA\} in raw and boiled potato tubers was chlorogenic acid (CA). Caffeic acid was also present in raw tubers but drastically decrease in boiled tubers. For all accessions, the concentrations of \{TP\} and \{AA\} determined in boiled tubers were higher than in raw tubers. However, with the exception of Guincho, the \{TA\} and \{CA\} concentrations determined in raw and boiled tubers of the accessions were not significantly different. The deep purple-fleshed accession Guincho showed the highest \{TA\} concentration (418 mg/100 g, FW) and \{AA\} (17,305 μg Trolox equivalent/g, FW).

We demonstrate that the PR-1 genes belong to a small multigene family with an estimated copy number of 4–6 with one of them located on chromosome \{IX\} as determined by genetic mapping. The expression of PR-1 genes was different in late blight resistant and susceptible genotypes.

In addition, the contribution of these phenolic fractions to the antioxidant capacity was evaluated. The Faq revealed the presence of caffeic, vanillic and cinnamic acid derivatives, flavan-3-ols and flavones derivatives, as the main non-anthocyanin phenolic compounds for both genotypes. Anthocyanins for the purple genotype were significantly present in this fraction. Acid hydrolysis revealed the presence of vanillic, caffeic and cinnamic acids and malvidin in Faq. The Fea was composed mainly of caffeic and cinnamic acid derivatives as well as flavan-3-ols, flavones and flavanone derivatives.

Household surveys and semi-structured interviews in one of the communities where the project was implemented provided the data. Results suggest that value chain participants generally have higher economic status and actively exclude lower-resource households in the community. However, non-participation is not necessarily viewed negatively by all non-participating households. Some deliberately choose not to participate to pursue other livelihood strategies or because of risks involved in participating. These findings indicate that participation in value chains is not necessarily beneficial. For such programs to have broad social benefits, policies and other institutional arrangements are needed to minimize risks of participation in such value chains and to provide support for other market outlets.

Experimental animals were infected at 110 days of gestation and euthanized 6 weeks post-infection. In culture supernatants from the dams, significantly higher IFN-γ and IL-4 levels were found in the experimentally-infected animals compared to the control or naturally-infected dams. However, among the experimentally-infected dams no significant differences in IFN-γ production were observed regardless of the incidence of live or aborted/dead foetuses, though spleen cultures of dams carrying live foetuses showed the highest levels of IFN-γ. IL-17A production was very low and occasional in the dams infected with N. caninum and did not seem to be a major regulator of IFN-γ production in this model. Experimentally infected dams with live foetuses showed higher IL-4 levels and accordingly IFN-γ/IL-4 ratios were significantly lower than ratios recorded for cows with aborted/dead foetuses. In the infected foetuses of these dams, only spleen cultures showed high levels of IFN-γ and IL-4 after Nc-1 antigen and ConA stimulation, respectively. No IL-17A was detected in the foetuses. As conclusion, although we could not clearly relate a protective immune response against N. caninum abortion only to IFN-γ levels in cell cultures, our results highlight the important role of an inverse IFN-γ/IL-4 balance in conferring protection against abortion induced by this parasite.

Here, we apply the definition of \{EIDs\} used in the medical and veterinary fields to botany and highlight a series of emerging plant diseases. We include \{EIDs\} of cultivated and wild plants, some of which are of significant conservation concern. The underlying cause of most plant \{EIDs\} is the anthropogenic introduction of parasites, although severe weather events are also important drivers of disease emergence. Much is known about crop plant EIDs, but there is little information about wild-plant EIDs, suggesting that their impact on conservation is underestimated. We conclude with recommendations for improving strategies for the surveillance and control of plant EIDs. "

Sustainability indicators are useful, but only if their number is limited and the interactions between indicators are taken into consideration. In this context, we propose a methodology for an integrated analysis of tradeoffs between economic and environmental indicators. The analysis to quantify these relationships should be based on a multi-disciplinary approach and as such requires the usage of bio-physical as well as econometric-process simulation models. The communication between these very different models is based on explicit definitions of spatial and temporal scales and model integration software. The methodology is based on spatially explicit econometric simulation models linked to spatially referenced bio-physical simulation models to simulate land use and input use decisions. The methodology has been applied for the potato–pasture production system in the Ecuadorian Andes. Results of the analysis are presented in the form of tradeoff curves between different indicators, but also as maps, and risks diagrams. Besides an analysis of the current status, the approach allows for the analysis of alternative scenarios showing the effect of those scenarios on the position and slope of the tradeoff curve. "

abstract = "In the last 50 years, theoretical and practical approaches to promoting agricultural innovations have been evolving. Initial innovation diffusion theories led to a linear, top-down approach of technology transfer. However, changes occurred in the 1970s and 1980s, such as the economic structural adjustment which caused a dramatic decrease in governmental agricultural research and extension services in several developing countries. Simultaneously a number of new stakeholders (NGOs, private companies, farmer organizations, local governments, etc.) started to contribute to agricultural innovations more actively in the 1990s and 2000s. As the changes occurred, scholars began proposing new theories, such as the innovation systems approach, to explain how multiple stakeholders interact, exchange information, generate knowledge and develop innovations for solving problems. The paper describes the results of a rapid appraisal of potato innovation systems in Bolivia, Ethiopia, Peru and Uganda. The method was useful for identifying components and limitations in the system at pilot sites. Results indicate that the systems had similar types of components, namely national and local government organizations, NGOs, private companies, farmer organizations and media; another common feature was the limited interaction among organizational components, which reduced farmer access to information, technologies, organizations, markets and services. However, the role of organizational components was different across countries. Farmer organizations played a limited role at the pilot sites in these countries, except in Bolivia. The role of national governments was also limited in Bolivia and Peru, but played a major role in Ethiopia and Uganda at the moment of the study. Local governments were starting to play an important role in the four sites. \{NGOs\} played an active role in most countries, and the private companies in charge of input supply were more active in Bolivia and Peru. Media (radio) were present, but they were not contributing significantly to disseminating information for innovation. The International Potato Center (CIP) was present in all the systems, playing a role of innovation brokerage. Results indicate that different types of intervention would be needed for each country to strengthen the roles that components were already playing, but should look for improving interactions among components. In Ethiopia, strengthening innovation capacity of potato-related government organizations would be desirable to start the process, but in Bolivia, Peru and Uganda, enhancing interactions and coordination among government organizations, NGOs, private companies and farmer organizations would be needed, for example, to improve farmer access to quality planting material and markets. The role of farmer organizations and the private companies in charge of input supply need to be strengthened in the potato innovation systems in all places. The rapid appraisal of potato innovation systems has shown to be a method with potential to start understanding the complexity of the innovation systems and identify potential entry points for interventions.

We have adopted a molecular approach to open the ‘black box’ of organic N cycling in soil. Stable isotope probing employing compound-specific isotopic analysis was used to trace the fate of N and C within metabolites central to organic N cycling. In time course experiments, 15N and 13C from two dual-labelled amino acid (AA) substrates (U-13C,15N-glutamate and U-13C,15N-glycine) were followed into \{AAs\} biosynthesised de novo. In the majority of cases, highly significant differences (P &lt; 0.01) were revealed in the magnitude and rate of N and C transfer from the \{AA\} substrates to products of central metabolic pathways prior to their loss from the \{AA\} pool. By applying linear and non-linear regressions, several important parameters were derived, namely rate constants, magnitude of fluxes and measures of biosynthetic proximity, which describe the rate and magnitude of N and C flux through primary metabolic processes. The significant differences in N and C processing demonstrate a decoupling of the N and C cycles at the molecular level, i.e. after 32 days the magnitude of N flux into newly biosynthesised \{AAs\} was twofold greater than that of C from both substrates. We anticipate that the parameters derived will have potential for use in developing detailed models of soil organic N and C processing, the construction of which is founded on the connectivity of the processes fundamental to life.

Using this assay, the effects of influential factors affecting the in vitro \{IPNS\} enzymatic reaction were investigated.

Iron(II) depletion and product inhibition were not the cause of this phenomenon, the addition of antioxidants or reducing agents failed to slow down inactivation or reactivate the enzyme.

The molecular electrostatic potentials and dipole moments of the three isomers were calculated by ab initio quantum mechanics (HF/6-311G). The single crystal X-ray analyses reveal non-planar structures. This non-coplanarity is retained during docking of the compounds into a model of hTDO, the molecular target of this series. The position of the Cl atom does not significantly affect the electronic delocalization. Nevertheless, the position of the Cl atom produces a local variation of bond lengths inducing different dipole moments for these isomers. Variations in dipole moments are consistent with the different melting points and crystal packings. Differences in aqueous solubilities are best explained by subtle changes in H-bonds resulting from different accessibilities of the indole NH's due to steric effects of the Cl substituent. The non-coplanarity plays an important role in the crystalline packing of the molecules in contrast to the position of the Cl. This study leads to a better understanding of the structural and electronic characteristics of this chemical series and can potentially help to better understand their inhibitory activity. "

Both accuracy and precision of additive genetic variance and heritability estimates were greatly influenced by the number and size of families. Based on estimates obtained empirically, optimum sample sizes for the number of families per provenance and the number of trees per family was proposed and compared with those obtained from analysing the data as a provenance trial (i. e., no family structure).

Le lendemain de l'accouchement, la maman, fébrile (40°C), est mise sous céfotaxime par voie intraveineuse pendant 48 heures, puis sous cefpodoxime pendant 15 jours. Vingt-quatre heures après sa naissance, le nouveau-né, également fébrile, est hypotonique et geignard. Il a été placé sous perfusion d'hydroxyéthylamidon et traité par une association de céfotaxime, nétilmicine et amoxicilline. L'évolution clinique de la mère et de l'enfant est rapidement favorable.

Background. — Materno-fetal infection due to Pasteurella multocida is rare; it may be severe in the neonate. Case report. — A 27-year old woman was admitted at 37 weeks' gestation with a history of abdominal cramps. Twenty-four hours after delivery, the mother was febrile (40°C) and was given intravenous cefotaxime (2 days), followed by cefpodoxime (15 days). The newborn was febrile and hypotonic 24 hours after birth; he received an infusion of hydroxyethylamidon and was given cefotaxime (3 days), netilmicin (6 days) and amoxicillin (10 days). Pasteurella multocida was isolated from placenta, blood and gastric fluid in the baby and in blood cultures and vaginal swab in the mother. It was established that the mother was bitten by her dog during the pregnancy and wounded a few days before delivery. Conclusion. — This neonate was infected during the delivery and the source of mother's contamination was easy to determinate: pet animals were kept by the family and there was an history of wounds during her pregnancy.

One of CA's key principles is the maintenance of soil cover often by retaining a proportion of crop residues on the field as mulch. Yet smallholder crop–livestock systems across Africa and Asia face trade-offs among various options for crop residue use. Knowledge of the potential trade-offs of leaving more residues as mulch is only partial and the objective of this research is to address some of these knowledge gaps by assessing the trade-offs in contrasting settings with mixed crop–livestock systems. The paper draws from village surveys in 12 sites in 9 different countries across Sub-Sahara Africa and South Asia. Sites were clustered into 3 groups along the combined population and livestock density gradients to assess current crop residue management practices and explore potential challenges to adopting mulching practices in different circumstances. Results show that although high-density sites face higher potential pressure on resources on an area basis, biomass production tends to be more substantial in these sites covering demands for livestock feed and allowing part of the residues to be used as mulch. In medium-density sites, although population and livestock densities are relatively lower, biomass is scarce and pressure on land and feed are high, increasing the pressure on crop residues and their opportunity cost as mulch. In low-density areas, population and livestock densities are relatively low and communal feed and fuel resources exist, resulting in lower potential pressure on residues on an area basis. Yet, biomass production is low and farmers largely rely on crop residues to feed livestock during the long dry season, implying substantial opportunity costs to their use as mulch. Despite its potential benefit for smallholder farmers across the density gradient, the introduction of CA-based mulching practices appears potentially easier in sites where biomass production is high enough to fulfil existing demands for feed and fuel. In sites with relatively high feed and fuel pressure, the eventual introduction of \{CA\} needs complementary research and development efforts to increase biomass production and/or develop alternative sources to alleviate the opportunity costs of leaving some crop residues as mulch.

Methods One hundred twenty bovine dentin specimens were infected intraorally by using a removable orthodontic device. Thirty samples were used for each irrigant solution: 2% chlorhexidine and 1%, 2.5%, and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). The solutions were used for 5, 15, and 30 minutes and at 2 experimental volumes, 500 μL and 1 mL. The samples were stained by using acridine orange dye before and after the experiments and evaluated by using a confocal microscope. The percentage of biofilm, isolated cells, and noncolonized dentin was measured by using a grid system. Differences in the reduction or increase of the studied parameters were assessed by using nonparametric methods (P &lt; .05). Results The higher values of biofilm dissolution and noncolonized dentin were found in the 30-minute NaOCl group and in the 5-minute and 15-minute groups of 5.25% NaOCL. The use of 2% chlorhexidine solution did not improve the biofilm dissolution or increase the cleaning of the dentin in comparison with the NaOCl solutions (P &lt; .05). Conclusions Two percent chlorhexidine does not dissolve the biofilms. Thirty minutes of NaOCl are necessary to have higher values of biofilm dissolution and to increase the cleaning of the dentin independently of the concentration in comparison with the 5-minute and 15-minute contact times.

The selected pesticides represent a broad range of polarity and volatility [benzoylcyclohexanedione (mesotrione and sulcotrione); chloroacetamide (acetochlor, alachlor, dimethenamide, and metolachlor); phenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D and MCPA); phenoxypropionic (dichloprop and mecoprop); phenylurea (chlortoluron, diuron, isoproturon, linuron, and metoxuron); sulfonylurea (foramsulfuron, iodosulfuron, and nicolsulfuron); triazine (atrazine, cyanazine, desethylatrazine (DEA), desisopropylatrazine (DIA), simazine, and terbutylazine)]. The analytes were extracted using solid-phase extraction (SPE). The separation was carried out on an acquity \{UPLC\} \{BEH\} \{C18\} column (1.7 μm, 50 mm × 1 mm ID) using a gradient elution profile and mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid in water and acetonitrile. The pesticides were detected with a tandem mass spectrometer after being ionised positively or negatively (depending on the molecule) using an electrospray ionisation (ESI) source. To achieve the suitable extraction conditions for sample preparation, several parameters affecting the efficiency of \{SPE\} such as the nature of the sorbent and the eluent, extractant volume and pH were studied. The best recovery was obtained by the extraction with an Oasis \{HLB\} cartridge and 3 mL of a solution of acetonitrile/dichloromethane (1:1, v/v) at pH 2. The average recoveries of the pesticides in different samples ranged from 82 to 109%. The weight least squares (WLS) linear regression was used to calculate the limits of detection and quantification (LOD and LOQ) because the dispersion was heteroskedastic. All the pesticides could be correctly quantified at a concentration level of 50 ng L−1 and most of them could be detected at a concentration inferior or equal to 8 ng L−1. Efficiency and robustness of this method were evaluated by the analysis of several samples of real natural water. "

We then look at how friendships are formed, focusing on the concepts of propinquity and homophily and how they play out within the context of online friendships. We delineate the major dimensions of friendship that have emerged in theory and research and then comment on how these features of friendship may be affected by the advent of widespread electronic communication. The differences between offline and online companionship, social support, tangible support and protection, exclusiveness, conflict resolution and relationship stability are also considered. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the challenges of conducting research on the behaviour of children and young people on the Internet and the difficulties in defining the term “friendship.” "

Computer-based learning environments that offer learner control (LC) to the learners are assumed to enhance motivation and learning outcomes. Recently, the focus of \{LC\} research has shifted from measuring the direct effect of \{LC\} on learning towards focusing on the underlying mechanisms of effective \{LC\} and determining under which conditions \{LC\} is most effective (Corbalan, Kester, &amp; van Merriënboer, 2009). There is considerable agreement that learners’ skills, perceptions and the experienced cognitive load interactively affect \{LC\} as instructional strategy. For this study, 165 first-year university students participated in an on-line English learning course on verb conjugation. We investigated the effect of learners’ perceptions of \{LC\} by comparing the learning outcomes and motivation of learners that received additional instructions on learner control with a group of learners that did not receive additional instruction. Learner characteristics, such as prior knowledge, working memory capacity, self-efficacy and cognitive load, were taken into account. The results indicate that it is not instruction as such, but rather satisfaction with the degree of control that affects learning outcomes and motivation. We suggest that instruction as such does not suffice to enhance perception of control, and that learners’ perceptions play a mere role in the effectiveness of instructional strategies such as learner control.

In the medium voltage range (200–1000 V), the on-state performance of vertical \{FLIMOSFET\} is strongly improved when compared to the conventional MOSFET. For instance, for a 900-V vertical FLIMOSFET, a reduction of the specific on-resistance of about 70% relative to the conventional structure and of 40% relative to the silicon limit is observed. But for a 180-V lateral FLIMOSFET, a reduction of 28% relative to the conventional structure is observed, which is not a very significant improvement when compared to medium voltage vertical devices.

The results show that zinc retention varied from 96 to 99%, depending on the composition of solution and operating conditions. At work pH (pH = 5.0), zinc was at 99.99% in the form of Zn2+ (Cheaqs v. L20.1, a program for calculating chemical equilibria in aquatic systems, RIVM, Bilthoven, The Netherlands,-2004); a better retention (99%) was obtained with low energy. Thus, the optimal transmembrane pressure was 5 bar in the case of a 75 ppm solution. At low concentration (3.99 ppm), the retention decreased when the pressure exceeded 8 bar. These results differ from the majority of those presented in previous works regarding metal ion nanofiltration. At P = 5 bar and when the concentration increased (from 75 to 559 ppm), the repulsion phenomenon became less important due to a higher interaction between membrane and metal ions, and consequently the latter was retained less (98%). Duly noted here is the influence of ionic strength related to the solution concentration on zinc rejection, which was found weak. "

We aimed to identify the most frequent type of psychiatric manifestation and symptomatological characteristics of psychosis following chloroquine ingestion (PFC). Method Out of a total of 4471 randomly selected recent-onset psychosis patients, 3610 consecutive patients who had responded to standard treatment were screened for entry in the study. We compared background clinicodemographic profile information and psychopathology of 51 \{PFC\} patients, who were either drug free or drug naive, to 51 brief psychotic disorder (BPD) patients who were matched in terms of age, sex and education. Only those patients who remitted within 8 weeks (PFC patients) or 4 weeks (BPD patients) were included. Cranial computed tomography, electroencephalography and lumbar puncture of the entire experimental group were normal, and none had Mini Mental Status Examination score &lt; 22. Group difference and correlational statistics (parametric and nonparametric) have been used to test the hypotheses and explain the results. Results The most common (76.2%) type of psychiatric disturbance in \{PCF\} group was mood disorder (mixed episode) accompanied by predominant irritability with little blunting of affect. \{PFC\} patients characteristically had prominent positive symptoms with visual hallucination and derealization experiences. They were more restless, agitated and anxious and had more disturbed thought content and orientation, but better preserved insight. There was no linear relationship between the amount of chloroquine consumed and the severity of psychosis. Conclusion Considering the large number of patients still receiving chloroquine especially in developing countries, this study has been presented to draw attention of the psychiatrists and other health professionals to the hazardous effect of chloroquine on mental health.

The method rests on a competition between a reference compound [R] for which the k2 and K values are already known and another inactivator [C]. During the experiments, the disappearance of the reference compound or the appearance of the ER* adduct is monitored. The analysis shows that under conditions where the k2 and K values for the competing substrate can be determined, the measured apparent first-order rate constant for the disappearance of the reference compound is not the sum of the rate constants obtained for each inactivator in the absence of the other. The method can be used to determine the K and k2 constants when an adequate reference compound is available, in particular, for the interactions between β-lactam antibiotics and penicillin-binding proteins. The precautions which must be taken to avoid large errors on the estimation of the parameters of the competing inactivator are discussed. Examples found in the literature are discussed where an erroneous simplified equation has been utilised, thus yielding incorrect values for k2 and K. Interestingly, the correct values can be calculated on the basis of the published results which do not contain the raw experimental data. But some of the values should be considered with a lot of caution since the experiments have not been performed under optimal conditions. "

A majority of men and women believe that women participate in decision-making, but that participation was of low efficacy. Women face significant obstacles to effective participation in forest decision-making in the community: weak community organization, pressure by spouses, difficulty organizing among themselves and informal sanctions. Improving meaningful participation of women in decision-making requires addressing challenges and obstacles at multiple levels; obstacles at the communal level, where the future of the forests will be decided, cannot be overcome without attention to the household.

In this study, different timings (at tuber initiation and bulking) and intensities (four soil moisture levels) of water restriction were tested in the potato crop. The temporal patterns of mid-morning or maximum, light saturated stomatal conductance (gs_max), recovery of net photosynthesis (Arecovery), stem water potential (Ψstem), carbon isotope discrimination in tubers (Δtuber), plant water concentration (PWC), photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and crop water stress index (CWSI) were analyzed. Early-severe water restriction caused a drastic yield reduction, with low recovery of physiological responses (gs_max, Δtuber, Ψstem, CWSI, Arecovery) after 15 days of post-restriction irrigation and even a continued reduction of some of them (PWC, PRI). It also caused a prolonged gs_max reduction below 0.05 mol \{H2O\} m−2 s−1 (≈ 5 μmol \{CO2\} m−2 s−1 of net photosynthesis) suggesting that this value defines a physiological severity threshold in potato, under which a metabolic impairment occurs. \{CWSI\} and \{PRI\} showed a close linear (R2 = 0.76) and no linear (natural logarithm function, \{R2\} = 0.67) relationship with gs_max respectively. In cloudless dry environments, irrigation schedules in potato should aim to avoiding \{CWSI\} values higher than 0.4, especially until before of maximum canopy cover establishment. A close relationship between Arecovery at maximum stress moment and yield reduction was found. The strong relationship between the measured traits (except \{PWC\} and Ψstem) and final yield at maximum stress moment found in the present study warrants further research on drought phenotyping immediately before post-restriction irrigation or when the defined severity threshold in potato is reached.

The aim of the present study was to conduct a comparative growth analysis of nine genotypes to describe their performance under the prevalent conditions in the high Andes. We also simulated the performance of nine genotypes from the species Solanum tuberosum subspecies andigenum and tuberosum, Solanum ajanhuiri, and their hybrids as affected by frost. The simulations were run using a user-friendly simulation model based on the \{LINTUL\} framework. Three native genotypes: Ajanhuiri (S. ajanhuiri), Gendarme and Waycha (S. tuberosum ssp. andigenum); one introduced genotype: Alpha (S. tuberosum ssp. tuberosum); and five hybrids (Condori, Tunari, Sajama, Illimani, and Totoreña) provided the crop data required as inputs to the model, from field experiments conducted over four years under favorable management conditions. Each experimental location also provided daily weather data required by the model. Genotypic differences, ascribed to parentage and ploidy, were evidenced by differences in growth response observed under a range of simulated frost scenarios. The diploid ajanhuiri showed better canopy cover and yield than most tetraploids. However, the average yield of the tetraploids was reduced by including the long day Alpha genotype (tuberosum), which did not perform as well as the others. Nevertheless, Alpha showed higher harvest index than the average of the short day genotypes and hybrids. Andigenum genotypes showed 12% higher yields than the andigenum hybrids. Gendarme showed the best growth parameters overall followed by Waycha. The adapted \{LINTUL\} model was validated as it adequately (R2 &gt; 0.88) reproduced observed field responses in the calibration experiments. This correspondence between the simulations and the experimental results demonstrated the adequacy of the model, which explained more than 82% of the variations in growth parameters. All statistical metrics used to test the validity of the model to simulate potato yield and yield components in the high Andes showed the model's robustness. "

Within the scope of the national and regional strategies/initiatives, we have used a multi-analysis approach to characterize the national sweet potato germplasm collection at two different levels: i) genetic, morphological and agronomic diversity; and ii) agronomic potential (storage root yield, vine weight, biomass, harvest index and dry matter content) toward drought tolerance. This collection, composed by 44 accessions, comprises 28 genotypes cultivated in three different provinces of Mozambique (Gaza, Inhambane and Zambezia), nine from other African countries (Kenya, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe), one from the United States of America, and six from \{CGIAR\} research centers (IITA and CIP). According to our results, the Mozambican germplasm bank presents a high level of diversity, comparable to those from the collections of the primary centers of origin and South Africa, therefore constituting of a good source of agronomic traits for breeding. Regarding drought tolerance, six Mozambican genotypes (Admarc, Chingova, Nhacoongo-1, Xihetamakote, Nwanatuyo, and Chissicuana-2), one from Uganda (NASPOT-5), one from Zimbabwe (Moz_white), one from Kenya (SPK 004), and one from the \{USA\} (Resisto) seem to have the highest potential to be used in regions with frequent drought seasons and in future breeding programs. The results showed that such integrated analysis can be used to successfully characterize the genetic material in terms of suitability to drought-prone regions, therefore helping sweet potato crop management, with economic and food security impacts.

Recombinant \{DNA\} technology and Agrobacterium-based vector systems offer a novel approach to modify plant proteins and raise the possibility of increasing their nutritive value. Methods are described for the inoculation of in vitro potato plants with Agrobacterium rhizogenes containing, within the Ri plasmid, a synthetic gene sequence coding for a protein high in essential amino acids. This synthetic gene fragment (HEAAE-DNA), 292 basepairs in length, codes for a protein composed of about 80% essential amino acids. Plants were regenerated from the Agrobacterium-induced hairy roots and we present data that these transformed plants contain the synthetic gene insert. Furthermore, our evidence shows that this novel gene was transcribed and translated within the transformed plant. Tubers from regenerated potato plants were subjected to analysis for introduction and expression of this gene. Integration of the gene into the plant genome and its expression into mRNAs and HEAAE-proteins have been demonstrated using Southern, northern and western analysis. "

The location prediction is optimised by subsequently adding three location parameters: rainfall distribution, land-use classes and \{DEM\} derived slopes. Then the three most important model parameters are calibrated to find the best prediction for both stable and unstable areas. The landslides predicted by the LAPSUS-LS model are compared with a landslide inventory to validate the output. The optimal model settings for the calibration area are then applied to a validation area. Results show that model performance can be improved by adding the spatial distribution of rainfall and by stratifying according to land-use classes. Landslide prediction is better with fine resolution DEMs, mainly because the local topography is smoothed in coarser resolutions. Although in general the amount of landslides is over-predicted, the overall performance indicates that the model is able to capture the important factors determining landslide location. Additional spatially distributed data such as regolith or soil depth and regeneration rates of the legacy effect can further enhance the model's prediction. "

The Tradeoff Analysis (TOA) System is software designed to implement the integrated analysis of tradeoffs in agricultural systems. The \{TOA\} methodology is based on spatially explicit econometric simulation models linked to spatially referenced bio-physical simulation models to simulate land use and input decisions. The methodology has been applied for the potato-pasture production system in the Ecuadorian Andes. The land use change literature often describes non-linearity in land use change as a result of sudden changes in the political (e.g. new agricultural policies) or environmental setting (e.g. earthquakes). However, less attention has been paid to the non-linearities in production systems and their consequences for land use change. In this paper, we use the \{TOA\} system to study agricultural land use dynamics and to find the underlying processes for non-linearities. Results show that the sources of non-linearities are in the properties of bio-physical processes and in the decision making-process of farmers. "

Total 12 acylated anthocyanins are identified. Top three anthocyanins, e.g., cyanidin 3-caffeoyl-p-hydroxybenzoyl sophoroside-5-glucoside, peonidin 3-caffeoyl sophoroside-5-glucoside, and cyanidin 3-(6″-caffeoyl-6″-feruloylsophoroside)-5-glucoside, account for half of the anthocyanin contents. Over 80% of anthocyanins measured by acid hydrolysis were cyanidin derivatives, indicating \{P40\} is unique when compared with other purple-fleshed sweet potatoes that usually contain more peonidin than cyanidin. Steaming, pressure cooking, microwaving, and frying but not baking significantly reduced 8–16% of total anthocyanin contents. Mono-acylated anthocyanins showed a higher resistance against heat than di- and non-acylated. Among of which, cyanidin 3-p-hydroxybenzoylsophoroside-5-glucoside exhibited the best thermal stability. The stable acylated and cyanidin-predominated anthocyanins in \{P40\} may provide extra benefits for cancer prevention. "

A selection of five field grown native Andean cultivars, presenting contrasting polyphenol profiles, was used. Moreover, we investigated the expression of the genes after a drought exposure. We concluded that the diverse polyphenolic profiles are correlated to variations in gene expression profiles. The drought-induced variations of the gene expression was highly cultivar-specific. In the three anthocyanin-containing cultivars, gene expression was coordinated and reflected at the metabolite level supporting a hypothesis that regulation of gene expression plays an essential role in the potato polyphenol production. We proposed that the altered sucrose flux induced by the drought stress is partly responsible for the changes in gene expression.

There were two qualitatively different results for changes in system variance. If median conditions are conducive to loss, increasing system variance decreases mean yield loss. On the other hand, if median conditions are intermediate or poor for disease or pest development, such that conditions are conducive to yield loss no more than half the time, increasing system variance increases mean yield loss. Time series for weather conduciveness that are darker pink (have higher levels of temporal autocorrelation) produce intermediate levels of yield loss less commonly. A linked model of decision-making based on either past or current information about yield loss also shows changes in the performance of decision rules as a function of system variance. Understanding patterns of variance can improve scenario analysis for climate change and help make adaptation strategies such as decision support systems and insurance programs more effective. "

Total carbohydrates were extracted as their monosaccharide components and analysed as the alditol acetates using gas chromatography. The δ13C values of the major monosaccharides glucose (−11.5 ±0.6‰), xylose (−10.4 ±0.4‰), arabinose (−10.4 ±0.5‰) and galactose (−8.3 ±1.6‰) extracted from the \{C4\} dung via acid hydrolysis were indicative of their source. Their weighted mean δ13C value was −10.8‰, 1.8‰ more 13C-enriched than the bulk dung value. The δ13C values of individual monosaccharides recovered by acid hydrolysis in the 0–1 cm and 1–5 cm soil horizons beneath \{C4\} cow pats, compared with control soils determined over 372 days, allowed assessment of the extent of incorporation and fluxes of dung-derived monosaccharides. A maximum of 60% of the dung C in soil was derived from carbohydrates after 56 days, declining to around 20% after 372 days. Incorporation dynamics varied between monosaccharide species. Glucose, xylose and arabinose behaved in a similar manner because of their predominantly plant cell wall derived provenance in the dung, whilst dung-derived galactose and mannose appeared to have a microbial source in the soil. The dynamics of total dung-derived monosaccharides in the top 5 cm was comparable to incorporation and flux of bulk dung C, previously estimated using bulk δ13C values. The movement of dung-derived carbohydrates into the soil was inequivalent between the 0–1 cm and 1–5 cm horizons. The lack of a significant difference in concentration, but the evidence for the persistence of dung-derived monosaccharides in soil based on δ13C values, indicated replacement of existing pools in the soil, suggesting that the ability of this particular soil to sequester further C derived from carbohydrates was limited.

Streptococus pneumoniae, aun no siendo el agente causal más habitual, debe ser considerado en especial en el contexto de procesos infecciosos de vías respiratorias. Caso clínico Niño de 17 meses, sin antecedentes relevantes, no vacunado frente a neumococo. Tras 10 días de fiebre, ingresa en un hospital con el diagnóstico de neumonía, detectándose antígeno neumocócico en orina. Tras practicar hemocultivos, se inicia tratamiento intravenoso con amoxicilina-ácido clavulánico, que se sustituye por cefotaxima a las 48 h ante persistencia de fiebre. Al cuarto día aparecen signos de insuficiencia cardíaca congestiva, destacando soplo sistólico regurgitante III/VI en foco mitral de nueva aparición. Ecocardiograma: vegetación en el velo anterior de la válvula mitral (8 × 8 mm) que produce insuficiencia mitral grave. Se diagnostica endocarditis infecciosa y se deriva al niño a nuestro centro vía \{SEM\} pediátrico, para reevaluación y tratamiento. Se modifica la antibioterapia intravenosa empírica: meropenem, gentamicina, vancomicina y rifampicina. Precisa ventilación mecánica y soporte vasoactivo (dopamina y milrinona). La búsqueda de focos infecciosos a distancia (TC craneal, ecografía abdominal, gammagrafía ósea y estudio del LCR), así como del agente etiológico, resultan negativas. Ante la persistencia de fiebre e inestabilidad hemodinámica, se decide intervención quirúrgica con circulación extracorpórea a los 10 días del diagnóstico. Se reseca el tejido valvular, se realiza limpieza y se procede a colocación de prótesis mitral mecánica. El postoperatorio cursa sin incidencias con desaparición de la fiebre a las 24 h. El estudio anatomopatológico de la válvula muestra una perforación con una gran vegetación friable; el estudio microscópico confirma el diagnóstico de endocarditis infecciosa. Mediante técnica de \{PCR\} se identifica a posteriori en el tejido valvular Streptococcus pneumoniae. El paciente es dado de alta hospitalaria tras completar 6 semanas de tratamiento intravenoso con vancomicina y gentamicina. A los 6 meses el niño se encuentra asintomático y sigue terapia anticoagulante por ser portador de válvula protésica. El estudio global de inmunidad resulta normal. Conclusiones Debemos estar alerta ante un posible aumento en la incidencia de formas graves de infección neumocócica, incluso en niños sanos, que pueden suponer un reto terapéutico para la UCIP. En el caso de la endocarditis infecciosa, los mejores resultados derivan de una adecuada combinación de tratamiento médico y quirúrgico. En cualquier caso, los pediatras intensivistas no debemos olvidar nuestro papel en la promoción de estrategias preventivas, como en este caso la vacunación antineumocócica. "

This paper examines patterns of association between household wealth, poverty, and livelihood dependency either on forest extraction or agricultural activities in Ucayali, Peru. The analysis is based on survey data of 578 households with geographical, ethnic and environmental heterogeneity. A typology of economic strategies was defined through relative income shares derived from agriculture, forest, wages and other income sources. Our results show that households have multifaceted livelihood systems. While forest/environmental products provide nearly 40% of total income, agriculture is critical to both indigenous communities and to farmers of non-Amazonian origin. We test the hypothesis that households relying on agriculture are wealthier than forest-dependent households. In addition, we examine the role played by ethnicity and location as interacting variables. The analysis suggests a strong role of specific ethnic and locational configurations in shaping income and asset patterns, with some weak evidence of statistically lower poverty levels being credited to dependency on forest products. Context-specific assessments of livelihood–environment interactions provide critical insights to development and environmental policies and programs, which need to recognize different forms through which households integrate forest use and agriculture.

In this research, the focus is on the use of adaptive item sequencing in an educational math game (Monkey Tales) as a way to provide learning content that is adapted to the knowledge level of the learner or player. One way to provide this is adjusting the difficulty level of the content that is presented hence allowing for optimal learning during gameplay. In order to realize this, accurate estimates of the learners’ skills are necessary, as well as accurate estimates of variables in the gaming environment that determine how much difficulty learners may experience while completing the items. The goal of this study is to compare difficulty ratings from users and experts in order to acquire reliable estimates of the difficulty of the math rules offered in Monkey Tales. The results suggest a double format effect: not only the gaming format adds difficulty to educational content, but also the format by which educational content is presented in a game is likely to add difficulty which affects learners’ in-game performance.

Owing to the intrinsic chemical resistance and low reactivity of polyolefins, the post-modification processes involve the use of free-radicals and are generally carried out at high temperature, rendering the reactions non-selective. Cross-linking and degradation set boundaries of the desired grafting reaction and their extent of grafting depends on the type of polyolefin and nature/type of chemicals used. The occurrence of these side reactions can severely damage the structure of polyolefins with poor control of ultimate properties. The main purpose here is to describe the conventional process in terms of chemical reactions involved, down to the molecular mechanism, and the dependence on chemicals/reagents nature and amounts. Particular attention is focused on methodologies aimed to hinder side reactions. The corresponding new functionalization approaches are based on well-known process chemistry and are all directed to control the grafting levels and structure/architecture of the initial polymer. Finally, a section is devoted to problems related to the radical post-modification processes of polypropylenes and obtaining new interesting materials by controlling their structure/architecture with the use of specific mono- or poly-functional co-agents as macroradical stabilizers.

The degradation efficiency has been compared in different continuous flow reactors: a photocatalytic tangential reactor (PTR) where the air flows tangentially over the catalytic medium and two photocatalytic filtering reactors (PFR) where the air flows through the porous catalytic medium. The degradation rate shows a linear dependence with the concentration of pollutants (up to 350 mg PCE/N m3) for the PTR, but the degradation was negligible for the PFR. The degradation rate was enhanced by accelerating the chlorine radicals’ formation (by adding \{HCl\} in catalytic quantity in the air flow or by \{PCE\} over-heating). In these conditions, the oxidation rate constant of \{PCE\} in the \{PFR\} was about five times higher than that in the PTR, although the mass of catalyst involved in the \{PFR\} was about 10 times lower and the contact time was about a 1000 times shorter than that of the PTR. Thus, the catalyst is globally more efficiently used in the PFR, as the mass transfer is not limiting. As a result, a degradation mechanism of PCE, involving the generation of free chlorine radicals, as the first limiting step, has been confirmed. "

Thirty seven per cent of the samples exceeded the 10 μg/kg regulatory limit for aflatoxin levels set by the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS). Raw podded peanuts had the lowest (χ2 = 167.78; P &lt; 0.001) levels of aflatoxin, with 96% having levels of less than 4 μg/kg and only 4% having more than 10 μg/kg.

A large proportion of peanuts in the country (44%) were traded through informal open air markets; 71.8% of products from supermarkets were safe according to \{KEBS\} and the \{EU\} regulatory limits, while only 52% from informal markets met this threshold (χ2 = 95.13; P &lt; 0.001).

Over 70% of all storage structures were poorly ventilated and dusty. Sorting comprised 53% of the various crop protection measures used by traders post-harvest. To reduce aflatoxin exposure to consumers, set standards need to be complemented by strict monitoring systems and education of producers, processors and consumers in crop commodities other than maize, which has received the most attention in Kenya.

Vegetation clearance had significant detrimental effects on earthworm activity. With an increasing length of continuous cropping, cast deposition declined. In young fallows, cast production exceeded levels attained in previously un-cropped controls on Alfisols, yet, on Ultisols, it depended on the previous \{LUS\} and length of the previous cropping phase. Recovery was highest after agrisilviculture and after clearing bush fallow. After forest clearance, burning and one year cropping, cast deposition did not recover within three years. On Alfisols, cast production was higher under planted tree fallow and natural fallow than under herbaceous fallow. On Ultisols, fallow type had no effect. Earthworm surface cast production contributes to soil quality. However, its suitability as an indicator of soil quality is limited to rough assessments as it is dependent upon earthworm species composition, vegetation management and soil type, with more drastic changes on the poorer Ultisols than the more fertile Alfisols.

For upgrade liquid/solid separation and pathogen retention in biological treatment, a membrane system was used with the aim of effluent reuse in flush. Despite an evolution of \{FM\} through time, centrifuge pre-treatment and bioreactor performances stayed at high level. An elimination of 86% of the suspended solids occurred through pre-treatment, and nitrogen and \{COD\} biological degradation remains at 90% all time long. Moreover, interestingly about half of the soluble part of phosphorus (20% of the global phosphorus content) was biologically removed via the recirculation between the anoxic and the aerobic tank which acted as an intermittent aerobic/anoxic sequence. A part of \{COD\} was proved not biodegradable and was accumulated via the reuse of the treated water for flushing purpose. This accumulation justifies washing of the biomass between two runs in purpose to enhance the treated water quality and also to meet the membrane tolerance.

Hunter color parameters could also be used for predictions, but with lower accuracy than NIRS. \{NIRS\} or chromameter improve selection protocols, allowing faster gains from breeding. Results also demonstrate that \{TBC\} and \{DMC\} can be improved simultaneously (required for the adoption of biofortified cassava). "

abstract = "Water quality is questionable when looking at the emerging pollutants that accumulate in hydrosphere day after day. In terms of water treatments to eliminate organic compounds, biological treatments are the most used technique, especially the conventional activated sludge (CAS) process. Unfortunately, several of these compounds such as petroleum and industrial wastes, some pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and hormonal substances appear to be refractory to such treatments and can join the different water surfaces from other natural environments especially contaminated soils. Physical and chemical treatments, in particularly the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are able to degrade some of these pollutants, but the nature and the possible effects of oxidation by-products remain controversial when complete mineralization does not occur. The aim of this article is to shed light on new and renewed biotechnological techniques recently introduced to resolve recalcitrance problem. Amending activated sludge with additional microorganisms able to produce versatile enzymes to enhance biodegradability or “bioaugmentation”, is gradually considered as a possible solution for the recalcitrance of Bio-Refractory Organic Compounds (Bio-ROCs). The use of this technique, traditionally in soil remediation field, and recently in water and sediments treatment is reviewed in this paper. "

Whereas abatement increased with velocities, pH and the chlorine concentration, an increase of inlet \{CH3SH\} concentration drove to a worse efficiency of process. Moreover, the contactor length and the presence of another pollutant in the gas phase only played a role on the methylmercaptan removal.

All compounds behave as acylating inhibitors of \{PBP2a\} and one β-lactam (5c), embedded into the largest ring (32 atoms), features an activity close to that of Ceftobiprole. Conformational analyses, theoretical reactivity models and docking experiments in \{PBP2a\} cavity allow to propose a novel pharmacophore, i.e. the 3-(S)-acylamino-1-acyl-2-azetidinone ring, with the syn-conformation of the imide function, associated to a flexible macrocycle favoring the opening of the active site.

We investigated whether judgments in a same–different task with digits are based upon the numerical value or upon the physical similarity of the digits. In addition, we investigated whether the numerical distance effect decreases with increasing age. Finally, we examined whether the performance in this task is related to general mathematics achievement. Our results reveal that a same–different task with digits is not an appropriate task to study magnitude representations, because already late kindergarteners base their responses on the physical similarity instead of the numerical value of the digits. When decisions cannot be made on the basis of physical similarity, a similar numerical distance effect is present over all age groups. This suggests that the magnitude representation is stable from late kindergarten onwards. The size of the numerical distance effect was not related to mathematical achievement. However, children with a poorer mathematics achievement score seemed to have more difficulties to link a symbol with its corresponding magnitude. "

However, it is still unclear whether IL-38 is an inflammatory or an anti-inflammatory cytokine. We generated anti-human IL-38 monoclonal antibodies in order to perform immunohistochemical staining and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. While human recombinant IL-38 protein was not cleaved by recombinant caspase-1, chymase, or \{PR3\} in vitro, overexpression of IL-38 cDNA produced a soluble form of IL-38 protein. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis showed that synovial tissues obtained from \{RA\} patients strongly expressed IL-38 protein. To investigate the biological role of IL-38, C57BL/6 IL-38 gene-deficient (−/−) mice were used in an autoantibody-induced rheumatoid arthritis (RA) mouse model. As compared with control mice, IL-38 (−/−) mice showed greater disease severity, accompanied by higher IL-1β and IL-6 gene expression in the joints. Therefore, IL-38 acts as an inhibitor of the pathogenesis of autoantibody-induced arthritis in mice and may have a role in the development or progression of \{RA\} in humans. "

Review of the \{VOC\} policy shows that barges neither fall under an integrated pollution prevention and control permit nor any other regulation or incentive related environmental policy. Current situation and trend in this area is presented through a case study of the Danube River, Serbia. The case study shows that evaporative losses have increased c ca 22 times in period 2006–2010 and, that vapour collection system can reduce \{VOC\} emissions by up to 3 times. A proposal for improved \{VOC\} policy has been developed in detail based on the following elements: a) The appropriate Best Available Techniques reference document (BREF) should include the transport sector; b) Mandatory reporting of \{VOC\} emitted during barge transport of crude oil and crude oil derivates should be introduced, and c) A pollution charge should be introduced on all barges without vapour collection system installed “onboard”. Three potential scenarios for the \{VOC\} charge are presented, which vary according to the charge introducing dynamics. The differences between scenarios are in initial levels of charge, but the final charge is same for all three and it is proposed to be 220 € per capacity ton. "

From this analysis, amino acids involved in the oligomerization of \{L1\} are clearly identified. Despite the similarity in fold, the active site of FEZ-1 was found to be significantly different. Two residues, which were previously implicated in function, are not present in \{L1\} or in FEZ-1.

We utilized multiple methods, including Stages-of-Progress and household surveys, which gave us a combination of qualitative and quantitative results. We examined how over the last 10 and 25 years households have moved into and out of poverty in 40 rural communities in two different highland regions of Peru. We also examined the role played in these movements by different livestock assets and strategies. We found a significant number of households had escaped poverty, while at the same time many households have fallen into poverty. The reasons for movements up versus down are not the same, with different strategies and policies needed to address escapes versus descents. Diversification of income through livestock and intensification of livestock activities through improved breeds has helped many households escape poverty and this method allowed us to explore what exactly this means in the diverse areas studied. These findings can contribute to better targeted livestock-related research and development strategies and policies, not only in Peru, but in other regions where similar livelihood strategies are being pursued.

Moreover, dynamic viscosity can be obtained over a wide range of shear rates (up to 50000 s−1) with both Bagley and Rabinowitsch corrections. The rheological data obtained for a poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate), \{PHBV\} copolymer shows that the reduction in viscosity associated with degradation is very fast and is detectable even at temperatures close to the melting point. Size Exclusion Chromatography analysis of selected samples shows that, except for residence times below 15s, molecular mass distribution is substantially affected, shifting toward lower masses, and with an increase in oligomer compound content. These oligomers may act as plasticizers of the bioplastic. The results also suggest that important thermomechanical degradation takes place during the plasticization/feeding step of injection molding. "

Furthermore, the use of alloplastic materials to be modelled intraoperatively may result in an inflammatory tissue response. Therefore the question is raised whether CAD/CAM-techniques may be used for the pre-operative geometric modelling of the implant based on helical computed tomography data. A numerically based 3-dimensional model of the skull defect serves as the basis for a freeform-surfaces design of the implant shape, position and thickness, using modelling tools and programmes developed for industrial CAD/CAM. The precise and individual fit of the implant results from generating its margins by the borders of the defect, whereas the implant surface is generated by the geometry of the non-affected neighbouring bone contours. The implant data run a numerically controlled milling machine to fabricate the individual implant. The reconstruction of post-traumatic defects of the forehead, of post-surgical temporal defects after intracranial haemorrhage, and of a parieto-occipital defect due to ablative tumour surgery are presented as the first clinical experiences of this new method.

The development of the autoimmune diabetogenic response results from a thymus dysfunction in programing central self-tolerance to pancreatic insulin-secreting islet β cells, leading to the breakdown of immune homeostasis with an enrichment of islet β-cell reactive effector T cells and a deficiency of β-cell specific natural regulatory T cells (nTregs) in the peripheral T-lymphocyte repertoire. Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) is the dominant member of the insulin family expressed during fetal life by the thymic epithelium under the control of the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene/protein. The very low degree of insulin gene transcription in normal murine and human thymus explains why the insulin protein is poorly tolerogenic as demonstrated in many studies, including the failure of all clinical trials that have attempted immune tolerance to islet β cells via various methods of insulin administration. On the basis of the close homology and crosstolerance between insulin, the primary \{T1D\} autoantigen, and IGF-2, the dominant self-antigen of the insulin family, a novel type of vaccination, so-called ‘negative/tolerogenic self-vaccination’, is currently being developed for the prevention and cure of T1D.

The analyses were carried out in three different drinking water supplies from the Paris area, during the four seasons. Free amino acids were monitored at the inlet of the plant. The odorous disinfection by-products were analyzed at the outlet of each drinking water treatment plant and the different distribution networks were connected to the corresponding plant. The results confirmed that the odorous chloraldimines are produced during chlorination of free amino acids in three different matrixes in different seasons throughout the year (N-chloroisobutaldimine; N-chloromethyl-2-butaldimine; N-chloromethyl-3-butaldimine (6–10 nM). The analytical method (HS/Trap/GC/MS) used to monitor odorous disinfection by-products appeared to be adapted for the detection of these by-products at nM level. "

Three conditions are established: a condition in which internal support is offered, a condition in which (identical) external support is offered, and a control condition in which no support is added to the game. One hundred twenty-two vocational secondary education students participated in this study. The results of this study indicate that students benefit from playing with an educational game in order to enhance their proportional reasoning skills. Adding conceptual clarifications as instructional support in an intrinsically integrated game is not recommended. If the support is given to the students anyhow, it is advised to offer it externally because internally integrating this support leads to a decrease in performance and motivation. Hence, not only support as such, but also the way it is integrated in the game-based learning process, might be decisive for its effectivity. Obviously, further research is warranted in order to replicate these findings also for other types of support, other game-based learning environments and other target groups. "

In this investigation, for the first time, we have elucidated the subcellular localization of the enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle in the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Acetyl-CoA synthase and malate dehydrogenase exist as multiple isoforms in this microalga, therefore, we first identified those implicated in the glyoxylate cycle based on the observation that lack of isocitrate lyase (ICL) in a previously identified icl deficient mutant was correlated with specific loss of the other enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle. In this work, we determined that five of the six enzymes associated with the glyoxylate cycle were found to be within peroxisomal microbodies. Citrate synthase, aconitase, malate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, and acetyl-CoA synthase are located in peroxisomal microbodies while isocitrate lyase is cytosolic. Our findings implicate a key role for these cellular compartments in acetate assimilation for Chlamydomonas. Microbodies have only recently been discovered in C. reinhardtii and their existence had been previously debated. The isoform specific subcellular localization determined here suggests that peroxisomal microbodies should be considered in the design of metabolic models for carbon assimilation in C. reinhardtii.

Moreover, expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in this pathway may be coordinately regulated by multiple TFs. In this study, fruits on trees of apple cv. Red Delicious were covered with paper bags during early stages of fruit development and then removed prior to maturation to analyze the transcriptome in the exocarp of apple fruit. Comparisons of gene expression profiles of fruit covered with paper bags (dark-grown treatment) and those subjected to 14 h light treatment, following removal of paper bags, were investigated using an apple microarray of 40,000 sequences. Expression profiles were investigated over three time points, at one week intervals, during fruit development. Overall, 736 genes with expression values greater than two-fold were found to be modulated by light treatment. Light-induced products were classified into 19 categories with highest scores in primary metabolism (17%) and transcription (12%). Based on the Arabidopsis gene ontology annotation, 18 genes were identified as TFs. To further confirm expression patterns of flavonoid-related genes, these were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) using fruit of red-skinned apple cv. Red Delicious and yellow-skinned apple cv. Golden Delicious. Of these, two genes showed higher levels of expression in ‘Red Delicious’ than in ‘Golden Delicious’, and were likely involved in the regulation of fruit red color pigmentation. "

These plans have recently become widespread across \{EU\} southern basins. However, in some of these basins the plans were approved without an assessment of the potential impacts that they may have on the economic activities exposed to water restrictions. This paper develops a stochastic methodology to estimate the expected water availability in agriculture that results from the decision rules of the recently approved DMPs. The methodology is applied to the particular case of the Guadalquivir River Basin in southern Spain. Results show that if \{DMPs\} are successfully enforced, available water will satisfy in average 62.2% of current demand, and this figure may drop to 50.2% by the end of the century as a result of climate change. This is much below the minimum threshold of 90% that has been guaranteed to irrigators so far. "

The socioeconomic variables and macroeconomic conditions affect the intention to migrate indirectly through life satisfaction. At all levels of life satisfaction, individuals with similar characteristics have greater intentions to migrate from \{CEE\} countries than from non-CEE countries. These findings underscore the importance of individual life satisfaction not only as a strong predictor of the individual migration intention, but also as a mediator between individual socioeconomic variables and macroeconomic conditions and that intention.

The model is calibrated for the profitable Agricultural Districts (ADs) in the overexploited Segura River Basin (SRB) in southeastern Spain. Results show that water use is highly inelastic for charge increases below 0.5 €/m3 (i.e. a water charge increase of 600%), and only starts showing a significant reduction for water charges above this threshold. However, water charging can still be used to promote the swap of overused and inexpensive conventional resources by underused and more expensive desalinated water. "

Although forest management in developing countries has clearly been influenced by international processes in the past, exactly how and to what extent \{REDD\} + \{MRV\} has affected institutional arrangements for forest assessments in developing countries remains unknown. Using as a theoretical framework Discursive-Institutionalism, a concept derived from political science, this paper examines (1) the historical evolution of institutional arrangements for forest inventories in Peru; and (2) how and to what extent their development has been shaped by international processes on forests, and, more recently, specifically by \{REDD\} + MRV. The findings show that the international \{REDD\} + \{MRV\} discussion has expanded the objectives of forest assessments in Peru, inspired the mobilization of new actors and resources, and spawned the development of new protocols for forest assessments. However, the ‘depth’ of these changes is not yet extensive, since the new rules for forest inventories have not yet been formally adopted, and the institutes envisaged to implement forest inventories, including measurement of carbon stocks and their changes, have not been established.

Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is a novel modality for treating \{NHL\} which offers the combined use of monoclonal antibodies for specific targeting of malignant cells and radiation for killing these cells. Despite the promising results favoring \{RIT\} in several clinical studies in different target populations and \{NHL\} types, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for \{RIT\} agents is restricted to a limited number of indications and agents, maybe because of several ambiguities that still exist in the field. One of these ambiguities is the lack of evidence-based prognostic factors that determine what patient population would benefit most from RIT, which is essential to know in order to optimize the efficacy and safety of treatment with RIT. As well as selecting the best patient population for RIT, it is important to assess the response to \{RIT\} in order to provide further treatment strategies or avoid unnecessary therapies and diagnostic procedures. In this review we have explored the details of how to predict the efficiency of \{RIT\} based on various prognostic factors that have been investigated in the evidence, and also discussed the proposed methods and timing schedules for assessing the response to RIT. We have also pointed out the ambiguities in the aforementioned topics, which call for more investigation. "

This performance-based incentive mechanism requires accurate quantification of carbon stock and emissions. However, currently there are limited existing local or regional equations for estimating aboveground biomass in peat swamp forests. The main objective of this study was to define the most accurate models for aboveground biomass estimation in Indonesian peat swamp forests. We found that the pan-tropical equations performed better in estimating biomass of peat swamp forests than did existing local equations. We developed new equations, based on 148 trees from 24 families with diameter at breast height in the range of 2–167 cm collected from peat swamp forests in the western part of Indonesia. Statistical indicators showed that the best model form was the common linear one using log-transformed data. Estimated biomass values needs to be back-transformed applying correction factors. The ratio estimator correction factor which derives from the ratio between the average of measured biomass and the average of predicted biomass, was found to provide the lowest mean deviation. The existing pan-tropical equations performed similarly to our mixed species and dipterocarp models but they systematically under- or over-estimated the biomass of certain species groups, especially non-dipterocarp trees. We also found that grouping by family (dipterocarp vs. non-dipterocarp) and wood density class (hardwood vs. softwood) significantly improved the accuracy of biomass estimation. In the absence of wood density values, wood density-class specific equations, instead of mixed-species equations improved the accuracy of biomass estimates. "

Value depends on managing both the diversity of tree species present in landscapes and the genetic variation within these species. The benefits from trees and their genetic resources are, however, often not well quantified because trade is frequently outside formal markets, there is a multiplicity of species and ways in which trees are used and managed, and genetic diversity within species is frequently not given proper consideration. We review here what is known about the value of trees to rural communities through considering three production categories: non-timber products harvested from trees in natural and managed forests and woodlands; the various products and services obtained from a wide range of trees planted and/or retained in smallholders’ agroforestry systems; and the commercial products harvested from cultivated tree commodity crops. Where possible, we focus on the role of intra-specific genetic variation in providing support to livelihoods, and for each of the three production categories we also consider wider conservation and sustainability issues, including the linkages between categories in terms of management. Challenges to ‘conventional wisdom’ on tree resource use, value and management – such as in the posited links between commercialisation, cultivation and conservation – are highlighted, and constraints and opportunities to maintain and enhance value are described.

During the last few years, the Living Tree Project (LTP) has taken care to create a high quality, aligned 16S and 23S rRNA gene sequence database of all type strains. However, the manual curation of the sequence dataset and type strain information revealed that a total of 552 “orphan” species (about 5.7% of the currently classified species) had to be excluded from the reference trees. Among them, 322 type strains were not represented by an \{SSU\} entry in the public sequence repositories. The remaining 230 type strains had to be discarded due to bad sequence quality. Since 2010, the \{LTP\} team has coordinated a network of researchers and culture collections in order to improve the situation by (re)-sequencing the type strains of these “orphan” species. As a result, we can now report 351 16S rRNA gene sequences of type strains. Nevertheless, 201 species could not be sequenced because cultivable type strains were not available (121), the cultures had either been lost or were never deposited in the first place (66), or it was not possible due to other constraints (14). The International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria provides a number of mechanisms to deal with the problem of missing type strains and we recommend that due consideration be given to the appropriate mechanisms in order to help solve some of these issues.
