However, yield is not the only factor to be considered when developing new varieties of rice, because the traits of quality have a large impact on adoption of any new variety. Rice quality programmes have reached a plateau in their capacity to screen for quality, and need to take delivery of information from new research enabled by technological progress to identify new traits of quality and methods to screen for them.

Examination of secondary data shows, however, that the survey years were unrepresentative of long-term trends and were unduly influenced by exogenous yield shocks. Correction for these effects removes the productivity decline, but shows that productivity has stagnated.

More precisely, drought, flood and salinity are the major causes of crop loss worldwide. These stresses are likely to get further aggravated in near future due to climate change. A wide range of adaptations and mitigation strategies are required to cope with such impacts. Trichoderma species, one of the most widely used microbes for the biocontrol of plant diseases, are known to alter the response of plants to abiotic stresses. There is need to exploit its unique properties of genetic diversity, ubiquity, tolerance to extremities, its interaction with crop plants and develop methods for its effective disposition in agriculture production to cope with climate change induced stresses. There is an increasing interest in developing the potential biotechnological applications of fungal endophytes especially Trichoderma species for improving plant stress tolerance and sustainable production of food crops. Subsequently, isolation of genes from this biocontrol agent and their further transfer to a plant genome may result in a significant improvement in plant tolerance to biotic or abiotic stresses. Here, we have described the role of Trichoderma species in alleviating adverse effects of abiotic stresses in plants and providing abiotic stress tolerance. A putative mechanism of stress tolerance by Trichoderma species has also been covered. Since Trichoderma alone may not be enough to provide required degree of protection against abiotic stresses like drought, soil salinity or flooding, there is need to explore the possibility of exploiting the microbes along with the plant gene (i.e. abiotic stress tolerant varieties) for the more effective abiotic stress management.

We review historical evidence and survey urban consumers across 24 cities in seven Asian countries to assess heterogeneity and trends of consumer preferences for intrinsic attributes of rice. We conclude that to improve food security in Asia, public rice breeding programs should incorporate widely preferred attributes such as softness in Southeast Asia and slenderness in South Asia, while considering geographic heterogeneity and specificity of preferences.

However, they typically focus primarily on supply-shifting investments that may be insufficient to render domestically produced food competitive, particularly in import-biased food markets. We review the national rice development investment strategies of 19 African countries and argue that in order to reverse urban bias in African rice markets, more resources will need to be allocated to value-adding and demand-lifting investments.

abstract = "Abstract The unpredictability of drought patterns and the inherent complexity of the physiological responses involved have made it difficult to characterize component traits required for improved performance, thus limiting crop improvement efforts to enhance drought resistance in rice. The various stress–response mechanisms and options to enhance plant survival under severe stress do not usually translate into yield stability under water deficit. Increased crop yield and water productivity require the optimization of the physiological processes involved in the critical stages of plant response to soil drying, water-use efficiency, and dehydration-avoidance mechanisms. New high-throughput phenotyping methodologies have been developed to allow fast and detailed evaluation of potential drought-resistant donors and the large number of lines identified by drought-breeding programs. Similarly, large collections of rice germplasm, including minicore sets, wild relatives, and mutant lines have been screened for drought-resistance traits. Genetic sources of drought resistance have now been identified for all major rice agroecosystems and some of the associated traits have been characterized. The identification and genetic mapping of major \{QTLs\} for performance under drought stress across environments are currently a major focus. This approach provides a powerful tool to dissect the genetic basis of drought resistance. If validated with accurate phenotyping and properly integrated in marker-assisted breeding programs, these approaches will accelerate the development of drought-resistant genotypes. This chapter reviews the recent progress and achievements in dissecting drought resistance in rice and presents future perspectives for the genetic enhancement of drought adaptation. "

abstract = "Abstract Rice is the principle staple crop of Asia and any deterioration of rice production systems through climate change would seriously impair food security in this continent. This review assesses spatial and temporal vulnerabilities of different rice production systems to climate change impacts in Asia. Initially, the review discusses the risks of increasing heat stress and maps the regions where current temperatures are already approaching critical levels during the susceptible stages of the rice plant, namely Pakistan/north India (Oct.), south India (April, Aug.), east India/Bangladesh (March-June), Myanmar/Thailand/Laos/Cambodia (March-June), Vietnam (April/Aug.), Philippines (April/June), Indonesia (Aug.) and China (July/Aug.). Possible adaptation options for heat stress are derived from regions where the rice crop is already exposed to very high temperatures including Iran and Australia. Drought stress is also expected to aggravate through climate change; a map superimposing the distribution of rainfed rice and precipitation anomalies in Asia highlights especially vulnerable areas in east India/Bangladesh and Myanmar/Thailand. Then, the review gives emphasis to two rice growing environments that have outstanding importance for food supply in Asia and, at the same time, are particularly vulnerable to climate impacts. The mega-deltas in Vietnam, Myanmar and Bangladesh are the backbone of the rice economy in the respective country and will experience specific climate change impacts due to sea level rise. Significant improvements of the rice production systems, that is, higher resilience to flooding and salinity, are crucial for maintaining or even increasing yield levels in these very productive deltaic regions. The other ‘hotspot’ with especially high climate change risks in Asia is the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) which will be affected by the melting of the Himalayan glaciers. The dominant land use type in the \{IGP\} is rice-wheat rotation, and we discuss specific vulnerabilities and possible adaptation options in the different sub-regions of the IGP. We conclude that geo-spatial vulnerability assessments may become crucial for planning targeted adaptation programs, but that policy frameworks are needed for their implementation. "

Since the 1960s, yield gains, rather than area expansion, have fuelled increases in maize production in Asia. Yield gains, in turn, have been due to the shift in maize cultivation from mostly open-pollinated varieties (OPVs) to mostly hybrids. This transition also shifted the locus of modern maize breeding research from government research organisations to private national and multinational seed companies. In countries where both the public and private sectors participated in maize research, private sector research investment far exceeded that of the public sector. With more aggressive marketing programmes, the private sector captured 89% of the Asian maize seed market in the late 1990s. National public seed research agencies (including universities and cooperatives) developed and produced more maize \{OPVs\} than hybrids, mass-produced and distributed seed cheaply, addressed location-specific production problems, and provided agricultural extension services. The private seed companies developed, produced, sold and promoted their own proprietary hybrids. The reluctance of the private sector, however, to address the needs of marginal maize farmers should encourage the public sector to continue playing an active role in maize research and development (R&amp;D), seed production and modern maize technology dissemination, especially with adequate support from appropriate government policies.

In order to increase yield and water productivity, arrest the mining of ground water, and achieve sustainability of rice production, there is need to adopt water-saving management practices. The present investigation in the Indian Punjab was aimed at investigating the effect of date of transplanting in four rice cultivars varying in growth duration (short-duration RH-257 and PR-115, and medium-duration PR-113 and PAU-201) on yield and water productivity. Delaying in transplanting from 15 June to 25 June or 5 July resulted in reduction in mean grain yield of the four cultivars by 7.2% and 15.9%, respectively. PAU-201, a photoperiod-sensitive cultivar, had higher mean grain yield (7.8 t ha−1) by 14.1%, 12.8% and 11.5% over the photoperiod-insensitive cultivars, PR-113, PR-115 and RH-257, respectively. Irrespective of transplanting dates, short-duration cultivars, RH-257 and PR-115, respectively, resulted in 18.9% and 16.6% saving of water, as compared to medium-duration cultivar PR-113. With delayed transplanting after 15 June, both yield and water productivity decreased for all photoperiod insensitive cultivars, but yields remained statistically similar and water productivity greater for a photoperiod sensitive cultivar. Mean irrigation water productivity (WPI) was highest for 15 June transplanting (0.66 kg m−3) and lowest for 5 July transplanting (0.57 kg m−3), and was highest for RH-257 (0.68 kg m−3) and lowest for PR-113 (0.50 kg m−3). Total water productivity (WPI+R; irrigation plus rainfall) decreased by 9.1% for 5 July transplanting compared with 15 June transplanting, and was highest for RH-257 (0.49 kg m−3) and lowest for PR-113 (0.38 kg m−3). Real crop water productivity (WPET) of the photoperiod insensitive cultivars decreased (1.10–1.40 kg m−3), but that of a photoperiod sensitive cultivar increased (1.63 kg m−3), with delayed transplanting. We conclude that substantial amount of water can be saved and yield increased by transplanting short-duration cultivars during the period of peak evaporative demand, or water saved and yield maintained by transplanting a photoperiod-sensitive cultivar late in the season when the evaporative demand is low.

We measured \{CH4\} and \{N2O\} emissions during two cropping seasons in the Philippines from field plots exposed to contrasting treatments during the fallow before land preparation for rice cultivation. The fallow treatments were continuous soil flooding (flooded), soil drying with exclusion of rainfall (dry), soil drying with dry tillage (dry + tillage), and a control with soil drying and wetting from rainfall (dry and wet). All plots were subdivided into removal of all aboveground rice residues from the previous crop (without residue) and retention of standing biomass after harvest of the previous rice crop (with residue). Emitted gas was collected weekly using chambers. Fallow treatments greatly influenced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during rice growth. Methane emissions and global warming potential (GWP) in both cropping seasons were highest following the flooded fallow, intermediate following the dry and wet fallow, and lowest following dry and dry + tillage fallows. The \{GWP\} was higher with than without residue across all fallow treatments. Nitrous oxide emissions were small during the season, and \{CH4\} emissions contributed more than 90% of the cumulative \{GWP\} during the rice crop regardless of fallow and residue management. Soil drying between rice crops in the tropics can reduce \{CH4\} emissions and \{GWP\} during the subsequent rice crop. "

abstract = "Rice (Oryza sativa L.) paddy soils have the potential to emit both of the greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), depending on redox potential. Results from incubation studies with homogenized soil led to a proposed “healthy redox potential” range that minimizes both \{CH4\} and \{N2O\} emission. We examined whether controlled irrigation with the water-saving practice of “safe alternate wetting and drying” (AWD) could maintain a healthy redox potential throughout the rooting layer of rice paddy soil in a greenhouse experiment without plants. We hypothesized that a surface redox potential for \{N2O\} and a rooting-depth redox potential for \{CH4\} would both be important in determining gas emissions, making it difficult to minimize rice paddy greenhouse gas emissions through water management. We monitored gas emission for 7 weeks from soil treated by continuous flooding, AWD, or “healthy redox” water management, with and without rice residue incorporation, with no fertilizer application. Nitrous oxide, after the initial flush, was emitted only when the redox potential at 2-cm soil depth was above + 140 mV. Methane was emitted even when the 7.5-cm redox potential was above –150 mV. Measurement of dissolved \{CH4\} in soil solution confirmed that there was 17 to100 times more methane at 20-cm depth than 7.5 cm, with no significant differences between water treatments at 20 cm (P &lt; 0.05). The \{AWD\} treatment emitted significantly more \{N2O\} than the continuously flooded treatment (P &lt; 0.05), while the reverse was true for \{CH4\} (P &lt; 0.05). Residue incorporation significantly increased CH4, but not N2O, emission in both water treatments (P &lt; 0.05), and thus had more impact than water management. We conclude that simultaneous minimization of both \{CH4\} and \{N2O\} emission cannot be maintained in rice soils due to the redox potential changes with depth, but that appropriate water and residue management can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Without residue incorporation, continuous flooding has the lowest combined risk of \{N2O\} and \{CH4\} emission, but with residue incorporation, \{AWD\} has similar or lower risk. "

Two pairs of \{NILs\} differing for grain yield under drought stress were isolated and characterized for yield, yield related traits, and several physiological traits in a range of contrasting environments. In replicated field trials both \{NIL\} pairs differed significantly for grain yield under drought stress but showed similar yield potential, phenology, and yield component traits under non-stress conditions. A polymorphism analysis study with 491 \{SSRs\} revealed that both \{NIL\} pairs are at least 96% genetically similar. These \{NILs\} show that small genetic differences can cause large difference in grain yield under drought stress in rice. In both pairs the drought-tolerant \{NILs\} showed a significantly higher assimilation rate at later stages both under stress and non-stress conditions. They also had a higher transpiration rate under non-stress condition. The most tolerant \{NIL\} (IR77298-14-1-2-B-10) had significantly higher transpiration rate and stomatal conductance in severe stress conditions. In one pair the tolerant \{NIL\} had constitutively deeper roots than the susceptible NIL. In the second pair, which had higher mean root length than the first pair, the tolerant \{NIL\} had more roots, greater root thickness, and greater root dry weight than the susceptible NIL. Deeper root length may allow tolerant \{NILs\} to extract more water at deeper soil layers. It is concluded that enhanced rooting depth is an important strategy for dehydration avoidance and rice adaptation to drought stress, but root architecture might not be the only mechanism causing the significant yield increase we observed in lowland drought stress environments. To further dissect the drought avoidance mechanisms in rice, analysis of root hydraulic properties may be necessary. "

In Asia, many of the rural poor live in rice-producing areas where the continuous flooding of rice (Oryza sativa) fields may lead to high leaching rates of groundwater contaminants. This study presents results of measurements of nitrate and pesticide concentrations in shallow groundwater in 54 domestic wells under rice-based production systems in Luzon, Philippines, from 1989 to 2000. In irrigated double rice cropping areas, seasonal-mean nitrate concentrations were 0–2 mg l−1, which is below the \{WHO\} limit of 10 mg l−1 for drinking water. In wet season (WS) rainfed rice and dry season (DS) irrigated sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum) double cropping areas, monthly mean nitrate concentrations were 5–12 mg l−1. Nitrate concentrations were lower under other, less fertilized upland crops, and with a high percentage of the area under rice in the WS. Mean pesticide concentrations were generally one to two orders of magnitude below the \{WHO\} single (0.1 μg l−1) and multiple pesticide (0.5 μg l−1) limits, although temporary peak concentrations of 1.14–4.17 μg l−1 were measured. For both nitrate and pesticides, the high leaching potential appears to be offset by the particular transformation and loss processes taking place under tropical, anaerobic conditions. The agro-ecological environment and history of the study sites suggest that the results may be characteristic of many parts of tropical Asia where rice-based cropping has intensified since the Green Revolution in the mid-1960s.

To increase productivity in aerobic or water-limited environments rice must overcome its adaptations to flooded environments. Deletion mutants offer an alternative genetic resource for improving drought tolerance. Almost 3500 \{IR64\} deletion mutants were screened under vegetative and reproductive stage drought stress in the field and evaluated for leaf drying and/or grain yield. Seven novel conditional mutants of rice which showed gain of function through continued growth as drought stress developed compared to the wild type were identified. Mutant recovery rate was 0.1%. Further evaluation of putative drought mutants revealed that their average shoot biomass at maturity and grain yield per plant under stress exceeded those of the wild type by two-fold. Studies under controlled conditions confirmed mutants to have continued growth of both roots and shoots as drought developed compared to the wild type, and a tendency for greater water extraction. We propose that deletions in these mutants have affected a regulator of the highly conservative growth response common to irrigated lowland rice cultivars. Our results suggest that screening deletion mutants for performance under managed drought stress in the field could be a highly effective way to identify valuable genetic resources for improved drought response and aerobic adaptation in rice.

Eight fertile, perennial \{F1\} hybrids between O. sativa and O. rufipogon were grown in non-flooded soil, and \{CER\} was measured at flowering under saturating light. Two \{F1\} hybrids had greater \{CER\} than the average of 26.1 μmol m2 s−1. The \{F2\} progeny from these hybrids were screened for \{CER\} in the field, and segregants with even greater rates of photosynthesis were selected. The basis of high photosynthetic rate in the \{F2\} populations was not leaf thickness or leaf chlorophyll content. One \{F2\} line had exceptionally high \{CER\} and stomatal conductance. Broad-sense heritability on an individual plant basis for \{CER\} in two \{F2\} populations was 0.44 and 0.37. A highly significant offspring-parent regression of 0.89 for \{CER\} was observed in a replicated field evaluation (four blocks, five plants per plot) of 20 vegetatively propagated \{F2\} selections and their \{F3\} seedling progeny. Broad-sense heritability for \{CER\} on a plot-mean basis was estimated as 0.74 for both selected F2:3 families and for the selected \{F2\} clones.

Near anthesis, substantial 14C label remained in the source (flag) leaf in O. sativa and \{F1\} hybrids, while in O. rufipogon more label was exported to sink tissues. The hybrids partitioned more 14C label to panicles than did cultivated rice and less to leaf sheaths than either parent.

Previous studies have measured yield trends from long-term rice–rice and rice–wheat experiments in different sites from the slopes of individual site regressions of yield over time. The statistical significance of each site regression was determined but not that of the aggregate trend, which could give an indication of the magnitude and significance of global yield change. The random regression coefficient analysis (RRCA) and meta-analysis were used in this study to analyze the aggregate yield trend from several long-term experiments (LTE) across the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and outside the IGP. Both methods show that there has been a significant (p &lt; 0.05) declining trend in rice yield in rice–wheat \{LTEs\} in South Asia including China with the recommended rates of nutrients, but that there has been no significant change in wheat and system (rice + wheat) yields. There was no significant year × region (IGP versus non-IGP) interaction in rice and wheat yields. However, \{RRCA\} showed that the average yield trend was significantly negative (−41.0 kg ha−1 yr−1) only in the IGP. In the rice–rice LTEs, there was a significant year × site (IRRI versus non-IRRI sites) interaction during the dry season but not the wet season. Rice yields declined throughout Asia in the wet season. The average system (dry + wet season rice) yield trends were significantly negative in both \{IRRI\} and non-IRRI sites (−170.1 and −52.8 kg ha−1 yr−1, respectively) but the magnitude of yield decline was significantly greater in the \{IRRI\} sites than in the non-IRRI sites. Rice in the rice–wheat \{LTEs\} showed a significantly positive yield trend with the addition of farmyard manure (FYM) but the initial yield was generally lower with \{FYM\} than without FYM. After 15 years, yield increase due to \{FYM\} was not evident in most of the LTE. "

The G × E interaction accounted for 13% of the total sum of squares with environment and genotype responsible for 84 and 3%, respectively. Cluster analysis identified four environment and six genotype groups, which accounted for 70% of the G × E sums of squares. Of this, AX1, \{AX2\} and \{AX3\} accounted for 27, 22 and 21% of the G × E-SS, respectively. \{AX1\} represented yield potential; \{AX2\} was related to soil conditions, aerobic status and possibly VPD; and \{AX3\} to change in phenology (days to flowering) with stress. The four environment groups were considered as broadly representative of contrasting rice production environments, including lowland-type, upland-wet season and upland-aerobic environments that experienced vegetative- or anthesis-stage drought stress. Genotype groups differed in adaptation to these diverse environments. For genotype groups G1–G6, \{G3\} (VM150) had stable yields across environments; \{G1\} (VM134) had the greatest grain yield in lowland-type environments (E2); \{G5\} (VM135) in wet season environments (E3); \{G6\} (VM168) in anthesis-stage drought (E4); \{G2\} (Vandana and VM26) in vegetative- and anthesis-stage drought (E1 and E4); \{G4\} had average yields across environments.

Tolerant landraces that withstand submergence for 1–2 weeks were identified; however, incorporation of tolerance into modern high-yielding varieties through conventional breeding methods has been slow because of the complexity of both the tolerance phenotype and floodwater conditions, and the ensuing discrepancies encountered upon phenotyping in different environments. Designing an effective phenotyping strategy requires a thorough understanding of the specific floodwater characteristics that most likely affect survival during flooding. We investigated the implications of floodwater temperature and light penetration, caused by artificial shading, seasonal variation, or water turbidity, for seedling survival after submergence. Three field experiments were conducted using rice genotypes contrasting in their tolerance of submergence: \{FR13A\} and Kusuma (tolerant); Gangasiuli (intermediate); Sabita, CRK-2-6 and Raghukunwar (elongating/avoiding types); and \{IR42\} (sensitive). We tested the hypotheses that warmer floodwater decreases plant survival and that turbid water augment plant mortality by causing effects similar to those caused by shading, by reducing light penetration. Plants survive better when water is cooler, and survival decreased at about 8% per unit increase in water temperature above 26 °C. Lower intensity of light and warmer temperatures seem to reduce biomass and increase mortality under flooding. An increase in the concentrations of \{O2\} and \{CO2\} and a decrease in water pH did not improve survival in clear unshaded water. Turbid floodwater was more damaging to rice as plant mortality increased as the percentage of silt increased, and the effects of water turbidity cannot be explained by the reduction in light penetration alone. Even the most tolerant rice cultivar, FR13A, experienced higher mortality when flooded with turbid floodwater. Correlation studies revealed that cultivars with the capacity to maintain higher biomass, higher chlorophyll, and non-structural carbohydrate concentrations after submergence had higher survival. These findings help to understand the variation observed in submergence tolerance when screening is done under different environments. The study could have implications for designing proper screening strategies and assessing the damage submergence causes across different rice-growing regions. "

Because of increasing water scarcity, there is a need to develop alternative systems that require less water. This paper reports results of on-farm experiments in the Philippines to reduce water input by water-saving irrigation techniques and alternative crop establishment methods, such as wet and dry seeding. With continuous standing water, direct wet-seeded rice yielded higher than traditional transplanted rice by 3–17%, required 19% less water during the crop growth period and increased water productivity by 25–48%. Direct dry-seeded rice yielded the same as transplanted and wet-seeded rice, but can make more effective use of early season rainfall in the wet season and save irrigation water for the subsequent dry season. Direct seeding can further reduce water input by shortening the land preparation period. In transplanted and wet-seeded rice, keeping the soil continuously around saturation reduced yields on average by 5% and water inputs by 35% and increased water productivity by 45% compared with flooded conditions. Intermittent irrigation further reduced water inputs but at the expense of increased yield loss. Under water-saving irrigation, wet-seeded rice out-yielded transplanted rice by 6–36% and was a suitable establishment method to save water and retain high yields. Groundwater depth greatly affected water use and the possibilities of saving water. With shallow groundwater tables of 10–20 cm depth, irrigation water requirements and potential water savings were low but yield reductions were relatively small. The introduction of water-saving technologies at the field level can have implications for the hydrology and water use at larger spatial scale levels. "

abstract = "Abstract Several studies have recognized that the agriculture sector is one of the major contributor to climate change, as well as largely affected adversely by climate change. Agricultural productivity is known to be sensitive to climate change induced effects and it has impact on livelihood of families linked with farming. Thus it is important to understand what are the existing coping strategies that farmer deploy in case of climate shocks like flood and drought and who is involved in making decision relating to these coping strategies. This paper uses the household level data of 641 households from 12 randomly selected villages in Vaishali district of Bihar to understand the household coping mechanisms with emphasis on role of gender. This study has moved away from the conventional division of households by male and female-headed households and thus capturing the intra-household gender dynamics by understanding the role of men and women within the household as decision makers of the coping strategy to manage climate shock. The study uses a multivariate probit model and the results suggest that there is a higher probability that the male farmers will make the decision on choice of the coping strategy. The most prominent coping mechanism is to find alternative employment in urban locations; however, when consumption levels have to be reduced because of climate shock, all family members then contribute to the decision-making process collectively. The results show that exposure to agriculture extension and training programs have a positive influence on choosing appropriate coping mechanisms, but female farmers have poor access to these resources. These policies should look into providing outreach to both male and female farmers in any given locality. "

abstract = "Deepwater rices from Thailand have been among the most promising lines tested in the deep-water areas of Africa, Burma, Indonesia, and Vietnam, and the effect of environmental factors and cultural practices on production in Thailand is relevant to those countries. In Thailand, approximately 800 000 ha of deepwater rice is grown in fields which are flooded to depths of 50 cm or more for over a month during the growing season. Most of this specially adapted rice is grown in three regions of the central plain. Dry seeds are broadcast on ploughed fields at the beginning of the wet season, and the crop grows under rainfed dryland conditions for about 3 months before floods arrive in July–August. The plants elongate to maintain foliage above the floodwater, which may be as deep as four m. The crop is harvested after the fields drain in December–January. Investigations were made to assess yields in farmers' fields, and to determine yield-limiting factors and crop responses to inputs. Farmers were interviewed to determine production practices, and fields were sampled to estimate yields. Samples from 30 fields gave an average yield of 2.18 t ha−1 (0.7–3.5 t ha−1) for the 1981/1982 season, and from 63 fields in 1982/1983 gave an average of 1.83 t ha−1 (0.1–2.9 t ha−1). There were 32 different varieties. Maximum water depths ranged from 60 cm to 200 cm. Major pests were yellow stem-borers and rats. A multi-location factorial experiment with 13 sites tested the possibility of improving yields by nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer, or by use of a herbicide spray to control broadleaved weeds. However, grain yields were increased by N only at four sites, by P at one site, and by herbicide spraying at one site. Major yield-limiting factors were drought and poor plant stands in the pre-flood period, and some flood damage. Better characterisation of the environment and of its interaction with genotypes is necessary before adequate prediction of performance and improvements in production will be obtained. "

We find that the evolutionary algorithm based on interactive experiential learning remains valid. However, in the case of the most successful technology – the flat-bed dryer in Vietnam – the R&amp;D team did not withdraw once a critical mass of manufacturers and users were familiar with the technology, as the model says should happen, but rather continued to champion the technology. In the process they developed major improvements to the original design, and a new type of dryer. They achieved far greater impact than any other team. They were successful largely because they were able to work with the same networks of partners, in the same innovation trajectory, for 25 years. We find evidence of institutional support in working in this way. Their role was to make the major modifications while local users, manufacturers and promoters made local adaptations and ‘bug fixes’. This way of working is similar to that of plant breeders working for the public sector and by many researchers in the private sector. However, current trends in international research towards ‘projectization’ on one hand, and the requirement to produce international public goods (IPGs) on the other means that researchers do not stay working for long enough with the same partners because funding keeps changing, nor do they work locally enough because of the expectation that they should generate new \{IPGs\} from scratch every one or two project cycles.

Water level had little effect on seedling establishment when seed were sown on the soil surface, but establishment was reduced by raising the water level when seed were sown below the soil surface. Calcium peroxide-coated seed established better than the tolerant cultivars at 13- and 25-mm sowing depths, but their seedlings were shorter and less vigorous than those of tolerant cultivars.

Poverty and food insecurity are concomitant problems in these heavily populated areas, because of the high risks and the lack of high-yielding, flood-tolerant varieties. Rice landraces that can withstand over 2 weeks of complete submergence were identified and the gene (named SUB1) that controls most of the tolerance phenotype was cloned and characterized. This enabled the use of marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC) to transfer this gene into numerous varieties that are popular among farmers, five of which were recently released for commercial use in five countries in South and Southeast Asia. Varieties carrying the \{SUB1\} gene developed through this process had the same agronomic, yield and quality traits as their non-Sub1 counterparts when grown under non-flooded conditions, but showed yield advantages of 1 to more than 3 t ha−1 after complete submergence for various durations in naturally flooded fields. Furthermore, \{SUB1\} was found to be effective at all growth stages from early seedling stage to about a week before flowering. Sub1 varieties have been spreading fast in several countries over the last few years, and are currently grown by more than 4 million farmers in Asia. This success is attributed to several factors, including the choice of varieties that are popular among rainfed lowland farmers for deploying \{SUB1\} and its consistent effectiveness in different genetic backgrounds and environments. Other factors are a far-reaching network of partners along the research to adoption continuum, an effective awareness programme targeting appropriate partners, policymakers and farmers, and the additional resources made available by international donors and national programmes primarily to support the production and distribution of good-quality seeds and for strengthening seed systems. Further work is ongoing to incorporate \{SUB1\} into more varieties and to strengthen the tolerance conferred by SUB1. Breeding varieties with multiple stresses is being accomplished by combining \{SUB1\} with other tolerance traits/genes for wider adaptation in the less favourable rice ecosystems. "

Incorporation of crop residues can be challenging because the fallow period between crops is often too short to allow sufficient decomposition. During early stages of anaerobic residue decomposition in flooded soils, plant growth may be inhibited by nutrient immobilization or by the production of potentially toxic organic acids. Straw from a brittle stem mutant of rice (Oryza sativa L. var. IR68) was tested in a 30-d incubation experiment under continuously flooded conditions in a greenhouse to determine if it would decompose more rapidly than the non-brittle phenotype, thereby allowing shorter fallow time between crops. Brittle straw decomposed faster, as indicated by 51% total C loss as \{CO2\} or \{CH4\} within 3 weeks of incorporation, compared with 28% for non-brittle straw. However, brittle straw also produced a significantly higher (P&lt;0.0001) amount of formic, acetic, aconitic, propionic, and butyric acids than non-brittle straw. There was no difference in soil N immobilization pattern between the two straw types, or in P or K availability in the soil, perhaps due to the short duration of the experiment. To maximize the potential advantage of faster decomposition of brittle straw in intensive rice cropping systems, it may be helpful to manage water for sufficient soil aeration to mitigate the negative organic acid and methane production effects.

Short-term submergence regularly affects over 20 million ha of rice in the tropics. Tolerant varieties like the Indian landrace \{FR13A\} can survive submergence for 2 weeks or more, whereas susceptible varieties are severely damaged or killed within a week. The discovery of the tolerance gene \{SUB1\} enabled marker assisted backcrossing to transfer it into rice mega varieties, and eight “Sub1 varieties” were recently developed in the background of popular Asian cultivars. Five have been officially approved for distribution to farmers and the remaining three are under advanced evaluation. The Sub1 varieties have grain yields equal to their parent varieties under non-submerged conditions and yield advantages of 1 t/ha or more when affected by submergence. They are tolerant at all growth stages from a week after seeding up to 2 weeks before flowering. The yield advantages are observed with submergence durations of 4–20 days or more, depending on environmental conditions. Farmers growing Sub1 varieties can avoid the costs of re-transplanting when submergence occurs in the nursery, and they can realize additional yield gains with improved crop management practices. Because the varieties have the same genetic background as popular cultivars, national and state governments have expedited their release. Intensive seed production and distribution programs have facilitated their rapid adoption by farmers. Further improvements to Sub1 varieties will include increasing the level of tolerance; incorporating additional traits, such as disease resistance and drought or salinity tolerance; and transferring the \{SUB1\} gene into additional cultivars and promising breeding lines.

This is the case in rainfed systems now, and will probably even be more important in the near future given the changing climate. Recent advances in rice breeding provide much improved drought tolerance in modern rice cultivars as has already been shown in farmers’ fields. To accompany these new cultivars, complementary crop management practices and diversified production systems have an important role to help farmers minimize risks and raise productivity and profitability. To evaluate the options we reviewed a wide range of studies investigating management options for rainfed lowland rice with a specific focus on drought-prone environments. To introduce the environment we provide an overview of general characteristics with a more detailed analysis of soil quality in rice-based rainfed lowlands around the world. Reviewed management technologies to mitigate drought stress include water management options, the choice of appropriate germplasm, adjusted cropping systems, improved nutrient management, different crop establishment options, better field management and soil amelioration. Several of these technologies do offer important advantages but their usefulness and applicability is dependent on site and system characteristics. Thus, a combination of germplasm × environment × management is necessary to choose the best management for a given rainfed lowland system. Getting this right can transform rice-based systems in rainfed lowlands, make them more productive, and increase and stabilize farmers’ income. "

Although Es is considered to be non-beneficial (not directly related to crop production), it may indirectly influence water availability for transpiration which is directly related to crop growth and thus yield. Due to the difficulty in measuring Es, empirical models are usually used, especially Ritchie's two stage model. Ritchie's model assumes that stage 1 evaporation is dependent on radiant energy at the soil surface, and that during stage 2, Es is independent of radiant energy. During stage 2, the model assumes that Es is only dependent on soil hydraulic properties, and that cumulative stage 2 Es is proportional to the square root of time. To evaluate the model, we measured Es under the canopy of wheat grown on a clay loam soil in Punjab, India, using mini-lysimeters. Soil evaporation during three different potential evaporation (Eo) periods (1.5, 3.0, 6.0 mm d−1) was compared during the 2006–2007 and 2007–2008 wheat seasons. The results suggested that stage 2 Es was affected by Eo, and cumulative Es was not described well by a square root of time function. An exponential decay function which describes the decrease in Es/Eo as a function of a soil dependent constant (b), whose value is directly related to Eo, was developed. Using this function, calculated cumulative Es for two independent drying periods was close to the observed Es values with coefficients of determination of 0.82 and 0.95. "

Four field experiments with ‘IR72’ were conducted, three at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and one at the Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice). In the SPAD-based N-treatment, N was topdressed when the \{SPAD\} value of the topmost fully expanded leaf fell below 35 (corresponding to about 1.4 g N m−2 leaf) from 15 days after transplanting to booting stage. The amount of N applied in each topdressing was determined by expected crop N demand predicted by equations relating N uptake to cumulative thermal units. Yields with SPAD-based management were 93–100% of maximum yields achieved by the best fixed-timing treatment but lower total N rates were used in all SPAD-based N treatments. Increased recovery efficiency from applied N and greater utilization of the acquired N to produce grain contributed to the significantly greater fertilizer-N efficiency of the SPAD-based than of the fixed-timing N treatments. The improved congruence of N supply and crop demand in SPAD-based treatments resulted in fewer unproductive tillers, less leaf senescence at flowering stage and comparable or greater crop growth rates after flowering than the best fixed-timing treatment. It is concluded that increased N fertilizer efficiency at high yield levels is possible using a chlorophyll meter to monitor leaf N status and guide fertilizer-N timing on irrigated rice. "

abstract = "Abstract Weed competition is a major constraint in all the rice production systems in Africa. In addition to the costs of weed control, weeds account for yield losses estimated to be at least 2.2 million tons per year in sub‐Saharan Africa, valued at $1.45 billion, and equating to approximately half the current total imports of rice to this region. Important weeds in upland rice include the perennial species Cyperus rotundus, Imperata cylindrica and Chromolaena odorata, the annual species Euphorbia heterophylla, Digitaria horizontalis, and the parasitic weeds Striga spp. In lowland rice the perennial weeds: Cyperus rotundus, C. esculentus and Oryza longistaminata and annual weeds Sphenoclea zeylanica, Echinochloa spp., Cyperus difformis, C. iria, Fimbristylis littoralis, Ischaemum rugosum, and O. barthii cause serious losses. Common weed management practices in rice‐based cropping systems include soil tillage, clearance by fire, hand‐ or hoe‐weeding, herbicides, flooding, fallow and crop rotations, and these are often used in combination. Labor shortages and lack of access to information, inputs, and credits are widespread constraints for African farmers. To optimize financial, social and environmental costs and benefits, integrated and ecological management approaches are advocated. Locally adapted and affordable combinations of preventive measures and interventions should be targeted. Future weed research should aim to deliver the information and tools for the implementation of these approaches. This requires the generation of knowledge on weed biology and ecology and on the consequences of changes in management and the environment on weed populations. To address the diversity of rice‐based cropping systems in Africa, priorities need to be set and products and information delivered that take full account of local conditions. This will require farmer participatory approaches that are inclusive with respect to resource‐poor farmers and gender. "

abstract = "The success of the first Green Revolution in the form of abundant food supplies and low prices over the past two decades has diverted the world's attention from agriculture to other pressing issues. This has resulted in lower support for the agricultural research work primarily undertaken by the 15 research centers of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). The total support in real dollars for most of the last three decades has been more or less flat although the number of centers increased from 4 to 15. However, since 2000, the funding situation has improved for the \{CGIAR\} centers, with almost all the increase coming from grants earmarked for specific research projects. Even for some centers such as the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), the downward trend continued as late as 2006 with the budget in real dollars reaching the 1978 level of support. The recent food crisis has renewed the call for a second Green Revolution by revitalizing yield growth to feed the world in the face of growing population and a shrinking land base for agricultural use. The slowdown in yield growth because of decades of neglect in agricultural research and infrastructure development has been identified as the underlying reason for the recent food crisis. For the second Green Revolution to be successful, the \{CGIAR\} centers will have to play a complex role by expanding productivity in a sustainable manner with fewer resources. Thus, it is crucial to examine the current structure of support for the \{CGIAR\} centers and identify the challenges ahead in terms of source and end use of funds for the success of the second Green Revolution. The objective of this paper is to provide a historical perspective on the support to the \{CGIAR\} centers and to examine the current status of funding, in particular, the role of project-specific grants in rebuilding capacity of these centers. The paper will also discuss the nature of the support (unrestricted vs. project-specific grants) that will be needed for a much-desired second Green Revolution. "

The structure of the model is simple, flexible, and involves as few parameters as possible. The model consists of two linked components. The first simulates the dynamics of the rice crop, with accumulation of biomass and its daily partitioning towards leaves, stems, roots, and panicles. The second component simulates the dynamics of tillering, tiller maturation, panicle formation, and tiller death. Coupling functions representing damage mechanisms due to sheath blight, stem borers, and weeds were developed and parameterized from published and experimental data. Each of these injuries corresponds to a set of damage mechanisms, some of which are specific to the injury considered, while others are common to several injuries. The parameters required to simulate attainable growth and attainable yield were determined, using specific field experiments, under three different production situations representing those commonly occurring in the Philippines and in Vietnam. Yield loss simulations due to the different injuries, considered alone or in combination, were tested under these different production situations. The model accurately simulated attainable rice growth and development, and adequately accounted for the yield-reducing effects of the different injury mechanisms considered. Results from sensitivity analyses conducted at varying levels of injuries are discussed. This model can be used as a tool to set research priorities for novel plant protection strategies for rice in tropical Asia. "

abstract = "Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a principal source of food for more than half of the world population, especially in South and Southeast Asia and Latin America. Elsewhere, it represents a high‐value commodity crop. Change in the method of crop establishment from traditional manual transplanting of seedlings to direct‐seeding has occurred in many Asian countries in the last two decades in response to rising production costs, especially for labor and water. Direct‐seeding of rice (DSR) may involve sowing pregerminated seed onto a puddled soil surface (wet‐seeding) or into shallow standing water (water‐seeding), or dry seed into a prepared seedbed (dry‐seeding). In Europe, Australia, and the United States, direct‐seeding is highly mechanized. The risk of crop yield loss due to competition from weeds by all seeding methods is higher than for transplanted rice because of the absence of the size differential between the crop and weeds and the suppressive effect of standing water on weed growth at crop establishment. Of 1800 species reported as weeds of rice, those of the Cyperaceae and Poaceae are predominant. The adoption of direct‐seeding has resulted in a change in the relative abundance of weed species in rice crops. In particular, Echinochloa spp., Ischaemum rugosum, Cyperus difformis, and Fimbristylis miliacea are widely adapted to conditions of DSR. Species exhibit variability in germination and establishment response to the water regime postsowing, which is a major factor in interspecifically selecting constituents of the weed flora. The relatively rapid emergence of “weedy” (red) rice, rice phenotypically similar to cultivars but exhibiting undesirable agronomic traits, has been observed in several Asian countries practicing DSR, and this poses a severe threat to the sustainability of the production system. Stale seedbeds, tillage practices for land leveling, choice of competitive rice cultivars, mechanical weeders, herbicides, and associated water management are component technologies essential to the control of weeds in DSR. Herbicides in particular are an important tool of weed management, but hand weeding is either partially or extensively practiced in countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Though yet to be globally commercialized, transgenic rice varieties engineered for herbicide resistance are a potential means of weed control. The release of herbicide‐resistant rice for red rice control in the United States has indicated the need to critically examine mitigation methods for the control of gene flow. Integrating preventive and interventional methods of weed control remains essential in managing weed communities in DSR, both to prohibit the evolution of herbicide resistance and to maximize the relative contributions of individual components where herbicides are not widely used. There remains a need to further develop understanding of the mechanisms and dynamics of rice weed competition and of the community dynamics of weed populations in \{DSR\} to underpin sustainable weed management practices.

Alleyways were grown with upland rice Oryza sativa L. and fertilised with G. sepium green manure or C. spectabilis mulch (or in combination) and assessed for weed and insect pest suppression. Mulch reduced weed biomass which was mostly composed of grasses on infertile soil. Green manure favoured broadleaf weeds and increased weed biomass reducing the effect of mulching. Greater weed suppression may be achieved. Improvement in soil fertility increased the crops’ competitiveness against weeds by concentrating it to crop furrows. Greater crop nutrition from hedgerow biomass resulted in increases of rice seedling maggot Atherigona oryzae Malloch and stem borer (mainly Sesamia inferens (Walker)) damage and white grub (mainly Holotrichia mindanaoana Brenske and Leucopholis irrorata (Chevrolat)) larval densities over the control. Terrace formation reduced white grub densities the first year. The trend reversed in the second year as shade from the hedgerows and mulch probably favoured survival of white grub larvae by reducing soil temperature and increasing soil moisture. Despite higher insect pest densities, the moderate tillering \{UPLRi5\} tolerated weeds and insect pest damage to produce higher yields in the biomass treatments than the control. But hedgerows may increase the incidence of rice blast Pyricularia oryzae Cav. by decreasing air movement. As purchased fertilisers provide limited crop response on depleted soils, alley cropping provides an economical means to overcome that constraint in small-scale tropical agriculture. "

The era of the Green Revolution started during the early 1970s with wheat and rice and since then the rice–wheat cropping system of the Indo-Gangetic Plains has played a significant role in the food security of the region. However, recent years have witnessed a significant slowdown in the yield growth rate of this system and the sustainability of this important cropping system is at risk due to second-generation technology problems and mounting pressure on natural resources. Traditional cultivars and conventional agronomic practices are no longer able to even maintain the gains in productivity achieved during the past few decades. Demand for food is increasing with the increasing population and purchasing power of consumers. The rice–wheat cropping system is labor-, water-, and energy-intensive and it becomes less profitable as these resources become increasingly scarce and the problem is aggravated with deterioration of soil health, the emergence of new weeds, and emerging challenges of climate change. Therefore, a paradigm shift is required for enhancing the system's productivity and sustainability. Resource-conserving technologies involving zero- or minimum-tillage in wheat, dry direct seeding in rice, improved water- and nutrient-use efficiency, innovations in residue management to avoid straw burning, and crop diversification should assist in achieving sustainable productivity and allow farmers to reduce inputs, maximize yields, increase profitability, conserve the natural resource base, and reduce risk due to both environmental and economic factors. A number of technological innovation and diversification options have been suggested to overcome the system's sustainability problems but some of them have not been fully embraced by the farmers as these are expensive, knowledge-intensive, or do not fit into the system and have resulted in some other unforeseen problems. Different concerns and possible strategies needed to sustain the rice–wheat cropping system are discussed in this review on the basis of existing evidence and future challenges. "

Lack of effective selection criteria is a major limitation hampering progress in breeding for drought tolerance. In an earlier report, we showed in two populations that one cycle of direct selection was effective in increasing grain yield under stress. In the present study, we retested the efficiency of direct selection for grain yield under drought stress in rice using four populations derived from crossing upland-adapted, drought-tolerant varieties (Apo, Vandana) to high-yielding, lowland-adapted, drought-susceptible varieties (IR64, IR72). Each population was subjected to two cycles of divergent selection either under drought stress in upland or under nonstress conditions in lowland conditions. Following selection, approximately 40 high-yielding lines selected under each protocol from each population, along with a set of unselected lines, were evaluated in a series of selection response trials over a range of moisture levels. Significant response to direct selection under stress was realized in 9 out of 15 combinations of populations and stress environments, and in 6 of the 7 severe stress trials. Averaging over all the populations and stress environments, the stress-selected lines had a yield advantage of 25 and 37% over nonstress-selected and random lines, respectively. In contrast to this, under nonstress, the nonstress-selected lines had an average yield advantage of only 7 and 13% over stress-selected and random lines, respectively. Direct selection in managed stress trials during dry seasons gave significant response (25% on average relative to indirect selection in nonstress conditions) under naturally occurring wet season stress. In addition, direct selection under stress in upland gave an average gain of 16 and 45% over nonstress-selected and random lines, respectively, under stress in lowland. The yield advantage of the stress-selected lines appears to result mainly from maintenance of higher harvest index. These results show that direct selection for grain yield under stress is effective and does not reduce yield potential. Overall, this is the first report in rice demonstrating that (a) selection under managed drought stress in the dry season can result in yield gains under natural stress in the wet season, and (b) that selection under upland drought stress can, at least under the conditions of the present study, result in gains under lowland drought conditions.

abstract = "Abstract In the rainfed mid-hill region of Nepal, most fields receive 2–3 t ha−1 of organic compost application every year. Despite efficient recovery and use of organics in the mixed crop-animal systems that predominant in the mid-hills, depleted soil fertility is widely understood to be a significant constraint to crop productivity, with most farmers achieving maize grain yields below 2 t ha−1. Increased use of fertilizer may arrest and even reverse long-term soil quality degradation, but few farmers in the mid-hills use them at present and existing recommendations are insufficiently responsive to site, varietal, and management factors that influence the productivity and profitability of increased fertilizer use. Moreover, policy makers and development practitioners often hold the perception that returns to fertilizer use in the mid-hills are too low to merit investment. In this study, on-farm experiments were conducted at 16 sites in the Palpa district, Nepal to assess the responsiveness of a maize hybrid (DKC 9081) and an ‘improved’ open-pollinated maize variety (‘OPV’, Manakamana-3) to four nitrogen (N) rates, i.e., 0, 60, 120 and 180 kg ha−1, with each N rate response evaluated at 30:30 and 60:60 kg ha−1 rates of phosphorus (P2O5) and potassium (K2O), respectively. With sound agronomy and high rates of fertilizer (180:60:60 kg N:P2O5:K2O ha−1), grain yields observed in the field experiments exceeded 8 t ha−1 with hybrids and 6 t ha−1 with OPV. Yield levels were lower for \{OPV\} than hybrid at every level of applied N, but both genotypes responded linearly to N with partial factor productivity for N (PFPN) ranging from 14 to 19 for \{OPV\} versus 26–30 for hybrid, with improved N efficiencies obtained when P and K rates were significantly higher. Averaged across phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) levels, a $ 1 incremental investment in fertilizer increased the gross margin (GM) by $ 1.70 ha−1 in \{OPV\} and by $ 1.83 ha−1 in the hybrid. For the full response of N, requires higher rate of P2O5:K2O and vice-versa and full response to P2O5:K2O does not occur if N is absent. These results suggest that, i) degraded soils in the mid-hills of Nepal respond favorably to macronutrient fertilizers – even at high rates, ii) balanced fertilization is necessary to optimize returns on investments in N but must be weighed against additional costs, iii) \{OPVs\} benefit from investments in fertilizer, albeit at a \{PFPN\} that is 36–47% lower than for hybrids, and, consequently iv) hybrids are an effective mechanism for achieving a higher return on fertilizer investments, even when modest rates are applied. To extend these findings across years and sites in the mid-hills, crop growth simulations using the CERES-maize model (DSSAT) were conducted for 11 districts with historical weather and representative soils data. Average simulated (hybrid) maize yields with high fertilizer rate (180:60:60 kg N:P2O5:K2O ha−1) ranged from 3.9 t ha−1 to 7.5 t ha−1 across districts, indicating a high disparity in attainable yield potential. By using these values to estimate district-specific attainable yield targets, recommended N fertilizer rates vary between 65 and 208 kg N ha−1, highlighting the importance of developing domain-specific recommendations. Simulations also suggest the potential utility of using weather forecasts in tandem with site and planting date information to adjust fertilizer recommendations on a seasonal basis. "

In general, maize yields in the hills are judged to be intractably low and few efforts have systematically assessed either the water-limited productivity potential or identified sensible entry points toward sustainable intensification that can be selectively matched to the needs and constraints faced by different types of farmers. This study combines field surveys, on-farm field experiments, and simulation modeling (DSSAT) to explore opportunities for closing maize yield gaps in these ecologies. Among surveyed households, the mean grain yield of maize under current farmer practice was 2.0 t ha−1 whereas good agronomic practices increased maize yields up to 6.5 t ha−1 (i.e. exploitable yield gap of 4.5 t ha−1). Recognizing that farmers rarely adopt full technology packages, the value of single agronomic interventions was also explored with all other management factors maintained as per prevailing farmer practice. Averaged across sites and two seasons, non-limiting fertilizer rates (175:60:60 kg \{NPK\} ha−1) increased grain yields by 1.8 t ha−1 followed by the use of hybrids (1.4 t ha−1), higher plant population (0.9 t ha−1), and improved weed control (0.9 t ha−1). These results were also reflected in changes to the economic performance of the system with gross margins increasing from a ‘farmer practice’ base of $202 ha−1 (B:C = 1.86) to $339 ha−1 (B:C = 2.14) with hybrid adoption, $454 ha−1 (B:C = 2.88) with higher plant population, $646 ha−1 (B:C = 2.52) with non-limiting fertilizer, and $611 ha−1 (B:C = 3.37) with careful weed control. Further gains in profitability were achieved with layered agronomic interventions, which increased gross margins to $857 and $763 ha−1 (B:C = 2.95 in both) in conventional tillage (CT) and minimum (strip tillage; ST) systems, respectively. Divergence between grain yield gains and economic performance criteria highlights the importance of considering both perspectives. For resource-poor households, maintaining optimal plant population can increase B:C by more than 50% with small investments ($7 ha−1). Simulation results also suggest that additional potential productivity advantages are achievable with timely planting (e.g. 19% higher mean yield for short duration hybrid with less inter-annual variability). Cultivation of longer duration hybrids can also increase yield potential over their shorter duration alternatives, although trade-offs with yield potential of the second crop in the rotation must be considered. These results highlight several pathways toward intensification in the hills of Nepal that have varying investment requirements, inferred risks, and implications for the different dimensions of sustainability and food security.

Chemicals hazardous to human health, namely methyl parathion and monocrotophos, are still commonly used. Farmers’ beliefs and attitudes towards insects and insecticide use are similar to other Asian countries. Most farmers strongly believe that insects decrease production and have to be controlled with insecticides. A social psychology framework was used to analyse farmers’ beliefs and norms. Farmers’ spray frequencies were correlated with both the belief and norm indices, implying that farmers’ spray decisions are influenced by these two components. Norm influences seem to be more dominant suggesting that farmers’ perceptions of what referent groups expected of them play an important role. The agricultural technicians seem to have the highest influence. The study showed that Lao farmers are potentially vulnerable to become victims of insecticide misuse as in many Asian countries that implemented rice intensification programmes. Strategic plans in research, education, extension and policies related to pest management and pesticide use need to be developed and implemented in parallel with these programmes. These should include establishing comprehensive pesticide policies, developing extension programmes to educate technicians and farmers on the health hazards and ecological principles related to pesticide use, similar educational programmes for schools and explore for non-face-to-face approaches like radio and television dramas and comic strips that can enhance belief change.

Global estimates of annual \{CH4\} emission from ricefields is 100 Tg. \{CH4\} emission data from limited sites are tentative. It is essential that uncertainty in individual sources is reduced in order to develop feasible and effective mitigation options which do not negate gains in rice production and productivity. Field studies at the International Rice Research Institute show that soil and added organic matter are the sources for initial methane production. Addition of rice straw enhances methane production. Roots and root exudates of wetland rice plants appear to be the major carbon sources at ripening stage. The production and transport of \{CH4\} to the atmosphere depend on properties of the rice plant. Under the same spacing and fertilization, the traditional variety Dular emitted more \{CH4\} per day than did the new plant type IR65597. Upon flooding for land preparation anaerobic conditions result in significant amount of methane being formed. Drying the field at midtillering significantly reduced total \{CH4\} emissions. Large amounts of entrapped \{CH4\} escape to the atmosphere when floodwater recedes upon drying at harvest. Cultural practices may account for 20% of the overall seasonal \{CH4\} emissions. "

abstract = "Abstract Reducing water input and \{CH4\} emission while maintaining grain yield is important for the sustainable rice production in south China. However, water-saving technology has not been widely adopted by farmers because of constrains in handling, effectiveness and reliableness. Recently a simplified and easy-to-use alternate wetting and drying technology, namely “safe” AWD, has been developed and recommended to farmers in Asian countries. However, the performance of the safe \{AWD\} technology has not yet been evaluated in south China. The objective of this study was to determine whether the safe \{AWD\} technology could maintain grain yield with reduced water input and \{CH4\} emission as compared to the conventional farmer’s practice (FP) in south China. Two on-station field experiments were conducted in Guangzhou, Guangdong province during 2014 early and late seasons. In the early season, a hybrid rice variety, Tianyou 3618 (TY3618), was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three water treatments, i.e., AWD15, \{AWD30\} and continuous flooding (CF). In the late season, a split-plot design was employed with four water management (AWD15, AWD30, \{CF\} and FP) as main plots and two varieties as subplots. The two varieties were \{TY3618\} and Hefengzhan (HFZ, inbred). Field water level and soil water potential were recorded daily and the \{CH4\} emission was monitored at 7-day intervals. Crop growth, grain yield and water productivities were measured. Results showed that grain yields under \{AWD15\} and \{AWD30\} were comparable with CF, while water input and total \{CH4\} emissions were significantly reduced under the two \{AWD\} treatments for both seasons. In the late season, there were no significant differences in grain yield among the four irrigation treatments for HFZ. While for TY3618, grain yield in \{AWD30\} was significantly lower than AWD15. Irrigation water input in \{AWD15\} and \{AWD30\} was 19.4% and 29.7% lower, and irrigation water productivity was 31.7–37.6% and 48.4–53.2% higher than FP, respectively. Over all, no significant differences were found in maximum tiller number, leaf area index, total aboveground dry weight, among the four irrigation treatments for HFZ. While for TY3618, the crop growth rate during grain-filling stage in \{AWD30\} was significantly lower than \{CF\} and FP. The \{CH4\} emission under \{AWD15\} and \{AWD30\} were 37.4–45.7% and 61.1–77.1% lower than FP, respectively. Multi-location on-farm comparisons were conducted in north, central, and southwest region of Guangdong province and the results confirmed that \{AWD15\} could obtain comparable grain yield as \{FP\} with fewer irrigations. These findings suggested that the \{AWD15\} could be used for water-saving and \{CH4\} emission mitigation while maintaining grain yield in rice production in south China. This is the first report on the performance of safe \{AWD\} in south China. "

We evaluated a set of selected best management practices (BMP) along with two N management options in the farmers’ crop management practices for rice in numerous farmers’ fields across 24 villages over 5 contiguous seasons during 2006–2008. Across years, \{BMP\} and two N management options increased grain yields compared with the farmers’ practice (FP) by 0.73 t ha−1 in both Aman and Boro seasons. The higher yield response (24.6% in Aman and 8.6% in Boro season) occurred with \{BMP\} in combination with leaf color chart (LCC) aided N management (BMP–LCC) than \{BMP\} with Urea Super Granule as N source (BMP–USG). Best management practices and two N management options reduced the yield gap of \{FP\} by 45%, with an average of 1.5 Mg ha−1.

The \{GS\} activities per unit fresh weight of these tissues reached maximum levels around the milk stage of the endosperm and declined thereafter as grain filling progressed. Flag leaves had 5-fold higher \{GS\} activity per unit fresh weight than rachis and 7-fold higher than spikelets at the milk stage. Native-PAGE and activity staining indicated that there were two \{GS\} isoforms in the rachis and they were the same as the eytosolic form (GS 1) and the chloroplastic form (GS2) in leaves, respectively. The \{GS2\} was the dominant isoform in flag leaves, whereas \{GS\} 1 was the dominant isoform in the rachis. However, only \{GS\} 1 activity was detectable in spikelets including hull and kernel. The lack of \{GS2\} activity in the spikelets was consistent throughout the entire grain development stage and was confirmed by protein immunoblotting. "

Use of the \{LCC\} for N management consistently increased grain yields and added net returns for rice and wheat as compared to the farmers’ fertilizer practice across two rice and two wheat seasons, which each involved two to five villages and a total of 20–33 farmers. In rice, use of the \{LCC\} for N management without any other change in farmers’ fertilizer and crop management increased mean grain yield by 0.3–0.4 Mg ha−1 across villages and seasons.

The \{CO2\} concentration of the atmosphere, the dominating determinant of autotrophic biomass productivity, changed throughout geological history considerably with a long-time-scale decreasing trend till a trend inversion with the begin of the industrial age.

Rates of oxidative and reductive biotransformation, exceeding the abiotic/protolytic and photochemical decomposition rates, have been assessed in different ecosystems, using unifoimly 14C-labeled plant material/soil organic matter. They depend primarily on temperature, moisture, soil pH and -Eh and on the inorganic complexing matrix. Reductive biotransformation, source of \{CH4\} and eventually N2O, receives increasing attention due to the contribution it renders in ca 630 mil hectare of wetlands, including the rice soils, to the climate change promoting greenhouse effect. The feasibility of engineered photosynthesis for channeling excessive \{CO2\} into sequestering land use systems, such as Azolla and BGA's (blue green algae) in wetlands, mangroves, coral banks or humus of legume-grass vegetation is under scrutiny. Otherwise, modeling results point to a state of overcompensation of CO2-release due to deforestation/slash and bum by the enhanced biomass production accrued from CO2-fertilization effects.

However, few of the well characterized genes/QTL have been successfully used in breeding for improved trait performance. One of the reasons is that the mapping populations used are irrelevant to breeding. Association mapping has also been used in identifying marker-trait associations that are effective in more complex background. However, the results from association mapping using diversity panels are difficult to be exploited in breeding, since most of the accessions had poor performance in many important agronomic traits. In this study, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using three multi-parent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) populations derived from elite indica lines (DC1, \{DC2\} and 8-way) to identify \{QTL\} for 14 traits including yield, yield components and other related traits. The three \{MAGIC\} populations were phenotyped in the dry season (DS) and wet season (WS) of 2014 at the headquarters of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and genotyped with a Rice \{SNP\} chip containing 4,500 markers. A total of 26 \{QTL\} on all chromosomes except 7, 9 and 11 were identified for 10 traits in the \{DS\} or WS. Six, two, 12, 10 and 20 out of the 26 \{QTL\} were identified in the DC1, DC2, 8-way, \{DC12\} (DC1 + DC2) and \{RMPRIL\} (DC1 + \{DC2\} + 8-way) populations, respectively. Nine of the \{QTL\} corresponded to known QTL/genes, including qFLW4 for FLW, qTGW3 and qTGW5 for TGW, qFGN4 for FGN, qSBN4 for SBN, qPH1.1 and qPH1.2 for PH, qHD3 and qHD6 for HD. All these nine \{QTL\} were identifiable using the \{RMPRIL\} population while only eight, seven, six and one could be identified using the 8-way, DC12, \{DC1\} and \{DC2\} populations, respectively. The 8-way population was more powerful than the DC1, \{DC2\} and \{DC12\} populations. The joint analysis, which combines different populations (e.g., \{DC12\} and RMPRIL), increased the number of \{QTL\} identified and mapping resolution. The study showed that \{MAGIC\} populations derived from diverse elite parental lines can be used to detect QTL, which are ideal for linking gene identification and practical breeding. \{GWAS\} using such \{MAGIC\} populations had higher detection power (compared to assembled populations) and higher resolution (compared to biparental populations). The identified \{QTL\} are directly applicable, since the populations are good breeding populations as well. "

The oldest seedlings (SA30) consistently resulted in lower yield, but required the lowest water input, and thus resulted in comparable or even better total water productivity in the two dry seasons. \{SA20\} was found to be the critical seedling age. When \{SA\} ≤ SA20, yield was not affected; when \{SA\} &gt; SA20, yield was reduced. Lower \{SR\} improved the grain yield of \{SA30\} during the DS. Well-fertilized seedbeds have better grain yield than with non-fertilized seedbeds in the DS, even with a higher seeding rate. Lowering seeding density (from 25 g seeds m−2 to 12.5 g seeds m−2) and increasing N topdressing did not enhance grain yield. "

Increased population pressure and regulations limiting access to land have resulted in shorter fallow periods. Limited information is available on nutrient dynamics in slash-and-burn systems of Southeast Asia in general and particularly on effects of reduced fallow length. Crop and fallow effects on soil parameters and fallow vegetation were quantified in slash-and-burn fields in Luang Prabang, northern Laos from 1991 to 1994. Over the cropping season from May to October declines of 8, 7, and 3% organic C and 33, 40, and 53% extractable P, were observed for the depth intervals of 0–3, 3–10 and 10–25 cm, respectively. Over the same period extractable K declined by 34% in the 0–3 cm interval and increased by 15 and 17% in the 3–10 and 10–25 cm intervals. The declining trend continued over the 3 year crop-fallow cycle with losses (depth 0–100 cm) of 29 ± 7.6 t organic C ha−1 , 2.0 ± 1.1 t total N ha−1, and 0.7 ± 0.8 t extractable K ha−1. At the end of the fallow period the above ground biomass contained 100 kg N ha−1 5 kg P ha−1 and 140 kg K ha−1. The fallow vegetation was dominated by Chrotnolaena odorata with a gradual succession towards tree and bamboo species. The nutrients in the above ground fallow vegetation represent only a small fraction of the N and C lost due to mineralization and leaching. With the present no-till system, mineralization losses are far more serious than losses due to soil erosion. Short fallows will result in a fast decline and low equilibrium of soil organic C levels, reducing the potential for rice yields and limiting farmers choice for other land use options which may become available with better market access.

Field experiments investigating the effects of rice straw mulch on components of the water balance of irrigated wheat were conducted during 2006–2007 and 2007–2008 in Punjab, India, on a clay loam soil. Daily Es was measured using mini-lysimeters, and total seasonal \{ET\} was estimated as the missing term in the water balance equation. Mulch lowered total Es over the crop growth season by 35 and 40 mm in relatively high and low rainfall years, respectively. Much of this “saved water” was partitioned into T, which increased by 30 and 37 mm in the high and low rainfall years, respectively. As a result, total \{ET\} was not affected by mulch in either year. In both years, there was a trend for higher biomass production and grain yield with mulch, but with significant differences only in 2006–2007. Transpiration efficiency (TE) with respect to grain yield was 18.8–19.1 kg ha−1 mm−1 in 2006–2007, and 14.6–16.4 kg ha−1 mm−1 in 2007–2008. While wheat grown in the presence of mulch tended to lower TE, this was only significant in 2007–2008. The results suggest that while mulching of well-irrigated wheat reduces Es, it does not “save” water because the crop compensates by increased T and reduced TE. "

In irrigated aerobic rice systems, rice grows in nonflooded and nonsaturated soil under supplemental irrigation. The development of such systems should start with the identification of promising varieties and the quantification of yield potential, water use, field water outflows, and water productivity. In this paper, we report on the results of growing different tropical upland and lowland rice varieties under irrigated aerobic conditions during six seasons in 2001–2003 at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines. The highest yields under aerobic conditions were realized in the dry season with the improved upland variety Apo (5.7 t ha−1) and the lowland hybrid rice Magat (6 t ha−1). These high yields were obtained in relatively wet soil with seasonal-average soil moisture tensions in the root zone of 10–12 kPa and with maximum values of around 40 kPa. On average, the mean yield of all varieties was 32% lower under aerobic conditions than under flooded conditions in the dry season and 22% lower in the wet season. Total water input was 1240–1880 mm in flooded fields and 790–1430 mm in aerobic fields. On average, aerobic fields used 190 mm less water in land preparation, and had 250–300 mm less seepage and percolation, 80 mm less evaporation, and 25 mm less transpiration than flooded fields. Without plastic sheets to prevent seepage in flooded fields, the water productivity of rice (with respect to rainfall and irrigation water input) under aerobic conditions was 32–88% higher than under flooded conditions. We conclude that the concept of aerobic rice holds promise for farmers that do not have access to enough water to grow flooded lowland rice. More research is needed into the development of improved varieties, the optimization of crop and water management, and the sustainability of aerobic rice under continuous cropping. "

The objective was to compare improved resource management technologies with farmers’ practice. The variance components of an appropriate mixed model serve as measures of stability.

The average \{HRY\} was 10% higher in \{DS\} than in WS. Degree of endosperm chalkiness (DEC) and percentage of grains with chalkiness (PGWC) were decreased with increasing N rates in both seasons. \{AC\} was only slightly affected by season and N treatment. DEC, PGWC, grain length (GL) and the ratio of grain length to width (LWR) were negatively correlated with \{HRY\} in both seasons. 78 and 23 lines had high \{HRY\} and low \{DEC\} under 180 (DS) and 90 N (WS) rates, respectively. 74 and 21 of these high quality lines had \{PGWC\} less than 30%, indicating that visual selection on \{PGWC\} could be a quick and simple method for screening for HRY. The low \{AC\} subset had lowest \{DEC\} but highest \{HRY\} in both seasons. Furthermore, the proportions of lines with high \{HRY\} and low \{DEC\} in different shape classes were significantly different, suggesting that it is possible to select for low chalkiness and high \{HRY\} by selecting for \{PGWC\} and grain shape.

Dry-matter accumulation and N concentration of various plant organs, leaf-area index (L), tissue death, tiller number, plant height, and canopy photosynthesis were recorded periodically. Crop duration increased plant biomass but did not significantly affect grain-yield. Plant N uptake was not affected by crop duration. Direct seeding gave grain yields superior to those of transplanted rice using short-duration IR58, but equal or lower grain-yield using the medium- and long-duration varieties. Growth and development were delayed, and tillering and foliage growth were reduced in transplanted rice due to transplant shock. Tiller production and abortion were a function of relative growth rate. Tissue death occurred during the reproductive phase and depended on L and foliage N concentration. \{IR58\} had the highest L (up to 11.6) and \{IR64\} the lowest. Direct-seeded rice had higher L and dry-matter during vegetative and reproductive growth, but lower foliage N concentration, than had transplanted rice. Growth during ripening was negatively affected by high biomass and L at flowering but enhanced by high foliage N concentration. It is concluded that grain-yield is impeded by high biomass at flowering in direct-seeded rice, particularly in long-duration varieties. High biomass at flowering, however, may enable further yield improvement if N partitioning and foliage expansion patterns are modified. "

Wilczek] on an Udic Haplustalf in the drought-prone, rainfed lowlands of eastern India. Rice was either direct seeded in lines on moist soil immediately after the onset of wet season rain or transplanted after sufficient rainwater accumulated for soil submergence. Crop establishment method had no effect on rice performance in a season (2001) with normal rainfall. In a drought season (2002), direct seeding resulted in mean rice grain yield of 2.3 t ha−1, whereas the transplanted rice crop failed. The agronomic efficiency of N fertilizer applied to direct-seeded rice was comparable for the 2 years (18 and 24 kg grain per kg N applied). Topsoil inorganic N was markedly higher following chickpea and moong than following a post-rice fallow. Direct-seeded rice had higher yield and accumulation of N following a post-rice legume than following fallow, but transplanted rice derived no such benefit from the legume. Direct-seeded rice was established 1–2 months before transplanted rice, and direct-seeded rice matured before transplanted rice by 8 days in the favorable season and by 26 days in the drought season. The soil nitrate present after legumes and fallow rapidly disappeared, presumably by denitrification, following the onset of rains and soil flooding prior to transplanting. A portion of this accumulated soil nitrate was taken up by the direct-seeded rice before it could be lost. But transplanted rice did not benefit from this inorganic N derived from legumes because virtually all soil nitrate was lost before transplanting. Direct seeding of rice ensured better use of residual and applied N, reduced risk due to drought, and favored intensification with post-rice legumes in drought-prone lowland systems. "

Progress has been made in second-generation \{NPT\} lines developed by crossing elite indica with improved tropical japonica. Several second-generation \{NPT\} lines outyielded the first-generation \{NPT\} lines and indica check varieties. China's “super” rice breeding project has developed many \{F1\} hybrid varieties using a combination of the ideotype approach and intersubspecific heterosis. These hybrid varieties produced grain yield of 12 t ha−1 in on-farm demonstration fields, 8–15% higher than the hybrid check varieties. The success of China's “super” hybrid rice was partially the result of assembling the good components of IRRI's \{NPT\} design in addition to the use of intersubspecific heterosis. For example, both designs focused on large panicle size, reduced tillering capacity, and improved lodging resistance. More importantly, improvement in plant type design was achieved in China's “super” hybrid rice by emphasizing the top three leaves and panicle position within a canopy in order to meet the demand of heavy panicles for a large source supply. The success of “super” hybrid rice breeding in China and progress in \{NPT\} breeding at \{IRRI\} suggest that the ideotype approach is effective for breaking the yield ceiling of an irrigated rice crop.

Fertilizer and pest management strategies of farmers are not based on plant nutrient demand and pest control requirements. To provide farmers with options for high yielding, yet more resourceful management options, site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) was developed at Zhejiang University in collaboration with the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). The approach comprises guidelines that allow farmers to adjust domain- and season-specific fertilizer recommendations to actual growing conditions in their fields taking into account plant nutrient demand, indigenous nutrient supply, nutrient use efficiency, as well as socio-economic factors. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the agronomic performance of \{SSNM\} in farmers’ fields in the past seven years (1998–2004). With SSNM, average grain yield increased by about 0.5 t ha−1 over the farmers’ practice, while N use efficiency increased significantly. About 30% of both fertilizer N could be reduced through adoption of SSNM, which would effectively eliminate an unnecessary source of pollution in the rice ecosystem. Larger scale dissemination of \{SSNM\} for rice is under way in Zhejiang province, but stronger institutional support is urgently required. "

The present study analyses the phenotypic plasticity of high and low tillering plant types. Twelve contrasting, high-yielding irrigated rice genotypes were studied for the plasticity of traits contributing to grain yield under different season/site environments and stand densities in the Philippines. For the density factor, sequentially developing yield components along phenology, beginning with tillering, showed decreasing plasticity, indicating progressive adjustment to the initial stand density. For the site/season factor (climate), tillering was less plastic and panicle size and grain filling ratio provided for the strongest adjustments. Large plasticity was observed also for \{LAI\} and little plasticity for \{SLA\} and leaf morphology, particularly blade width. Genotypes differed strongly in organ size vs. number (leaves, panicles), representing organ “number” or “size” plant types. Up to 10 Mg ha−1 grain yield were observed for both extreme types. The plasticity of panicle size was caused by variation in spikelet number and not kernel weight. All genotypes were able to fully adjust yield components to differential plant stand density, resulting in unchanged yield. However, between environments, genotypes having greatest maximal yields and those having stable (but on average smaller) yields showed different patterns of phenotypic plasticity for yield component and plant morphology traits. The \{SAMARA\} model was calibrated for five genotypes showing contrasting morphology and plasticity. It was able to predict most of the genotypes’ variation in morphological and yield component traits. Future opportunities to predict improved rice ideotypes for changing environments and cultural practices through combined field experimentation and modelling are discussed. "

Tiller number at flowering (R2 = 0.94) and maturity (R2 = 0.84) and grain yield (R2 = 0.77) were predicted accurately for independent datasets. The model also predicted accurately density effects on aboveground dry weight (agdw), plant height, leaf size, spikelet number per panicle and filling percentage. Tiller and leaf mortality were over-estimated under high density. Overall, the model predicted satisfactorily the sequential compensation processes among YCs. They led to stable grain yield despite large morphological differences among density treatments and environments. Sensitivity analysis of simulation outcomes vs. variation in crop parameters indicated that modified genotypic tillering ability, phyllochron or leaf size had little effect on final grain yield because of compensations by other traits, although \{IR72\} appeared to have an optimal combination of parameter values. Larger effects on grain yield were predicted for variation of parameters affecting the sensitivity of leaf and tiller mortality to assimilate resources and the ability to mobilize stem non-structural carbohydrates during grain filling. The model will be used next to perform physiological trait dissection and plasticity analyses for diverse genotypes. "

abstract = "Abstract To counteract the increasing unavailability of water for agriculture, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and its national agricultural research and extension system (NARES) partners have worked together to develop and promote the “alternate wetting and drying” (AWD) water management technology. In this paper, we review progress in the development and dissemination of \{AWD\} in several Asian countries, and provide evidence of its extent of adoption and economic impact. \{AWD\} involves the partial drainage of rice fields, which is done by irrigating the fields to the desired depth and then re-irrigating after some time, when the water dissipates. To guide proper implementation, a simple, very low cost, farmer-friendly tool – a perforated “field water tube” – was devised. Demonstration trials and training have been conducted in eight countries in Asia, with large scale adoption in the Philippines, Vietnam and Bangladesh. \{AWD\} has reduced irrigation water input by up to 38% with no yield reductions if implemented correctly. Water pumping expenses and fuel consumption decrease also, thus increasing farmers’ income—by 38% in Bangladesh, 32% in the Philippines, and 17% in southern Vietnam, based on “with and without” \{AWD\} comparison. The investment to develop and disseminate the \{AWD\} technology has a high rate of return, with benefit-cost ratio of 7:1. The evidence of economic benefits at the farm level when aggregated up more than compensates for the total research investments made to develop and disseminate the technology. Successful \{NARES\} partnerships and strong farmers’ groups were critical factors in the validation and dissemination of the technology. \{AWD\} has also been successfully integrated into national government programs, which also facilitated the widespread adoption of the technology in these countries.

The aim of this study was to explore factors (such as biophysical characters of the rice growing environment, farmers’ management practices, and socioeconomic characteristics) that affect the infestation of rainfed lowland rice fields by R. fistulosa and farmers’ ability to cope with the problem. Data were collected from 231 rice plots located in 12 inland valleys infested by Rhamphicarpa in Benin. Data were analyzed using a double hurdle model, which analyses both the likelihood (of occurrence) and the severity of infestation. Results showed that 72% of the surveyed rice plots were infested by R. fistulosa and the average severity was 109 plants m−2. The likelihood of infestation was higher on poorly fertile soils and fields located in the inland-valley bottom, and it decreases through timely use of herbicides and ploughing. Severity of infestation was higher on rice plots cultivated by female-headed households farmers and reduced through management practices such as late sowing, timely application of post-emergence herbicide, three hoe or hand weeding operations, medium-rate fertilizer application and prolonged fallow. Likelihood and severity of infestation were found to be negatively correlated. These findings suggest that farmers can reduce the likelihood and the severity of infestation of their plot as long as they are aware of factors causing the problem given their access to and management capacity of production resources.

We used 3 cycles of backcrossing with selection based on \{DNA\} markers and field-testing using ‘FL478’ as tolerant donor and the widely grown ‘Rassi’ as recurrent parent. In the \{BC3F2\} stage, salt-tolerant lines with over 80% Rassi alleles except in the region around Saltol segment were selected. 429 introgression lines (Saltol-ILs) were identified as tolerant at vegetative stage, of which 116 were field-tested for four seasons at the reproductive stage. Sixteen Saltol-ILs had less yield loss (3–26% relative to control trials), and 8 Saltol-ILs showed high yield potential under stress and non-stress conditions. The 16 Saltol-ILs had been included for further African-wide testing prior to release in 6 \{WA\} countries. \{MAS\} reduced the time for germplasm improvement from at least 7 to about 4 years.

Given the importance of rice as staple crop for many of the world's poorest people, this will have implications for the alleviation of poverty, hunger and malnutrition. Thus, policy-makers need to be aware of the potential benefits of \{GM\} rice. We provide an overview of the literature and discuss the evidence on expected agronomic and consumer benefits of genetically engineered rice. We find that while \{GM\} rice with improved agronomic traits could deliver benefits similar to already commercialized biotechnology crops, expected benefits of consumer traits could be higher by an order of magnitude. By aggregating the expected annual benefits, we estimate the global value of \{GM\} rice to be US$64 billion per year. This is only an indicative value, as more \{GM\} varieties will become available in future. Nevertheless, such a figure can help guide policy-makers when deciding on the approval or funding of biotechnology crops and it may also raise awareness among consumers about what is at stake for their societies.

Similarly, a one percent increase in drought area reduces rainfed Aus season rice production by approximately 693 kilograms per household, on average, annually.

Growing more food with the same production costs or even reduced costs and sustaining the quality of the natural resource base are a major concern. On-farm trials were conducted in Chuadanga District of Bangladesh during the wet season as monsoon rice (aman) and during the dry season as winter rice (boro) in 2006–07 to evaluate the effects of establishment methods with improved crop management on productivity, resource (land, water, and labor) use, and economic return. Rice was established by sowing in line with a drum seeder on conventional tilled puddled soils (CT-DrumR) and by transplanting in line on the day of CT-DrumR (CT-TPR1) and 30 and 35 days after CT-DrumR (CT-TPR2) in aman and boro seasons, respectively. Farmers’ usual transplanting time corresponds to the day of CT-TPR2. Grain yields in CT-DrumR and CT-TPR2 were similar but the crop occupied the main field 22–24 days longer in CT-DrumR than in CT-TPR2, resulting in lower productivity (45 kg grain ha−1 day−1 vs. 55 kg grain ha−1 day−1) in both seasons. Drum-seeded rice matured earlier by 8 and 11 days, received 12% and 6% less irrigation water, saved 19 and 24 person-days ha−1, and gave higher gross margins of 6% and 4% but input costs increased by 20% and 12% than CT-TPR2 in aman and boro seasons, respectively.

The objective was to evaluate the comparative efficacy of hand weeding and pretilachlor applied at different days after seeding (DAS) rice in effectively and economically controlling weeds and improving the productivity of rice wet-seeded using a drum seeder, during the aman and boro seasons. Three application timings of pretilachlor and five weed control treatments, including (a) pretilachlor 0.500 kg ha−1, (b) pretilachlor 0.375 kg ha−1, (c) pretilachlor 0.250 kg ha−1, (d) hand weeding thrice, and (e) unweeded (check), were tested. The reduction in grassy weeds due to different rates of pretilachlor and hand weeding thrice was inconsistent due to less efficacy of pretilachlor against Cynodon dactylon and incomplete removal of the same weed by hand weeding. The density and biomass of sedges and broad-leaved weeds at different pretilachlor rates were lower than or similar to those of hand weeding thrice during both seasons. On average, rice yield loss due to uncontrolled weeds was 43% and 51% in aman and boro seasons, respectively. Economic analysis revealed that the net income with pretilachlor application was equivalent to that obtained with hand weeding thrice in the boro season and higher than with hand weeding thrice in the aman season, in spite of getting slightly lesser rice yield with pretilachlor usage than with hand weeding thrice. Results of the study revealed that, for effectively controlling associated weeds and attaining optimal wet-seeded rice productivity and net returns, pretilachlor 0.250 kg a.i. ha−1 or 0.375 kg a.i. ha−1 application at 3 or 5 \{DAS\} in aman and at 7 or 9 \{DAS\} in boro season can be used as an alternative to hand weeding thrice, during the times of labor scarcity in Bangladesh.

A portion of \{PAB\} is capable of fixing nitrogen (N), and is hence also a source of N for crop nutrition. To account for this phenomenon in long term simulation studies of rice-based cropping systems, the \{APSIM\} modelling framework was modified to include new descriptions of biological and chemical processes responsible for loss and gain of C and N in rice floodwater. We used well-tested algorithms from CERES-Rice, together with new conceptualizations for algal dynamics, in modelling the contribution of \{PAB\} to maintenance of soil organic C and soil N-supplying capacity in rice-based cropping systems. We demonstrate how our new conceptualization of \{PAB\} growth, turnover, and soil incorporation in flooded rice systems facilitates successful simulation of long-term soil fertility trials, such as the \{IRRI\} Long Term Continuous Cropping Experiment (35+ years), from the perspectives of both soil organic carbon levels and yield maintenance. Previous models have been unable to account for the observed maintenance of soil organic C in these systems, primarily due to ignoring inputs from \{PAB\} as a source of C. The performance of long-term rice cropping system simulations, with and without inclusion of these inputs, is shown to be radically different. Details of our modifications to \{APSIM\} are presented, together with evidence that the model is now a useful tool to investigate sustainability issues associated with management change in rice-based cropping systems.

Well-tested cropping systems models that capture interactions between soil water and nutrient dynamics, crop growth, climate and management can assist in the evaluation of new agricultural practices. The \{APSIM\} model was designed to simulate diverse crop sequences, residue/tillage practices and specification of field management options. It was previously unable to simulate processes associated with the long-term flooded or saturated soil conditions encountered in rice-based systems, due to its heritage in dryland cropping applications. To address this shortcoming, the rice crop components of the \{ORYZA2000\} rice model were incorporated and modifications were made to the \{APSIM\} soil water and nutrient modules to include descriptions of soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics under anaerobic conditions. We established a process for simulating the two-way transition between anaerobic and aerobic soil conditions occurring in crop sequences of flooded rice and other non-flooded crops, pastures and fallows. These transitions are dynamically simulated and driven by modelled hydraulic variables (soil water and floodwater depth). Descriptions of floodwater biological and chemical processes were also added. Our assumptions included a simplified approach to modelling \{O2\} transport processes in saturated soils. The improved \{APSIM\} model was tested against diverse, replicated experimental datasets for rice-based cropping systems, representing a spectrum of geographical locations (Australia, Indonesia and Philippines), soil types, management practices, crop species, varieties and sequences. The model performed equally well in simulating rice grain yield during multi-season crop sequences as the original validation testing reported for the stand-alone \{ORYZA2000\} model simulating single crops (n = 121, \{R2\} = 0.81 with low bias (slope, α = 1.02, intercept, β = −323 kg ha−1), \{RMSE\} = 1061 kg ha−1 (cf. \{SD\} of measured data = 2160 kg ha−1)). This suggests robustness in APSIM's simulation of the rice-growing environment and provides evidence on the usefulness of our modifications and practicality of our assumptions. Aspects of particular strength were identified (crop rotations; response to applied fertilizers; the performance of bare fallows), together with areas for further development work (simulation of retained crop stubble during fallows, greenhouse gas emissions). \{APSIM\} is now suitable to investigate production responses of potential agronomic and management changes in rice-based cropping systems, particularly in response to future imperatives linked to resource availability, climate change, and food security. Further testing is required to evaluate the impact of our simplified assumptions on the model's simulation of greenhouse gas emissions in rice-based cropping systems. "

Results of the impact analysis using both empirical approaches indicate that AWD, particularly the “Safe AWD” variant, reduces the hours of irrigation use (by about 38%), without a statistically significant reduction in yields and profits. This reduction in irrigation time translates to corresponding savings in the amount of irrigation water and pumping energy used. However, further analysis of the impact estimates suggests that the potential magnitude of the selection bias based on unobservable variables may still be able to eliminate the measured impact from the \{PSM\} and regression-based techniques that only control for selection based on observable variables. Hence, the current impact results have to be interpreted with caution and further data collection is needed to construct a panel data that would allow one to account for selection problems due to unobservable variables and, consequently, better estimate the \{AWD\} impact.

This analysis presents mapped agricultural cropland change detected over a large area, where fuzzy classification accuracies range between 67% and 91% for various rice classes, with an accuracy of 82% for field-plot data. The MODIS-derived rice areas for the districts were highly correlated with national statistical data with \{R2\} values of 0.9918. We observed a significant decline (13%) in rice cultivated area in 2006 compared with the average over the remaining years. The higher reduction in rice area was mainly restricted to the rainfed districts of the eastern, central, and midwestern regions due to severe drought incidence, particularly in 2006. The area under the rainfed rice ecosystem continues to predominate, recording the largest share among rice classes across all the years from 2000 to 2009. The use of remote-sensing techniques is a rapid, cost-effective, and reliable measure to monitor changes in rice cultivated area over long periods of time and estimate the reduction in area cultivated due to climatic stress such as drought. Reinforced with methods and information in socioeconomics, these techniques could be used for mapping agricultural land-use changes, production planning, and targeting. Agricultural research and development institutions in Nepal can use these techniques for better planning, regular monitoring of land-use changes, and technology transfer. "

Selective herbicides to control weedy rice in conventional rice cultivars are not available and therefore managing weedy rice is a challenging and increasing problem for farmers in Asia. In the absence of selective herbicides, various cultural weed management strategies may help reduce the problem of weedy rice. These strategies may include the use of clean seeds and machinery, use of stale seedbed practice, thorough land preparation, rotation of different rice establishment methods, use of high seeding rate and row-seeded crop, use of purple-coloured cultivars, use of flooding, and adoption of crop rotation.

This study explored the feasibility of using hybrid rice technology in drought-prone rainfed lowland fields. Hybrid lines, parental inbreds, and cultivated varieties as checks were screened for yield potential in well-watered fields and for drought resistance in drained fields at different stress levels. Nineteen out of 45 hybrid lines showed a yield advantage (on average 20%) over check lines in the three well-watered environments. Classifications of drought stress levels were based on the yield reduction relative to the well-watered environments, with moderate, severe, and very severe stress levels resulting in 54%, 77% and 89% reductions in yield, respectively. The relationship between yield advantage of hybrids and drought severity differed among lines; some hybrids showed more of an advantage under severe drought, whereas others had a greater yield advantage under moderate stress. Some hybrids did not perform as well as parents under drought. In general, the harvest index of hybrids was greater than those of inbred parents and checks, and showed strong correlation with grain yield in the different stress environments. Total dry matter yield of hybrids was correlated with improved yield in all stress environments during dry seasons, and some drought-tolerant hybrids also showed greater tillering efficiency and thousand-grain weight. Twenty-four selected hybrid lines were divided into seven clusters on the basis of yield trends across different drought stress environments.

Hybrid \{IR81954H\} showed an 8% yield advantage over other hybrids across all studies, as well as stable yield in all the stress environments having an average yield advantage of 22% over other hybrids averaged across drought environments. These results highlight the variability among hybrids in their drought response, and the need for screening of hybrids and parents under drought stress conditions. "

In this study, selected accessions from the Genebank of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) were screened under upland and lowland field conditions to identify accessions that could be drought tolerance donors for use in breeding. Accessions that performed well under drought stress were retained and screened again in succeeding years along with additional new accession entries under well-watered and different drought stress treatments. A total of 988 accessions were screened in this study. High biomass production and short growth duration (flowering in less than 100 days after sowing) were related to high grain yield under drought stress. Accessions Binuhangin, Dharia Boalia, Gul Murali, and Kalia produced the highest yields under drought stress in both upland and lowland environments. Accessions Kataktara Da2, L201, Gopal, Gathi Kama Nangarhar, and Kotteyaran exhibited the highest grain yields in both well-watered and drought stress conditions. Most drought-tolerant accessions identified in this study originated from eastern India and Bangladesh. Based on yield results under drought and well-watered conditions across crop seasons combined with a disease-resistance evaluation, accessions Kataktara Da2, Dular, Shada Shaita, and \{DA\} 28 are recommended for use in drought breeding programs.

A field study was conducted in the wet season of 2011 and dry season of 2012 to evaluate the effect of plant-to-plant spacing (10 or 20 cm), the number of rice seeds planted per spacing (2 or 3), and weed control methods (42 days weedy, weed-free, and oxadiazon followed by penoxsulam + cyhalofop) on the growth and yield of rice under a dry-seeded rice system. The crop was planted at 20-cm row spacing. Herbicide-treated plots had fewer rice plants than the 42 days weedy and weed-free plots when rain occurred before crop emergence. However, the herbicide treatment provided 81–93% better weed control than the 42 days weedy treatment, which resulted in 54–125% yield advantages over no weeding for 42 days. Grain yield in the herbicide-treated plots was only 75–88% of the grain yield in the weed-free plots, suggesting further scope to improve rice yield in dry-seeded systems.

However, weed infestations are a serious problem in dry-seeded rice systems because dry cultivation practices and aerobic soil conditions are conducive to the germination and growth of weeds. A field study was conducted in the wet season of 2011 and the dry season of 2012 to evaluate the effect of two rice cultivars and different herbicides on weed growth and rice yield under dry-seeded rice. The rice cultivars (one hybrid and one inbred) were dry-seeded at 20–22 kg seed ha−1 with a combine drill fitted with knife-point openers. Rice plant densities ranged from 44 to 56 plants m−2 in the first season and from 67 to 77 plants m−2 in the second season. Weed density, weed biomass, rice panicle number, and rice yield were not influenced by the cultivars; however, they were strongly influenced by the weed control treatments. In terms of percent, the hybrid cultivar had 11–12% higher yield than the inbred cultivar. Weed competition in the control plots (one hand-weeding) lowered yield by 39–41% compared with the weed-free plots. All herbicides significantly reduced weed biomass compared with the control treatment, providing 75–93% weed control. Herbicide-treated plots had similar grain yield and the yield in these plots was 76–86% of the yield of the weed-free plots (4.2–4.4 t ha−1), suggesting further scope to improve rice yield in dry-seeded systems.

Root length density (RLD) at a depth of 30–45 cm varied up to 74–92% among genotypes under drought stress (2008–2009 dry seasons), ranging from 0.024 to 0.23 cm cm−3 in 2008 and from 0.19 to 0.81 cm cm−3 in 2009. Real-time monitoring of soil moisture profiles revealed significant differences among genotypes, and these differences were correlated with \{RLD\} at those soil depths.

To explore differences in growth and the effects of weed competition on yield, 20 diverse Asian rice cultivars were grown in the field and in greenhouse experiments. Differences in grain yield occurred between cultivars in the field and, after a single hand weeding, weed competition decreased grain yields by more than 60% compared with weed-free plots. Three of four cultivars producing the largest grain yields in weed-free plots also had the largest yields in competition with weeds in the same season. Some cultivars, however, had relatively poor yields in competition with weeds compared with weed-free conditions. Rice biomass at 28 days was correlated with grain yield in competition with weeds, and with reduced weed biomass. Substantial differences in seedling growth were found among cultivars. Sabita and \{NSG19\} accumulated twice the total dry matter and leaf area per seedling by 12 days after sowing (DAS) as some of the least vigourous cultivars. Grain yields in competition with weeds in field experiments in two seasons significantly correlated with rice seedling biomass at 12 \{DAS\} in greenhouse experiments. Leaf area at 6 \{DAS\} had the greatest direct effect on seedling dry matter accumulation at 12 DAS. Leaf area at 6 DAS, in turn, was associated with higher specific leaf area, greater dry matter partitioning to leaves at 4 DAS, larger embryos, heavier seeds, and earlier onset of photo-autotrophic growth. More than 90% of the variation in total rice seedling biomass at 12 \{DAS\} was associated with the parameters studied. Leaf area at 6 \{DAS\} and dry matter of rice seedlings are easily measurable traits that have potential to be used as an indirect tool for mass screening of rice for competitiveness against weeds.

Plant height of these two weed species was not influenced by the crop row, but it was influenced by the weed emergence time. Weeds of either species emerging until 30 \{DARE\} had greater biomass and more seeds under wide rows than under narrow rows, but row spacing had no effect on biomass and seeds of plants emerging later. In both crop row spacing treatments, delay in weed emergence until 45 \{DARE\} significantly reduced weed biomass. E. colona and E. crus-galli plants that emerged 60 \{DARE\} produced only 3 seeds plant−1 in 30-cm rows, whereas no seed was produced by these plants in 20-cm rows. Fitting a single linear function to the combined data for rows and weed emergence time gave a strong positive linear relationship between shoot biomass (g plant−1) and seed production (number plant−1) of these species, accounting for 94% and 93% variation in E. colona and E. crus-galli, respectively. These relationships can be used as a predictor of seed production in these species. Regardless of the weed species and weed emergence date, rice grain yields were greater in narrow rows than in wider rows. In the case of both weed species, rice grain yield improved significantly with each delay in weed emergence up to 45 DARE. The results of this study suggest that narrowing row spacing and controlling early weeds led to decreased weed growth and seed production, and increased grain yield in aerobic rice. Narrow crop row spacing and early weed control could be important components of integrated weed management strategies in aerobic rice. "

A complete demand system (Almost Ideal Demand System in linear form) is estimated in two stages based on aggregate time series data from 1960 to 1988. In the high-income countries, i.e. Japan and South Korea, urbanization was observed to significantly reduce demand for cereal grains. In the lower-income countries, demand for cereal grains either increased or remained the same with urbanization. Among cereal grains, urbanization has had negative effects on demand for rice and coarse grains, but consistently positive effects on demand for wheat. Only Japan and Thailand among the countries studied have negative income elasticities of demand for total cereal grains and for rice in particular. Hence, rice remains a necessity and a normal good in most Asian countries. Previous estimates of income elasticities of rice based on time-series aggregate data tend to be lower than those based on cross-section household level data. When urbanization is explicitly specified in the demand model, the estimates of income elasticities from time-series data turn out to be consistent with those from cross-section data. "

To close this knowledge gap, we characterized rice \{TE\} in several experiments with varying experimental and climatic conditions. All six experiments were pot studies conducted between 1994 and 2006 at the International Rice Research Institute, Los Baños, Philippines. Between experiments, arithmetic means of \{TE\} varied from 1.8 to 4.7 g dry matter per liter transpired, whereas linear regressions showed \{TE\} means between 2.2 and 4.0 g dry matter per liter transpired. Actual \{TE\} values were estimated to be about 10% higher because root biomass was not determined. The corresponding k-factor ranged from 1.4 to 5.1 Pa (arithmetic mean) and 1.3 to 5.0 Pa (linear regression slope), indicating a considerable effect of climatic conditions on \{CO2\} and water vapor diffusion processes at the leaf surface. The analysis of different experimental treatments could not show a significant effect of drought treatments or variety on TE, but significant effects of soil type and water by nutrient interactions were observed. We concluded that the \{TE\} of rice is in the lower range of other small grain cereals, possibly comparable to oat. The results of this analysis can serve as a reference for further work on the \{TE\} of rice but they need to be verified in studies covering a wider range of climatic conditions and in field experiments.

Rice is also a major source of protein for the masses of Asia. Most Asian countries have done remarkably well in meeting the food needs of the growing population over the last quarter of a century. However, the future poses even more challenging and ambitious tasks. Developments in China encouraged the International Rice Research Institute and several national rice research programs during the 1980s to initiate research on exploring potentials and problems of hybrid rice technology. Virmani and Edwards (1983) reviewed the status and prospects for breeding hybrid rice and concluded that exploitation of heterosis through hybrid breeding offered an important option to increase varietal yields in this selfpollinated crop. During the past 12 years, considerable progress has been made in the development and use of this technology both in and outside China. This chapter reviews work on various aspects of hybrid rice research since 1983 and provides a future outlook on this subject. "

Insect-resistant cultivars of major food crops—such as rice, wheat, corn, sorghum, and barley— are grown on millions of hectares annually. Farmers growing these save billions of dollars in insecticide costs and supply lower cost food to the consumer. Insect-resistant cultivars have greater yield stability and thus are responsible for greater food security. The chapter presents several cases, such as rice variety IR36, which is resistant to brown planthopper, green leafhopper, yellow stem borer, striped stem borer, and gall midge was planted in over 10 million ha of riceland of the world annually (IRRI, 1982). Its cultivation alone yielded an additional income of one billion dollars annually to rice growers and processors. Numerous rice cultivars with multiple resistances to insects have been developed and are widely grown. However, for the continued success of host resistance, one must have dynamic programs for gene identification. New genes for resistance must be continuously utilized in breeding programs to ensure the availability of resistant cultivars when old ones become susceptible because of the development of new biotypes.

A seed bank conserving crop varieties is often called a genebank as the seed samples (accessions) are used as a source of genes conferring desirable characteristics. Conventional seed banking involves drying orthodox seeds to low moisture content prior to storage. Seeds are also cleaned, tested for germination and health, and then sealed in (ideally) airtight, moisture-proof containers. Seed banks actively manage their collection(s), testing seeds for viability (germination) at regular intervals and, if necessary, recollecting or rejuvenating samples. Most seed banks also actively distribute seeds for use by plant breeders and other researchers, as permitted by relevant legislation. Seed bank databases store all the passport and seed management data. "

It is a culturally valued part of Asian societies and is a political commodity for many governments. Globally per capita demand remains stable at about 65 kg, while in Africa demand is growing rapidly. Genetic improvements through plant breeding and associated crop management practices led to more than doubling of rice yields over the last 50 years. Most gains have been in intensive, irrigated systems while only recently has progress been made in developing rice varieties that tolerate drought, floods, and soil toxicities. Rice production faces pressure from changing land and water use patterns and most likely the effects of climate change. The current international trade of rice (&lt;9% of production) will grow as self-sufficiency policies of a number of large countries become untenable. "

abstract = "Abstract Elevated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly of methane (CH4) from flooded rice production systems contribute to global warming. Different crop management strategies, such as drainage of paddy soils and climate-smart residue management, are essential in order to mitigate \{GHG\} emissions from flooded rice systems, but they often conflict with practical management preferences. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of early-season drainage for mitigating \{CH4\} and \{N2O\} emissions from soils with and without added organic amendments in relation to native soil organic carbon (SOC). Rice plants were grown in pots under controlled conditions in a growth chamber with different treatments in a 2 × 2 × 3 factorial design. The treatments included an arable soil with two different carbon levels: 1.4% (low carbon, [L]) and 2.2% (high carbon [H]); two water regimes: midseason drainage (M) and early plus midseason drainage (EM); and three nutrient treatments: one inorganic control (nitrogen fertiliser only [N]), and two organic: maize straw + N fertiliser (S) and maize compost + N fertiliser (C). An equal amount of mineral N fertiliser was applied in all treatments. Straw and compost were applied to the soils on the basis of an equivalent amount of C added in each organic treatment. The results revealed rapid mineralization of organic C in the double-drained system, resulting in lower total \{CH4\} emissions in treatments under early plus midseason drainage compared to those under midseason drainage only. Total \{CH4\} emissions were reduced by 89% and 92% in the S + \{EM\} treatments in low C soils and high C soils respectively, as compared to S + M. The drainage effects on \{CH4\} emissions from compost amendments were only significant in the low C soil, with a 61% reduction in \{EM\} compared to M drainage. \{N2O\} emissions from non-organic treatments in \{EM\} were 87% higher than in M under low C soils. The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were higher in organic treatments and decreased by the end of growth period. This experiment demonstrated an interaction between water and straw management to achieve both sustainable soil quality and low-emission rice production. "

Recently, multidisciplinary teams of agricultural scientists conducted diagnostic surveys in several rice-wheat areas in South Asia. This paper reviews rice-wheat system problems and longer-term issues of sustainability identified through the surveys (near-term problems affecting rice and wheat yields are discussed less fully). System problems include poor wheat populations caused by the poor soil structure and plow pan formed for puddled rice, late wheat planting resulting from late rice harvesting, and losses to grassy weeds encouraged by continuous rice-wheat cultivation. Sustainability issues include soil nutrient depletion and possible buildup of insects, weeds, and diseases. "

Increased leaf longevity, increased water and nutrient uptake, greater assimilate supply during grain filling, and increased grain and ear set have been associated with constitutive stress tolerance mechanisms in maize (Zea mays L.). We examined tropical maize for adaptive changes associated with drought tolerance that are sustained under N stress and therefore may indicate constitutive stress tolerance mechanisms. Original and drought-tolerant selection cycles of four populations were evaluated in five experiments differing in N supply at Poza Rica, Mexico between 1992 and 1994. Selection for tolerance to mid-season drought stress consistently increased grain yield across N levels due to an increase in both the number of ears per plant and kernel weight. The number of ears per plant was associated with a shorter anthesis–silking interval (ASI) of drought-tolerant cycles. Reduction in \{ASI\} due to selection was greater under N stress as compared to well-fertilized conditions, however, it was not associated with either biomass or N accumulation of plants and ears around flowering. The N content of individual kernels did not change with selection and grain N concentration decreased. Greater kernel weights were likely the result of delayed leaf senescence and increased assimilate supply during grain filling. We conclude that decreased ear abortion and increased assimilate supply during grain filling of maize selected for tolerance to mid-season drought also provide tolerance to N stress and therefore may contribute to increased yield and yield stability.

Model evaluation was based on the analysis of two output variables: grain yield and relative yield loss. The paper reports results of qualitative and quantitative methods used to assess RICEPEST. Qualitative evaluation involved visual examination of graphs where deviations (simulated minus observed) are plotted against simulated values, and displaying an area of acceptance. This method showed that, in general, \{RICEPEST\} accounted well for the yield reducing effects of rice pests. Two areas for potential improvement of \{RICEPEST\} were however, identified: the simulation of damage caused by dead hearts in water-stressed environments, and the simulation of damage caused by weeds. Quantitative evaluations made use of equivalence- and χ2-tests. The equivalence tests rejected (P≤0.05) the hypothesis of difference between simulated and observed yield and relative yield loss larger than a preset tolerance in both test- and validation-experiments. Conversely, the χ2-tests did not reject the hypothesis of difference in categorised simulated and observed yields and relative yield losses (P≤0.05) in both test- and validation-experiments. \{RICEPEST\} proved to simulate adequately yield losses and can be used as a tool to set research priorities for rice crop protection in tropical Asia.

The indica rice cultivar \{IR64\} and four of its near-isogenic lines (NILs; BC3-derived lines) unique for leaf size traits, \{YTK\} 124 (long leaves), \{YTK\} 127 (broad leaves), \{YTK\} 205 (short leaves) and \{YTK\} 214 (narrow leaves), were compared in this study for changes in leaf growth and its water status. The plants were subjected to two soil water regimes, well-watered and progressive soil drying measured by the fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW). Applied drought reduced leaf number, total leaf area, specific leaf area, plant biomass, tiller number, plant height, stomatal conductance, amount of water transpired, leaf relative water content, and leaf water potential more in \{IR64\} and the \{NILs\} than in the respective controls; nonetheless, transpiration efficiency (TE) was slightly higher under drought than in the well-watered controls. \{NILs\} with broader leaves had higher biomass (and its individual components), less stomatal conductance, and higher \{TE\} under drought than \{NILs\} with narrow and shorter leaves. Under drought, leaf number was positively correlated with tiller number and plant height; nonetheless, root weight and total biomass, water transpired and TE, and plant height and \{TE\} were positively correlated with each other. However, a negative correlation was observed between stomatal conductance and the \{FTSW\} threshold at which normalized transpiration started to decline during soil drying. Overall, the IR64-derived lines with broader leaves performed better than \{NILs\} with narrow and short leaves under drought. "

Genotypic variation in the time of day of anthesis is considered an escape mechanism from thermal stress, but little is known on its dependency on environmental conditions. One traditional, cold-tolerant rice cultivar and three improved tropical rice cultivars were grown in four different climatic environments under flooded conditions to study the environmental response of time of day of anthesis. The environments were the cold-dry season and the hot-dry season in Senegal, the temperate summer in Southern France and the dry season in the Philippines. The time of day when the first spikelets opened, a maximum of spikelets were open and the last spikelets closed was observed daily on a population basis (2 m2 plots replicated 3 times). The time of these observations was expressed as hours after sunrise (hasr) calculated from astronomic day length and the local time of solar noon. Aggregate flowering periods were 4–10 d at panicle scale and 14–32 d at population scale. Within a day, onset of anthesis was earliest in the Philippines (3.4 hasr) and latest in the cool season in Senegal (6.75 hasr), the other environments being intermediate. The duration from onset to end of anthesis varied between 1.82 h in the Philippines and 2.77 h in France. Genotypic differences in time of anthesis and duration of anthesis were small. Across all genotypes and environments, 80% of the variation of the time of maximum anthesis could be explained with the mean minimum air temperature (Tmin) during the 7 d preceding any given anthesis event. Linear, multiple regression models determined for each cultivar using Tmin and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) observations from the three tropical environments explained 94% of variation of time of anthesis onset and end. Low Tmin thereby delayed and low \{VPD\} advanced anthesis processes. Under the assumption that panicle temperature during anthesis is indeed a major determinant of spikelet fertility in rice, it is concluded that the sensitivity of time of day of anthesis to air temperature and humidity is an effective eco-physiological adaptation of the rice crop. Prospects for improved modeling approaches for the prediction of thermal sterility in rice are discussed. "

Four rice genotypes were planted under irrigated flooded conditions in a similar replicated design in four environments: the relatively humid dry season in the Philippines, the summer season in southern France and the cold-dry and hot-dry seasons in northern Senegal. Panicle temperature was measured by \{IR\} photography on ca. 4000 images, complemented with simultaneous monitoring of micro-climatic variables on the floodwater-canopy-air continuum. Spikelet sterility was observed at the population scale at grain maturity, and canopy morphology was also characterized (plant height, leaf area index, panicle position within the canopy and panicle exertion). The period and time of day of anthesis (TOA) was estimated using a model developed on the same experiments as described in a previous paper. Panicle temperature varied between 9.5 °C below and 2 °C above air temperature at 2 m. During \{TOA\} it was on average slightly warmer than the air in the Philippines and significantly colder in Senegal. Spikelet sterility was disaggregated into three components caused by chilling at microspore stage, incomplete panicle exertion at anthesis and high panicle temperature at anthesis. Chilling caused up to 100% and heat up to 40% sterility, the former mainly in the Senegal cool-dry season and the latter in the Philippines. All genotypes avoided heat sterility in the hot-dry season in Senegal despite air temperatures up to 40 °C, by a combination of escape (early TOA) and avoidance (transpiration cooling). Only one genotype had no chilling induced sterility due to physiological tolerance. It is concluded that heat stress causing sterility is more likely to occur in warm-humid than hot-arid environments due to humidity effects on transpiration cooling. Models predicting global warming effects on sterility losses need to consider microclimate and organ temperature, and research is now needed on the genetic control of panicle transpiration cooling "

We used a nation-wide dataset of over 603 farm households, which surveyed pockets of successes in using improved livestock feed technologies. Heckman two-stage estimation procedures were used to identify factors associated with success and intensity of livestock feed technology use simultaneously. Results from the first stage of selection equation show that households socioeconomic and institutional factors such as education status of the head, herd size, exercise in feed technology utilization, cooperative membership, distance to district center, and diverse use of technologies have significant effect on success in livestock feed technologies adoption. The second stage demonstrates that intensity of household collaboration or network, membership in livestock related cooperatives, training, access to livestock feed technologies with packages, diverse use of technologies, engagement in livestock enterprises, livestock management system, willingness to invest more in feed technologies, and agro-ecologies significantly influence the intensity of feed technologies use. These results suggest that success and intensified use of improved feed technologies demand different entry strategies for risk factors, enablers, and behaviors, which may differ from the classic agricultural technologies transfer system. These include availability of appropriate biophysical and resource environments, functional linkages between different actors, access to inputs and social capital, and enabling institutional support system. Moreover, this study shows that when there is limited adoption, few pockets of success in improved technologies use, positive deviant approach would be more informative to understand the underlying factors and principles for success and intensified use of technologies than the most commonly reported conventional adoption rate studies.

Topsoil (0–20 cm depth) and subsoil (30–50 cm depth) were used for the study along with their blend (1:1) for generating a gradient in soil properties, which allowed evaluating the importance of organic carbon content in regulating \{CH4\} production in both layers of soil. For all the three soil samples, total \{CH4\} production showed a decreasing trend in the order Topsoil &gt; 1Topsoil:1Subsoil &gt; Subsoil. Inoculation by non-sterilized soil suspension in sterilized soils triggered higher \{CH4\} production. It was observed that with the addition of external organic substrates like rice straw, even subsoil produced appreciable amount of CH4. Methane emission was also studied from the same soils cultivated with a rice seedling (IR-72) grown in pots. Temporal pattern of \{CH4\} emission deviated from temporal pattern of its production, i.e. emission patterns either showed a certain time lag (Luisiana and Pila soil) or no significant correlation to the \{CH4\} production (Maahas soil). Methane production and emission rates recorded in this study yielded significant relationship. "

While it is generally accepted that the longer growth duration in subtropical environments mainly contributes to the greater yield potential, comparisons of adapted cultivars in tropical and subtropical climates are lacking and other factors that might be responsible for differences in yield potential have not been identified. Field experiments were conducted in a tropical environment at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines and in a subtropical environment at Taoyuan Township, Yunnan, China in 1995 and 1996. Three to five high-yielding rice cultivars were grown in each experiment under optimum crop management to achieve maximum attainable yields. Yield, yield components, plant dry matter and harvest index (HI) were determined at maturity. Growth analyses were conducted at key growth stages to determine crop growth rate (CGR), leaf area index (LAI), and leaf area duration (LAD). Daily radiation and air temperature were monitored. The highest yield of 15.2 t ha−1 was produced at Yunnan by Shanyou 63, a Chinese indica \{F1\} hybrid, whereas maximum yield at \{IRRI\} was 9.3 t ha−1. On the average across cultivars, Yunnan produced 33 and 62% greater yields than \{IRRI\} in 1995 and 1996, respectively. Sink size (spikelets per m2) was responsible for these yield differences. Larger panicles (spikelets per panicle) contributed mostly to the greater sink size at Yunnan. Biomass production was 42% and 58% greater at Yunnan than at \{IRRI\} in 1995 and 1996, respectively, while differences in \{HI\} were relatively small. Dry matter accumulation and \{CGR\} were significantly greater at Yunnan than at \{IRRI\} during vegetative and grain-filling stages. These differences were relatively small and inconsistent across cultivars and years during the reproductive phase. Yunnan had greater \{LAI\} and \{LAD\} than at IRRI, which might be responsible for greater CGR. These results indicate that further improvement in rice yield potential in the tropics will depend mainly on the ability to increase sink size and biomass production. "

Submergence caused by typhoons and floods is one of the major reasons for production losses. Because of the complexity of these ecosystems, the breeding framework necessitates adequate feedback and a more in-depth understanding of the ecological and socioeconomic conditions in these flood-prone areas. Within this purview, this study validated the performance in farmers’ fields of lines with the \{SUB1\} gene that confers tolerance of submergence for up to two weeks. The \{SUB1\} gene was incorporated through marker-assisted backcrossing, MABC. The evaluation was conducted through participatory approaches to gain understanding of the risks as well as farmers’ preferences for these varieties. A baseline survey of 658 farm households accomplished during 2008, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and adaptability trials were conducted, with focus on farmers commonly affected by submergence in four Southeast Asian countries: the Philippines, Lao PDR, Indonesia, and Southern Viet Nam. The study further examined farmers’ criteria in evaluating new varieties through the participatory varietal selection (PVS) process. Results showed that varying conditions of submergence can influence farmers’ criteria and preferences for rice cultivars. Depending on the timing of flood with respect to growth stage, shorter duration and shallow flashfloods can result in less than 10% production losses while deeper and stagnant water with two weeks’ duration and &gt;100 cm depth can cause damage ranging from 40% to 77%. Major findings of \{PVS\} trials and preference analysis indicated that farmers prefer rice cultivars that are tolerant of submergence, have early to medium maturity relative to their commonly grown varieties, are resistant to pests and diseases, and are resistant to lodging, among other traits. To enhance adoption, male and female farmers should be involved in the evaluation process. The results of this study can contribute to enhancing breeding programs to develop appropriate varieties that reduce production losses, improve income, and ultimately reduce poverty incidence in submergence-prone areas.

While it seems reasonable that the ability to access pond water would reduce the risk involved in letting the paddy dry temporarily, and thus encourage adoption of AWD, we can find no solid empirical evidence to support the proposition. The result showed that adoption of \{AWD\} is not driven by farmer desire but rather imposed on them due to increasing water scarcity. Furthermore, we found that farmers who were more reliant on pond irrigation were less likely to adopt \{AWD\} – the ponds were used to avoid soil drying. Because of the numerous benefits, it is assumed that pond water sources will continue to play an important role in sustaining crop production. "

In a field study, we evaluated resource conserving and cost-saving alternative tillage and crop establishment options with an aim to improve system productivity and efficiency. Treatments included transplanting and direct-seeding of rice after reduced and no-tillage, followed by wheat after no-tillage. Conventional-tilled (puddled) transplanted rice followed by conventional-tilled wheat was included as a current practice. Rice yields of transplanted rice were similar irrespective of tillage/puddling. However, both dry and wet direct-seeded rice yielded 0.45–0.61 Mg ha−1 lower than puddled transplanted rice. Wheat yield after no-tillage was either higher or equivalent to conventional practice. Wheat provided more economic return (US $35 ha−1) than rice. No-till wheat was 6% more profitable than the conventional practice (T1). Rice transplanting with or without puddling had similar water application but dry direct-seeded rice had 10–12% lower and wet direct-seeded rice 20–24% higher. Machine labor without tillage was lower by maximum of 51 and 43% in rice and wheat, respectively. Similarly, human labor was also 9–16% lower in no-till rice compared to other practices. Two years results consistently showed $35 more net income when rice was transplanted without puddling than that of conventional practice. Direct-seeded/un-tilled rice had variable response in 2 years; \{US\} $16 more in year 1 and similar in year 2 to the puddled transplanted rice.

The ca. 35% carbon content of the rice husk char is possibly a consequence of the protective shield of silica, preventing full exposure of the biomass to oxidation in the gasifier. In this paper we undertake an evaluation of the sustainability of this ‘gasification–biochar system’ (GBS) in Cambodia, where a rapid deployment of gasifiers is underway. In Part I, we describe the context and analyse (some of) the physical and chemical properties of the biochar. While there are some potential health, safety and environmental issues that require further analysis, they are problems that could be readily addressed in further research and appear to be resolvable. In Part II, we present results from field trials, summarise the data on the carbon abatement of the gasification–biochar system and present some preliminary economic data. "

In the 1980s, a series of reforms progressively returned means of production to individual farmers. Over the same period the mountains in the study area lost 50% of their forest cover. This paper provides an overview of the impact of changes in government policies on farmers’ practices, on land use, and on environmental dynamics. It applies a multi-agent simulation model to validate the hypotheses derived from household survey and remote sensing data about the mechanisms linking the allocation of paddyland to farm households with shifting cultivation on the hillsides, and deforestation. The model explains the diversity of the current land use systems by analysing the interactions between land tenure policies in the lower part of the toposequence and the dynamics of land use in the upper part. The findings are based on an extensive diagnostic survey of a number of representative sites, on generation of primary data from an intensive survey of 50 randomly selected households, and on insights gained by the authors during their long association with an action research project using a participatory observation method. The authors also explore whether the modelling approach can capture the main features of complex human-environment interactions of a site and can help apply the findings to the broader agroecosystem the site represents.

Our data show that, although the potential is high, the insufficient supply of irrigation water, excessively expensive chemical fertilizer, and moderately costly labor hinder the scheme from achieving that potential. First of all, an improvement in irrigation is crucial as it increases yield not only directly but also indirectly through its complementary relationship to chemical fertilizer. We also find that an improvement in credit access is important as it can increase the application of chemical fertilizer and labor by making the acquisition of these expensive inputs through markets possible. The unavailability of hired and exchange labor during peak seasons is another constraint to the intensive use of labor. The introduction of rice varieties with a shorter maturity duration would relax the timing of transplanting and thus spread out the peak seasons’ labor demand. "

Soil penetration resistance can restrict, or even halt, root system growth. For rice, a soil penetration resistance of 1.4 \{MPa\} is sufficient to inhibit root system expansion. This review describes the effects of the soil physical environment on root growth and its interaction with drought stress. A large variation in soil penetration resistance exists among rainfed rice-growing areas of South and Southeast Asia and within experimental stations used for managed-drought field phenotyping. This variability may influence genotypic performance across experimental sites/countries and the response of crop genotypes to drought stress. A case study is presented in which differences in the soil physical environment may partially elucidate differences in experimental results between two field studies conducted at different locations.

These two hunting and wolf spider, respectively, are believed to actively contribute to brown planthopper (BPH) population control. However, how much each species attacks prey in Cambodian field condition is unknown. We conducted field experiments in Cambodia during the wet season at two locations, a famner's fields at Takeo and at CARDI, using both field cages and natural conditions. Cages were sprayed with insecticide to remove all pre-existing insects in the cages and then washed after 10 days to reduce insecticide residue. Results confirmed \{BPH\} inside the cage were killed by the insecticide. A known \{BPH\} population was reared inside the cages starting with 3 pairs of adults. Temporary cages were removed after counting second instar \{BPH\} and permanent cages were left in place. Spiders were released into the cages for 15 days. In permanent cages either two individual A. inustus or P. pseudoannulata were allowed to feed on \{BPH\} prey. Both spider species have the same killing ability in dense prey populations, but predation is higher for Pardosa at low prey density. In uncaged field environments (where more than just \{BPH\} prey are available) with a spider/BPH ratio 1:3 to 1:11 \{BPH\} mortality was 78–91%. Within 15 days in permanent cages spiders caused 100% \{BPH\} mortality at an average predator/prey ratio of 1:5 to 1:14. At a ratio of 1:18 or higher there was some \{BPH\} survival in cages. "

Since 1994 \{BPH\} have attacked Cambodian rice fields in patchy form. More \{BPH\} attacked in field where farmers have more opportunity to use fertilizer and insecticides. Rice production in Cambodia will probably face more problems with \{BPH\} outbreaks as rice production intensifies. The birth and/or survival rate of \{BPH\} that leads to population outbreaks are related to fertilizer, plant variety and insecticide treatments. The experiments were conducted in the field and laboratory in Cambodia in 1999 to test the hypothesis above. A traditional variety (Eath Chhmoush), low and high fertilizer rates, and an organic phosphate insecticide (Diazinon) were used in the field experiment and two varieties (susceptible and tolerant to BPH) and three rates of \{NPK\} fertilizer were used in the laboratory study. \{BPH\} population and others arthropods were collected weekly from the field experiment by a D-vac machine. Two kinds of net cages (temporary and permanent) were covered the rice plants to determine the birth and survival rate of \{BPH\} population with and without natural enemies. Number of oöcytes was counted from \{BPH\} females, which reared in plant-cages. Birth and survival rates of \{BPH\} were higher in susceptible plants with high fertilizer rate used. The experiment indicated that natural enemies have played the important role to control the \{BPH\} population. The realized fecundity and survival of \{BPH\} was higher in susceptible host plant variety with high rate of \{NPK\} fertilizer used.

In the present paper, the structural properties of the two solubility fractions of hyper-branched material are explored in a set of traditional waxy rice varieties. The objective was to elucidate the nature of the \{HWS\} component, e.g. to see if it could be phytoglycogen, another water-soluble polysaccharide. We show that solubility is controlled by thermodynamic effects, rather than slow dissolution (kinetic effects). The average size, degree of branching and the debranched chain-length distributions indicate that the \{HWS\} fraction is structurally different from phytoglycogen. The debranched chain-length distributions of short chains and the degrees of branching in the \{HWS\} material are similar to those of the hot-water-insoluble (HWI) fractions but the chain-length distributions indicate that the \{HWI\} fractions carry longer chains than those in the \{HWS\} fractions. Light-scattering measurements show that the average size of whole molecules in the \{HWI\} component is significantly greater than in the \{HWS\} component. It is postulated that the structural differences limit solubility of the molecules in the \{HWI\} fraction, possibly due to co-crystallisation with adjacent molecules at more points than is possible for the shorter chains in \{HWS\} molecules.

In small farm agriculture, the yields obtained in cereal production are usually low and losses, both in the field and during storage, are dramatically high, particularly in developing countries. In Mozambique, these aspects, together with an increased frequency of floods, are hindering advances in rice production. Aimed at contributing to the reduction of losses in stored rice, trials were carried out to compare the effectiveness of traditional raffia bags and of hermetic storage using single and double plastic bags concerning quantitative losses and seed quality, including germination potential, after three and six months of storage. Pest identification, insect populations estimates, percentage of weight loss, germination power and seedling vigor were evaluated. The results showed that, in descending order of density, Angoumois grain moth (Sitotroga cerealella Olivier), lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica F.), rice/maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais Mostch. and Sitophilus oryzae L.) and red flour beetle [Tribolium castaneum (Herbst)] were the main insects infesting the rice. When compared to hermetic storage with both single and duplicate airtight bags, traditional storage presented statistically significant higher mean infestation density (30.63–53.94 individuals/kg in traditional and 0.71–3.50 individuals/kg in hermetic storage) and percentage of weight loss (3.03–3.44% in traditional contrasting with 0.27–0.47% in hermetic conditions). In traditional storage a significant 38.25% drop in the germination potential was also observed, attaining values below the established minimum tolerated in Mozambique (80%), while under hermetic storage, that reduction remained within the acceptable values of 13.9–17.5%. The distinct storage methods did not produce significant differences on the moisture content of the grain. These results demonstrate that the use of hermetic storage has resulted in a safe, pesticide-free, and sustainable storage method, suitable for rice seeds, with advantages over traditional bagging. The results presented here lead to propose hermetic storage to be adopted by paddy small farmers, in order to lever food security and income generation in the country. "

Therefore, research on the interactions between residue and irrigation management on wheat crop performance and water use was initiated, using the dual approach of field experiments and crop modelling. This paper presents the results of a comprehensive evaluation of the \{APSIM\} model for its ability to simulate the effects of mulch and water management, and their interactions, for wheat in Punjab, India. The model was evaluated for its ability to predict crop development, grain yield, biomass production over time, soil water dynamics, daily soil evaporation (Es), total evapotranspiration (ET) and water productivity (WPET kg ha−1 mm−1), using two years of data from field experiments at Ludhiana, Punjab. The model predicted grain yield adequately, with coefficients of determination (r2) of 0.91 and 0.81 with and without mulch, respectively, and prediction of total biomass was even better, with r2 of 0.99 and 0.92. The corresponding absolute \{RMSE\} values were 433 and 550 kg ha−1 for grain yield (means 4100 and 3800 kg ha−1) and 300 and 800 kg ha−1 for total biomass (means 10,200 and 9300 kg ha−1). However, grain yield was underpredicted (by 600–1000 kg ha−1) in treatments where the crop was subjected to water deficit stress, even though simulation of soil water dynamics, and the effect mulch on soil water content, was generally very good. The model accurately predicted total crop seasonal evaporation and the effect of mulch; however, daily Es was poorly simulated. \{APSIM\} does not attempt to capture the soil temperature driven effect of mulch on crop phenology. The evaluation shows that \{APSIM\} is suitable to use for wheat under the conditions of north-west India. However, additional model processes that capture the effects of mulch on crop development and growth, as driven by soil temperature, are needed to help design intensive cropping systems to optimise land and water productivity. The ability to better simulate crop performance under conditions of water deficit is also needed to help determine irrigation management strategies that minimise irrigation input while maintaining yield.

One of the assumptions is the increase in night respiration and thus the increase in carbon losses over time. Some rice cultivars (indica, aus and japonica types) were grown in the field in the Philippines and in heated greenhouses in Montpellier, France, to quantify the response of respiration to increased \{NT\} and its implication at crop level. Increased \{NT\} by 3.8 and 5.4 °C over the whole crop cycle in two greenhouse experiments and by 1.9 °C in the field from 33 days after transplanting up to maturity using a free-air-controlled enhancement increased night respiration rate significantly. Overall, the cost in \{CH2O\} of night respiration over crop duration was 17 to 20% (field) and 8 to 18% (greenhouse) of the potential shoot dry matter (including that lost by respiration). Additional respiratory burden due to increased \{NT\} was only 1 to 7% of the potential shoot dry matter at maturity, and was not associated with significant loss in additional dry matter. The absence of any dry matter reduction with increased \{NT\} within indica cultivars questions the assumptions of recent papers. "

Whereas \{MHA\} was evenly distributed through a 0–60 cm soil profile, the CaHA was concentrated in the 0–20 cm surface layer. The CaHA pool is probably protected from chemical and biological degradation through development of bonds to exchangeable Ca and possibly structural Fe. The \{MHA\} may be bound to the soil through exchangeable monovalent cations, through attachment of peripheral amino acids to exchange sites or fixation sites, or through other \{SOM\} molecules. No evidence was found to suggest different source materials for the two \{HA\} fractions.

Field experiments were done in Liuyang (moderate-yielding site) and Guidong (high-yielding site) counties, Hunan Province, China, in 2007 and 2008. Two varieties from each varietal group were grown in each field experiment under moderate and high N rates. Grain yield, yield components, aboveground total dry weight, harvest index, total N uptake, and crop radiation use efficiency (RUE) were measured for each variety. A significant difference in grain yield was observed among the varieties and varietal groups but not between the two N rates. “Super” hybrid varieties have increased rice yield potential by 12% compared with ordinary hybrid and inbred varieties. The higher grain yield of “super” hybrid varieties was attributed to improvement in both source and sink. “Super” hybrid varieties produced more biomass than ordinary hybrid and inbred varieties. Long growth duration and high accumulated incident radiation were partially responsible for high biomass production for the “super” hybrid varieties. “Super” hybrid varieties had significantly larger panicle size (spikelets per panicle) than ordinary hybrid and inbred varieties, which resulted in larger sink size (spikelets per m2). Crop \{RUE\} did not explain the yield superiority of “super” hybrid rice.

The retention of rice residues as a surface mulch could be beneficial for moisture conservation and yield, and for hence water productivity, in addition to reducing air pollution and loss of soil organic matter. Two field experiments were conducted in Punjab, India, to study the effects of rice straw mulch and irrigation scheduling on wheat growth, yield, water use and water productivity during 2006–2008. Mulching increased soil water content and this led to significant improvement in crop growth and yield determining attributes where water was limiting, but this only resulted in significant grain yield increase in two instances. There was no effect of irrigation treatment in the first year because of well-distributed rains. In the second year, yield decreased with decrease and delay in the number of irrigations between crown root initiation and grain filling. With soil matric potential (SMP)-based irrigation scheduling, the irrigation amount was reduced by 75 mm each year with mulch in comparison with no mulch, while maintaining grain yield. Total crop water use (ET) was not significantly affected by mulch in either year, but was significantly affected by irrigation treatment in the second year. Mulch had a positive or neutral effect on grain water productivity with respect to \{ET\} (WPET) and irrigation (WPI). Maximum \{WPI\} occurred in the treatment which received the least irrigation, but this was also the lowest yielding treatment. The current irrigation scheduling guidelines based on cumulative pan evaporation (CPE) resulted in sub-optimal irrigation (loss of yield) in one of the two years, and higher irrigation input and lower \{WPI\} of the mulched treatment in comparison with SMP-based irrigation scheduling. The results from this and other studies suggest that farmers in Punjab greatly over-irrigate wheat. Further field and modelling studies are needed to extrapolate the findings to a wider range of seasonal and site conditions, and to develop simple tools and guidelines to assist farmers to better schedule irrigation to wheat.

Two field experiments were conducted to determine the effects of tiller reduction on plant growth and grain yield in two varieties with different tillering ability. Two methods were used to reduce tillers: the first was the removal of tillers manually at different crop growth stages and the second was to grow rice plants through holes in styrofoam slats, which provided a physical restriction on tiller emergence. Tiller number declined by 12–57% with the first method and by 18–47% with the second method compared with the control. Despite the significant reduction in tiller number and unproductive tiller percentage, none of the treatments with manual tiller removal and physical restriction of tillering resulted in a significant increase in grain yield compared with the control. Decreases in leaf area and biomass at heading and panicle number at maturity were observed when tiller number declined significantly, but grain yield was not necessarily reduced because it was compensated for by more biomass production after heading and increased spikelet number per panicle. The two varieties with different tillering ability had similar responses to tiller reduction. Based on the two methods of tiller reduction used in this study, we conclude that a further increase in rice yield potential may not be possible by reducing or eliminating unproductive tillers. "

This study was conducted to compare the N response and fertilizer-N use efficiency of Shanyou63 (SY63) and Liangyoupeijiu (LYP9) under a wide range of N rates. \{SY63\} and \{LYP9\} were the most popular hybrid varieties in the late 1980s and late 1990s in China, respectively. The overall objective was to develop optimal N management for \{LYP9\} using SSNM. The two varieties were grown under eight and six N treatments in 2004 and 2005, respectively, in Hubei, China. N treatments included a zero-N control, an FTNM, and several \{RTNM\} with different chlorophyll meter (SPAD) thresholds. \{SPAD\} readings were taken weekly on the topmost fully expanded leaves. Grain yield, yield attributes, total N uptake, and components of fertilizer-N use efficiency were measured in both years. Both \{FTNM\} and \{RTNM\} can be used to improve N management for \{SY63\} and LYP9, but the optimal \{SPAD\} threshold for determining the timing and rate of N application was 2 units higher in \{LYP9\} than in \{SY63\} because \{LYP9\} has thicker leaves. The two varieties required a minimum total N rate of 120–150 kg N ha−1 for producing maximum grain yield. The difference in maximum grain yield was very small between the two varieties, although \{LYP9\} had the potential to produce higher grain yield than SY63. The two varieties did not show a clear difference in fertilizer-N use efficiency. When excessive N was applied (195–275 kg N ha−1), grain yield of \{LYP9\} was 13% higher than that of \{SY63\} in both years because they responded differently to the high N inputs. Our study suggests that the planting of a variety insensitive to high N input such as \{LYP9\} would lead to over-application of fertilizer-N by rice farmers if knowledge-intensive N management technology such as \{FTNM\} and \{RTNM\} were not used.

The significance of this cereal as a source of energy and income seems overwhelming for millions of people in Asia, representing 90% of global rice production and consumption. Estimates indicate that the burgeoning population will need 25% more rice by 2025 than today's consumption. As the demand for rice is increasing, its production in Asia is threatened by a dwindling natural resource base, socioeconomic limitations, and uncertainty of climatic optima. Transplanting in puddled soil with continuous flooding is a common method of rice crop establishment in Asia. There is a dire need to look for rice production technologies that not only cope with existing limitations of transplanted rice but also are viable, economical, and secure for future food demand. Direct seeding of rice has evolved as a potential alternative to the current detrimental practice of puddling and nursery transplanting. The associated benefits include higher water productivity, less labor and energy inputs, less methane emissions, elimination of time and edaphic conflicts in the rice–wheat cropping system, and early crop maturity. Realization of the yield potential and sustainability of this resource-conserving rice production technique lies primarily in sustainable weed management, since weeds have been recognized as the single largest biological constraint in direct-seeded rice (DSR). Weed competition can reduce \{DSR\} yield by 30–80% and even complete crop failure can occur under specific conditions. Understanding the dynamics and outcomes of weed–crop competition in \{DSR\} requires sound knowledge of weed ecology, besides production factors that influence both rice and weeds, as well as their association. Successful adoption of direct seeding at the farmers' level in Asia will largely depend on whether farmers can control weeds and prevent shifts in weed populations from intractable weeds to more difficult-to-control weeds as a consequence of direct seeding. Sustainable weed management in \{DSR\} comprises all the factors that give \{DSR\} a competitive edge over weeds regarding acquisition and use of growth resources. This warrants the need to integrate various cultural practices with weed control measures in order to broaden the spectrum of activity against weed flora. A weed control program focusing entirely on herbicides is no longer ecologically sound, economically feasible, and effective against diverse weed flora and may result in the evolution of herbicide-resistant weed biotypes. Rotation of herbicides with contrasting modes of action in conjunction with cultural measures such as the use of weed-competitive rice cultivars, sowing time, stale seedbed technique, seeding rate, crop row spacing, fertilizer and water inputs and their application method/timing, and manual and mechanical hoeing can prove more effective and need to be optimized keeping in view the type and intensity of weed infestation. This chapter tries to unravel the dynamics of weed–crop competition in DSR. Technological issues, limitations associated with DSR, and opportunities to combat the weed menace are also discussed as a pragmatic approach for sustainable \{DSR\} production. A realistic approach to secure yield targets against weed competition will combine the abovementioned strategies and tactics in a coordinated manner. This chapter further suggests the need of multifaceted and interdisciplinary research into ecologically based weed management, as \{DSR\} seems inevitable in the near future. "

Income volatility may force households in developing countries to lower their expenditures on health and education, as the literature suggests. A drastic reduction in education and health expenditures due to negative income shocks can affect children’s health and education, and hence human capital formation in the long run, in developing countries. Using the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) data from the government of Bangladesh and applying the “difference-in-difference” estimation method in a natural experimental setting, this article reveals that in the face of a loss in income caused by a tropical cyclone that hit the coastal region in May 2009, cyclone-affected rice farmers spent less on their children’s education. This study suggests active intervention to ensure stable income to make schooling expenditures less elastic with rice income to ensure human capital development in agriculture-dependent countries in the long run.

The hypothesis was that the brittle mutant straw would break into smaller pieces during threshing, and that both the smaller piece size and the differences in biochemical straw composition would enable more rapid decomposition. Brittle straw broke into smaller pieces than non-brittle straw during a replicated trial of three threshing methods: hand threshing, pedal threshing, and axial-flow machine threshing. In a litter bag study to determine the effect of straw piece size on decomposition rate of each straw type over 10 weeks, smaller straw pieces decomposed faster than larger pieces as indicated by changes in amount of straw and its C/N ratio over time (P &lt; 0.05), but there was no significant difference between straw types at the same size.

Two weather generators, \{WGEN\} and WMAK, from the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) were utilized to produce estimated daily weather data for running the combined model. Methods to estimate some weather factors, such as relative humidity and soil temperature, were developed using historical data. Results demonstrated that simulated and observed distribution of vapour pressure which was needed to estimate daily humidity were consistent. This approach can be applied to estimate daily humidity when data are not available. Simulation outputs included daily disease severity, the area under disease progress curve (AUDPC), and yield loss. Sensitivity analysis revealed that temperature was a sensitive variable in the combined model influencing rice growth and leaf blast epidemics. Results were insensitive to precipitation because simulations were assumed to be conducted without water limitations, and rainfall change led to only slight changes in dew period. Simulations of leaf blast for 30 years were conducted for a location in the Philippines. Frequencies, cumulative probabilities of disease severity, AUDPC, and yield loss were calculated. Results demonstrated that the combined model is useful to simulate rice leaf blast epidemics for multiple years based on estimated weather data, from that the information regarding risk of blast epidemics could be obtained.

A comprehensive knowledge of E. crus-galli ecology and fecundity is fundamental in managing different biotypes of this weed. It was hypothesized that (a) high weed plant density produces more biomass and fertile seeds per unit area, (b) rice interference reduces the biomass and fecundity of the weed, and (c) a delay in weed emergence reduces the soil seed bank. In 2013, experiments were conducted in the wet season (WS) and dry season (DS), to understand the effect of E. crus-galli densities (40 and 80 plants m−2) on its growth, survival, and fecundity, with varying emergence times of 2, 15, 30, and 45 d after rice emergence (DARE). Relative to the weed plants grown without rice interference, E. crus-galli growth and seed production was lower in the presence of rice. Percent survival and plant height of E. crus-galli declined in a linear manner in the DS, and declined in a quadratic manner in the WS. Tiller number, inflorescence number, inflorescence biomass, and shoot biomass per plant declined in an exponential manner, with a delay in emergence of each cohort relative to rice. Across rice seeding rate, weed density, and emergence time, there was a linear relationship (y = 110x − 272 in the \{DS\} and y = 100x − 220 in the WS) between E. crus-galli shoot biomass and the number of seeds plant−1. Relative to the late-emerging weed cohorts, E. crus-galli seed production (1320–1579 seeds plant−1), 1000-seed weight (2.2–2.9 g), and seed yield (2808–2334 kg ha−1) were higher when seedlings emerged with the crop (2 DARE). None of the seedlings that emerged 45 \{DARE\} produced viable seeds. Seed germination of the first two cohorts (2 and 15 DARE) ranged from 84 to 91%. The delay in emergence of E. crus-galli beyond 30 \{DARE\} reduced the percentage of germinable and viable seeds, and increased the percentage of non-viable seeds produced plant−1. The results suggest that cultural weed management approaches that delay the emergence of E. crus-galli can reduce weed biomass and seed production, and is thus valuable for preventing seed rain to the seed bank by noxious weed biotypes in the field.

There have been reports that increasing nitrogen application can alleviate the negative impact of high-temperature stress on yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.). However, little is known about the interactive effect of \{HNT\} and nitrogen (N) supply on rice grain yield and its underlying source-sink relationships. We conducted two field experiments at the International Rice Research Institute in both the dry (DS) and wet (WS) season of 2012, in which three cultivars with contrasting responses to \{HNT\} were grown under two levels of night-time temperature and two levels of N application. \{HNT\} significantly decreased grain yield of cv. Gharib at both N levels and in both seasons, while grain yield of cv. \{PSBRc4\} was significantly reduced by \{HNT\} at the higher N level only. Among the yield components, grain weight was consistently reduced by \{HNT\} in all three cultivars across two seasons while spikelets m−2 and seed-set were affected by \{HNT\} during \{DS\} and WS, respectively. In most cases, higher N application reduced grain yield and its components. Thus, in our study, increasing the total N fertilizer did not alleviate the adverse effects of \{HNT\} on rice yield. Using a novel modelling approach that quantifies source-sink relationships during grain filling, we found that increased nitrogen did not alleviate the negative impact of \{HNT\} on source-sink interactions during grain growth across cultivars and seasons. Nevertheless, the model showed that there were significant differences among cultivars in grain filling duration, grain filling rate and total sink size, modulated by their source-sink relationship in response to HNT, suggesting that breeding programs should select for sink-related traits to improve rice tolerance to HNT.

Borer populations built up in broods 3, 4 and 5 in flooded deepwater rice to reach densities of 16–52 immatures, m−2, which damaged 33–80% of the stems. Borer populations declined in brood 6 at the end of the deepwater rice season, the larvae entering diapause in the field stubbles. The major factors regulating the populations were as follows: the incidence of weather extremes (temperatures 34 °C with relative humidity &lt; 70%) before flooding which are lethal to eggs and first instars; the presence of succulent, elongating stems which are-favourable for larval penetration and development; the occurrence of rapid water rises (6–8 cm day−1) which drown the immature stages; the activity of natural enemies, particularly the complex of egg parasitoids, and spider and orthopteran predators; and the harvesting and threshing operations which kill many diapausing larvae in the stems. An early season population outbreak in 1977 was associated with exceptionally mild, wet weather; the highest population density and level of stem damage followed a late surge of flooding in 1980 that produced a second flush in elongating stems.

Significant differences among N rates (0, 40, 80, and 120 kg N ha−1) and soils were observed with rice for grain yield, total biomass and grain N uptake in both years. Low N response, low grain yield, low N uptake, and a short grain filling phase during the 1995 wet season was due to post-heading water stress. The stress was more pronounced on the Vertisol and at high N rates. This resulted in lower N content at maturity than at heading. The loss of biomass N from plant implied that apparent N recovery (AR) and physiological nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE) may differ significantly based on whether maximum N accumulation or total N uptake at maturity was used. Plant N recovery, both by the N difference method and 15N technique, revealed much lower recovery of fertilizer N (21–27%) with rainfed lowland rice than with irrigated dry-season rice. The residual effect of N applied to the preceding rice crop was nonsignificant on all yield, growth, and N uptake parameters of chickpea. The performance of chickpea was better on the Alfisol than the Vertisol, principally due to soil physical attributes. The better performance and longer growth duration during 1994–1995 dry season as opposed to the 1995–1996 season was attributed to higher rainfall (92 mm versus 39 mm) and rainfall during the critical pod-filling to maturity phase. Mineralization and nitrification of N was negligible during the rice–fallow period due to the dry conditions and low organic matter content. This was corroborated by the similarities in N balance between rice–chickpea and rice–fallow system. The \{PNUE\} of rice was 33 to 57 kg grain per kg N absorbed compared with 25 to 27 kg grain per kg N absorbed of chickpea, owing mostly to higher N concentration of chickpea grain and the higher energy cost due to biological N fixation.

Multi-agent modelling enables horizontal relationships (spatial configurations) and vertical relationships (socio-economic organisation) to be integrated. \{GEMACE\} is a multi-agent model for simulating farming-hunting-duck interactions in the Camargue (Southern France). For an archetypal region, we simulated land-use conversion and ecological change in space and time resulting from the interaction between environment and human drivers. A wintering duck population is simulated and distributed heterogeneously in its habitats. The duck population is affected by various environmental factors such as land-use changes, wetland management, hunting harvest, and disturbance. Land-use decisions are made at farmland level by farmers and hunting managers. Important biophysical drivers are water and salt through land relief, land-use history, infrastructure, spatial neighbourhood, and current land use. Important human drivers are the economic conditions of the world agricultural market and land-use strategy. Through three scenario runs, we discuss the implications that can be drawn from this modelling application with regard to the viability of a spatial conservation management alternative and multi-field research on sustainable development.

A study was conducted in two consecutive seasons in farmers' fields at three sites (Atalla, Samanthurai, and Girithale villages) in Sri Lanka to evaluate the effect of different establishment methods (farmers' practice, random broadcast, row seeding, seedling broadcast, and transplanted rice) on weedy rice infestation and rice yield. The farmers' practice had a higher number of weedy rice panicles (60–80 m−2) than the random broadcast (39–48 panicles m−2), seedling broadcast (3–15 panicles m−2), and transplanted rice (1.3–3.0 panicles m−2) methods. The use of clean rice seeds in the random broadcast method reduced weedy rice seed production by 29–41% compared with the farmers' practice (0.6–2.0 t ha−1). Compared with the farmers' practice, the seedling broadcast method reduced weedy rice seed production by 71–87% and transplanted rice by 95–98%; and increased rice yield by 27–49% (7.5–9.1 t ha−1). At all three sites, the farmers' practice resulted in the lowest grain yield (5.1–6.7 t ha−1). Compared with the farmers' practice, the random broadcast and row seeding methods increased rice yield by up to 21% and 31%, respectively. The findings suggest that the use of clean rice seeds, the use of a row-seeded crop, and the adoption of different rice planting methods may help to suppress the spread of weedy rice. "

Six rice/cowpea experiments were conducted to explore rice and cowpea yield sensitivities to species proportion, cowpea cultivar, seeding rate, water stress and N fertility. Five experiments were on moderately productive Typic Tropudalfs (pH 5.3), and one was on an unproductive Oxic Dystropept (pH 4.3). Cowpea grain-yield responses to increased cowpea proportion consistently exceeded crop proportionate area increases (0.49 and 0.85 relative yields at 25 and 50% cowpea) whereas rice grain-yield responses proved to be sensitive to cowpea cultivar and other factors. However, an early-maturing, nonviney determinate cowpea line (IT82D-889) was compatible with rice. Grain-yields responded to seeding rates, but increases to rates that were only 10–15% above monocrop optima for each species were adequate to obtain most benefit from intercropping. Neither irrigation nor fertility effects markedly altered relative competitive abilities of the species. The experiments demonstrated that rice can be advantageously intercropped with early-maturing nonviney cowpeas. Within soil-fertility and water-stress ranges of this study, highest combined relative yields should be obtained from an intercrop composed of rice and cowpea planted at a 50:50 proportion with seeding rates about 15% above the monocrop optima.

When intercropped with cowpea line IT82D-889, rice N yield consistently increased as cowpea replaced up to 50% rice. Above 50%, the effecton rice N yield was not consistent. Cowpea N yield increased sharply as cowpea proportion increased. At the 50:50 species ratio, N yields relative to those of monocrops were 0.70 for rice and 0.71 for cowpea. In a comparison of cowpea lines at 50:50 species ratio, the early-maturing, determinate IT82D-889 accumulated 68 kg N ha−1, whereas later-maturing lines accumulated as much as 40% more N. The viney habit of the late-maturing lines, however, made them incompatible with rice. Seeding rates affected N yields of both species. Rice and cowpea yields increased 0.54 and 0.88 kg N ha−1 for each kg ha−1 cowpea seed increase. However, for each 10 kg ha−1 rice seed increase, rice N yield increased 1.06 kg ha−1 but cowpea N yields decreased 0.54 kg ha−1. Water stress imposed by a line-sources irrigation system increased N yields of both species, but organic N amendment (75 kg N ha−1 from manures) had only a small effect on N yields. Neither water availability nor soil fertility status strongly interacted with crop proportion to influence the N benefit from intercropping. These experiments demonstrated that, given a determinate, early-maturing, nonviney cowpea cultivar, intercropping increased rice N yield. Maximum total N yield (rice+cowpea) occured when approximately half the intercropped area was planted to cowpea. "

abstract = "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) faces multiple problems. The main one is improving the lives of the 30% of its population that suffers from extreme poverty and food insecurity. As more than 70% of the population lives off farming and related activities, agricultural development will have to play a major role in improving this situation. Fortunately, Africa has an abundant supply of natural resources that can support a huge expansion in food, specifically rice production. Because of strong demand, rice area expansion in \{SSA\} is larger than for any other crop. Total milled rice production increased from 2.2 million Mg in 1961 to 9.1 million Mg in 2004. Rice imports into \{SSA\} also increased from 0.5 million Mg of milled rice in 1961 to 6.0 million Mg in 2003 and \{SSA\} currently accounts for 25% of global rice imports, at a cost of more than US$1.5 billion per year. Therefore, many African governments accord high priority to developing their local rice sector as an important component of national food security, economic growth, and poverty alleviation. The abundant supply of agroclimatically suitable wetlands (~239 million ha) and water resources can support a large expansion in rice area and productivity. Currently, less than 5% of the potentially suitable wetlands are planted with rice because of various constraints. Expansion and intensification of rice cultivation in \{SSA\} will not compete with other crops in terms of land and water resources because, during the rainy season, only rice can be grown on low-lying wetlands, including inland valleys. In addition, the labor-intensive nature of rice cultivation will provide additional sources of work and income to the rural poor, especially women. Should labor shortages become acute, however, appropriate mechanization can be considered. Small farmers want to earn money from rice farming, but lack modern inputs and capital to fully exploit their rice lands as these items are limited or not available. This is where an innovative public–private partnership is desirable to support the intensification of rice farming. Rice is cultivated in four ecosystems of SSA: dryland (38% of the cultivated rice area), rainfed wetland (33%), deepwater and mangrove swamps (9%), and irrigated wetland (20%). Many abiotic stresses (drought, flood, and variable rainfall; extreme temperatures; salinity; acidity/alkalinity and poor soils, soil erosion, and high P fixation) and biotic constraints [weeds, blast, Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV), and African rice gall midge (AfRGM)] limit rice production on the continent. The changing climate is expected to further aggravate the abiotic constraints and reduce rice yields in all ecosystems. Rice production is also restricted by many technical, management, socioeconomic, health, and policy constraints. The constraints to irrigated wetland rice in the Sahel of \{SSA\} are similar to those faced by Asian farmers in the 1960s; therefore, well-tested irrigated rice technologies from Asia and elsewhere are being introduced and adapted to local conditions to obtain fast returns on investment. For rice in irrigated wetlands in the humid and moist savanna zones, rainfed wetlands, and drylands, locally developed \{NERICA\} (new rice for Africa) varieties and production technologies are being tested in target environments. The progenies of Oryza glaberrima and O. sativa subspecies indica are better adapted to rainfed and irrigated wetlands, while those of O. glaberrima and O. sativa subspecies japonica are more suited to rainfed drylands. In addition, research is ongoing to tackle SSA-specific problems such as \{RYMV\} and AfRGM and to develop efficient crop management technologies. Currently available best management practices (integrated crop management options) for different rice ecosystems are shown in Table XV. Additional support through the provision of technical advice through revamped national R&amp;D services; a supply of good-quality seed and other inputs, including farm credit; and enabling policy are needed for profitable and sustainable intensification of rice cultivation in SSA. It is also critical to organize preventive health measures for farmers against wetland-related diseases (malaria, bilharzia, and so on), protect certain natural wetlands (e.g., with bird sanctuaries), preserve mangrove forests in strategic coastal belts and rich peats in inlands, and use chemical inputs efficiently to minimize pollution and maintain environmental quality while intensifying rice production. Anticipatory research is needed to tackle the impacts of changing climate on rice farming and the environment. Modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) can be exploited to reach out to farmers in remote areas and to deploy technologies effectively. In addition, the development of innovative private–public partnerships and the organization of farmers into user-groups will enhance the training, farmer education, and technology adoption required for intensive commercial rice farming.

The permanent raised-bed/furrow system, a water-wise conservation agriculture-based practice, is gaining importance for row- and high value-crops in irrigated agriculture. However, because of additional surface exposure and elevation, raised beds may be more prone to salt accumulation especially under shallow water table conditions. A field study was carried out in 2008 and 2009 in the Khorezm region, Central Asia, to investigate the effect of three furrow irrigation methods on salt dynamics of the soil and the performance of the cotton crop on the raised bed-furrow system. The irrigation methods compared included (i) Conventional furrow irrigation wherein every furrow was irrigated (EFI) at each irrigation event; (ii) Alternate skip furrow irrigation (ASFI where one of two neighbouring furrows were alternately irrigated during consecutive irrigations events; and (iii) Permanent skip furrow irrigation (PSFI) during which irrigation was permanently skipped in one of the two neighbouring furrows during all irrigation events. For salinity management with \{PSFI\} a ‘managed salt accumulation and effective leaching’ approach was pursued. The \{EFI\} method increased salt accumulation on the top of the raised beds. In contrast, the \{PSFI\} method allowed an effective salt leaching from the top of the raised beds. After leaching, salinity on top of the beds under \{PSFI\} was reduced to &lt;3 dS m−1 compared to 5–6 dS m−1 under \{ASFI\} and \{EFI\} indicating an effective leaching with the \{PSFI\} method. Raw cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L., cv. Khorezm 127) yield was higher under the \{PSFI\} (2003 kg ha−1) method having yield increases of 984 kg ha−1 (96% higher) and 787 kg ha−1 (64% higher) than under \{EFI\} (1216 kg ha−1) and \{ASFI\} (1019 kg ha−1) methods, respectively. Better crop performance with \{PSFI\} was linked with the lesser salinization of the raised beds and a larger salt free root zone before the leaching events. In addition, the \{PSFI\} method reduced irrigation water demand contributed thus to minimizing secondary soil salinization. Thus, \{PSFI\} could be an effective method to manage the salt under raised beds in salt-affected irrigated arid regions. "

Here, we investigate the intensification option of increasing production by increasing cropping intensity and choice of varieties with different crop duration. We developed a model to generate, compare and visualise opportunities for single/double/triple cropping systems consisting of irrigated rice and optionally a vegetable. The model was applied in a case study in the Senegal River valley. Results showed that with appropriate choice of sowing dates, severe cold sterility in rice can be avoided, also in rice–rice crop rotations. At optimal sowing dates, simulated total long term average potential yields of single, double and triple cropping yields were 10.3, 19.0 and 18.9 t/ha respectively (total of 1,2 and 3 yields). With a hypothetical completely cold tolerant variety, yields could increase to 11.2, 20.2 and 20.9 respectively. Simulated Triple crop yields are hardly any higher than those of a double crop with two medium duration varieties. Delay in sowing due to late availability of resources (machinery, irrigation water allocation within a scheme, credits for pump fuel) is a known problem in the region. Therefore we also simulated how much delay was possible (width of the sowing windows) whilst still allowing for double cropping. We found enough delay was possible to allow for a rice–rice or a rice-vegetable crop. A rice-rice-vegetable triple cropping system would only be possible without delays and with a very short duration vegetable of 2 months. Most promising options to increase production are through shifting the sowing date to facilitate double cropping, adoption of medium duration varieties and breeding for cold tolerant varieties. "

We illustrate the approach by mapping and contrasting poverty and livelihood assets within the Indian Indo-Gangetic Plains drawing on district-level indicators and livelihood asset-based principal components. The relatively low poverty incidence in the north-western plains is associated with an overall favorable livelihood asset base, particularly pronounced for natural and financial capitals. There is a marked gradient with poverty increasing eastwards, reflecting a similarly marked decline in livelihood assets. The overall unfavorable livelihood asset base in the mid-Gangetic Plains of Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh provides a particularly challenging spatial poverty trap. The maps and regional contrasts of poverty and livelihood assets provide a foundation for future research and development work and reiterate the need for cross-sectoral and inter-disciplinary approaches.

This paper develops sampling strategies and formulates mitigation options based on diel (day and night) and seasonal patterns of methane emissions. The design of sampling strategies and identification of abatement strategies were based on data obtained using automatic closed-chamber systems. Diel patterns of methane emissions from irrigated rice fields displayed similar patterns from planting to flowering. Fluxes at 0600, 1200, and 1800 h were important components of the total diel flux. Methane fluxes sampled during these times are sufficient to capture most of the diel variation observed throughout the growing season. Seasonal patterns of methane emissions indicated the intensity of flux measurement that should be done within the growing season. The characterization of seasonal emission patterns according to ecologies, fertilizer amendments, and water management provides a focus for mitigation strategies. Mitigation strategies, based on seasonal patterns, may be grouped into two approaches: preventive measures and reducing measures. Preventive measures may take into consideration, prior to planting rice, the ecology and fertilizer management that will give fewer methane emissions. Reducing measures become necessary when the option to prevent high emissions is not possible under a given condition. Other factors may be considered as preventive or reducing measures to mitigate methane emission. These factors, however, should be evaluated as to how they influence the diel and seasonal patterns of methane emission. Two things can be derived from the evaluation: (i) an improvement of the emission factor for better extrapolation; and (ii) a better understanding of how and when mitigation strategies can best be applied.

abstract = "Fifty varieties of rice grown in the Philippines this century were grouped chronologically for comparison in both glasshouse and field experiments at Los Baños. The five groups of lowland, and two of upland, varieties each contained 5 to 11 entries. Plants were grown under three daylengths in the glasshouse experiment. In the field they had to be grown at a relatively low density and nitrogenous fertilizer level. Group comparisons revealed marked changes in growth habit, daylength response and inflorescence characteristics, not always consistently in one direction. Lowland varieties have become shorter, with smaller and more upright leaves and reduced daylength sensitivity. Panicle weight initially became heavier, and then lighter again with greatly increased panicle number. Despite these changes, there has been no change in photosynthetic rate, crop growth rate or kernel weight. However, there has been a marked increase in harvest index and in grain production per day, associated with reduced stature and earlier maturity. Although upland varieties have also become less sensitive to daylength, in other respects they have diverged from lowland varieties towards taller, more sparsely tillering, larger panicle types. "

Soil tilth varied with clay content. Cropping system and crop residue management affected tilth by changing the soil consistency. They had pronounced effects on the range of soil moisture levels optimum for ease of tillage in sandy clay loam soil. Puddling was classified according to quality, on the basis of change in apparent specific volume (ΔASV) of the silty clay soil and availability of soil moisture, as follows: granulated (ΔASV = 0.03–0.05 cm3 g−1); paste ΔASV = 0.06–0.09 cm3 g−1); and muddy (ΔASV &gt; 0.10 cm3 g−1). The ΔASV of the silty clay soil was dependent on cropping system, crop residue management, and method of land preparation for rice. Sandy clay loam soil was difficult to puddle because of its low water-holding capacity, swelling property and plasticity number. Puddling the silty clay soil reduced soil moisture stress and soil redox potential, but more energy was required to plow the puddled field than to plow the nonpuddled field for a dry-season crop. "

However, seedbed preparation, crop establishment, and stored soil water availability are critical to successful production of dryland crops in a soil previously puddled for wetland rice. Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) was grown after wetland rice in a rice-based cropping system during the post-monsoon season in a clayey soil. No tillage and complete tillage were compared for their effects on soil moisture regime, root growth, and crop yield in the presence of declining water table levels in the range of 50 – 150 cm depth. Sorghum depleted up to 22 cm of water from the 0–90 cm root zone which exceeded the available water capacity of the soil (water released between 0.1 and 15 bar). Soil water depletion in the deep water table (125 ± 25 cm) treatment ranged from 17.4 to 21.9 cm of water and was nearly twice that from the shallow water table (75 ± 25 cm) treatment. Tillage treatments did not significantly affect soil water depletion, maximum depth of root penetration and depth distribution of roots. In the deep and shallow water table treatments roots penetrated to a maximum of 90 and 75 cm soil depths, respectively. Root length densities in the shallow water table treatment exceeded those in the deep water table treatment by 90 – 150% in the surface 30-cm soil depth. Early season seedling root extension in the previously puddled soil was faster in the tilled treatment and reached 30-cm depth 20 days after sowing compared to 10-cm depth in the no-tillage treatment. Tillage and water table treatments did not significantly affect grain and dry matter yield. This study indicates that sorghum may be successfully grown without tillage after wetland rice where soil water availability is not constrained by water table depth. "

Two field experiments were carried out in 1983 and 1984 to evaluate the performance of different rice genotypes planted to a slope of an inland valley in western Nigeria. The experimental slope was divided into four zones based on the depth of ground water-table and its fluctuation. Drought stress, blast and grain discoloration are major constraints to rice in Zone I where the ground water-table nerver rises to above 60 cm below soil surface, and upland genotypes are invariably outyielded by lowland ones. In Zones \{III\} and \{IV\} where ground water never drops below 40 cm below surface, rice never showed drought-stress symptoms and lowland genotypes outyielded upland ones. In Zone II, where ground watertable fluctuated between 20 and 80 cm below surface, no clear difference in performance could be drawn between the two genotypical groups. Yields of rice ranged from 0 to 200, 20 to 250, 190 to 600, and 110 to 400 g/m2, respectively, in Zones I, II, III, and IV. "

Grain yields obtained when there were two or three weedings were similar. Three weedings and a pre-emergence application of pendimethalin plus hand weeding kept the rice crop free until harvest. This enabled the early establishment of the maize (Zea mays L.) crop using zero tillage. The other weeding treatments required the usual ploughing and harrowing operations to establish the maize crop. Zero tillage could be used for cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] establishment provided that there were at least two weeding operations in maize. In an upland rice-maize-cowpea cropping sequence, pre-emergence application of pendimethalin plus hand weeding in upland rice, zero tillage for maize establishment, and spot weeding at 14 days after emergence (DAE) in maize, and zero-tillage establishment for cowpea plus hoe weeding at 14 \{DAE\} resulted in the lowest cost for weed control and the highest net return and highest marginal benefit-cost ratio.

Redistribution of seedlings and manual weeding were used to improve plant stand and soil physical properties in addition to reducing weeds. Farmers' dry-seeding systems did not necessarily reduce labor, but could increase cropping intensity, result in stable yields using low material inputs, or distribute labor demands where some fields are dry seeded and others transplanted.

The theory is applied to the problem of \{NH3\} loss from lowland rice-field flood water as influenced by the simultaneous loss fo CO2. It uses a two-thin-layer model of the interface and describes the diffusion and reaction of gases and dissolved species, and of acids and bases that move in response to the pH changes that result from gas diffusion and reaction. Reaction kinetics are allowed for. In the rice-field system, \{NH3\} loss tends to make the solution more acidic, whereas \{CO2\} loss makes it more alkaline. Over the range of conditions found in rice fields, \{NH3\} loss may be limited by diffusion in both air and solution; \{CO2\} loss is always limited by diffusion in solution. When the equilibration between \{CO2\} species is uncatalysed, acidification resulting from \{NH3\} loss dominates alkalinization resulting from \{CO2\} loss, and the pH at the air-water boundary may be as much as one unit lower than that in the bulk solution. But in the presence of carbonic anhydrase, the situation is reversed and the boundary pH may be considerably greater than that in the bulk, especially at high \{CO2\} pressures. "

Decreasing Ks improved the profile moisture retention in sandy loam soil, but had no effect on moisture regime in clay soils with a shallow water table (0–30 cm deep) or in clay loam under high climatic water balance (W &gt; 100 cm). As a result, tillage had no effect on grain yield in clay soils with a shallow water table or in clay loam soil under high climatic water balance. In sandy loam, however, thorough puddling significantly increased grain production. It was concluded that tillage is not required to alleviate soil physical limitations in rainfed lowland rice production in low permeable soils under an adequate climatic water balance. Wet tillage is a prerequisite for rice productivity in medium- to coarse-textured soils in drought-prone environments, although thorough puddling showed no advantage over shallow puddling. "

Cultural methods that are applicable to traditional rice transplanting are often successful in reducing snail damage to rice. However, high labor and irrigation costs associated with transplanting highlight the need to develop modern rice crop establishment methods to replace traditional, labor-intensive methods. This study examined four broad categories of rice crop establishment for their vulnerability to apple snail damage. Seedlings from dapog nurseries and wet-direct seeding were highly vulnerable to damage and produced no grain in snail-infested ponds in the Philippines. Rice transplanted from dry bed nurseries at 21 days after sowing (DAS) had high mortality (85%) and consequently low yields. In contrast, seedling broadcasting (21 DAS) significantly reduced rice vulnerability (22% seedling mortality) to snail damage compared to all other methods and resulted in the highest grain yields per plot in our experiments. We attribute lower vulnerability to snail damage and successful stand development to reduced transplanting shock at the time of seedling broadcasting and to the generally good condition of seedlings even after 21 days in polyvinyl chloride trays. We suggest that seedling broadcasting be considered as a crop establishment method with potential to sustainably manage apple snails in irrigated rice. "

For most A. pinnata strains (except three) and an A. mexicana strain the maximum weekly relative growth rate was higher at 33°C than at 22°C, but not for A. filiculoides and A. caroliniana. The highest value of maximum relative growth rate corresponded to 1.9 doubling days and in most strains this occurred in the first week. As the plants grew, the growth rate slowed down more severely at higher temperatures. The maximum biomass was higher at 22°C than at 33°C in all strains. At 22°C, it took 30–50 days to attain maximum biomass and the highest value was 14 g N m−2 or 320 g dry m−2 by A. caroliniana, followed by 12 g N m−2 or 290 g dry wt. m−2 by one strain of A. filiculoides. At 29°C, the maximum biomass was attained in 20–35 days. The highest value was 6.3 g N m−2 or 154 g dry wt. m−2 by A. caroliniana. At 33°C, most A. pinnata strains gave a maximum biomass of less than 4 g N m−2 after 13–23 days, while some strains grew up to 30 days, resulting in a higher maximum biomass. The highest maximum biomass at 33°C was 5.5 g N m−2 or 140 g m−2 dry wt. by A. pinnata from Cheng Mai while the maximum biomass of A. filiculoides and A. caroliniana was much less. Azolla filiculoides requires lower temperature than other species for its growth. Azolla pinnata has the best tolerance to high temperatures among the four species. Azolla mexicana could not be discriminated from A. pinnata in its response to temperature. Azolla caroliniana may keep an intermediate position between A. filiculoides and A. pinnata in temperature response. The formation of ammonia in the medium was examined and it occurred mostly under stationary growth conditions, but, at 33°C, some strains of A. pinnata and A. mexicana released or formed ammonia at 0.3–0.8 μg N ml−1 per week during their initial exponential growth stage.

This paper identifies three distinct phases in the history of the market based on trends in the level and stability of production and the trade orientation of major exporters. The level and stability of production increased steadily over the entire period. Exporters have generally been active in the world market, with the period 1965–1981 being an important exception. Since the mid-1980s, prices have been low and quite stable, and the patterns identified in the paper suggest that prices will remain so in the future. The policy implication is that Asian rice importers can afford to rely more on the world market than was warranted in the past. "

The analysis was conducted in four steps: (1) the time-dependent, quantitative information pertaining to pests (diseases, insects, and weeds) was integrated over crop development to account for injuries to the crop; (2) classes reflecting the various distribution frequencies were developed, and the quantitative information was categorized accordingly; (3) seven patterns of cropping practices (PR) and seven types of pest profiles (PE) were characterized from two independent cluster analyses using a chi-square distance; (4) two contingency tables, yield by cropping practices (Y × PR) and yield by pest profile (Y × PE), were built and jointly submitted to correspondence analysis. Two first axes accounted for 52·2% and 25·5% of total inertia, and were used to interpret the relationships among PR, PE, and yield. A path of increasing yield levels was associated with increasingly favourable production situations, and was opposed to the accumulation of pest injuries. Cropping season, date of establishment, fertilizer input, and weed control practices were identified among the components that drive production levels. Correspondences of specific key pests, or key pest combinations, with particular production levels and patterns of cropping practices were identified. The analysis suggested that weeds and stemborers may contribute much to yield reduction. Sheath blight was closely associated with the highest yields, suggesting that (1) the disease did not contribute to any yield reduction, and/or (2) it is particularly enhanced in potentially high-yielding crops. In the latter case, control of sheath blight might result in even higher yields. "

Prior to about 1970, much emphasis was placed on the development of concepts and modeling techniques; in the 1970s and early 1980s, a series of pest simulation models for key pests was developed; and, in the late 1980s, some crop and socio-economic factors were incorporated to develop decision-aids for farmers and extensionists. Significant advances have been made in methodology at three levels—Level 1 on pest constraint characterization and pest management domain definition, Level 2 on quantitative and qualitative descriptions of the pest-crop-ecosystem interfaces, and Level 3 on the development of specific tools for applying systems techniques in pest management. The three levels are interlinked, as shown in several crop-pest ecosystems such as potato pests in the Mid-Western USA, groundnut diseases in West Africa, and rice pests in Tropical Asia. Analysis of pest profiles over time, resulting in the characterization of relationships among components of a system and improved system definition, has resulted in more focussed analysis of sub-systems. Pest simulation models commonly simulate the dynamics of single diseases or insects as they are affected by the host and physical environment. Pest or pest-crop models find little application for pest management unless they are used within the context of the socio-economic factors influencing the considered system and are adapted to the application domain. This has been accomplished in several ways. Simplified pest models or simplified decision rules from crop-pest models with economic values assigned to their outputs have been used for managing several pathosystems. Predictive models have been used to define zones of equivalent pest risk to guide extrapolation of pest management technology. from key sites to a broader area, and to deploy host plant resistance. For agricultural development and, more specifically, for an accelerated adoption of the systems approach in pest management, a toolkit may have to be developed to reduce the lag time between generation of global principles and development of site-specific management tactics and strategies.

Several cellular thermosensors are reported in plants and understanding their mode of operation in a potentially coordinated framework continues to be a persistent challenge. Despite growing insight into the molecular control of thermal perception, physiological significance of plant thermal responses under a complex interaction with other environmental cues is largely unaddressed. Plant thermal perception and signaling could be similar across growth habits such as herbaceous to perennial woody species while developmental transitions such as vegetative to reproductive stage, influenced by their immediate microclimate, are generally altered across growth habits. The overall aim is to connect the knowledge gained with thermal perception and the signaling that drives plant responses, with major focus on the latter. "

We conducted experiments to examine the effects of seedbed seed-density on hill survival in snail-infested paddy fields in the Philippines and to examine the interactions between seedbed seed-density and other cultural methods (delayed transplanting, 3 seedlings per hill and hand-picking). Seedbed seed-density determined seedling weight and stem thickness at the time of transplanting. Hill survival was highest where cultural methods (delayed transplanting and 3 seedlings per hill) were combined with low seed-density seedbeds (60–120 g m−2). Furthermore, reduced seedbed seed-density was directly related to increased hill biomass in field plots 32 days after transplanting. Hand-picking of snails together with delayed transplanting and 3 seedlings per hill eliminated hill mortality due to snail herbivory. Farmers adopting cultural snail control methods, but without adhering to low seedbed seed-densities risk increased losses due to snails because of poor quality seedlings. We suggest that seedbed seed-densities should not exceed 120 g m−2 with better results at even lower densities. "

The treatments included: three water regimes, viz., Shallow continuous ponding throughout the crop growth, ponding until panicle initiation and then saturated soil, and saturated soil throughout, two tillage intensities, viz, one plowings+two harrowings, and two plowings+two harrowings and three herbicide levels, viz. pretilachlor @ 0.30 kg a.i/ha, pretilachlor @ 0.15 kg a.i./ha, and no herbicide.

In general, increase in tillage intensity did not produce significant effects on all the weed classes, but, sporadic reduction in some species was noticed. Full-and half-doses of herbicide were equally effective in reducing the number, density and biomass of different species, but no herbicide treatment encouraged almost all species to grow.

Studies from the tropical regions on possible effects of tillage and water control on weed emergence and growth in the presence and absence of herbicides have yielded conflicting results due to site specificity. Surface ponding of water in rice (Oryza sativa L.) reduces weed emergence and growth with variable degrees of success depending upon water depth, nature of weed species and time of ponding. Most studies, however, indicate that shallow ponding for the first few weeks after planting can effectively suppress weeds. Integration of herbicide in a weed control program makes proper water management more critical. However, good water control is still lacking in most parts of tropical Asia. Investigations of various tillage intensities have revealed that invariably zero tilled soils have more weed population compared with those conventionally tilledin the absence of herbicides. Tillage may bury some weed seeds and expose others that were once deeply buried. Also, repeated tillage will uproot and bury the already germinated weeds. In a diverse weed community situation weed control is effectively achieved if tillage is combined with herbicide application, because tillage is known to enhance herbicide effectiveness. There are reports of identical rice yields being obtained under saturated and flooded water regimes, and zero and conventionally tilled soils. However, effective weed control is required for obtaining such results. Investigations of interactions of tillage intensities and water regimes with weed populations have not been adequately addressed, as most studies have been confined to quantifying competition factors in terms of critical weed population thresholds. Some studies have attempted to explain the nature of competition and its mechanisms. Of the many weed species reported to grow in rice fields, only few actually compete with rice. Generally there are only three to four weed species which are economically important for rice farmers in the tropics. It is these weeds which should be essentially controlled, although total weed control is preferred by most rice farmers. Continuous use of the same control measure in some areas may contribute to a buildup of some tolerant weed species which are difficult to control. Therefore, for effective and sustained weed control, integrated weed management with proper tillage and water control is needed. "

This study is the first attempt to use \{ORYZA2000\} for the selection of drought-resistant rice genotypes, and it provides a ‘virtual’ platform for a large number of environmental trials. In a case study, \{ORYZA2000\} results from two field experiments in two environments were extrapolated to 669 environments in South Asia. For these two field experiments, the differences between simulated and field-measured grain yield and total above-ground biomass for all the 69 genotypes were within the standard deviations of the field measurements. This result confirmed that \{ORYZA2000\} has the capability to correctly represent the growth and yield of rice genotypes under different environments. Using simulation outputs for 69 genotypes in 669 environments, the performance of these genotypes was evaluated for rainfed conditions with various drought stress. With the increase in the number of environments, the effect of the genotype on phenotypic performances across environments become much more significant than that of the effects of environment and genotype–environment interactions, and heritability was also increased. Desirable rice genotypes could then be selected by breeders based on the expected yield and adaptability to various environments generated by the model. The evaluation of rice genotypic performance by ORYZA2000, as ‘virtual’ multiple-environment trials, can improve the reliability of selected genotypes for a wide range of environments and enhance efficiency in terms of time consumption and cost effectiveness of the breeding process.

Around 0.12 million ha of maize are grown in rice–maize (R–M) systems, mostly situated in the lowlands, and the area of this system is growing fast. The objectives of this study were to describe the targeted cropping system, to test several management options that could help to optimize it and reduce the production risk, and to develop a simple nutrient balance as a sustainability indicator. For this, we conducted participatory on-farm trials in Pangasinan province, where about 33,600 ha of yellow maize are grown, mostly in R–M systems. Combined grain yields of the system reached 14 t ha−1 in the first year and 21 t ha−1 in the second year, depending on the treatment. Yield differences were mostly due to climate-induced stresses in the first year and very favorable conditions in the second year. Varietal choice in rice was an option to reduce production losses by selecting the variety according to average field-specific characteristics (drought-prone, favorable, flood-prone). Balanced fertilizer applications reduced stress-dependent rice yield losses considerably, and helped to maximize grain yield in the favorable season. The rice fertilizer treatment without any application caused lower yields in the subsequent maize crop but the effect was not significant. No effects of field topography on soil characteristics or on grain yields of rice or maize were detected. The nutrient balance indicated the considerable danger of soil nutrient mining in this cropping system, which could aggravate possible trends of declining soil organic matter concentrations in R–M systems that have been shown in previous studies. We concluded that a combination of adjusted management components can reduce production risk and optimize system productivity. To maintain system productivity, it seems most promising to combine different management elements, including balanced \{NPK\} fertilizer rates with limited \{PK\} mining, recycling of waste products from residue use on the farm as much as possible, and only limited removal of residues from the fields.

abstract = "Abstract Rice (Oryza sativa L.), the major staple food crop of the world, faces a severe threat from widespread drought. The development of drought-tolerant rice varieties is considered a feasible option to counteract drought stress. The screening of rice germplasm under drought and its characterization at the morphological, genetic, and molecular levels revealed the existence of genetic variation for drought tolerance within the rice gene pool. The improvements made in managed drought screening and selection for grain yield under drought have significantly contributed to progress in drought breeding programs. The availability of rice genome sequence information, genome-wide molecular markers, and low-cost genotyping platforms now makes it possible to routinely apply marker-assisted breeding approaches to improve grain yield under drought. Grain yield \{QTLs\} with a large and consistent effect under drought have been indentified and successfully pyramided in popular rice mega-varieties. Various rice functional genomics resources, databases, tools, and recent advances in “-omics” are facilitating the characterization of genes and pathways involved in drought tolerance, providing the basis for candidate gene identification and allele mining. The transgenic approach is successful in generating drought tolerance in rice under controlled conditions, but field-level testing is necessary. Genomics-assisted drought breeding approaches hold great promise, but a well-planned integration with standardized phenotyping is highly essential to exploit their full potential. "

abstract = "Abstract Rice (Oryza sativa L.), a staple food for more than half of the world population, is commonly grown by transplanting seedlings into puddled soil (wet tillage) in Asia. This production system is labor-, water-, and energy-intensive and is becoming less profitable as these resources are becoming increasingly scarce. It also deteriorates the physical properties of soil, adversely affects the performance of succeeding upland crops, and contributes to methane emissions. These factors demand a major shift from puddled transplanting to direct seeding of rice (DSR) in irrigated rice ecosystems. Direct seeding (especially wet seeding) is widely adopted in some and is spreading to other Asian countries. However, combining dry seeding (Dry-DSR) with zero/reduced tillage (e.g., conservation agriculture (CA)) is gaining momentum as a pathway to address rising water and labor scarcity, and to enhance system sustainability. Published studies show various benefits from direct seeding compared with puddled transplanting, which typically include (1) similar yields; (2) savings in irrigation water, labor, and production costs; (3) higher net economic returns; and (4) a reduction in methane emissions. Despite these benefits, the yields have been variable in some regions, especially with dry seeding combined with reduced/zero tillage due to (1) uneven and poor crop stand, (2) poor weed control, (3) higher spikelet sterility, (4) crop lodging, and (5) poor knowledge of water and nutrient management. In addition, rice varieties currently used for \{DSR\} are primarily selected and bred for puddled transplanted rice. Risks associated with a shift from puddled transplanting to \{DSR\} include (1) a shift toward hard-to-control weed flora, (2) development of herbicide resistance in weeds, (3) evolution of weedy rice, (4) increases in soil-borne pathogens such as nematodes, (5) higher emissions of nitrous oxide—a potent greenhouse gas , and (6) nutrient disorders, especially N and micronutrients. The objectives of this chapter are to review (1) drivers of the shift from puddled transplanting to DSR; (2) overall crop performance, including resource-use efficiencies of DSR; and (3) lessons from countries where \{DSR\} has already been widely adopted. Based on the existing evidence, we present an integrated package of technologies for Dry-DSR, including the identification of rice traits associated with the attainment of optimum grain yield with Dry-DSR.

This is because all the modern high-yielding rice varieties are sensitive to complete submergence. A major quantitative trait locus (QTL), SUB1, associated with submergence tolerance, was mapped on chromosome 9 and recently bred into popular rainfed lowland rice varieties sensitive of complete submergence, using marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC). Here, we assessed the impact of introgressing \{SUB1\} into three rice varieties popular in farmers’ fields of South and Southeast Asia, Swarna, Sambha Mahsuri, and IR64, under control conditions as well as following submergence in the field. Under control conditions, no differences were observed between Sub1 introgression lines and their recurrent parents in grain yield or quality aspects. Submergence substantially delayed flowering and maturity, and reduced grain yield, shoot biomass, harvest index, and yield components across cultivars. The reduction in yield was more drastic in the sensitive varieties, particularly when submerged for longer duration (17 d). The significant decline in grain yield was mainly attributed to reductions in grain filling, number of grains per panicle, and grain weight. The \{SUB1\} \{QTL\} is effective in conferring tolerance of submergence for about 12–17 d, depending on floodwater conditions. Sub1 introgression lines showed a yield advantage of up to 3.8 t ha−1 and slightly better grain quality after submergence compared with their parents. Apparently, the introgression of \{SUB1\} into popular varieties did not have any negative impact on their performance under control conditions but considerably enhanced their yield and grain quality following short-term submergence.

In less intensive areas, opportunities exist for further increasing fertilizer use by reducing risk through cultivar improvement and better management. As opposed to simple ‘blanket’ recommendations, improved efficiency requires conditional ‘if-then’ types of rules. Such recommendations, to be acceptable to farmers, should not only be cost-efficient, but must also fit into the farmers' knowledge systems and provide them with enough flexibility for experimentation and learning. In addition to technologies, policy reforms such as the removal of fertilizer subsidies are needed to make nutrient-efficient practices economically profitable to farmers. "

Although no S. furcifera-resistant commercial cultivars have been released, advanced breeding lines with resistance to S. furcifera and other major insect pests have been developed. "

The \{ANI\} effect was studied in a field experiment with transplanted and direct seeded flooded rice, comparing three methods of N-application (broadcast and incorporation of prilled urea ; band placement of urea solution ; and point placement of urea supergranules). ANI's for broadcast and incorporation treatments were generally greater than those for band and point placement treatments. The values for \{NRF\} calculated by the isotope-dilution method were lower than those of the apparent N-recovery fracton (ARF) as calculated by the difference method. Most of the discrepancy between plant nitrogen recoveries estimated by the isotope-dilution and the difference method could be explained by fertilizer losses and by pool-substitution, which means that fertilizer N stands proxy for soil N.

Early plant \{DM\} patterns are characterized by a decline in total (kernel+seedling) \{DM\} during heterotrophy, and then an increase into exponential growth after \{CO2\} assimilation (autotrophy) begins. Data for a tropical japonica variety were used for qualitative comparisons of observed and predicted kernel and total DM. The published version of \{DSRICE1\} was sequentially modified to (1) subtract respiration costs from mobilized reserves, (2) use a constant mobilization rate, (3) use the same partitioning fractions (PF) for both reserves and assimilates, and (4) assess the effects of leaching losses. After the first modification, the model reproduced observed \{DM\} patterns, and setting a constant mobilization rate allowed complete use of reserves. Using consistent \{PF\} values for both assimilates and reserves was justified because it simplified the model and had only slight effects on predictions. Predicted mobilization efficiencies (ME; g seedling g−1 seed) were greater than measured values, but were improved by accounting for leaching losses. In sensitivity analyses, six seed-related parameters had significant effects on seedling \{DM\} at 14 days after seeding (DAS), but none significantly affected mature \{DM\} or yields. In other tests, the effects of four traits on seedling growth were assessed over their likely empirical ranges. The start of \{CO2\} assimilation (DAS) had the greatest effect, followed by the start of mobilization and seed mass. Mobilization rate had the smallest effect over its likely range. Finally, simulated and measured early \{PF\} values were significantly different, particularly for root partitioning. Predicted \{DM\} to 18 \{DAS\} using three sets of \{PF\} values also differed, although more for total \{DM\} per plant than for some plant parts. Using the measured \{PF\} values will likely improve the model. It was also demonstrated that simulating reserve mobilization allows dynamic responses to variation in environmental and cultural inputs that may have critical effects on later growth. Thus, the calibration of parameters such as initial \{DM\} and leaf area required in other models may be avoided. Most important, using a more process-based approach in \{DSRICE1\} facilitates (or forces) realistic linkages between seedling growth and environment by management interactions, which can improve analyses of crop and weed establishment and management strategies.

Tolerances to salinity and alkalinity were positively associated, saline-tolerant germplasm often being tolerant of alkalinity and vice versa. Tolerances to salinity and Zn deficiency were also positively associated. However, tolerances to salinity and P deficiency were negatively associated for scores from greenhouse screening in which only the internal P efficiency of the plants was assessed, and not associated for scores from field screening. Tolerance for salinity and Fe toxicity was negatively associated. Salinity and peat soils were positively associated, probably because of tolerance to Zn deficiency, which is common to both. It is concluded that multiple tolerance for some combinations of stresses exists. But unless selected in breeding programs, tolerances may be lost over time. To preserve tolerance to combinations of stresses, ready means of identifying tolerances to the individual stresses are required. "

Single rice plants were grown in pots with and without nitrogen fertilizer, surrounded by six plants of either barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli), in trials 1 and 2, or themselves, in trial 3. Growth traits were measured weekly or in harvests at 21 and 48 days after seeding (DAS). Significant differences amongst cvs were found for nearly every response variable, and the most productive cvs lacked uniform growth traits. Total dry mass (DM) was primarily a function of leaf area (LA, m−2 per plant), but height growth rates (HGRs, m per day) at 7 and 21 \{DAS\} and tillering ability were also consistently important. Non-destructively measured traits, such as tillering, and \{HGRs\} at 7 and 21 DAS, accounted for at least 75% of the variation in \{DM\} across all trials. Overall, rice cv growth in competition depended on multiple traits, and in particular was not simply a function of specific leaf area (SLA, m2 g−1 leaf). Early vigor was highly repeatable in both competition and monoculture trials, indicating that it may be used to discriminate between more and less competitive cvs even in monoculture. Therefore, screening lines in standard nurseries for competitiveness against weeds seems possible using non-destructive scoring of plant cover, very early heights (i.e., vigor), tillering ability, and early HGRs.

Brewer's rice is used as an ingredient in beer making and as starting material for starch manufacture. Sodium hydroxide is used for purifying milled rice starch because at least 80% of the protein of milled rice is alkali-soluble protein. The cooking and eating quality of milled rice is determined by the properties of its starch. The major determinant of water absorption, volume expansion, and dissolved solids during cooking and of color, gloss, stickiness, and softness of cooked rice is its amylose content. Differences in eating quality exist among varieties of similar amylose content that are related to other quality factors, such as final \{BEPT\} and gel consistency. The widespread use of rice starch is limited by its higher price relative to corn, wheat, and potato starches. Rice starch is used as (1) a cosmetic dusting powder, (2) a laundry stiffening agent in the cold-starching of fabrics, and (3) a custard or pudding starch. The non-food applications take advantage of the small size of the rice starch granules. "

It summarizes information on the physical, physicochemical, and biochemical processes relevant to nitrogen transformations and to improving fertilizer nitrogen efficiency in wetland soils. Wetland soils differ markedly from well-drained dryland soils. The characteristics of the wetland rice soils have been studied and reported. Some dynamic aspects of the wetland rice soils that are pertinent to nitrogen transformations are summarized as retardation of gaseous exchange between flooded soil and atmosphere. In the wetland rice soil, a reduced plow layer is sandwiched between a thin oxidized surface soil layer and a partly oxidized subsurface soil layer. Within the reduced soil layer, in which most of rice roots proliferate and derive nitrogen, is a complex mosaic consisting of aerobic and anaerobic microsystems. Flooding soil results in the accumulation of ammonium, the instability of nitrate, and a lowered nitrogen requirement for organic matter decomposition. Flooding also causes inefficient utilization of applied nitrogen. Ammoniacal nitrogen is subject to fixation by clays, loss by volatilization, leaching, runoff, seepage, and nitrification followed by loss through denitrification. "

It is noted that a particular range, duration, or concentration of an environmental factor, at a sensitive stage of plant development, induces male sterility, whereas some other range, duration, or concentration of an environmental factor at the sensitive stage induces fertility in plants.

A policy of pure price stabilization for rice, without consistent protection (either subsidization or taxation), can help to create the macroeconomic stability that is essential for sustained rapid economic growth by increasing the quantity and efficiency of investment throughout the economy. Pure price stabilization can also generate significant equity gains by protecting poor consumers and farmers from sharp fluctuations in prices. While domestic commodity price stabilization schemes have a checkered history around the world, the experience of Asian countries in stabilizing rice prices offers more scope for optimism. Asian governments have been generally successful in stabilizing rice prices, and there are several instances where this has been accomplished without sustained protection of either consumers or farmers. However, there is room for improved stabilization mechanisms that would lower the costs of intervention. "

This correlation improved to about r2 = 0·85 using \{RE\} of (embryos plus coleoptiles) over 0-3 d, or coleoptiles at 3 d after anoxia. Coleoptile growth of individual seeds was usually poorly correlated to \{RE\} in these cultivars at 2-3 d after anoxia.

IR42) were approximately 300 and 100 mol m-3 respectively when seeds were grown 3 d in stagnant agar, however 92% of the ethanol in seeds diffused into the external medium when solutions were mixed for 5-10 s. Coleoptile growth under anoxia was related to rates of ethanol synthesis (RE) in different treatments; there was greater coleoptile growth and \{RE\} for seeds in \{N2\} flushed solutions than in stagnant deoxygenated agar. Coleoptile growth of individual seeds was also related to the \{RE\} of each seed at 2-3 d after anoxia (r2 = 0·46). Analysis of different tissues was important in evaluating growth and metabolism of coleoptiles. Although the coleoptile only accounted for 0·7% of seed dry weight at 3 d after anoxia, it contained 21% of the ethanol produced by rice seeds. There were also three-fold higher rates of \{RE\} on a fresh weight basis in expanding tissues in the base of the coleoptile relative to the elongated tissues at the apex. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of environmental conditions used to impose anoxia, quantification of \{RE\} in specific tissues and the possibility that under stagnant conditions high ethanol concentrations in tissues may limit \{RE\} and coleoptile growth.

We furthermore elaborate on the interconnections of elevated amounts of protein and a balanced composition of essential amino acids. The importance of a nutritious aleurone layer and its role in lipid storage and micronutrient composition is discussed briefly in the context of brown rice benefits.

Hydrodynamic diameters of starch molecules were found to change with solvent conditions. The component starches in the rice varieties studied had similar sizes in pure water (between 125 and 235 nm), but showed different expansion behaviour with changes in salt concentration, with addition of urea (which disrupts hydrogen bonding) and with the addition of 1-butanol (which reduces solvent polarity). Some starches showed a gradually increasing size with increasing [NaCl], while others showed an initial steep increase followed by more gradual behaviour. The size distributions from \{DLS\} indicated two (and possibly three) components at about 100 and 1000 nm. The larger component was largely responsible for the expansion with added salt, an effect which is ascribed to the greater ability of larger chains to expand. Chain length distributions (CLD) of debranched starch from the same samples were examined by capillary electrophoresis (CE) for correlation with the expansion behaviour obtained by DLS. The ratio of shorter to longer chains partly correlated with the classes of expansion behaviour. The data suggest that the expansion behaviour is sensitive to the branching structure (connectivity) as well as to the distribution of the lengths of the branches. "

The population of lines was phenotyped for \{GY\} and ten yield related traits under eight environments of three locations including Jiangxi, and Sichuan in China, and six season (2) and nitrogen rate (3) combinations in \{IRRI\} and genotyped using 46 markers tightly linked to the 39 target genes/QTL and 53 \{SSR\} markers evenly distributed on the genome. Using the 53 random \{SSR\} markers identified two major subpopulations. Association analyses were separately carried out for the whole population and the two subpopulations. All the 39 target genes/QTL were associated with two or more measured traits including traits not previously reported. \{GW6\} and Gn1a were associated with nine and eight traits, respectively.

The current panel of indica breeding lines were divided into two subpopulations by three analytical methods including STRUCTURE, principal component analysis (PCA) and neighbour joining (NJ) tree. \{STRUCTURE\} and \{PCA\} gave the same classification of genotypes while the \{NJ\} tree results are slight difference in assigning genotypes to subpopulation from \{STRCUTURE\} and PCA. Wide variation was observed for all the 11 traits in the whole panel and the two subpopulations inferred by \{STRUCTURE\} analysis. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis showed that \{LD\} decay varied across the chromosomes and average pairwise squared correlation coefficient (r2) dropped to half of its maximum value (r2 = 0.25) within a physical distance of 200 kb in the whole population. A \{MLM\} model controlling both population structure and cryptic relatedness was chosen to identify \{MTA\} for all the 11 tested traits. A total of 452 \{MTA\} that were delineated into 43 \{QTL\} were identified for all traits but PB, SB, and \{SR\} with 39 \{QTL\} being not reported before. Three \{QTL\} on chromosome 6, 9 and 12 were identified for \{GY\} but only in DS2. The numbers of \{QTL\} identified for the remaining traits varied from two to 26. Most of the detected \{QTL\} were found in only one environment. Four \{QTL\} were located in the regions containing genes/QTL previously identified for other related traits. The effects of identified \{QTL\} were relatively small with the highest percentage of phenotypic variance explained by a single \{QTL\} being 9.6%. The identified \{QTL\} are directly relevant to and can be more effectively used in breeding programs. "

Significant variation was observed among the 73 \{DH\} lines for different characters namely; plant height, tiller number, panicle number, panicle length, days to heading, and % seed fertility. For all traits, the phenotypic variance within each \{DH\} line was comparable to the mean phenotypic variance of parents indicating that the plants within lines were uniform and did not exhibit plant-to-plant variation. \{SSR\} analysis of the \{DH\} population showed an expected 1:1 ratio of indica and japonica alleles. It revealed homozygosity for 99.84% of the total marker loci in the 141 lines evaluated suggesting that the AC-derived plants originated from the \{F1\} pollen. Heterozygosity was observed in only 10 \{DH\} lines for one or three marker loci out of 107 polymorphic \{SSR\} markers. Absence of non-parental bands in the \{DH\} lines is indicative of the purity of the \{DH\} lines and that no variation at the \{DNA\} level occurred during the in vitro process.

Like other rice systems, \{WDSR\} is beset by many constraints, foremost of which is weed infestation. Surveys were conducted for two consecutive dry seasons (2012 and 2013) among farmers and/or households (FH) in these three districts to document the cultural practices used and the accompanying production constraints in WDSR. The results showed seeding rates of up to 100–300 kg ha−1, using farmers' own seed stock. Farmers broadcast pre-germinated seeds manually because of limited (or no) access to drum seeders. The most important production constraint identified was severe weed infestation, particularly by grass species, such as Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv., Leptochloa chinensis (L.) Nees, O. sativa L. (as volunteers from previous seasons), and O. sativa f. spontanea or weedy rice. Most farmers were aware of the presence of weedy rice in their fields and the damage it does to the crop. They enumerated numerous strategies to improve current practices to manage weeds. Despite the constraints, yield across the sites for two years ranged from 6.27 to 8.27 t ha−1, which may be considered higher than those obtained from other rice ecosystems across Asia. This also highlights that there is further scope to increase the rice yield in weedy rice infested fields. "

However, the survival of some of these wild plant species could be threatened because of climate change. We used current and projected future climate data for ∼2055, and a climate envelope species distribution model to predict the impact of climate change on the wild relatives of peanut (Arachis), potato (Solanum) and cowpea (Vigna). We considered three migrational scenarios for modeling the range shifts (unlimited, limited, and no migration). Climate change strongly affected all taxa, with an estimated 16–22% (depending on migration scenario) of these species predicted to go extinct and most species losing over 50% of their range size. Moreover, for many species, the suitable areas become highly fragmented. Arachis were the most affected group, with 24–31 (depending on the migration scenario) of 51 species projected to go extinct and their distribution area on average reduced by 85–94%, depending on the migration scenario, over the next 50 years. The number of patches was predicted to decrease by 19% under the no migration scenario or increase by 4% assuming unlimited migration. Patch size decreased by 55–60%. For Solanum, 7 (no migration) to 13 (unlimited migration) of 108 species were predicted to go extinct, and their range sizes were reduced by approximately 38–69%. The number of patches was predicted to decrease by 34% (no migration) or increase 7% (unlimited migration) and patch size decreased by 20 (unlimited migration) to 37% (no migration). In terms of species extinction, Vigna was the least affected of the three groups, losing no species (unlimited migration) to 2 species (no migration) of the 48 species in the genus. The mean range size was predicted to decrease by 65% (no migration) or increase 8% (unlimited migration), with 8–41 of the 48 species losing more than 50% of their current geographic range. The number of Vigna patches increased by 12–115%, but the size of those patches shrunk by 51–59%. Our results suggest that there is an urgent need to identify and effectively conserve crop wild relatives that are at risk from climate change. While increased habitat conservation will be important to conserve most species, those that are predicted to undergo strong range size reductions should be a priority for collection and inclusion in genebanks.

Grain yield and plant nutrient accumulation in above-ground plant dry matter (DM) were measured at physiological maturity of rice (n ∼ 2000) in on-station and on-farm experiments in six Asian countries between 1995 and 1997. These data were used to model the nutrient requirements for yields up to 11 t ha−1 using the \{QUEFTS\} (Quantitative Evaluation of the Fertility of Tropical Soils) approach. The model required the estimation of two borderlines describing the minimum and maximum internal efficiencies (IE, kg grain per kg nutrient in plant DM), which were estimated at 42 and 96 kg grain kg−1 N, 206 and 622 kg grain kg−1 P and 36 and 115 kg grain kg−1 K, respectively. The model predicted a linear increase in grain yield if nutrients are taken up in balanced amounts of 14.7 kg N, 2.6 kg P and 14.5 kg K per 1000 kg of grain until yield targets reached ca. 70–80% of the climate-adjusted potential yield (Ymax). The corresponding \{IEs\} were 68 kg grain kg−1 N, 385 kg grain kg−1 P and 69 kg grain kg−1 K for a balanced nutrition. The model predicted a decrease in \{IEs\} when yield targets approached Ymax. The derived borderlines are valid for current modern, high-yielding indica cultivars with a harvest index of 0.50 kg kg−1 and can be used for all methods of crop establishment. Only Ymax is required as site- or season-specific information when estimating nutrient requirements for a yield target making the model applicable for all irrigated lowlands in South- and Southeast Asia. Predicted \{IEs\} were greater than actual \{IEs\} measured in more than 200 farmers' fields (n ∼ 700), the latter averaging 59 kg grain kg−1 N (27–100 kg kg−1), 354 kg grain kg−1 P (158–1069 kg kg−1), and 64 kg grain kg−1 K (27–179 kg kg−1) with grain yields ranging from 1.5 to 9.9 t ha−1 (mean 5.2 t ha−1).

However, water scarcity arising from competition from other sectors, rainfall variability and climate change increasingly challenges global rice production. One option to adapt to lower water availability is switching from paddy rice to less irrigation intensive upland cropping systems. Such land management change (LMC) is likely to significantly affect ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycling and its greenhouse gas (GHG) balance. This study evaluates how well the ecosystem model LandscapeDNDC is able to simulate observed emissions of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from different tropical cropping rotations, i.e., double- and triple-cropped paddy rice, aerobic rice–paddy rice and maize–paddy rice (rice: O. sativa, maize: Zea mays) and how management changes to rice dominated lowland systems will affect the \{GHG\} balance on short (a few years) and long (several decades) time scales. LandscapeDNDC predicts seasonal emissions of \{CH4\} and \{N2O\} across different cropping rotations (including LMC) with \{R2\} values of 0.85 and 0.78 and average underestimations of 15 and 14%, respectively. In addition to emissions of \{CH4\} and N2O, LandscapeDNDC also captures the long-term development of soil organic carbon (SOC). Soil oxygen status, growth of photosynthetic active aquatic biomass as well as decomposability of harvest residues significantly influence \{SOC\} development. Simulation results demonstrate that short-term \{GHG\} balances after \{LMC\} considerably differ from long-term balances. Simulated total \{GHG\} emissions three years after \{LMC\} are highest for upland crop − paddy rice rotations due to pronounced decomposition of soil organic carbon. In contrast, the total \{GHG\} emissions are highest for double cropping of paddy rice and are clearly dominated by \{CH4\} emissions over a longer period of several decades. Simulation results suggest that approx. 2.8–3.4 t C ha−1 yr−1 residue incorporation after harvest is needed to achieve stable \{SOC\} stocks in mixed upland crop–paddy rice systems after \{LMC\} from double-cropped paddy rice systems.

The hydrological conditions (duration and intensity of flooding) vary with the toposequence position between the fringe and the centre of the valley. Production methods tend to evolve from the currently predominant unbunded plots without external input use, to input-intensive production in bunded plots. Agronomic management interventions co-evolve and may include varietal choice, herbicide use, and mineral N fertilizer application. The response of rice and the associated weeds to such interventions is likely to vary with the prevailing hydrological regime. A 2-year field experiment was conducted in northern Ivory Coast to determine the impact of water regime (plot position in the valley, presence of bunds) and input use (mineral N fertilizer and herbicide) on the productivity (yield and N use efficiency) of traditional and modern rainfed lowland rice cultivars and the biomass and composition of the associated weeds. Installing field bunds reduced seasonal variations in ponded water depth and resulted in a mean increase in rice grain yield of 30–40% (p &lt; 0.005). This increase was associated with a 25% lower cumulative weed biomass and a several-fold increase in the agronomic use efficiency of applied mineral N in bunded than unbunded plots. Under low input management, traditional varieties tended to out-yield modern varieties in unbunded plots. Improved crop management such as herbicide and fertilizer application, and the construction of field bunds was more effective to increase the yield and N use efficiency in the flooded valley centre than in the drought-prone valley fringes. There is a need for site-specific targeting of modern cultivars, land development and improved production methods in the inland valleys of the West African savanna zone. "

abstract = "Abstract Improving the genetic yield potential (YP) of tropical, irrigated rice varieties is a priority objective of rice breeding programs worldwide in the interest of achieving food security and maintaining political stability. But \{YP\} has stagnated at about 10 Mg ha−1 since the Green Revolution. We present a survey of researchers’ current top yields across different environments and countries, experimentally investigate YP-related traits and radiation use efficiency (RUE) of 12 elite materials, and use a simple model to explore traits that would raise the yield ceiling. The survey indicated that maximal grain yield is between 5 and 12 Mg ha−1 depending on radiation during flowering and grain filling. The experiments conducted in several environments in the Philippines indicated that (1) different morphologies in terms of panicle number and size and leaf size lead to similar \{YP\} due to trait–trait compensation, and (2) differences in \{RUE\} are partly attributable to variation in terminal senescence which is strongly environment dependent. Simulations thus focused on post-floral physiological processes, namely dynamics of light interception, carbon assimilation and maintenance burden. Scenarios of different degree of stay-green indicated that terminal senescence is essential to limit N requirements and maintenance burden, but partial stay-green would strongly benefit \{RUE\} and YP, particularly if accompanied with increased leaf photosynthetic capacity. The need to increase pre-floral C and N reserves for grain filling is discussed, resulting in a concept to refine current ideotypes such as IRRI’s New Plant Type and China’s Super Hybrid Rice. In conclusion, current best tropical breeding products do not have higher \{YP\} than some varieties dating 30–40 years, and new concepts are needed in rice breeding. Breeding for such plants should be done under high N inputs. "

abstract = "Abstract Resource scarcity (labor, water, and energy) and high production costs are challenging the sustainability of conventional methods for rice and wheat establishment in Central Asia. Water saving irrigation and conservation agriculture (CA) practices (e.g., dry seeded rice, zero tillage wheat, residue retention) are potential alternative, resource-saving establishment methods. The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) Cropping System Model (CSM) can both be a valuable ex-ante and ex-post tool to evaluate the effects of water saving irrigation and resource saving CA-practices. The CSM-CERES-Rice and CSM-CERES-Wheat models of \{DSSAT\} were evaluated using experimental data from the 2008 to 2010 rice and wheat seasons as monitored in Urgench, the Khorezm region of Uzbekistan for growth, development of these crops, as well as soil mineral nitrogen (N) and volumetric soil moisture content in these cropping systems. Thereafter, the models were used to explore the long-term impact of water saving irrigation and CA-practices on grain yield, soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics, N dynamics, and water balance in a rice–wheat rotation for 39 years starting from 1971. The simulation results showed that the simulated yield of water-seeded rice without residue retention and flood irrigation (WSRF-R0-FI) is likely to remain the highest and constant over 39 years. The simulated yield of dry seeded rice (DSR) with alternate wet and dry (AWD) irrigation and varying levels of residue retention was penalized for the initial years. However, the simulated rice yield increased after 13 years of CA-practices and continued to increase for the remaining years. Wheat did not experience a yield penalty for any of the treatments and simulated yield increased over time across all CA-practices based treatments. In the long-term, the effect of tillage methods and different residue levels for both rice and wheat were apparent in terms of grain yield and \{SOC\} build up. The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that \{WSR\} using \{AWD\} irrigation with puddling (WSRF-R0-AWD-Puddled) could give equivalent yield with that of WSRF-R0-FI and that irrigation water for rice could be reduced from 5435 mm to 2161 mm (or by 60%). Deep placement of urea in \{DSR\} (CT-DSR-AWD-DPUS) has the potential to increase yields of \{DSR\} by about 0.5 t ha−1. Despite the huge water saving potential through the adoption of water saving \{AWD\} irrigation in DSR, a major challenge will be to prevent N losses. Substantial amounts of N losses through leaching, immobilization by residue mulch, combined with gaseous losses through volatilization and denitrification are the major causes for the lower simulated yield of rice for the \{AWD\} treatments. During the rice season, the implementation of water saving irrigation can improve water use efficiency by reducing percolation and seepage losses, which is an option in particular for WSRF-R0-FI. For both crops, the water use efficiency can be improved by lowering evaporation losses e.g. through residue retention on the soil surface. The creation of a sub-surface hard pan (puddling) and deep placement of urea super granules/pellet (DPUS) fertilizer could be the key for water saving and better yields of rice. Because CA-practices require almost three times less irrigation water than conventional method, and provide a long-term positive impact on grain yields of both crops, the CA-practices should be considered for double, no-till, rice–wheat cropping systems in the irrigated semi-arid drylands of Central Asia.

To quantify the single and combined effect of these biological constraints on rice yields, and to investigate whether weeds attract birds and thereby contribute to increased bird damage, a three-year factorial experiment was set-up in the Senegal River Valley. We tested two management factors (bird and weed management), each with two levels (‘complete’ and ‘absent’), and one crop cycle factor also with two levels (Sahel 202, a medium-cycle and Sahel 108, a short-cycle rice cultivar). Season-long competition from weeds resulted in high but predictable yield losses ranging from 50% to 75%, with lower yield losses for the medium-cycle cultivar Sahel 202 in two of the three seasons. Due to the nature of the pest, season-long exposure to birds resulted in less predictable yield losses ranging from 13% to as high as 94%, with high seasonal variation. In two seasons, much lower bird-inflicted yield losses were observed in the short-cycle cultivar Sahel 108, whereas in one season the medium-cycle cultivar Sahel 202 was much less damaged. When rice was exposed to both weeds and birds, the relative yield losses ranged from 80 to 99%. The yield reducing effect of weeds and birds was never additive. Bird visits to a weedy crop were more frequent compared to a weed-free crop at least in the early rice grain filling stages. This attraction of birds by weeds resulted in an additional yield loss in five of the six cases, ranging from 2 to 62%. Bird-inflicted yield losses in irrigated rice may be reduced by keeping the crop, as much as possible, free from weeds. "

This paper provides a selective overview and synthesis of the issues involved in the commercialization and diversification process of agriculture, drawing in significant part from the papers in this volume. Based on an assessment of the process observed in selected countries, we show that the commercialization process should not be expected to be a frictionless process, and significant equity and environmental consequences may occur, at least in the short to medium term, particularly when inappropriate policies are followed. However, we highlight that appropriate government policies including investment in rural infrastructure and crop improvement research and extension, establishment of secure rights to land and water, and development and liberalization of capital markets, can help alleviate many of the possible adverse transitional consequences.

Among the several factors limiting their productivity, weeds account for about 40%. In order to meet the requirements of growing population, it is essential to improve productivity by reducing such unwarranted losses. Managing weeds with crop competition is an eco-friendly approach. Once the mechanisms of competition are understood, further improvements in weed control could be gained by manipulating other agronomic practices. The choice of cultivars, crop density, seeding rate, direction of planting, and intercropping could be exploited to enhance crop competitiveness against weeds. The variation in competitiveness and weed suppression among cultivars has been documented in rice, and to a lesser extent in wheat and maize. Research has demonstrated that the integration of crop competitiveness with other methods, such as the use of herbicides and manual weeding, is successful in managing weeds. However, in India, greater efforts are needed to exploit crop competitiveness for managing weeds in rice, wheat and maize. The success of these approaches relies on proper understanding of the biology and ecology of weeds, to identify weak points in their life cycle. "

In rainfed conditions, conservation agriculture (CA) practices, i.e., reduced tillage, residue retention and crop rotation, have proven to have substantial scope for arresting or reversing soil degradation. Previous research findings suggest that \{CA\} can be beneficially applied to irrigated croplands as well, but influences on salinization processes are insufficiently documented. This study investigates the effect of \{CA\} practices on soil salinity dynamics in irrigated production systems in the Khorezm region, Uzbekistan, Central Asia. The study was conducted under a cotton-wheat-maize rotation system, typical for the region, from 2007 to 2009 with two tillage methods (‘CA’ – permanent raised beds (PB); conventional tillage (CT)) combined with two residue levels (residue harvested (RH); residue retained (RR)). Compared to pre-experiment levels, salinity in the top 30 cm soil increased significantly during cotton (May–October), while a negligible change occurred during wheat (October–June) and maize (July–September) season. In absence of crop residues, soil salinity on top of the beds increased compared to \{CT\} without crop residue retention. When retaining crop residues, the soil salinity under \{PB\} was reduced by 32% in the top 10 cm and by 22% over the top 90 cm soil profile compared to \{CT\} without crop residue retention. Thus, \{PB\} + \{RR\} seems a promising option to slow down on-going soil salinization in salt-affected agro-ecologies such as those in the irrigated arid lands of Central Asia. "

Surrogates \{SLA\} and SCMR, were measured prior, during and after completion of the drought period, whereas Δ13C was measured on the dried tissue after harvest. Transpiration efficiency was negatively associated with \{SLA\} after the completion of stress treatment (r2 = 0.15) and Δ13C in leaves (r2 = 0.13) and positively associated with \{SCMR\} during stress (r2 = 0.17). These associations, all fairly weak, were significant only in 2004. None of these relationships was found in 2005. Although the heritability of \{SCMR\} during 2005 was relatively higher than that of TE, and although \{SCMR\} has previously been used to identify contrasting germplasm for TE, the stress-dependence of the relationship with TE, and the poor regression coefficients (r2) with that \{RIL\} population, do not confer that these surrogates are adequately robust enough in that population.

The range of variation in yields under salinity was similar in both kabuli and desi chickpeas, indicating that breeding for salinity tolerance can be undertaken in both groups. A strong relationship (r2 = 0.50) was found between the seed yield under salinity and the seed yield under a non-saline control treatment, indicating that the seed yield under salinity was explained in part by a yield potential component and in part by salinity tolerance per se. Seed yields under salinity were therefore computed to separate the yield potential component from the residuals that accounted for salinity tolerance per se. Among the genotypes evaluated, desi genotypes had higher salinity tolerance than kabuli genotypes. The residuals were highly correlated to the ratio of seed yield under salinity to that of the control, indicating that both parameters can be used to assess salinity tolerance. A similar ratio was calculated for shoot dry weight at 50 days after sowing. However, no significant correlation was found between the shoot dry weight ratio and the yield ratio, indicating that differences in salinity tolerance among genotypes could not be inferred from measurements in the vegetative stage. The major trait related to salinity tolerance was the ability to maintain a large number of filled pods, whereas seed size was similar in tolerant and sensitive genotypes. Salinity tolerance was not related to the shoot Na+ or K+ concentrations. "

Conservation agriculture is an approach to managing agro-ecosystems for improved and sustained productivity, by way of minimal soil disturbance, permanent soil cover with organic matter or cover crops and crop rotation. Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were measured using static chambers. Experiments involved four cropping system scenarios with different \{CA\} components, and different N rates. In addition, emissions of \{CH4\} and \{N2O\} fluxes were measured in farmers’ fields to establish baselines. The dynamics of \{CH4\} emissions were controlled by floodwater levels, and fertilizer N had no effect. On the other hand, N application rates and timing in relation to soil water status determined the \{N2O\} emissions in rice fields. Nitrous oxide fluxes could be avoided by applying N fertilizer to wet soil or by irrigating the field not later than 1 day after N application. Applying crop residues on soil surface had no significant effect on the seasonal \{CH4\} and \{N2O\} emissions. It was estimated that switching rice crop establishment method from conventional to CA-based practices in Haryana could reduce \{GWP\} for rice by 23% or by 1.26 Tg \{CO2\} eq yr−1. An intensive CA-based rice–wheat and maize–wheat system reduced \{GWP\} by 16–26% or by 1.3–2.0 Tg \{CO2\} eq yr−1 compared with the conventional rice–wheat system. However, this reduction in \{GWP\} would be from a decrease in diesel and electricity consumption and not from direct emissions of \{CH4\} and N2O, which were higher in the maize–wheat system than in the rice–wheat system.

With a choice of technologies, farm household decisions are governed not only by productivity and profitability considerations but also by factors such as available resources and their quality, family consumption preferences and attitudes towards risks, and prevailing policies. It is therefore necessary to analyse the adoption of such technologies from a whole-farm perspective. In this paper, a farm household model is used to assess possible technology adoption behaviour of farmers in Ilocos Norte Province, Philippines. Four alternative technologies were evaluated: hybrid rice production (HYR), balanced fertilization strategy (BFS), site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) and integrated pest management (IPM). Possible impacts of price policies and infrastructure improvements on technology adoption were assessed. The results show that all four alternative technologies considered are attractive to farmers, although simulations show differential adoption rates for poor, average and better-off households. \{IPM\} and \{HYR\} appear the most attractive amongst all technologies considered. In all technology simulations, relative profitability and risks, labour and capital requirements and availabilities are decisive factors in the adoption of alternative technologies. Adoption of alternative technologies would result in higher discretionary income, higher rice production and lower biocide use and nitrogen loss. Amongst policy simulations considered, availability of low-cost credit shows the largest improvements in farmer welfare for poor and average households, but its effect on simulated adoption of alternative technologies was variable. We argue that the methodology and results presented can contribute to ex ante assessments of policies targeted at stimulating technology adoption by farmers. "

Many varieties grown on large holdings in rainfed areas provide good yield under normal water availability but suffer high losses in the event of drought. From a set of 129 genotypes tested in shallow rainfed drought-prone environments at three locations in eastern India from 2005 to 2007, a subset of 39 genotypes that were tested for two or more years under favorable irrigated, moderate reproductive-stage drought stress, and severe reproductive-stage drought stress situations in 16 environments was selected for a \{GGE\} biplot analysis to identify genotypes that provide stable yield across environments. IR74371-70-1-1 and IR74371-46-1-1 were identified as stable genotypes showing high yield under varied environments across different sites. IR36, IR64, and MTU1010, the three popular varieties grown on large holdings in rainfed areas but bred for irrigated ecosystem, as well as improved genotypes CB2-458, DGI237, R1027-2282-2-1, RR272-21, IR67469-R-1-1, and IR66873-R-11-1, and varieties \{PMK1\} and \{PMK2\} released for rainfed ecosystems performed well only in irrigated non-stress environments and were not found promising in drought environments. Improved genotypes ARB6, ARB2, ARB5, ARB7, ARB8, RF5329, CB0-15-24, IR72667-16-1-B-B-3, IR74371-78-1-1, and IR55419-04, and drought-tolerant released varieties Tripuradhan, Annada, and Poornima performed well only in drought-stress environments. The identification of improved genotypes with ability to provide stable high yield across variable environments and their release for cultivation by farmers will enable farmers to reap high yield and stable income.

The objectives of the analysis were to (1) investigate how widespread yield declines are in experiments with constant levels of input and (2) study the cross-sectional relationship between the magnitude of yield trends and the initial yield level in the experiment. In rice–rice (–rice) systems, yields in the most favorable climatic season (dry season) have remained stable in many \{LTEs\} conducted outside of IRRI, mostly at yield levels of 4–7 Mg ha−1 with recommended rates of N, P and K applied. Statistically significant yield declines at p≤0.05 were observed in only two of 21 data sets outside of IRRI, although all three \{LTEs\} at \{IRRI\} showed yield declines. One dry season experiment showed a statistically significant yield increase. In the less favorable climatic season (wet season), only two of 14 data sets outside of \{IRRI\} showed a statistically significant declining yield trend, while three of four at \{IRRI\} showed statistically significant yield declines. In rice-upland crop (typically wheat) LTEs, a significant yield decline for rice was found in only one of ten data sets. For wheat, there were no statistically significant yield declines, although there was one statistically significant yield increase. There was a negative correlation between the magnitude of yield decline and the level of initial yields, but it was not statistically significant. The data suggest that while yield declines exist in some LTEs, they are less common than previously thought, particularly at moderate yield levels. Where yield declines occurred, they were related to soil properties affected by prolonged soil wetness or soil nutrient depletion. "

During the three rice cultivation periods, the community of the \{CF\} plots gradually changed with time, while the community of the \{AWD\} plots possessed a relatively large variation. Principal component analysis and sequencing analysis of selected 16S rRNA genes indicated that members of Methanosarcinales dominated in the \{CF\} plots while members of Methanocellales and uncultured group of “Thaumarchaeota” characterized the \{AWD\} plots.

These morphological responses are caused by ethylene produced during submergence, however, a visible damage of intolerant cultivars is markedly developing after desubmergence rather than during submergence, which is probably due to oxidative damage. We studied the effect of ethylene produced during submergence on antioxidant content and oxidative damage after desubmergence. When rice (Oryza sativa) was submerged for 8 days, both tolerant cultivar (BKNFR) and intolerant cultivars (Mashuri and IR42) showed a decrease in ascorbate concentration during submergence. After 3 days of desubmergence, the tolerant cultivar showed a rapid recovery of total ascorbate and ascorbic acid, whereas intolerant cultivars showed a slow recovery of them, an increase in malondialdehyde formation, and low survival rate (about 30%). However, applying 200 mg l−1 of AgNO3 as an ethylene antagonist to intolerant cultivars suppressed the decrease in ascorbate and the increase in malondialdehyde formation after desubmergence, and improved survival rate to about 60%. Ascorbic acid supply to leaf discs from submerged \{IR42\} suppressed increase in malondialdehyde formation by incubation under the light for 24 h. In addition, strong negative correlations were observed between malondialdehyde formation with ascorbate concentration (r=−0.93) and with percentage of survival (r=−0.98). Our results indicate that the accumulated ethylene during submergence adversely affected antioxidant mechanism in intolerant rice cultivars after desubmergence, and ascorbic acid was an important antioxidant in vivo for the recovery of submerged rice seedlings.

Screening was conducted under controlled conditions in greenhouse and field conditions, and indicators of early vigour, including shoot length, shoot biomass, leaf area, number of roots, root biomass, partitioning coefficients, and growth rates, were measured. Phenotypic correlations suggested that traits that were related and combined could be used to define early vigour. Broad-sense heritability ranged from moderate to high. Many regions were identified containing more than one QTL, suggesting that these traits were controlled by pleiotropic and/or closely linked QTLs. Many \{QTLs\} were specific to one environment but G × E interaction analysis showed that the main effects of the environment were large. Differences in temperature between experiments resulted in large differences in seedling age when expressed in thermal time. Different genes (QTLs) may be expected to control growth at different time intervals and thus may partly explain the limited agreement between experiments. However, several regions showed co-location of \{QTLs\} from more than one experiment. Comparisons with published studies revealed that these regions were previously identified in different genetic backgrounds and could potentially be used as introgression targets in a marker-assisted breeding program to improve germplasm for direct-seeded environments.

Such \{CA\} practices aim at maximizing profits while making a better use of soil and water resources lowering labor demands, farm power and production costs. The \{CA\} experiments with rice–wheat systems combined two establishment methods (beds and flats) with three residue levels (all zero tillage) and with alternate wet and dry (AWD) irrigation followed by surface seeded wheat (SSW); and conventional tillage (dry tillage) and continuously flooded rice (water seeded rice, WSR) followed by SSW. These were evaluated for 2 years (2008–2010) by using several financial indicators such as gross margins (GMs) estimates and benefit/cost ratio (BCR) while accounting for the soil water balance and soil salinity dynamics. The \{GM\} and \{BCR\} were higher under WSR–SSW than under treatments of dry seeded rice (DSR)–SSW. Both were higher under residue removal compared to residue retainments in DSR-SSW. Surface seeded wheat, which involved minor production costs, yielded &gt;6 t ha−1 in both years in all treatments. Furthermore, &gt;80% of the total irrigation water was applied to rice. Yet, &gt;90% from WSR–SSW and ∼67% from DSR–SSW were lost through seepage and percolation. Dry seeded rice in bed (DSRB)–SSW saved 15% more irrigation water compared to dry seeded rice in flat (DSRF)–SSW and 67% compared to WSR–SSW. Soil salinity decreased with rice cultivation. After 2 years, WSR–SSW had the lowest while residue-removed DSRB–SSW had the highest salinity level at all soil depths. Groundwater salinity under deep groundwater tables was higher under treatments of DSR–SSW than under WSR–SSW. However, under shallow groundwater tables, groundwater salinity was higher under WSR–SSW than under DSR–SSW. Under the conditions that irrigation water is subsidized or even free of charge, conventional WSR–SSW into the standing rice field (20 days before rice harvest) is the most profitable option. However, under water scarce conditions, the \{CA\} based rice–wheat system could be a suitable alternative to cope with water scarcity and secondary soil salinization. Before this crop production system can be advocated and promoted, it needs to be flanked by adequate water pricing policies. "

Food security in the world is challenged by increasing food demand and threatened by declining water availability. More recently, the increase in area under biofuel crops at the cost of food crops is also threatening. Exploring ways to produce more rice with less water is essential for food security. Water-saving rice production systems, such as aerobic rice culture, system of rice intensification (SRI), ground-cover rice production system (GCRPS), raised beds, and alternate wetting and drying (AWD), can drastically cut down the unproductive water outflows and increase water-use efficiency (WUE). However, these technologies can sometimes lead to some yield penalty, if the existing lowland varieties are used. Other new approaches are being explored to increase water economy without compromise on yield. These include the incorporation of the \{C4\} photosynthetic pathway into rice to increase rice yield per unit water transpired, the use of molecular biotechnology to develop rice varieties with improved water-use efficiency, transpiration efficiency (TE), drought tolerance, and the development of varieties for aerobic system, to achieve high and sustainable yields in nonflooded soil. Through the adoption of water-saving irrigation technologies, rice land will shift away from being continuously anaerobic to being partly or even completely aerobic. These shifts will produce profound changes in water conservation, soil organic matter turnover, nutrient dynamics, carbon impounding, weed flora, and greenhouse gas emissions. Although some of these changes can be positive, for example, water conservation and decreased methane emission, others might be negative, for example, release of nitrous oxide from the soil and decline in soil organic matter. The challenge will be to develop effective integrated natural–resource–management interventions, which would allow profitable rice cultivation with increased soil aeration, while maintaining the productivity, environmental safety, and sustainability of rice-based ecosystems. This chapter discusses the integrated approaches like genetics, breeding, and resource management to increase rice yield and to reduce water demand for rice production. "

The investigation was conducted at the centre of a geographic area representative of the rice-wheat system of South Asia, and covers a large diversity of production situations undergoing intensification. A survey procedure was used to collect data for 3 consecutive years (1993–1995) in 251 individual farmers' fields. Two analytical approaches were used, the emphasis shifting from yield determining variables, that are mostly qualitative in nature, to quantitative, and predominantly yield-reducing, variables. The first approach was intended to characterize relationships among variables using cluster and correspondence analyses, while the second approach was aimed at generating yield loss estimates using combinations of principal components and step-wise multiple regressions. Seven patterns of cropping practices were distinguished, reflecting a wide variation in production situations, especially in terms of use of fertilizers and manure, and degree of water control. Six types of disease profiles, four insect injury profiles, and four weed infestation patterns were identified. Correspondence analysis, based on patterns of cropping practices and injury profiles, yielded a path of increasing attainable yield associated with varying levels of intensification and combinations of injuries. The use of principal component analysis with multiple regression generated estimates of yield reductions due to rice diseases, insects and weeds. The analysis highlighted the effects of changes in patterns of cropping practices on injuries caused by weeds, brown spot, sheath blight and dead hearts. The significance of these findings with respect to current and future \{IPM\} needs is discussed. "

Mean minimum air temperature ranged from 22°C in late November and in March to 20°C in January. Mean maximum temperatures ranged from 27 to 30°C. Larger-sized seed gave superior tuber yields averaging over 21 t ha−1 for the best treatments in five experiments. Highland seed constantly produced superior yields primarily because of better plant survival. All three cultivars evaluated in this respect (Sequoia, Desiree and LT-5) had similar responses to seed size. Desprouting did not improve yields of well-sprouted highland seed. Seed rates from 1.5 to 2.5 t ha−1 gave similar yields regardless of seed size from 20 to 50 mm diameter. Seed rates of 1.0 and 3.0 t ha−1 significantly reduced and increased yields, respectively. Increased plant densities of up to 80 000 plants ha−1 improved tuber yields. This coincided with a stem ha−1 population of over 200 000. The most important factor in obtaining maximum yields was canopy duration. In five experiments, yield = −1.98 + 0.05x canopy duration with \{R2\} = 0.67. Increased branching provided good canopy development at lower plant populations. Double-row beds enhanced yields by up to 3 t ha−1 over single-row ridges. Shallow planting gave faster emergence and canopy development but it did not improve yields. It resulted in more tuber greening. Hilling reduced greening at shallow planting. Results of the twelve experiments show the possibility of producing potatoes in an isohyperthermic environment. With optimum agronomic practices, yields of over 20 t ha−1 can be obtained with cultivars such as Cosima. "

Cutting resulted in many more stems per unit weight of seed planted, particularly for cultivars with long dormancy (up to 100% increase). Seed-curing for 5 days before planting was essential for cv.

They were planted on five dates from early to late dry season (October-January) during two years, at 14° N lat. in The Philippines. Another objective, studied during the second year, was to compare seed produced under hot lowland conditions and stored for 8 months, with newly sprouted seed grown under cool highland temperatures. Potato plants grew faster and tuberized earlier for later planting dates. Physiologically young seed of Cosima and DTO-2 always produced plants with superior canopies. Tuber bulking was linear up to about 70 days after planting. Total dry-matter production was highest with young Cosima seed, exceeding 100 g plant−1 for all planting dates except the last. Old Cosima and DTO-2 seed generally produced between 80 and 100 g dry matter plant−1. Final tuber yields were highest with the mid dry-season planting (December) during both years with highland seed Cosima yielding 30 t ha−1. Lowland seed of Cosima yielded over 21 t ha−1 for the first 4 planting dates, significantly less than yields from highland seed. Yield differences increased with later planting. Although highland seed is recommended, lowland seed is an alternative for poor farmers. The final tuber yield of Cosima decreased by 12% with a minimum air temperature rise from 18.5 to 21° C, while DTO-2 was more adversely affected. Based on these results, minimum ait temperatures above 21 °C are unsuitable for potato production. Total intercepted solar radiation was positively correlated with final tuber yields and total dry-matter production. Efficiency of conversion into dry matter was about 70% of that in cool temperate climates. "

Because of the close interaction of these components, a change in any one of them can alter the whole system. The adoption of a modern rice variety (IR66) in the early wet season of the rainfed lowland rice agroecosystem resulted from the interplay of many factors which provided the preconditions that favoured adoption of the new technology. Agricultural innovation was associated simultaneously with adoption (of a product of professional research) and adaptation (by farmers to fit local circumstances) so that emerging opportunities for change could be exploited. The key to this innovation process was experimentation by farmers using novel inputs. Innovation was thus a collaborative process involving sequential learning and social change. "

The goal of modern pest management is to contribute to agricultural sustainability, with its different facets (food security, balanced relations between man-made and natural ecosystems, conservation of ecosystem services). The four principles are considered in turn within the classic Human - Pest - Environment - Crop framework. Biodiversity, as a first principle, is fundamental to the functioning of food webs. The second principle, host plant resistance (HPR), is a pro-poor, and an often highly efficient element that critically contributes to sustainable crop protection. \{HPR\} needs to account for the other principles in its implementation in order to sustain durable resistances over time and space. The third principle, landscape ecology, encompasses inter-linked levels of spatial hierarchies governing the performance of systems (pests, host plants, plant genotypic make-ups, plant and crop physiology, trophic chains, and the physical environment). The fourth principle, hierarchies, concerns the different levels of hierarchy in a landscape, from biological to social. This principle concerns the very fabric of human societies, which involve perceptions, knowledge, and attitudes, which translate into decision-making at several scales, from the individual farmer to policy-makers. This principle thus addresses psychological, policy, and decision-making dimensions. In this review, all organisms that may be harmful to rice are referred to as ‘pests’, including pathogens and animal pests. We do not address all rice pests, but proceed through a few key examples, nor do we enter into the specifics of pest management strategies covering the range of rice production situations. This is because of the very large range of rice pests, of the corresponding diversity of rice production situations worldwide, of the unprecedented rate of diversification of rice production in response to environmental, climatic, social, and economic drivers, and lastly because plant protection in rice faces emerging crop health challenges that continually call for new solutions in new contexts. The review shows that the considered framework – Human - Pest - Environment - Crop – applies, with each of its summits having a different bearing depending on the pest considered. The review further underlines the need for basic research across a range of disciplines, with novel approaches and methods, as well as the need for connecting hierarchy levels, from farmers, to consumers, to societies, the environment, and to policies.

The objective of this study is to decompose the yield gap into efficiency, resource and technology yield gaps for irrigated lowland rice-based farming systems in Central Luzon, Philippines, and to explain those yield gaps using data related to crop management, biophysical constraints and available technologies. Stochastic frontier analysis was used to quantify and explain the efficiency and resource yield gaps and a crop growth model (ORYZA v3) was used to compute the technology yield gap. We combined these two methodologies into a theoretical framework to explain rice yield gaps in farmers’ fields included in the Central Luzon Loop Survey, an unbalanced panel dataset of about 100 households, collected every four to five years during the period 1966–2012. The mean yield gap estimated for the period 1979–2012 was 3.2 ton ha−1 in the wet season (WS) and 4.8 ton ha−1 in the dry season (DS). An average efficiency yield gap of 1.3 ton ha−1 was estimated and partly explained by untimely application of mineral fertilizers and biotic control factors. The mean resource yield gap was small in both seasons but somewhat larger in the \{DS\} (1.3 ton ha−1) than in the \{WS\} (1.0 ton ha−1). This can be partly explained by the greater N, P and K use in the highest yielding fields than in lowest yielding fields which was observed in the \{DS\} but not in the WS. The technology yield gap was on average less than 1.0 ton ha−1 during the \{WS\} prior to 2003 and ca. 1.6 ton ha−1 from 2003 to 2012 while in the \{DS\} it has been consistently large with a mean of 2.2 ton ha−1. Varietal shift and sub-optimal application of inputs (e.g. quantity of irrigation water and N) are the most plausible explanations for this yield gap during the \{WS\} and DS, respectively. We conclude that the technology yield gap explains nearly half of the difference between potential and actual yields while the efficiency and resource yield gaps explain each a quarter of that difference in the DS. As for the WS, particular attention should be given to the efficiency yield gap which, although decreasing with time, still accounted for nearly 40% of the overall yield gap. "

Increased maize production is required to meet rising demands, but additional production should come from the sustainable intensification of existing farmlands to minimize the undesirable effects of agriculture on the environment. We hypothesize that maize yields, profit, and N use efficiencies can be significantly increased through site-specific nutrient management (SSNM), thereby reducing yield gaps in the region. Through a combined approach of simulation modeling and on-farm research in at least 65 sites in 13 major maize-producing domains across Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines from 2004 to 2008, we were able to (a) quantify maize yield gaps and yield responses to fertilizer application, (b) evaluate the agronomic and economic performance of SSNM, and (c) evaluate the incremental profitability of \{SSNM\} in various production and grain and fertilizer price scenarios. The average exploitable yield gap between the attainable yield and current farmers’ yield in Southeast Asia was about 0.9 t ha−1. Yield responses to fertilizer application across the region followed the order N &gt; &gt;P &gt; K. Yield response to N was higher in irrigated sites than in rainfed sites (6 t ha−1 versus 2 t ha−1), while P and K fertilizer responses were similar across production systems (&lt;2 t ha−1). Yield with \{SSNM\} was 1.0 t ha−1 (+13%) higher than the current farmers’ fertilizer practice (FFP) measured in the same cropping seasons. Yield increases were associated with a 10% decrease in the average N rate, but with increased application of K at sites where the previous K rates were low. Average N use efficiency increased by 42%, mainly by adjusting the rates and timing of N application to the stages of crop development. Across all sites and seasons, profitability increased by US$167 ha−1 per crop, which was equivalent to15% of the total average net return. Opportunities for achieving higher income over the \{FFP\} (≥US$100 ha−1 season) were greatest in highly favorable rainfed environments; less favorable rainfed areas were vulnerable to unfavorable market prices. We conclude that \{SSNM\} has the potential to close existing yield gaps in the maize production systems of Southeast Asia by improving yield, nutrient use efficiency, and profitability. "

We quantified and modeled grain yield–nutrient uptake relations in maize grown without significant biotic and abiotic stresses. Grain yield and plant nutrient accumulation in above-ground plant dry matter (DM) of commercial maize hybrids were measured at physiological maturity in on-station and on-farm experiments in Nebraska (USA), Indonesia, and Vietnam during 1997–2006. These data were used to model the nutrient requirements for yields up to 20 Mg ha−1 using the \{QUEFTS\} (QUantitative Evaluation of the Fertility of Tropical Soils) approach. The model required estimation of two boundary lines describing the minimum and maximum internal nutrient efficiencies of N, P and K (IE, kg grain per kg nutrient in plant DM), which were estimated at 40 and 83 kg grain kg−1 N, 225 and 726 kg grain kg−1 P and 29 and 125 kg grain kg−1 K, respectively. The model predicted a linear increase in grain yield if nutrients are taken up in balanced amounts of 16.4 kg N, 2.3 kg P and 15.9 kg K per 1000 kg of grain until yield reached about 60–70% of the yield potential. The corresponding \{IEs\} were 61 kg grain kg−1 N, 427 kg grain kg−1 P and 63 kg grain kg−1 K. The model predicted a decrease in \{IEs\} when yield targets approached the yield potential limit. A spherical model was derived from \{QUEFTS\} model outputs and found to be particularly suitable for practical applications such as estimating fertilizer needs. The proposed spherical model offers generality across environments and management practices, allowing users to estimate the optimal N, P and K uptake requirements based on two inputs: estimated yield potential and yield target. Further improvements in modeling the relationship between N uptake and grain yield can be made by taking into account differences in harvest index. Accuracy in the simulation of N uptake using the spherical model was improved from an \{RMSE\} of 35 kg N ha−1 to 25 kg N ha−1 when harvest index was accounted for, suggesting that the relationship between N uptake and actual yield is affected by both yield potential and efficiency in biomass partitioning.

abstract = "Abstract Depletion and/or degradation of natural resources, increasing farm labour scarcity, and high production cost are major threats to the rice-wheat cropping system of north-west India. Conservation agriculture (CA) is a potential solution which can be achieved by switching from puddling then transplanting of rice to dry seeding (DSR), together with changing from conventional tillage (CT) to zero tillage (ZT) for wheat with surface retention of rice residues. Whether the use of \{ZT\} for both crops confers additional benefits to either crop is not known. The effects of surface retention of rice residues in wheat on the subsequent \{DSR\} crop are also unknown, nor how this is affected by tillage for DSR. Therefore, a field study was conducted during 2012-14 to investigate the interactions between tillage for rice and wheat (CT, ZT), and rice residue management (removed, retained on the soil surface), on the performance of a dry seeded rice-wheat system. There were no significant interaction or main treatment effects on wheat grain yield in the first two years, but in the third year, yield of \{ZT\} wheat (5.5 t ha−1) was significantly lower than yield of \{CT\} wheat (6.0 t ha−1). Yield of wheat decreased significantly over the three years, for example from 7.7 to 6.3 to 5.8 t ha−1 in the control system (CT for both crops, no rice straw mulch). Weather data analysis and simulation modelling suggested that this was entirely due to differences in seasonal weather conditions. Growth of non-mulched \{ZT\} wheat was inferior to that of mulched \{ZT\} wheat, and that of \{CT\} wheat with and without mulch, regardless of tillage for rice, although this was not reflected in wheat grain yield. Mulch delayed wheat crop development and the time of irrigation to varying degrees depending on seasonal conditions, and reduced irrigation amount by 50–100 mm in two of the three years. Tillage and rice residue management treatments did not affect the yield of \{DSR\} in the first year (mean yield 6.0 t ha−1). However, in the second year, growth and grain yield of \{ZTDSR\} (3.2 t ha−1) were inferior to that of \{CTDSR\} (3.8 t ha−1), regardless of tillage treatment for wheat. There was a consistent trend for poorer growth of \{DSR\} following wheat mulched with rice straw (significant in the first year), suggesting the need to examine the possibility of allelopathic effects of surface rice straw retention in dry seeded rice-wheat systems. There was a decline in rice growth and grain yield over the two years in all treatments. For example, yield of rice in the control declined from 5.9 t ha−1 in 2012 to 4.3 t ha−1 in 2013. Seasonal conditions and simulated growth and yield were similar each year; the poorer observed rice growth and yield in 2013 were due to disease during grain filling, greater weed infestation during the early vegetative stage, and unexplained factors during the middle of the season. Total system rice equivalent yield (REY) was not affected by tillage or mulch treatments nor their interactions in 2012 (mean \{REY\} 13.3 t ha−1), but was significantly lower in systems with \{ZTDSR\} (9.4 t ha−1) than \{CTDSR\} (10.0 t ha−1) in 2013. Treatment effects on irrigation input to rice and the total system were small. The net result was no treatment effects on total cropping system irrigation water productivity (WPi) in 2012 (mean 0.83 kg m−3), and significantly higher system \{WPi\} in 2013 in systems with \{CTDSR\} (0.69 kg m−3) than \{ZTDSR\} (0.63 kg m−3). The results suggest that in a dry seeded rice-wheat cropping system, surface retention of rice residues can improve the growth of \{ZT\} wheat right from the first crop, although this did not affect yield in the first three years. However, whether there is an adverse carry over effect of the rice residues on \{DSR\} requires further investigation. "

As a case study, \{HISS\} at flowering stage was surveyed under field conditions using local popular varieties in Savannakhet, Laos, and Tamil Nadu, India, during the dry season. At the field site in Savannakhet, sterility in variety Thadokkham1 (TDK1) was 10.8% when the maximum average temperature at heading was 32.9 °C, which increased to 23.3% at 37.3 °C. When plots were covered with a shading net, solar radiation was reduced by 60% at heading, which significantly reduced sterility to 10.0%. Panicle temperature estimates produced with a micrometeorology model revealed that shading during the hours when flowering occurs decreased panicle temperature by 2.2–2.6 °C. At the field sites in Tamil Nadu, sterility of variety Coimbatore 51 (CO51) was highly correlated with the maximum temperature at heading; sterility was around 5–10% when maximum average temperature was below 36.5 °C, which increased to 33.4% at 38.0 °C. Marking of opened spikelets at hourly intervals allowed us to detect increases in sterility as temperature increased from early morning until noon. We conclude that \{HISS\} at flowering stage can occur in local popular varieties grown in Savannakhet and Tamil Nadu during the hot, dry season. Effective protocols such as using a shading net and hourly marking of open spikelets are useful approaches to quantifying \{HISS\} during flowering stage across hot and potential heat-vulnerable rice-growing regions.

Rice and wheat together constitute the world's two most important food crops. Wheat is the staple food of many developed countries and constitutes the leading cereal in terms of total world production. Because of the importance of rice in many developing countries, especially in Asia, considerable effort has been expended during the past decades to develop varieties capable of responding to improved management and to reduce production hazards through the incorporation of genes resistant to major biological, chemical, and physical stresses. The successful development of hybrid maize in the 1930s provided an important impetus for breeders of other crops, including self-pollinating cereals such as wheat, rice, barley, and cross-pollinating sorghum, to utilize the principles of hybrid production. Heterosis was first reported in wheat when it was found that \{F1\} plants were generally taller than the tall parent. The major yield components in rice and wheat are number of panicles per square meter, spikelet number per panicle, spikelet fertility percentage, and 1,000-grain weight. Significant positive mid-parent, high-parent, or standard heterosis has been observed for one or more of these components in a number of rice crosses. "

Using the Driving Forces – Pressures – State – Impact – Response (DPSIR) scheme developed by \{EEA\} and Eurostat we analyse the logic inherent to the application of insecticides. Its underlying biology-to-society perspective considers insects as the initial Pressure, spraying insecticides as adequate Response and yield protection as result. This view is apparently supported by positive results in the early growth phase, but this short term success is paid for by increased system sensitivity, possibly leading to severe damages in the later stages when a seemingly similar situation is indeed very different. This is due to the complementary but ignored society-to-biology loop: insecticide spraying leads to biocontrol loss enhancing vulnerability. Once the system has gone through both loops, the State of the system has changed, enhancing its sensitivity to planthopper infestations. The changed State leads to unexpected Impacts – in particular, the standard Response is no longer capable of reducing the Drivers (the numbers of planthoppers) as expected. This does not become obvious, however, before a new pressure arises and cannot be understood inside the standard management loop but requires combining it with the society-to-biology loop. A double-DPSIR scheme is suggested as a heuristic device, and as a communication tool conveying the message in a simplified way. It shows that the Responses of one loop are the Drivers of the other, leading to different conclusions based on different pre-analytical visions. "

No-tillage (NT) has been increasingly adopted in this region to reduce costs and increase input use efficiency. But, optimal nutrient management practices for \{NT\} based wheat production are still poorly understood. Opportunities exist to further enhance the yield, profitability, and resource use efficiency of \{NT\} wheat through site-specific nutrient management (SSNM). On-farm trials were conducted in seven districts of Haryana, India for two consecutive years (2010–11 and 2011–12) to evaluate three different approaches to \{SSNM\} based on recommendations from the Nutrient Expert® (NE) decision support system in \{NT\} and conventional tillage (CT) based wheat production systems. Performance of \{NE\} based recommendations was evaluated against current state recommendations and farmers’ practices for nutrient management. Three \{SSNM\} treatments based on \{NE\} based recommendation were (1) ‘NE80:20’ with 80% N applied at planting and 20% at second irrigation (2) ‘NE33:33:33’ with N split as 33% basal, 33% at Crown Root Initiation (CRI) and 33% at second irrigation; and (3) ‘NE80:GS’ with N split as 80% basal and further application of N based on optical sensor (Green Seeker™)-guided recommendations. Yield, nutrient use efficiency and economic profitability were determined following standard agronomic and economic measurements and calculations. Cool Farm Tool (CFT), an empirical model to estimate greenhouse gases (GHGs) from agriculture production, was used to estimate \{GHG\} emissions under different treatments. Wheat grain and biomass yield were higher under \{NT\} in 2010–11 but no difference was observed in 2011–12. The three NE-based nutrient management strategies increased yield, nutrient use efficiency as well as net return as compared to state recommendation and farmers’ fertilization practice. Global warming potential (GWP) of wheat production was also lower with \{NT\} system as compared to \{CT\} system and NE-based nutrient managements as compared to farmers’ fertilization practice. State recommended nutrient management had similar \{GWP\} as NE-based nutrient managements except NE80:GS in which \{GWP\} was the lowest. Results suggest that no-tillage system along with site-specific approaches for nutrient management can increase yield, nutrient use efficiency and profitability while decreasing \{GHG\} from wheat production in \{NW\} India.

The objectives of this study were (1) to compare crop performance between aerobic and flooded rice continuously over several seasons, and (2) to identify yield attributes responsible for the yield gap between aerobic and flooded rice. Field experiments were conducted at the International Rice Research Institute farm in dry and wet seasons. Grain yield and its components were compared between aerobic and flooded rice continuously for eight seasons from 2001 to 2004 using the best available aerobic rice varieties in the tropics. The yield difference between aerobic and flooded rice ranged from 8 to 69% depending on the number of seasons that aerobic rice has been continuously grown, dry and wet seasons, and varieties. When the first-season aerobic rice was compared with flooded rice, the yield difference was 8–21%. The yield difference between aerobic and flooded rice was attributed more to difference in biomass production than to harvest index. Among the yield components, sink size (spikelets per m2) contributed more to the yield gap between aerobic and flooded rice than grain filling percentage and 1000-grain weight. Yield decline was observed when aerobic rice was continuously grown and the decline was greater in the dry season than in the wet season. The yield decline of aerobic rice was attributed more to changes in biomass production than in harvest index. Our data suggest that new aerobic rice varieties with minimum yield gap compared with flooded rice and crop management strategies that can reverse the yield decline of continuous aerobic rice have to be developed before aerobic rice technology can be adopted in large areas in the tropics.

The trial, established in early 1998 and continued to 2003, included three cropping systems (rice–soybean–rice, soybean–rice–maize, and rice–rice–maize) and seven combinations of N, P and K and FYM. Potassium was the most yield-limiting macronutrient, and regular K applications were required to make investments in the application of other mineral nutrients profitable. In the absence of K application, the average yield gap for rice ranged from 1.2 to 2.2 Mg ha−1depending on season. For soybean and maize the yield gap resulting from K omission averaged 0.9 and 3.4 Mg ha−1, respectively. This yield gap was less when N or P was omitted. With \{NPK\} application, positive apparent K balances of the cropping systems of +14 to +37 kg K ha−1 yr−1 were achieved. Yield trends for 5 years were not significant and ranged from −0.04 to +0.13 Mg ha−1 yr−1 in rice, from −0.02 to 0.0 Mg ha−1 yr−1 in soybean, and from −0.04 to 0.0 Mg ha−1 yr−1 in maize. The application of \{FYM\} improved grain yield and K balances more in upland crops than in rice. The break-even costs for the application of \{FYM\} ranged from 24 to 31 US$ Mg−1 \{FYM\} depending on the cropping system. While present \{NPK\} fertilizer recommendations for degraded soils appear to maintain current average yield levels of 3.8 Mg ha−1 for rice and maize, and 1.2 Mg ha−1 for soybean, modifications of the nutrient management including the application of nutrients other than \{NPK\} are likely to be required to sustain higher yield levels in the future.

Six tropical genotypes were used in the 2004 dry season and wet season at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Laguna, Philippines. Grain filling rate and duration exhibited highly significant genotypic variations in each crop season. Grain weight on area basis was positively associated with grain filling duration, irrespective of crop seasons, but negatively or not significantly associated with grain filling rate. Grain filling rate and duration were negatively correlated with each other. Final grain weight linearly increased with the rise in cumulative mean temperature and cumulative solar radiation. Longer grain filling duration resulted in higher cumulative mean temperature and cumulative solar radiation for effective grain filling. Higher daily mean temperature and radiation did not accelerate daily grain filling rates of different rice genotypes. It was concluded that longer grain filling duration, which provided rice plants with more cumulative mean temperature and cumulative solar radiation for effective grain filling period, was the main factor that determined grain yield on unit area basis in the field-grown tropical irrigated rice genotypes.

The concept of a combined bioenergy/biochar system could tackle these problems in a new way. Rice residues would be used for energy production, thereby reducing field burning and the use of fossil fuels, and the biochar by-product could help to improve soils, avoid methane emissions, and sequester carbon in soils. To examine some of these promises, we conducted field experiments from 2005 to 2008 in three different rice production systems. Objectives were to study the effect of biochar from rice husks on soil characteristics, assess the stability of carbonized rice residues in these different systems, and evaluate the agronomic effect of biochar applications. The results showed that application of untreated and carbonized rice husks (RH and CRH) increased total organic carbon, total soil N, the C/N ratio, and available P and K. Not significant or small effects were observed for soil reaction, exchangeable Ca, Mg, Na, and the CEC. On a fertile soil, the high C/N ratio of \{CRH\} seemed to have limited N availability, thereby slightly reducing grain yields in the first three seasons after application. On a poor soil, where the crop also suffered from water stress, soil chemical and physical improvements increased yields by 16–35%. Together with a parallel study including methane and \{CO2\} emission measurements at one site, the results strongly suggest that \{CRH\} is very stable in various rice soils and systems, possibly for thousands of years. However, the study also showed that \{CRH\} was very mobile in some soils. Especially in poor sandy soil, about half of the applied carbon seemed to have moved below 0.30 m in the soil profile within 4 years after application. We concluded that biochar from rice residues can be beneficial in rice-based systems but that actual effects on soil fertility, grain yield, and soil organic carbon will depend on site-specific conditions. Long-term studies on biochar in field trials seem essential to better understand biochar effects and to investigate its behavior in soils. "

Improved fertilizer management is one of the few options to enhance cropping system productivity but related results from previous studies were often disappointing and sometimes contradictory, possibly due to the large variability of soil and water resources. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to develop a site-specific nutrient management approach, and to propose a related decision tool for farmers. For this purpose, we conducted on-farm experiments in Kumpa-Oong Village, Roi Et Province, during the 2003–2005 cropping seasons. Tested fertilizer treatments were designed based on topographic field position. A comparison of soil characteristics between lower and upper fields revealed significantly higher soil fertility for lower fields (higher pH, TOC, TSN, CEC, clay, and silt content; lower sand content). Across seasons and treatments, grain yields were higher in the valley bottom (VB; 2.82 t ha−1) than on upper and middle terraces (UMT; 1.68 t ha−1). In all seasons, significant fertilizer treatment effects were detected only in \{UMT\} fields. But the comparison of treatment effects in individual fields and in both toposequence positions showed that the limited average fertilizer response was mainly caused by low or even negative responses in fields with a higher control yield, i.e., with higher indigenous nutrient supply. A missing or even negative fertilizer response occurred at lower control yields in \{UMT\} fields, most probably because attainable yields in these fields were lower as a result of limited water resources. Thus, site-specific fertilizer recommendations need to take toposequence and the field-specific indigenous nutrient supply into account. Based on these results, we proposed a decision tool that helps farmers to choose the most adequate fertilizer treatment for their fields, based on their knowledge of specific field characteristics. On-farm testing of the proposed decision tool is the next step to show whether this approach is acceptable to farmers and can contribute to higher resource-use efficiency and system productivity. "

abstract = "The time of flowering in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is affected by photoperiod. A nonlinear response has been reported with an optimum photoperiod, either below or above which flowering can be delayed. Three equations which account for both short- and long-day nonlinear effects were compared to describe the response of rice to photoperiod. The Beta model is unique in that it can describe an asymmetric shape of the relation between days to flowering (f) or rate of development to flowering (1f) and photoperiod (P). The other two models were the quadratic relation between f and P (QFP) and the quadratic relation between the rate, 1f, and P (QRP). The Beta model accurately described the flowering response to a wide range of photoperiods, and was superior to \{QFP\} and \{QRP\} in predicting the photoperiod effect on the flowering time as observed in several published data sets involving diverse rice cultivars. To provide the basis for predicting final main-stem leaf number in rice, the relationship between leaf number and photoperiod was studied experimentally for eight cultivars with different photoperiod sensitivities. A new equation for describing this relationship was derived based on the Beta model and a power-law model for rice leaf appearance. The equation adequately described the response of final leaf number to photoperiod in the eight cultivars. "

For three of the cultivars, periodic determination of leaf \{ABA\} was performed during differential irrigation and recovery. Diurnal kinetics of leaf \{ABA\} content, along with observations on leaf bulk turgor (ψt) and gas exchange, were established in two cultivars under well-watered conditions. Water-stress-induced proline and \{ABA\} accumulation differed among cultivars. Across cultivars, stress-induced proline accumulation was correlated negatively with midday ψ1 and positively with osmotic adjustment, but \{ABA\} accumulation was not. Proline accumulation therefore gave a similar discrimination among cultivars as did predawn turgid osmotic potential and ψ1. Diurnal oscillations of ψ0 differed among cultivars but were not related to \{ABA\} accumulation or ψ1. Interpretation of stress-induced \{ABA\} accumulation kinetics was difficult due to large diurnal oscillations. The relative amplitude of diurnal \{ABA\} oscillation reflected diurnal changes in ψ1 and ψt across cultivars. Diurnal \{ABA\} response to ψt of a drought-resistant cultivar was less sensitive than that of a susceptible cultivar under well-watered conditions. Highest \{ABA\} concentrations were observed at 16:00 h. Diurnal \{ABA\} accumulation lagged 4 hours behind changes in leaf bulk turgor. The results suggest that high- and low-ABA-accumulating rice cultivars exist, but no clear linkage of this trait to behavior under water stress was observed. "

Leaf appearance for the four fluctuating temperature treatments could be accurately predicted on the basis of these relations in each cultivar. This indicated that there were no specific effects ofTDandTNon leaf appearance in rice, in contrast with phenological development to flowering. The optimum temperature for leaf development was found to be substantially higher than for development to flowering. The final main-stem leaf number differed with diurnal temperature conditions. When a diurnal temperature delayed flowering, it increased the leaf number as well. This might explain whyTDandTNhad a different effect on development to flowering but not on leaf development. "

However, the continuing provision of these environmental services may be jeopardized by land use changes. To re-establish natural or productive forests, programs are being proposed in which participating farmers can set aside some of their cultivated sloping land and receive payment for maintaining the newly forested land. This paper compares two types of payments for ecosystems services (or PES)-type programs designed to favor reforestation by farming households: “Payments for forests” (PFF) and “Terraces for forests” (TFF). Both programs involve setting aside sloping land for reforestation but differ in the type and amount of compensation offered. \{PFF\} offers annual payments per area of retired land. \{TFF\} offers to cover the cost of converting a certain amount of a farm's sloping land into terraces, combined with annual payments per unit area of retired land. The main objective of the paper is to compare the two types of programs in terms of cost-efficiency – can we get the same amount of forest at lower cost? – and equity – will the poorest farmers participate? Using mathematical programming, we developed a set of farm models corresponding to typical farms in a mountainous district in Northern Vietnam. We simulated participation rates of different types of farms in the two types of \{PES\} programs. For each PES, we assessed the amount of land converted into forest, the cost of the program, and its impacts on land use and household revenues, at individual farm and village level. Results of our simulations showed that increasing access to irrigated terraces as a way of compensating for converting land to forest increased the participation of the poorest farmers and was more cost efficient than pure cash payments. This suggests that existing \{PFF\} programs are biased against the smallest landholders in the region whereas they could be transformed into win–win programs likely to increase forested areas and reduce inequalities among farm households. Our paper demonstrates that \{PES\} schemes, when fine-tuned to the South East Asian context, could not only be used to restore ecosystem services, but also to alleviate poverty. "

As with other rice production ecosystems, genotype and growing environment are the main factors influencing grain yield (GY) in irrigated rice production. However, the relative importance of genotype, environment and genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) on \{GY\} is less studied for irrigated rice, although evaluation of candidate varieties for yield stability through multi-environment trials before release and registration is mandatory in many countries. To identify patterns of genotype, environment, and \{GEI\} for \{GY\} of irrigated lowland rice, 392 cultivars or advanced breeding lines mostly from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), PhilRice (Philippines) and a few breeding programs of other countries were evaluated for \{GY\} and related traits in eight environments including Jiangxi (JX) and Sichuan (SC) in China, and six season (2) and nitrogen rate (3) combinations at \{IRRI\} headquarters (Los Baños, Philippines). Wide ranges of variations across genotypes and environments were observed for all traits. Genotype, environment, and \{GEI\} all significantly affected \{GY\} and some of the yield associated traits. \{GEI\} was more important than genotypic main effect for GY, seed setting rate and the number of panicles per plant but less important for other traits. For GY, the genotype-by-season interaction and genotype-by-season-by-nitrogen interaction was more important than the genotype-by-nitrogen interaction. The 303 genotypes with \{GY\} data in all environments were clustered into ten groups based on \{GY\} using an agglomerative hierarchical clustering procedure. The eight environments were grouped into three groups based \{GY\} using the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analysis. Three nitrogen rates in the \{WS\} and \{SC\} were grouped together (E1), while three nitrogen rates in the \{DS\} formed another group (E2). \{JX\} alone was the third group (E3).

abstract = "Publisher Summary This chapter reviews the existing knowledge about improving rice yields per unit quantity of rainwater available. Nearly one-third of the world's lowland rice is rain fed; however, rain-fed rice comprises only one-fifth of the global rice produced. Insufficient or excess water is the major constraint in the production of rain-fed lowland rice. Coupled with this are problems of poor agronomic practices followed by farmers, socioeconomic constraints, and lack of technology suited to rain-fed lowlands. There are two aspects of increasing the efficiency of rainwater use under rain-fed situations: raising the yield of the rain-fed crop when rainfall is normal and preventing yield loss when rainfall is inadequate and drought occurs frequently. The technology for improving the efficiency of rainwater use in rain-fed lowlands aims at increasing in situ rainwater interception, soil infiltrability, and profile water storage; decreasing nonproductive water losses, such as percolation and seepage; collecting runoff water for providing supplementary irrigation at critical growth stages, if needed; and properly managing rice crops for efficient utilization of conserved soil moisture. These objectives can be achieved by proper soil, water, and crop management techniques and the chapter reviews some of the findings, possibilities, and challenges that are significant. Subsurface soil compaction before planting rice appears to be a practical way to decrease percolation losses and to improve profile water storage in coarse-textured soils. Water harvesting is an important component of rain-fed technology. Rainwater stored in suitable reservoirs can provide supplemental irrigation to rice during prolonged dry spells. The adoption of suitable agronomic practices is equally important in increasing the efficiency of rainwater use in growing rain-fed lowland rice. These include selection of crop variety, time of planting, plant populations, crop geometry, efficient fertilizer use, weed control, and insect control. "

abstract = "Irrigated rice (Oryza sativa L.) yield increases in Asia have slowed down in recent years. Further, yield increases are likely to occur in smaller increments through fine-tuning of crop management. On-farm experiments at 179 sites in eight key irrigated rice domains of Asia were conducted from 1997 to 1999 to evaluate a new approach for site-specific nutrient management (SSNM). Large variation in initial soil fertility characteristics and indigenous supply of N, P, and K was observed among the eight intensive rice domains as well as among farms within each domain. Field- and season-specific \{NPK\} applications were calculated by accounting for the indigenous nutrient supply, yield targets, and nutrient demand as a function of the interactions between N, P, and K. Nitrogen applications were fine-tuned based on season-specific rules and field-specific monitoring of crop N status. The performance of \{SSNM\} was tested for four successive rice crops. Average grain yield in the \{SSNM\} increased by 0.36 Mg ha−1 (7%) compared to the current farmers’ fertilizer practice (FFP) measured in the same cropping seasons or 0.54 Mg ha−1 (11%) compared to the baseline \{FFP\} yield before intervention. Average nutrient uptake under \{SSNM\} increased by about 10% in the same seasons or by 13% (N) and 21% (P, K) compared to the baseline data. Yield increases were associated with a 4% decrease in the average N rate, but larger amounts of fertilizer-K at sites where the previous K use was low. Average N use efficiencies increased by 30–40%, mainly through the use of improved in-season N management schemes. Across all sites and four successive rice crops, profitability increased by US$ 46 ha−1 per crop or 12% of the total average net return. The performance of \{SSNM\} did not differ significantly between high-yielding and low-yielding climatic seasons, but improved over time with larger benefits observed in the second year. Average profitability increased from US$ 32 ha−1 pre crop in the first year to US$ 61 ha−1 pre crop in the second year due to improvements in the \{SSNM\} approach and re-capitalization of P and K applied in the first year. \{SSNM\} required little extra credit for financing, and remained profitable even if rice prices are somewhat lower than current levels. Further, scope for improvement exists at many sites by alleviating other crop management constraints to nutrient use efficiency. Profit increases ranged from US$ 4 to 82 ha−1 per crop among eight rice domains. However, profit decreases occurred in about 25% of all cases, indicating that a certain minimum level of crop care is required for \{SSNM\} to be profitable. Yields at sites with labor-saving direct-seeding of larger fields were about 1 Mg ha−1 lower than those achieved at sites with labor-intensive transplanting and good management, raising concern about future trends in rice production. \{SSNM\} has potential for improving yields and nutrient efficiency in irrigated rice to close existing yield gaps. The major challenge for \{SSNM\} will be to retain the success of the approach while reducing the complexity of the technology as it is disseminated to farmers. The nature of the approach will need to be tailored to specific circumstances in different countries. In some areas, \{SSNM\} may be field or farm specific, but in many areas it is likely to be just region and season-specific. "

These losses can be reused downstream and do not necessarily lead to true water depletion at the irrigation system level. Because of this potential for reuse, the general efficiency of water use can increase with increasing spatial scale. To test this hypothesis, a multi-scale water accounting study was undertaken in District I of the rice-based Upper Pampanga River Integrated Irrigation System (UPRIIS) in the Philippines. Daily measurements of all surface water inflows and outflows, rainfall, evapotranspiration, and amounts of water internally reused through check dams and shallow pumping were summed into seasonal totals for 10 spatial scale units ranging from 1500 ha to 18,000 ha. The amount of net surface water input (rainfall plus irrigation) per unit area decreased and the process fraction, depleted fraction, water productivity, and amount of water reuse increased with increasing spatial scale. In total, 57% of all available surface water was reused by check dams and 17% by pumping. The amount of water pumped from the groundwater was 30% of the amount of percolation from rice fields. Because of the reuse of water, the water performance indicators at the district level were quite high: the depleted fraction of available water was 71%, the process fraction of depleted water was 80% (close to the 75% area covered by rice), water productivity with respect to available water was 0.45 kg grain m−3 water, and water productivity with respect to evapotranspiration was 0.8 kg grain m−3 water. Water use in the district can be reduced by cutting down the 49 × 106 m3 uncommitted outflows. The depleted fraction of available water can be increased to 80% or more by a combination of adopting alternate wetting and drying (AWD) and increased pumping to capture percolating water. Water productivity with respect to available water can be increased to 0.83 kg grain m−3 water by a combination of reduced land preparation time, adoption of AWD, and increased fertilizer N use to increase yields.

With shallow to medium groundwater depth (less than 0.5 m deep), rainfed rice yields are close to potential yields with timely sowing in the wet season. With groundwater tables fluctuating mostly between 0.5 and 1.5 m, rainfed yields are 0.5–1 Mg ha−1 lower than potential yields with timely sowing. The decrease in yield with late sowing sets in earlier and proceeds faster with deeper groundwater depths. Deep tillage and supplementary irrigation increase yield more with deep groundwater tables than with shallow groundwater tables, but N fertilisation increases yield more with shallow than with deep groundwater tables.

Statistically significant yield increases are demonstrated for \{RHC\} addition in irrigated rice cultivation (33% increase in paddy rice yield for a 41.5 t (dry weight) \{RHC\} application per hectare). The carbon abatement from the \{RHC\} addition is approximately 0.42 t \{CO2\} t−1 rice husk; including energy generation from gasification this increases to ca. 0.86 tCO2 t−1. Assuming a carbon value of $5 t \{CO2\} t−1, and agronomic value of $3 t−1 \{RHC\} based on the field trials, the economic value of the \{RHC\} varies from $9 t−1 (including only recalcitrant carbon) to $15 t−1 (including avoided emissions from energy production). We summarise results from parts I and II, concluding that the gasification–biochar system meets many of the criteria of sustainability, but requires better waste water management and more field trials to demonstrate repeatable agronomic efficacy of \{RHC\} application.

However, in this region there is very limited information available about water use efficiency across spatial levels in irrigation systems. This study quantifies the volume of water reuse and its related cost-benefits at five different spatial levels, ranging from 1500 ha to 18,000 ha, under gravity-fed irrigation system in Upper Pumpanga River Integrated Irrigation System (UPRIIS), Philippines. The major sources of water reuse are considered, namely groundwater pumping, pumping from creeks, combined use and irrigation supplies from check dams. The volume of water available from all four sources of water reuse was quantified through extensive measurements. Production functions were developed to quantify water-yield relationships and to measure the economic value of water reuse. This study was conducted during the dry season of 2001, which existed from 19 November 2000 until 18 May 2001. The water reuse by pumping and check dams was 7% and 22% of the applied surface water at District 1 level. The reuse of surface water through check dams increased linearly with 4.6 Mm3 per added 1000 ha. Similarly, the total amount of reused water from pumping is equivalent to 30% of the water lost through rice evapotranspiration during the dry season 2001. The results showed that water reuse plays a dominant role in growing a rice crop during the dry season. The result showed no difference in pumping costs between the creek (US$0.011/m3) and shallow pumps (US$0.012/m3). The marginal value of productivity (MVP) of water reuse from creek (US$0.044/m3) was slightly higher than the water reuse through the pumping ground water (US$0.039/m3). Results also indicated that the total volume pumped per ha (m3/ha) was ranging from 0.39 to 6.93 m3/ha during the dry season. The results clearly indicate that the quantification of amount of water reuse is very crucial for understanding and finding of water use efficiency at the irrigation system level. The results also revealed that rice production systems are still profitable despite high pumping costs and other associated expenses at all spatial levels in District 1. More than 1500 farmers, from a total of 10,000, use 1154 pumps to draw water from shallow tube wells (or from drains and creeks) for supplementary irrigation at a District level. Reuse of water plays a vital role in growing a profitable rice crop during the dry season. "

Percolation losses from fields with relatively low subsoil permeability (ks,sub &lt; 10−1 cm d−1) are either limited by a poorly permeable plow sole (ks, top &lt; 10−2 cm d−1) or by the low hydraulic conductivity of the subsoil itself. Typical percolation losses of 0–0.5 and 1–1.5 cm·d−1 respectively are hardly affected by ponded water depth, subsurface water content and depth of ground water table. Percolation losses from fields with relatively high subsoil permeability (ks,sub101 cm·d−1) may vary from 0–0.5 cm d−1 with a poorly permeable plow sole, to 1–5 cm·d−1 or more for a relatively permeable plow sole (ks, top10−2 cm d−1). Only in the latter case, percolation rates are largely affected by the depth of ponded water. Next, the constancy of combined \{SP\} rates was studied in a field experiment on a permeable subsoil. Simple book-keeping of the water balance using a fixed \{SP\} rate proved accurate to predict the depth of ponded water in time in case of a poorly permeable plow sole and a small seepage component. A decision tree was suggested based on soil-hydraulic properties and characteristics of bunds to estimate the magnitude and variation of \{SP\} rates, and to decide whether book-keeping with a fixed \{SP\} rate is an appropriate tool in monitoring the water balance of paddy fields.

How rice responds to high night-time temperature (HNT) is largely unknown. This study presents the first effort to assess the response of tropical hybrid rice to HNT. Six commercial tropical hybrid rice cultivars together with a tolerant (N22-aus) and a susceptible (Gharib-indica) genotype were evaluated under control temperature (23 °C) and \{HNT\} (29 °C) starting from panicle initiation until maturity under field conditions at the International Rice Research Institute during the dry (DS) and wet (WS) seasons of 2013. Overall, \{HNT\} significantly decreased grain yield of Gharib and all tested hybrids across both seasons, with less average reduction in the \{DS\} (13.4%) than in the \{WS\} (18.6%). Among the yield components, spikelets m−2 most significantly contributed to yield variation under control and/or \{HNT\} during both \{DS\} and \{WS\} followed by grain weight, while the contribution of seed-set was low and season-specific. Grain quality in most hybrids was also strongly affected by HNT, with decreased head rice yield, increased chalkiness and reduced grain width. Given this vulnerability to HNT, there is an urgent need to explore options for improving the adaptation of rice hybrids to increasingly warmer nights. "

The economic benefit from a reduction in the length of the breeding cycle for rice in Northeast Thailand is evaluated here using a cost-benefit analysis. The economic benefit from completing the current breeding cycle 2 years earlier was found to be of the order of $18 million dollars over the useful life of the variety. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the benefits are particularly sensitive to the discount rate, the number of years required for full adoption, the yield increase over current varieties and the maximum area under improved varieties. Economic trade-off between early completion of breeding and the required yield increase to maintain the economic benefits was assessed. The results highlight the potential value of institutional reforms that will make varieties available to farmers earlier by reducing the length of the breeding cycle and the time required for formal release of varieties. Implications for the design of extension strategies to reduce the adoption lag are also discussed. "

abstract = "Abstract This review addresses possible adaptation strategies in rice production to abiotic stresses that will aggravate under climate change: heat (high temperature and humidity), drought, salinity, and submergence. Each stress is discussed regarding the current state of knowledge on damage mechanism for rice plants as well as possible developments in germplasm and crop management technologies to overcome production losses. Higher temperatures can adversely affect rice yields through two principal pathways, namely (i) high maximum temperatures that cause—in combination with high humidity—spikelet sterility and adversely affect grain quality and (ii) increased nighttime temperatures that may reduce assimilate accumulation. On the other hand, some rice cultivars are grown in extremely hot environments, so that the development of rice germplasm with improved heat resistance can capture an enormous genetic pool for this trait. Likewise, drought is a common phenomenon in many rice growing environments, and agriculture research has achieved considerable progress in terms of germplasm improvement and crop management (i.e., water saving techniques) to cope with the complexity of the drought syndrome. Rice is highly sensitive to salinity. Salinity often coincides with other stresses in rice production, namely drought in inland areas or submergence in coastal areas. Submergence tolerance of rice plants has substantially been improved by introgressing the Sub1 gene into popular rice cultivars in many Asian rice growing areas. Finally, the review comprises a comparative assessment of the rice versus other crops related to climate change. The rice crop has many unique features in terms of susceptibility and adaptation to climate change impacts due to its semiaquatic phylogenetic origin. The bulk of global rice supply originates from irrigated systems which are to some extent shielded from immediate drought effects. The buffer effect of irrigation against climate change impacts, however, will depend on nature and state of the respective irrigation system. The envisaged propagation of irrigation water saving techniques will entail benefits for the resilience of rice production systems to future droughts. We conclude that there are considerable risks for rice production stemming from climate change, but that the development of necessary adaptation options can capitalize on an enormous variety of rice production systems in very different climates and on encouraging progress in recent research.

One such property, gelatinisation temperature, has been studied at the genetic, biochemical and phenotypic level. A technique, the ‘log(number distribution) approach’, offers a means of collecting normalisation-free representations of the chain-length distributions of starch, with the potential to reveal new information about kinetics and processes of starch synthesis; this method of plotting the data can potentially reveal much more than that usually employed, viz., the simple number chain-length distribution. In this study, samples from genotypes with defined mutations in starch biosynthetic genes that specifically and differently alter the chain-length distribution of single-cluster chains, with a resultant effect on gelatinisation temperature, are used to show that log(number distribution) plots have sufficient discriminative capacity to diagnose the gene affected by mutations, provide new information, and determine those features of the plot which associate with genotype and phenotype.

Because of concerns about excessive and injudicious use of herbicides, cultural weed management approaches that are safe and economical are needed. Developing such approaches will require a better understanding of weed biology and ecology, as well as of weed response to increases in crop density and nutrition. Knowledge of the effects of nitrogen (N) fertilizer on crop-weed competitive interactions could also help in the development of integrated weed management strategies. The present study was conducted in a screenhouse to determine the effects of rice planting density (0, 5, 10, and 20 plants pot−1) and N rate (0, 50, 100, and 150 kg ha−1) on the growth of C. iria. Tiller number per plant decreased by 73–88%, leaf number by 85–94%, leaf area by 85–98%, leaf biomass by 92–99%, and inflorescence biomass by 96–99% when weed plants were grown at 20 rice plants pot−1 (i.e., 400 plants m−2) compared with weed plants grown alone. All of these parameters increased when N rates were increased. On average, weed biomass increased by 118–389% and rice biomass by 121–275% with application of 50–150 kg N ha−1, compared to control. Addition of N favored weed biomass production relative to rice biomass. Increased N rates reduced the root-to-shoot weight ratio of C. iria. Rice interference reduced weed growth and biomass and completely suppressed C. iria when no N was applied at high planting densities (i.e., 20 plants pot−1). The weed showed phenotypic plasticity in response to N application, and the addition of N increased the competitive ability of the weed over rice at densities of 5 and 10 rice plants pot−1 compared with 20 plants pot−1. The results of the present study suggest that high rice density (i.e., 400 plants m−2) can help suppress C. iria growth even at high N rates (150 kg ha−1). "

Lines were selected based on plant traits or on grain yield measured in a breeder's replicated yield trial. The main target traits for selection were plant height, leaf and panicle morphology, grain size, total dry weight, and grain-filling percentage. Yield performance of trait-based selection was compared with that of yield-based selection in an agronomic trial with optimum crop management for three seasons. Trait-based selection increased leaf area index and total dry weight but reduced spikelet number per m2 and harvest index compared with yield-based selection. Consequently, selection based on plant traits did not increase grain yield compared with selection based on yield per se. In one of the three seasons, yield of trait-based selection was significantly lower than that of yield-based selection. Among all tested breeding lines, maximum yield was produced by yield-based selection and minimum yield came from trait-based selection. These results suggest that lines with ideotype traits did not express higher grain yield than lines selected based on yield per se under optimal crop management conditions, and yield-based selection was as effective in increasing rice grain yield as trait-based selection in the late generations of the breeding cycle.

Results show that both HD-5 and LJ-7 produced higher grain yield, took up higher amount of N from the soil, and exhibited higher \{NUE\} than NJ-7 or YJ-4 at lower N rates (0, 100 or 200 kg ha−1). Grain yield and \{NUE\} were comparable among the four varieties at the N rate of 300 kg ha−1.

Our results suggest that HD-5 and LJ-7 can maintain grain yield at lower N rates as N-efficient varieties. The shoot and root traits, especially the deeper roots, greater root oxidation activity and higher photosynthetic \{NUE\} at lower N rates, could be used in selection for N-efficient rice varieties.

abstract = "Field-scale variation in soil fertility can be a major source of uneven crop growth on acid soils of the humid tropics, but this has not received much research attention. We used factorial kriging (FKA) to analyze processes causing spatial variation in soil chemical properties (pH, P, K, Na, Ca, Mg, Al) measured at two depths within a single field on an acid Ultisol in the Philippines. A linear model of coregionalization comprising (i) a nugget effect, (ii) a spherical structure with a range of 20 m, and (iii) a linear structure was fitted to the experimental auto- and cross-variograms of the topsoil properties. Variograms for subsoil variables were modeled using a nugget effect plus a linear structure. Regionalized factors associated with short- and long-range variation were then mapped and formed the basis for a conceptual model of soil formation and soil variation at the study site. Patchy inputs of nutrients from buffalo excrement have led to pronounced short-range variation in P, Ca, Mg, and K concentrations in the topsoil. The effects of these are superimposed on long-range processes operating along the topographic slope. The latter include vertical and lateral water flow causing translocation of basic and acidic cations. Leaching of acidity along the major directions of the field slope seems to be a process of general importance in sloping lands of the humid tropics. Amelioration of soil acidity as well as design of field experiments have to account for this kind of slope-dependent systematic soil variation. Combining pedological expert knowledge with techniques such as \{FKA\} helps to explore complex processes in a quantitative way. "

abstract = "Water shortage in drought-prone rice-growing areas of the world is threatening conventional irrigated rice production systems, in which rice is transplanted into fields where standing water is maintained until harvest. Aerobic rice production systems, in which rice is grown as a direct-seeded upland crop without flooding, require less water than conventional systems, but the transition to aerobic rice systems is impeded by severe weed infestation. An environmentally friendly and less labor-intensive weed control method needs to be introduced to aerobic rice farmers. A study was conducted at the International Rice Research Institute in the 2003 wet season and 2004 dry season to evaluate the effects of genotype, seeding rate, seed priming and their interactions on vegetative growth, yield and weed suppression. Three contrasting aerobic rice genotypes differing in yield and weed-suppressive ability (WSA) were grown at three seeding rates (100, 300 and 500 viable seeds m−2) with or without seed priming under two weed management treatments (weed-free and weedy) in a split-plot design. In 2004, the overall weed pressure was higher than in 2003, and consequently treatment effects in this year were more distinct than in 2003. No significant interactions among the experimental factors were found for crop yield, weed biomass, leaf area index, tiller number and vegetative crop biomass. Raising seeding rate from 100 to 300 viable seeds m−2 resulted in a significant increase in yield and a decrease in weed biomass, whereas a further increase from 300 to 500 viable seeds m−2 did not result in a further improvement in yield and weed suppression. The stronger \{WSA\} of genotype Apo than that of genotypes IR60080-46A and \{IRAT\} 216 related to a stronger competitive ability of individual plants and a faster canopy closure (0.5–6 days earlier). The \{WSA\} of weakly competitive genotypes was partially compensated for by a higher seeding rate. Seed priming, which was only evaluated in 2003, accelerated emergence by 2 days and slightly enhanced early crop growth, but had no significant effect on yield and weed suppression. The present study suggests that combining a weed-suppressive genotype with an optimum seeding rate can serve as a tool to manage weeds. "

Surviving such stresses over a long evolutionary scale led plants to acquire mechanisms by which they can sensitively perceive incoming stresses and regulate their physiology accordingly. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays a major role in plant responses to stress. Although rapid production of \{ABA\} in response to drought and salt stresses is essential to define \{ABA\} as a stress hormone, an equally rapid catabolism of \{ABA\} when such stresses are relieved is also essential in that role. Since \{ABA\} mediates so many stress responses, the initial perception of dehydration and the subsequent changes in gene expression that lead to rapid \{ABA\} biosynthesis constitute the most important stress signal transduction pathway among all the plant responses to stresses. Identification of the genes involved and understanding their roles during stress perception and physiological regulation has become an important and exciting research field in recent years. This review covers mainly our understanding of this aspect. ABA-induced changes in gene expression and their roles in physiological regulation are dealt with in less detail. "

Weed-competitive cultivars will be critical to the adoption of aerobic rice production by farmers. Breeding weed-competitive cultivars requires an easily used selection protocol, preferably based on traits that can be measured under weed-free conditions. To develop such an indirect selection index for weed competitiveness, 40 rice cultivars were evaluated in aerobic soil conditions in a weed-free environment in 2003 and in weedy environments over 3 years (2001–2003). Broad-sense heritabilities (H) of vegetative and harvest traits and their genetic correlation with weed biomass and yield under weed competition were estimated. All the traits measured under weed-free conditions were closely correlated with the same traits measured under weedy conditions. Crop vigor ratings at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after sowing (WAS), canopy ground cover at 6 WAS, height at 3 and 4 WAS, tillers per plant at 4 and 8 WAS, vegetative crop biomass at 4 and 9 \{WAS\} and plant erectness at 3 \{WAS\} under weed-free conditions in 2003 were all positively correlated with means for yield under weed competition and negatively with means for weed biomass across three years. In general, traits associated with rapid seedling biomass accumulation were also strongly associated with weed suppression and yield under weed competition. Regression analysis revealed that yield and early vigor under weed-free conditions in a single three-replicate trial could be used together in an indirect selection index, explaining 89% and 48% of variation for yield under weed competition and weed biomass, respectively. The predicted indirect selection efficiencies of weed-free yield and vigor ratings as selection criteria for yield under weed competition and weed biomass were high. Visual vigor rating at 4 \{WAS\} is the best vegetative trait as an indirect selection criterion for use together with weed-free yield, but it could be replaced by plant height at 4 \{WAS\} without loss in selection effectiveness.

Besides direct interaction with plant pathogens, bioagents have been reported to induce systemic resistance in plants. In the present study, a large number of Trichoderma sp. and pseudomonad isolates were evaluated for their efficacy to control Fusarium wilt of tomato. T. harzianum was multiplied on six different substrates out of which Jhangora, an undertilized grain crop, proved to be the superior substrate. Application of T. harzianum and fluorescent Pseudomonas by seed bio-priming significantly increased seed germination (22–48%) and reduced the days required for germination (2.0–2.5 days). All bioagents used in this study significantly reduced the incidence of wilt in pot and field trials and combinations of bioagents were more effective than single isolate treatments. The combination of fluorescent Pseudomonas, T. harzianum and \{AMF\} provided significantly better control than uninoculated treatment, reducing disease incidence and severity by 74% and 67% in pots and field, respectively. The combination treatments also increased yield by 20%. Addition of cow dung compost (CDC) further reduced disease and improved yield in all treatments.

The sequential applications of all preemergence and postemergence herbicides reduced weed density and biomass by 80–100% compared to the nontreated plots. The sole application of postemergence herbicides reduced weed density by only 44–54% and weed biomass by 51–61%, whereas oxadiazon alone reduced weed density and biomass by 96–100%. All herbicide treatments and manual weeding significantly affected tiller number, biomass, crop growth rate, agronomic indices, yield-contributing parameters (panicle density and filled grains), and yield (biological and grain) of rice. The highest grain yield was obtained in the manually weeded plots (5.9–6.1 t ha−1) and the plots treated with oxadiazon alone (5.4–5.6 t ha−1) and oxadiazon followed by postemergence herbicides (5.2–5.8 t ha−1). The lowest paddy yield (0.22 t ha−1) was achieved in the nontreated plots followed by the plots treated with the sole application of bispyribac-sodium and fenoxaprop + ethoxysulfuron. The results suggest that oxadiazon is the best broad-spectrum and economically effective herbicide when applied alone or in combination with other effective postemergence herbicides with different modes of action, depending on the weed species present in the field.

All herbicides provided 100% control of Echinochloa colona, Echinochloa crus-galli, Leptochloa chinensis, Cyperus iria, and Amaranthus spinosus. Murdannia nudiflora was 100% controlled by oxadiazon and pretilachlor with safener, but poorly controlled (22–75%) by pendimethalin. Pendimethalin at 2 kg ai ha−1 was more effective than at 1 kg ai ha−1 in reducing the biomass of the stem, leaf, and root of M. nudiflora irrespective of timing of soil saturation. Rice plant height was reduced to a maximum (77–96%) by pendimethalin at 2.0 kg ai ha−1 followed by oxadiazon at 1.0 kg ai ha−1 (38–70%) compared to the non-treated control. In contrast, the tallest rice plants were observed in the non-treated control and those treated with pretilachlor with safener which had 80–100% rice plant survival. The lowest rice plant survival of 0, 6, 7, and 16% was found in the soil applied with pendimethalin at 2 kg ai ha−1 and saturated at 1, 3, 5, and 7 DAS, respectively, which was followed by oxadiazon at 1 kg ai ha−1. All herbicides except pretilachlor with safener reduced \{SPAD\} values with early soil saturation, which improved with delay in soil saturation timing. Pendimethalin at 2 kg ai ha−1 reduced the \{SPAD\} values of rice plants by 100–164% relative to the non-treated control and produced the highest phytotoxicity symptoms. Pendimethalin also reduced rice shoot biomass more than oxadiazon, which was compounded by early soil saturation after herbicide application. Pretilachlor with safener was the only herbicide that exhibited low phytotoxic symptoms on rice plants and did not reduce leaf, stem, root, and shoot biomass of rice. Percent reduction in rice leaf, stem, root, and shoot biomass by the different herbicides was in the order of pendimethalin 2 &gt; oxadiazon 1 &gt; pendimethalin 1 &gt; oxadiazon 0.5 &gt; pretilachlor with safener 0.6 kg ai ha−1. Each herbicide treatment reduced rice growth parameters as soil saturation was delayed in the order of 1 DAS &gt; 3 DAS &gt; 5 DAS &gt; 7 DAS. The study suggests that soil water content and herbicide rates are important factors in influencing herbicide phytotoxicity in rice. The application of herbicides should be avoided when the soil is too wet, and irrigation should be delayed at least one week after herbicide application. "

This study investigated if and how irrigation regimes could synergisticly interact with nitrogen (N) rates to increse grain yield, water use effciency (WUE) and N use effciency (NUE) in rice. A field experiment was conducted with three N rates, 100 (low amount, LN), 200 (normal amount, NN) and 300 kg ha−1 (high amount, HN), and three irrigation regimes, alternate wetting and moderate drying (AWMD), alternate wetting and severe drying (AWSD) and continuously flooded (CF). Among the three N rates, both grain yield and \{WUE\} were the lowest at \{LN\} in all the irrigation regimes, were the highest at \{NN\} in the \{CF\} regime and at \{HN\} in the \{AWSD\} regime, and showed no significant difference between \{NN\} and \{HN\} in the \{AWMD\} regime. Either internal N use efficiency or N partial factor productivity (PFPN) decreased with the increase of N rates. At the same N rate, the \{AWMD\} regime showed the highest grain yield, \{WUE\} and \{PFPN\} among the three irrigation regimes. Reduced unproductive tillers, enhanced root growth and increased harvest index contributed to a higher grain yield and higher resource use efficiency in the \{AWMD\} regime, especially at NN. The results indicate that adoption of an \{AWMD\} regime with an appropriate N rate can achieve a higher grian yield, \{WUE\} and NUE, and an increase in N rate can reduce the yield loss in an \{AWSD\} regime.

Cleome species have shown a cytological developmental progression from \{C3\} to \{C4\} photosynthesis. Hence, a better understanding of growth responses of the weed in rice is critical in developing sustainable integrated management approaches for the suppression of this weed. Physiological and morphological changes of C. rutidosperma were studied in a pot experiment by growing the weed alone (1 plant per pot; 0.045 m2) and in competition with 4, 8, 12, and 16 plants per pot of two rice cultivars namely, \{IR64\} and SACG4, in separate pots. The plant height of C. rutidosperma was not affected by the rice density or cultivar, and the height increased linearly with increasing time. The leaf area production of the lower half of the weed was reduced by 80–88% when grown with 12 and 16 rice plants compared to that grown without rice interference. Rice interference at the density of 16 plants per pot reduced leaf biomass of the weed by 92%, inflorescence biomass by 93%, stems biomass by 90%, and root biomass by 92% compared to the weed plants grown alone. The leaf and stem biomass allocation was higher to the lower half of the weed than that to the upper half, when grown in competition with rice. The specific stem length of C. rutidosperma increased by 84% in the presence of 12 rice plants (sowing density 60 kg/ha) compared to 4 plants (sowing density 20 kg/ha), indicating the change in resource allocation to stem elongation to enable the weed to compete effectively under shade to acquire light. However, the relative growth rate of the weed declined by 28% and 54% in the presence of 16 rice plants (sowing density of 80 kg/ha) during 3–5 and 5–7 weeks after sowing, respectively, compared to when the weed was grown without rice interference, reflecting less competitiveness of the weed for the resource acquisition under crop competition. The results of this study showed that the rice interference alone can reduce the weed's growth to a great extent. Therefore, the need of integration of other management practices in dry-seeded rice along with crop interference is highlighted to achieve complete control of C. rutidosperma and similar weeds. "

Five widely different diseases were considered, caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses, which have different disease-site and epidemiological attributes. \{EPIRICE\} is a simple Suscept-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model, parameterized using literature data for each of the five diseases, and combined with a few, simplified, characteristics of the growing crop (establishment, growth, senescence). Simulated outputs were tested against published disease progress curves, using visual and statistical, parametric and non-parametric, methods. Despite its simplicity, the model generates potential disease progress curves that concur with the literature. The model was linked to a \{GIS\} involving crop establishment date and daily climate data over a 12-year period of time. Successive epidemics were simulated at locations across the world, and their means and variances at each location were analyzed. Using rice as a model crop system, our results provide a proof of concept that it is possible to (1) use the same model (2) at different levels of plant and crop hierarchy, in order to (3) simulate and map potential plant disease epidemics globally. Further developments of this approach are discussed. The study also underscores the dearth of publicly available field data. "

abstract = "Abstract With increasing labor and water scarcity throughout Asia, there is a need to find alternative rice establishment methods to the traditional practice of manual transplanting into puddled soil. Therefore, field experiments were conducted to compare different rice establishment methods under safe alternate wetting and drying (AWD) water management (irrigation when soil water tension increased to 10 kPa at a depth of 15 cm). Rice yield and grain quality were not affected by planting method (direct (wet or dry) seeding or transplanting) or tillage method (dry tillage or puddling) in both the wet and dry seasons, except for significantly lower yield of wet seeded rice in dry tilled soil due to poor establishment. Dry seeding and transplanting into dry tilled soil had significantly lower total irrigation input (by about 10%) than all other establishment methods. Puddling increased total irrigation input to both transplanted and wet seeded rice in comparison with dry tillage, mainly because of the large amount of water required for soil soaking/puddling. Irrigation input to direct (wet) seeded rice in puddled soil was much higher than for any other establishment method because of both the longer duration in the field and the water requirement for puddling, which resulted in low irrigation and input water productivity. There was no significant effect of establishment method on N use efficiency except for wet seeded rice (WSR) on dry tilled soil, primarily because of the low yield. The results show that with safe \{AWD\} water management on a highly permeable soil, avoiding puddling reduces irrigation input by about 10%, but that there is no further reduction in irrigation input by changing from transplanting to dry seeding, in contrast with the findings from less permeable soils. This, together with the poor establishment of wet seeded rice, in contrast with the findings of others, indicates the importance of taking soil and site characteristics into consideration in the selection of a crop establishment method. Further evaluation of crop establishment methods under a wider range of site conditions is needed to characterize establishment method in terms of yield, irrigation input and water productivity. "

Marker‐trait associations have been established for a diverse array of traits in these crops, and research on marker/quantitative trait loci (QTL) validation and refinement is increasingly common. Researchers are now routinely using candidate gene‐based mapping and genome‐wide linkage disequilibrium and association analysis in addition to classical \{QTL\} mapping to identify markers broadly applicable to breeding programs. Marker‐assisted selection (MAS) is practiced for enhancing various host plant resistances, several quality traits, and a number of abiotic stress tolerances in many well‐researched crops. Markers are also increasingly used to transfer yield or quality‐ enhancing \{QTL\} alleles from wild relatives to elite cultivars. Large‐scale MAS‐based breeding programs for crops such as rice, maize, wheat, barley, pearl millet, and common bean have already been initiated worldwide. Advances in “omics” technologies are now assisting researchers to address complex biological issues of significant agricultural importance: modeling genotype‐by‐environment interaction; fine‐mapping, cloning, and pyramiding of QTL; gene expression analysis and gene function elucidation; dissecting the genetic structure of germplasm collections to mine novel alleles and develop genetically structured trait‐based core collections; and understanding the molecular basis of heterosis. The challenge now is to translate and integrate this knowledge into appropriate tools and methodologies for plant breeding programs. The role of computational tools in achieving this is becoming increasingly important.

Conservation agriculture (CA)-based resource-conserving technologies (RCTs) vis-à-vis zero-till (ZT), raised-bed planting and direct-seeded rice (DSR) have shown promise as alternatives to conventional production technologies to overcome these problems. The integration of CA-based \{RCTs\} with precision agriculture (PA)-based technologies in a systems perspective could provide a better option for sustainable \{RW\} production systems. In this study we attempted to evaluate conservation and precision agriculture (CPA)-based \{RCTs\} as a double-ZT system integrated with laser-assisted precision land leveling (PLL) in the \{RW\} system. A field experiment was conducted in the western \{IGP\} for 2 years to evaluate various tillage and crop establishment methods under \{PLL\} and traditional land leveling (TLL) practices to improve water productivity, economic profitability and soil physical quality. Irrespective of tillage and crop establishment methods (TCE), \{PLL\} improved \{RW\} system productivity by 7.4% in year 2 as compared to traditional land leveling. Total irrigation water savings under \{PLL\} versus \{TLL\} were 12–14% in rice and 10–13% in wheat. \{PLL\} improved \{RW\} system profitability by US$113 ha−1 (year 1) to $175 ha−1 (year 2). Yields were higher in conventionally transplanted rice followed by direct-drill-seeded rice after ZT. In wheat, yields were higher in \{ZT\} when followed by \{DSR\} than in the conventional-till (CT) system. \{RW\} system productivity under double \{ZT\} was equivalent to that of the conventional method. Among different TCE, conventional puddled-transplanted rice-CT wheat required 12–33% more water than other \{TCE\} techniques. Compared with \{CT\} systems, double \{ZT\} consumed 12–20% less water with almost equal system productivity and demonstrated higher water productivity. The \{CT\} system had higher bulk density and penetration resistance in 10–15 and 15–20 cm soil layers due to compaction caused by the repeated wet tillage in rice. The steady-state infiltration rate and soil aggregation (&gt;0.25 mm) were higher under permanent beds and double \{ZT\} and lower in the \{CT\} system. Under CT, soil aggregation was static across seasons, whereas it improved under double no-till and permanent beds. Similarly, mean weight diameter of aggregates was higher under double \{ZT\} and permanent beds and increased over time. The study reveals that to sustain the \{RW\} system, CPA-based \{RCTs\} could be more viable options: however, the long-term effects of these alternative technologies need to be studied under varying agro-ecologies.

This is especially critical in rainfed lowlands where floods can occur immediately after sowing, creating anaerobic conditions during germination and early seedling growth. Developing rice cultivars that can germinate in flooded soils will ensure good crop establishment. Several major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for tolerance of anaerobic conditions during germination (anaerobic germination; AG) were identified from different landraces; and near isogenic lines (NILs) containing one of these \{QTLs\} (qAG-9-2, AG1) in the background of \{IR64\} were developed. This study is an attempt to determine the effectiveness of \{AG1\} \{QTL\} in improving germination of two IR64-AG NILs; \{IR\} 93312-30-101-20-3-66-6 (IR64–AG131) and IR93312-30-101-20-13-64-21 (IR64-AG132) sown under flooded conditions. The study also evaluated selected agronomic practices anticipated to further enhance crop establishment in flooded soils. IR64-AG \{NILs\} showed 81% and 217% higher plant populations over IR64-Sub1 and IR64, respectively, and this was also reflected as significantly higher grain yields. IR64-AG \{NILs\} mobilized relatively more starch into soluble sugars while submerged and maintained higher soluble sugar supply to the developing embryo resulting in faster and higher germination rates than the non-AG genotypes. Agronomic manipulations like higher seed rate (60 kg ha−1), better seeding methods and nutrient application improved seedling growth after germination and emergence, increasing plant height, leaf area, number of tillers and biomass accumulation. These improvements were reflected as higher grain yield even in the intolerant cultivar IR64. Application of 20% more phosphorus with the recommended N-P-K resulted in 21%, 16% and 19% higher grain yield in IR64-AG, IR64-Sub1 and IR64, respectively, over the control. The results established that combining proper crop establishment practices with tolerant genotype could enhance crop establishment in flooded soils using direct seeding methods, with consequent reduction in production costs and water use and subsequent increase in farmers’ income.

The complex nature of drought tolerance, genotype × environment interaction, and the difficulty of effective drought tolerance screening complicate the development of drought tolerant varieties. This study reports on progress made by a collaborative network of Indian rice breeding programs, in partnership with International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), to develop lines combining high yield potential with drought tolerance by employing direct selection for grain yield under drought stress, and testing their performance in rainy season managed-drought screenings (RSMDS) of different stress severity levels at several locations during the main season in rainfed rice production areas in India. Advanced-generation breeding lines of less than 100 days, 100–120 days, and greater than 120 days duration generated at eight national institutes and \{IRRI\} using diverse drought tolerant donors were evaluated in 2005–2007 under RSMDS. Stress was imposed at the reproductive stage, either by draining paddies shortly after transplanting for lowland trials, or by stopping irrigation before flowering for upland trials. Yield reduction of 34–53% under moderate stress and 65–88% under severe stress was achieved in comparison to irrigated controls. Several varieties that have been widely grown in rainfed environments in India for many years, including \{IR\} 36, \{IR\} 64, Mahamaya, Sambha Mahsuri, and Swarna, were shown to be highly susceptible. Breeding lines were identified that perform consistently better than these and other widely grown rainfed varieties under both moderate and severe drought stress without any yield penalty under fully irrigated conditions. In the combined analysis over locations and years, these promising breeding lines outyielded the widely grown controls by about 0.5 t ha−1 under moderate stress and 0.7–1.0 t ha−1 under severe stress. \{IRRI\} breeding lines contributed to the network were developed using a selection protocol involving replicated dry season managed-drought screening (DSMDS) in dry season at Los Banos, Philippines. For a subset of lines extensively tested both at \{IRRI\} and in India, correlations between yield under \{DSMDS\} in the Philippine and yield in \{RSMDS\} in India were moderately high, indicating the efficacy of dry-season \{MS\} screening at \{IRRI\} in identifying tolerant lines for India. Drought tolerant lines developed by the network members have been released in several Indian states and in the Philippines. Overall, these results indicate that managed stress screening for drought tolerance, with a focus on selection for yield under stress, is effective in generating drought-tolerant cultivars. "

Wild food plants are important elements of biodiversity in rice fields and are critical components to the subsistence of poor farmers. The spatial and seasonal distribution of wild food plants were analysed across different sub-systems occurring within paddy ecosystems in two adjacent rice farming villages in Kalasin, Northeast Thailand. Data were collected in 102 sampling sites corresponding to seven sub-systems including tree rows, mounds, field margins, shelters, ponds, pond margins and levees. Frequency of occurrence and absolute abundance were quantified for each species in the two seasons of two years, and data on uses of wild food plant species were collected through focus group discussions. A total of 42 species from 28 botanical families were reported, and one third of these have been classified as weeds of rice by other authors. Results show that species abundance, frequency of occurrence and diversity varied seasonally and spatially within paddy rice ecosystems. Higher diversity indexes were observed in the monsoon in most sub-systems. The most diverse sub-systems in the monsoon were shelters, mounds and pond margins, and tree rows and mounds in the dry season. Field margins, ponds and levees presented lower diversity, but are habitat of aquatic species important for the local diet, such as Ipomoea aquatica and Marsilea crenata. The herbs Lobelia sp. and Glinus oppositifolius, classified as rice weeds, were most abundant species in the dry season and frequently consumed. Leucaena leucocephala, of which the roots, leaves and fruits are commonly consumed as vegetable, was the most abundant tree in most sub-systems. More than half of the species were specific to one or two sub-systems due to particular niche requirements. Three quarters of wild food plant species had additional uses besides food; with ten different types of use and multiple use categories occurring in the different sub-systems. This study highlights that the development of more productive lowland rice systems may jeopardize the diversity of wild food plant species in the rice landscape, which is important for the food security of the rural poor.

The diurnal and seasonal variations of \{CH4\} emissions over the whole cropping period of 2013 dry season were characterized. Clear diurnal cycles of \{CH4\} fluxes were observed during the different growth stages of the rice plant (vegetative, reproductive, and ripening). Methane flux started to increase at around 0800H, reached a peak at around 1300–1500H, and then decreased to low values after 1900H. Peak \{CH4\} flux (mean ± standard deviation) was 0.082 ± 0.048 μmol \{CH4\} m−2 s−1 during the vegetative stage (0–37 days after transplanting, DAT); 0.063 ± 0.021 μmol \{CH4\} m−2 s−1 during the reproductive stage (38–72 DAT); and 0.060 ± 0.033 μmol \{CH4\} m−2 s−1 during the ripening stage (73–103 DAT). The diurnal cycles were influenced by temperature (air, floodwater, and soil), surface energy flux (net radiation, soil heat flux, sensible heat flux, and latent heat flux), and ecosystem \{CO2\} exchange (photosynthesis and respiration). The seasonal variations in daily \{CH4\} emissions were primarily controlled by water management and the growth of the rice plants. This study has shown that intermittent irrigation during the vegetative stage was an effective water management strategy to lower the seasonal \{CH4\} emissions to about 3.26 g C m−2. The irrigated rice field sequestered 306.45 g C m−2 of \{CO2\} from the atmosphere, released 3.03 g C m−2 of \{CH4\} to the atmosphere during the growing period, and produced a grain yield of 5.44 Mg ha−1. Considering a global warming potential (GWP) of 25 over a 100-year horizon, we accounted for the C footprint during the growing period: the irrigated rice field has taken up 1.88 kg \{CO2\} equiv. per kg of grain produced. Additionally, the irrigated rice field had a net biome productivity of 17.22 g C m−2 and it is a C sink. "

The eddy covariance method was employed for the first time to monitor its environmental impacts on the seasonal variations of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from irrigated lowland rice ecosystems over the entire cropping period (encompassing land preparation, growing, and fallow) during the dry (DS) and wet (WS) seasons in 2013 and 2014. The continuous incorporation of rice straw increased both the average and cumulative \{CH4\} fluxes during land preparation and vegetative growth stage through successive cropping seasons. The cumulative seasonal gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Re) as well as the seasonal Re/GPP ratio also increased through time, which shows that the amount of \{CO2\} emissions became higher relative to the \{CO2\} taken up by the rice plants. This clearly indicates the cumulative effect of residual rice straw from its continuous incorporation in the soil. Results further showed that the annual net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB) for 2013 (984 kg C ha−1) and 2014 (740 kg C ha−1) were both positive, indicating that the irrigated lowland rice ecosystem was a net C sink for both cropping periods. However, it should be noted that the \{NECB\} values decreased from 2013 to 2014 due to a decrease in the annual net ecosystem production (NEP) brought about by higher \{CO2\} emissions and an increase in the annual \{CH4\} emissions. The annual net greenhouse gas budget (NGHGB) decreased from 348 kg \{CO2\} eq. ha−1 in 2013 to −2052 kg \{CO2\} eq. ha−1 in 2014, indicating that the irrigated lowland rice ecosystem has shifted from being a net \{GHG\} sink to a net \{GHG\} source due to the increase in annual \{CH4\} emissions. It should be noted that \{CH4\} has 25 times higher global warming potential than \{CO2\} (for a 100-year time horizon). The increasing rate of \{CH4\} and \{CO2\} emissions due to continuous rice straw application, such as from combine harvesters, could transform the irrigated lowland rice ecosystem into a net \{GHG\} source as well as a net C source. This study, however, showed that leaving rice straw on the surface of the fields after harvest to undergo partial decomposition under aerobic conditions before soil submergence and incorporation during land preparation could provide a management strategy for reducing \{CH4\} emissions while managing rice straw residues from combine harvesters.

Several varieties were developed and commercialized in this region in recent years, including some salt and stagnant flood (SF, medium deep, 25–50 cm water depth) tolerant varieties. However, suitability of these varieties based on adaptation to local conditions across the region and farmers’ preferences have not been sufficiently evaluated. Genotype by environment analysis leads to identification of varieties with stable performance, or suitability to specific regions. Two frequently used statistical analyses are additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI); and the genotype main effects and genotype × environment interaction effects (GGE). These models were used in this study to identify stable rice varieties for the wet and dry seasons in South Bangladesh. Experiments were conducted at six sites over four years (2010–2013) in coastal Bangladesh, using eight and five varieties for wet and dry season, respectively. The trials were laid in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. Genotypic contribution was much higher than the environmental effect on grain yield in the wet season, while the environmental contribution was much higher than genotypic effect during the dry season. \{SF\} stress affected yield of wet season rice; but in the dry season, salinity stress had major effect on grain yield. The variety \{BRRI\} dhan54 was identified as the most suitable genotype with wider adaptability in the region during the wet season, followed by \{BRRI\} dhan40 and \{BRRI\} dhan53, while \{BRRI\} dhan47 was the most stable variety followed by \{BRRI\} dhan61 and \{BINA\} dhan8 for the dry season across all sites. However, when these varieties were evaluated based on farmers’ preferences in participatory varietal selection, \{BRRI\} dhan53; a short duration variety with medium slender grains was the most preferred, followed by \{BRRI\} dhan54 and \{BRRI\} dhan40 for wet season, and in the dry season \{BRRI\} dhan47 was the most popular variety followed by \{BRRI\} dhan61, which agreed with ranking based on yield. Modern varieties were far superior over traditional varieties based on grain yield and farmers’ preferences, and should be targeted for large-scale seed production and dissemination. "

However, the genetic progress of grain yield in most rice breeding programs was slow in the last decades. Although great progress in rice genomics and molecular biology has been achieved, the effect of such technological innovations on rice breeding is far small. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) for a few target quantitative trait loci (QTLs) has significant effects in improving qualitative traits, such as disease resistance. The success of \{MAS\} has therefore motivated breeders to identify and use major \{QTLs\} for yield and yield component traits. In this review, we summarized the recent methods in \{QTL\} identification, including novel statistical methods for linkage and association mapping, special population types, and whole-genome sequencing. We reviewed the successful application of marker-assisted gene introgression and gene pyramiding to improve grain yield and discussed the design of efficient \{MAS\} schemes to further increase the success rate of breeding programs. The use of well-characterized major \{QTLs\} through introgression and gene pyramiding is proven effective in improving grain yield, particularly yield under abiotic stress. Major \{QTLs\} that are stable across genetic background and growing environments are often found in less adapted germplasms, such as landraces and wild relatives. Advanced backcross \{QTL\} analysis and introgression lines, which integrate \{QTL\} discovery and utilization, are important methods for exploiting major \{QTLs\} contained in such germplasms. Nextgeneration sequencing substantially increases mapping resolution and accelerates the identification of casual genes underlying major QTLs. Practical guidelines derived from theoretical and empirical studies are given to guide the design of efficient marker-assisted gene introgression and pyramiding schemes. "

A systems analytical approach was adopted to increase understanding of damage and to develop a tool that generates disease management recommendations. Field experiments were conducted at three locations in India and The Philippines during the dry and wet seasons from 1991 to 1995, to assess the consequences of various epidemics for growth and production. On the whole, higher and longer epidemics reduced amounts of green leaf area, leading to reduced total above-ground dry matter production and grain yield. Higher nitrogen application rates caused greater grain yields, but also greater grain yield reduction due to BLB. The \{BLIGHT\} crop simulation model, incorporating the effects of \{BLB\} on area and photosynthetic rate of green leaf area at three canopy levels, was successfully tested against three field experiments, and used in scenario studies to quantify the grain yield reduction at harvest due to a certain amount of disease spread earlier in the season. This reduction, defined as damage coefficient (DC), was determined for various crop development stages and for a wide range of environments, epidemics and leaf nitrogen contents. The 216 data sets resulting from the scenario studies were structured by approximation by the ‘hat’-curve, which is characterized by the maximum \{DC\} for a certain scenario, the crop development stage at which this occurs, and a scale parameter that determines the width of the curve. On the average, the \{DC\} reached a maximum of 266 kg grain ha1 leaf abou leaf about mid-way through grain filling. It is concluded that in addition to traditional disease management options such as use of tolerant cultivars and optimizing transplanting dates, careful nitrogen management is a possible tool to limit spread of the disease.

(4) By means of simulation the sensitivity of Makalioka 34, \{IR58\} and \{IR64\} to nitrogen fertilization and temperature is evaluated. The model appears to have a sufficient validity range to produce reliable predictions on dry mass growth as well as nitrogen dynamics for different varieties and under different climatic conditions. It yields slightly better results for \{IR64\} than for \{IR58\} when comparing the standardized bias and standardized mean square error. Field data suggest that the model accurately simulates the effects of nitrogen fertilization in Makalioka 34 but underestimates the relative yield response to N applications in \{IR58\} and IR64. According to the model, \{IR58\} and \{IR64\} seem to be well adapted to the actual temperatures in the Philippines while Makalioka 34 thrives better under lower temperatures. In its present form, the model proves to be a useful tool to investigate and explain the most important processes of yield formation for different rice varieties grown under various agronomic and climatic conditions.

Alternate wet and dry (AWD) water management combined with alternative establishment methods, e.g., zero tillage planting in bed and flat layouts, and residue retention, may substantially reduce rice irrigation water requirement. Field experiments were conducted in a rice–wheat cropping system to evaluate these technologies and to identify the underlying processes responsible for possible reductions in rice yield. Zero till dry seeded rice (DSR) on the flat (DSRF) and on raised beds (DSRB), combined with three levels of wheat and rice straw residue retention – none (R0), 50% (R50) and 100% (R100) were therefore evaluated during the 2008 and 2009 growing seasons, using \{AWD\} water management. These treatments were compared with water seeded rice (WSR) grown with conventional tillage (dry tillage) on the flat under continuous flood irrigation (WSRF-R0-FI) or alternate wet and dry irrigation (WSRF-R0-AWD). The use of \{AWD\} reduced irrigation amount to only 30% of the amount of water applied to continuously flooded rice. However, yield of residue removed \{AWD\} treatments was lower than yield of the continuously flooded treatment by 27% in 2008 and by 40% in 2009. The significant reduction in rice yield in all treatments with \{AWD\} was caused by reduced growth rate, resulting in lower biomass, leaf area, panicle density, number of florets panicle−1 and floret fertility, with significant differences in the second year. In 2008, this appeared to be due to water deficit stress in the \{AWD\} treatments. In 2009, the reduction in growth and yield with \{AWD\} was greater, and more so as the level of residue retention increased. Residue retention reduced rice yield by 59% in 2009 with \{R100\} compared to the R0. By far the biggest cause was a reduction in floret fertility. The reduction in fertility with \{AWD\} in 2009 appeared to be due to cold damage, whereas the continuously flooded rice appeared to have been protected from cold damage by the floodwater. The weather during the period from panicle initiation (PI) to flowering in 2009 was very cold, with 20 days with minimum temperature less than 15 °C. About 1 in 10 years experience such low temperatures in this region. Therefore, the development of varieties with greater cold and water deficit stress tolerance is needed if non-flooded rice culture and surface residue retention are to be adopted in this region. "

These include crop simulation models, expert systems, GIS, and multiple goal linear programming (MGLP) models for land evaluation and optimization. \{LUPAS\} was designed as a decision support system (DSS) for strategic land use planning. Integration of \{LUPAS\} components in four case studies was performed in a network with national research teams and local stakeholders. This network allowed iterative evaluation and refinement of \{LUPAS\} for scenario analysis on technical and policy changes. Several interactive sessions with stakeholders led to more detail in scenarios (goals and constraints), model features and databases. To facilitate negotiation among stakeholders, the \{MGLP\} user interface (UI) was developed. In interactive sessions, goal restrictions are tightened to quantify trade-offs between conflicting goals. Choice and degree of tightening reflect the specific priorities for sustainable land use. The development of \{LUPAS\} is exemplified for one case study, Ilocos Norte, Philippines. Weak points of the system include inadequate spatial differentiation of socio-economic characteristics, scarce database for quantifying perennials and mixed cropping systems, and insufficient consideration of long-term effects of production technologies on resource quality. However, a promising perspective for effective policy support lies in the possible link of the regional \{LUPAS\} approach with farm household models. "

The cause of this phenomenon in sorghum has long been questioned and is often attributed to the effects of low night temperatures during this period. Monthly sowings, from December to March, in greenhouse compartments with two contrasting night temperatures and under field conditions with contrasting soil conditions were conducted over two years near Bamako, Mali, with three contrasting sorghum varieties. Dates of panicle initiation, rates of leaf primordia initiation at the stem apex, and rates of leaf appearance were observed. In the greenhouse, colder night temperatures were found to have no effect on prolonging vegetative-phase duration when measured in thermal time and on plant development. Although a prolonged vegetative phase and prostrate forms were observed under field conditions, these were not observed in the greenhouse experiments despite having similar temperature conditions. Although the higher soil fertility of the potting soil increased the development rates slightly, and reduced the vegetative phase relative to natural soil conditions in the field, this difference between greenhouse and field growth remained when a comparison was made between plants grown in pots. Thus, it appears that the greenhouse glass had masked the \{UV\} component of sunlight, which would mediate the cue responsible for the delayed flowering and modified morphogenesis. This cue, which has strongly contrasting effects between October and November sowings, could be the daily changes in the sunrise and sunset hour that have negative values from November to July. "

Aerobic rice has traditionally been grown in low-input systems, but as fresh water for irrigation becomes increasingly scarce, aerobic rice cultivation is expected to expand into regions with more intensive cropping. The primary yield constraints for the low-input aerobic crop include water deficit, acid and infertile soils, weed competition, and disease. Yield potential has been improved through traditional breeding approaches, and some improved upland rice cultivars show a similar pattern of interactions with environments as traditional cultivars. Critical environmental factors that interact with genotype are the distribution of rainfall during the season, the amount of solar radiation received in the period just prior to flowering, and disease pressure. In systems where adequate inputs are applied, aerobic rice tends to yield less than lowland rice, and yield reductions are dramatic when water deficit occurs. The poor adaptation of the lowland cultivar \{IR72\} to aerobic soils is associated with reduced height and harvest index in aerobic conditions, but \{IR72\} had similar biomass production by anthesis as better-adapted upland cultivars. The best-yielding upland lines had very stable pre-anthesis biomass production across five contrasting environments. The physiological and molecular dissection of aerobic rice yield is expected to identify opportunities to accelerate progress in the areas of aerobic adaptation, tolerance to water deficit, and improved weed competitiveness. \{QTLs\} have been reported for a number of traits potentially related to performance under water deficit, such as improved root morphology and osmotic adjustment. In an upland-by-lowland mapping population, alleles from the lowland cultivar contributed significantly to improved yield in aerobic environments. "

The use of this methodology and the associated tools accompanies the shifts in various paradigms on the study of ecological complexity. Behavior and interactions are now key issues for understanding and modeling ecosystem organization, and models are used in a constructivist way. \{MAS\} are introduced conceptually and are compared with individual-based modeling approaches. Various architectures of agents are presented, the role of the environment is emphasized and some computer tools are presented. A discussion follows on the use of \{MAS\} for ecosystem management. The strength of \{MAS\} has been discussed for social sciences and for spatial issues such as land-use change. We argue here that \{MAS\} are useful for problems integrating social and spatial aspects. Then we discuss how \{MAS\} can be used for several purposes, from theorization to collective decision-making support. We propose some research perspectives on individual decision making processes, institutions, scales, the credibility of models and the use of MAS. In conclusion we argue that researchers in the field of ecosystem management can use multi-agent systems to go beyond the role of the individual and to study more deeply and more effectively the different forms of organization (spatial, networks, hierarchies) and interactions among different organizational levels. For that objective there is considerably more fruit to be had on the tree of collaboration between social, ecological, and computer scientists than has so far been harvested. "

abstract = "The basaltic aquifers of the Upper Bhima River Basin in India are highly utilized for irrigation but the sustainability of groundwater withdrawals and the agricultural production systems they support is largely unknown. Here we used hydrogeological data, supported by secondary data, to assess the effects of water scarcity over a decade-long period (1998–2007) on the groundwater resources at the regional basin scale. This reveals no evidence of systematic declines in total groundwater availability over the period; only shorter-term losses/gains in storage associated with successive dry/wet years. The clearest indicator of stress comes from the more widespread drying out of wells following lower rainfall years throughout the basin and especially in upland areas where aquifers are least developed and most easily drained. Groundwater in the basin offers an adaptive mechanism to climate variability to some degree, but the buffering capacity is constrained by low aquifer storativity and average residence times of just a few years. Around 40% of the basin is currently at a level of development that is of concern, and the number of irrigation wells is growing rapidly. However recent evidence of conversion from high to low water use crops indicates the adaptive capacity of farmers to water-related stresses. Surplus surface water flows may provide opportunities to enhance groundwater recharge but requires careful trade-off analysis of the downstream impacts. "

The yields of the highest yielding entries (HYE) in these experiments have declined by about 0.1 t ha−1 year−1 in both wet and dry seasons. Additional losses attributed to severe disease infestations were larger for \{IR8\} (about 1.5 t ha−1) than for the \{HYE\} (1.0 t ha−1) in the wet season. In the dry season major disease outbreaks reduced \{IR8\} yields by up to 1.6 t ha−1, but not the yields of HYE. The frequency of major disease occurrences, however, was higher for \{IR8\} than for the HYE. The systematic decline of rice yields in these long term trials are implied to be mainly a consequence of a buildup of soil related problems — specially zinc deficiency and boron toxicity — a result of irrigating with alkaline, high boron water.

Seeds were drilled on dry granular clay soil (Andaqueptic Haplaquoll) in the field, then sprinkler-irrigated every 4 days for 37 days. As the soil dried, each entry was visually scored for drought reaction at 0.1–0.2, 0.4–0.5 and 0.8–1.0 \{MPa\} soil moisture tension (smt) at 20-cm soil depth. Entries were visually scored for drought recovery 10 days after the field was reirrigated. A total of 38 691 rices was tested in the dry seasons from 1978 to 1985. The 8-year screening test showed reproducibility of results in the field as indicated by the consistent scores of drought-tolerant and susceptible control cultivars within and across years. Ten germplasm accessions repeatedly performed similar to, or better than, the drought-tolerant control. There were ten outstanding drought-tolerant breeding lines, six of which were progenies of moderately tolerant Nam Sagui 19 from Thailand.

At that SMT, drought-susceptible rice lines were desiccated and drought-tolerant varieties averaged 50% dead leaves. Seven days after sprinkler-irrigation to relieve soil moisture stress, the desiccated rice lines did not show recovery but stand recovery in those with partial leaf drying was up to 100%. A significant relationship between drought tolerance, as indicated by degree of desiccation, and percentage recovery was observed.

The Random Forests (RF) algorithm, which is a machine learning method, has recently been applied to data-driven predictive mapping of mineral prospectivity, and so it is instructive to further study its efficacy in this particular field. This case study, carried out using data from Abra (Philippines), examines (a) if \{RF\} modeling can be used for data-driven modeling of mineral prospectivity in areas with a few (i.e., &lt;20) mineral occurrences and (b) if \{RF\} modeling can handle evidential data with missing values. We found that \{RF\} modeling outperforms weights-of-evidence (WofE) modeling of porphyry-Cu prospectivity in the Abra area, where 12 porphyry-Cu prospects are known to exist. Moreover, just like WofE modeling, \{RF\} modeling allows analysis of the spatial associations of known prospects with individual layers of evidential data. Furthermore, \{RF\} modeling can handle missing values in evidential data through an RF-based imputation technique whereas in WofE modeling values are simply represented by zero weights. Therefore, the \{RF\} algorithm is potentially more useful than existing methods that are currently used for data-driven predictive mapping of mineral prospectivity. In particular, it is not a purely black-box method like artificial neural networks in the context of data-driven predictive modeling of mineral prospectivity. However, further testing of the method in other areas with a few mineral occurrences is needed to fully investigate its usefulness in data-driven predictive modeling of mineral prospectivity. "

Large-effect \{QTLs\} conferring tolerance to submergence, salinity, and drought have been identified. Marker-aided incorporation of the submergence tolerance gene into popular rice varieties illustrates how gene discovery can be rapidly converted into useful products. Extensive use of parallel whole-genome expression and mapping analyses is expected to improve our understanding of QTL. To accelerate conversion of discoveries into products, much can be gained by using agronomically proven genotypes and by testing in multiple environments. "

Large differences in daily as well as seasonal total transpiration and evapotranspiration values exist for various locations. Crop transpiration rate is low at the early stage of growth and increases almost linearly, reaching 3–4 mm/day at maximum tiller number stage and 5–7 mm/day at heading time. Evapotranspiration also follows a similar trend for the maximum rate and varies with crop growth stage. The seasonal average evapotranspiration in wetland rice fields is in the range of 4–7 mm/day. The value of crop growth coefficient factor (ET/EP) is 1 at transplanting, reaching about 1.15 at maximum tiller number stage and around 1.3 at flowering stage. For a crop season this ratio is about 1.2 This information will aid significantly in developing better water management practices for rice. "

In central Luzon, Philippines, farm reservoirs are about 800 to 5000 m2 in area and have an average depth of about 1 m. The average farm size is about 3 ha. The stored water is used to supplement rainfall for wet season rice production and to irrigate a dry season rice crop on approximately one third of the farm area. Farmers without reservoirs cannot grow a dry season crop. This study quantified the major hydrological parameters of four selected farm reservoirs using a water balance approach. Direct rainfall and runoff from the catchment area contributed, respectively, about 36% and 64% to reservoir inflow. Typically, farmer's use of stored water for land preparation and irrigation of rice accounted for about 30% of the total water outflow from a reservoir. Seepage and percolation losses of water accounted for about 45% of the outflow volume, and evaporation loss of about 25%. The minimum catchment area required to support a reservoir of given capacity was calculated to be nearly 5 times higher for a grassed catchment than for a catchment under paddy rice. The hydraulic conductivity of reservoir embankments reduced with reservoir age due to continuous settlement of poorly compacted materials, affecting the rate of water loss through seepage. "

The model captures the temporal and spatial changes in the water demand-and-supply relationship within the system as land-soaking, land-preparation, transplanting and crop-irrigation activities progress within a season. The principal outputs of the model are the extent of area that can be land-prepared, transplanted to rice and supported with required irrigation water until the crop reaches maturity. \{PUMPMOD\} has been adapted and evaluated for a rice irrigation system in The Philippines and uses four pumps of about 6.0 m3/s total discharge capacity, using field data collected during eight consecutive seasons and taking into account its existing major physical and socio-economic constraints which influence the operation of the system. The results are satisfactory. \{PUMPMOD\} is designed to be used as a tool for making decisions to optimize the supply of irrigation water from the source in relation to rainfall and field-water demands. It can also be used for various investigative purposes, including the evaluation of the efficacy of alternative designs to allocate and distribute water for maximizing irrigation benefits. "

Factors contributing to high and low on-farm rice yields were examined. In water-surplus years, sub-optimal crop management contributed about 57% to rice yield difference between low and high yielding rice farms.

We found that the size of potential crop area can be increased by over 550 ha for every additional pump operating for 18 hours each day during maximum water demand periods. The maximum rate of land preparation that can be supported by the irrigation system limits the size of the potential crop area, but when the per day rate exceeds 7.5% of the system's command area water supply becomes the limiting factor. The simulation indicates that if the pumps can be operated longer than 18 hours a day, a significantly larger area than the current average of about 1500 hectares can be satisfactorily irrigated.

Vapor pressure deficit and canopy temperature at the dry ends of the gradient plots increased with windspeed and solar radiation. Leaf water potential was closely related to solar radiation flux density and decreased with decrease in irrigation water applied. The maximum differences in vapor pressure deficit, canopy temperature, and leaf water potential between stressed (environment 5) and well-watered (environment 1) locations occurred at peak solar radiation.

The benefits of tank improvements were based on the behavior of the tank system using a 10-year tank irrigation cycle. Three evaluation criteria, viz., productivity ratio, equity ratio and financial measures, were used to evaluate the investment strategies. Productivity and equity ratios were not in conflict when the objective was to improve productivity and income of the system.

Overt symptoms such as desiccated white areas on the spikelets develop at water potentials and water contents of about −25 to −30 bars and 50–60%, respectively, after which spikelet desiccation progresses exponentially with further change in water status. Decrease in panicle water potential below −13 to −17 bars was also associated with decreased anthesis.

abstract = "Upland agriculture in southeast Asia has been associated with resource-poor farmers, land degradation, soil and water losses, and increasing pest problems. Research and extension have offered farmers on-farm innovations—often forms of ‘agroforestry’—intended to improve sustainability of upland agroecosystems. Farmer adoption, however, has been minimal. Based on case materials, six overlapping reasons why farmers do not adopt are that farmers do not face the problem targeted by the innovation, farmer practice is equal to or better than the innovation, the innovation does not work, extension fails, the innovation costs too much, and ‘social’ factors. Learning from such reasons, our work in the Philippines is hopefully leading to farmers' adaptation and adoption of contour vegetative strips for soil erosion control. A few conclusions are drawn. "

The earthworms' burrowing activity caused leaks in rice levees and body setae mechanically injured roots resulting in plant stunting and seedling death. Infested fields exhibited reduced plant stand and uneven growth. Rice was more sensitive to damage occurring during the vegetative than reproductive stage. The crop could tolerate earthworm densities of 140 m−2 but suffered significant yield loss when populations were ten times higher, and complete loss at 700 m−2. Field observations and greenhouse tests showed prolonged flooding reduces earthworm densities. Seedbeds should be located away from the rice fields and taller seedlings (45–55 days old) should be transplanted to tolerate &gt;14 cm depth ponding until the late reproductive stage. A preventative method of creating holding ponds is suggested to trap earthworms before irrigation water passes to the fields. During the off-season, infested fields may be kept flooded for 2–3 months to lower resident densities. Leaves of Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Steud, a popular pesticidal plant suggested by farmers, increased rather than decreased earthworm numbers when incorporated into the soil.

The empirical results show that adoption depends on several farm and farmer characteristics and the relative importance of these factors differs across sites. The high cost of establishment, maintenance and the loss of land to hedgerows are considered to be the major constraints to adoption by non-adopters. The economics of the contour hedgerow system is found to improve substantially if crop intensification or cash cropping is possible. In addition to the need to develop a range of cost-effective technologies, the study indicates that in the more marginal environments, on-site benefits alone may not be sufficient to justify investment in soil conservation.

This is because, ostensibly, tropical plants are already exposed to relatively high levels of UV-B radiation (relative to a temperate environment) and should, therefore, possess a greater degree of tolerance to increased UV-B radiation. In this brief review I hope to show that, potentially, direct and indirect effects on photosynthesis, assimilate partitioning, phenology and biomass could occur in both tropical crops (e.g. cassava, rice) and native species (e.g. Cecropia obtusifolia (Bertol. Fl)., Tetramolopium humile (Gray), Nana sandwicensis L.). However, it should be noted that differences in sensitivity to UV-B radiation can be related to experimental conditions, and care should be taken to ensure that the quantity and quality of background solar radiation remains at near ambient conditions. Nevertheless, by integrating current and past studies on the impact of UV-B radiation on tropical species, I hope to be able to demonstrate that photosynthesis, morphology and growth in tropical plants could be directly affected by UV-B radiation and that UV-B radiation may be a factor in species and community dynamics in natural plant populations in the tropics.

Echinochloa crus-galli is one of the most problematic and competitive weeds in direct-seeded rice systems. Because of concerns about excessive herbicide use, there is an interest in developing cultural weed management strategies. However, the design of such strategies requires a better understanding of the weed response to crop density, nutrition, and water regime. A study was therefore conducted in pots to determine the effect of water (flooded and aerobic), nitrogen (N) fertilization (0, 100, and 200 kg N ha−1), and rice density [0, 4 rice plants (≈20 kg seed ha−1), and 16 rice plants (≈80 kg seed ha−1)] on the growth and reproduction of E. crus-galli. When grown alone, the growth and seed production of E. crus-galli were higher in flooded conditions than in aerobic conditions. However, no such differences were observed when E. crus-galli was grown with rice interference. E. crus-galli growth and seed production increased with increases in N rate. Irrespective of water regime and N rate, the growth and seed production of E. crus-galli declined with increases in rice density. At 100 kg N ha−1, for example, E. crus-galli shoot biomass and seed production decreased by 84–86% and 82–87%, respectively, when grown with 16 rice plants compared with its growth without rice interference. The results suggest that growth and seed production of E. crus-galli can be greatly reduced by increasing rice seeding rate. However, there is a need to involve other weed management strategies to achieve complete control of E. crus-galli and other weed species. "

Because of concern about the continuous use of single herbicides, cultural weed management strategies need to be developed to maintain the sustainability of direct-seeded rice systems.

The effects of shade on growth and seed production of Echinochloa colona, Echinochloa crus-galli, and Echinochloa glabrescens were determined. Weeds of three Echinochloa species were grown continuously in full sunlight or in 50% or 25% of full sunlight, or started in full sunlight and transferred to 50% or 25% of full sunlight at 21 days after sowing. The results suggested that changes in shade regime did not affect the plant height of E. colona and E. glabrescens; however, shade reduced the height of E. crus-galli. Compared with the plants grown in full sunlight, 75% of continuous shade reduced E. crus-galli height by 22%. Shade reduced leaf, total shoot, and root biomass and seed production in all the weed species, if occurred during the early growth of the weeds. The weeds responded with increased leaf biomass ratio when grown in shade. Compared with full sunlight, continuous shade of 75% increased leaf biomass ratio by 90% in E. colona and this value was 25% in the other two species. The results of this study show that shade can reduce weed growth and seed production of Echinochloa species but it should not be considered as a stand-alone strategy to manage these weeds in rice. This highlights the need for the integration of other weed management strategies to achieve complete control of these species. "

Although newly available herbicides may provide satisfactory weed control in DSR, an excessive use of herbicides may increase the risk of herbicide resistance and shifts towards problematic weed species. Cultural management practices with the integrated use of cultivars could be exploited to reduce selection pressure and delay herbicide resistance in weeds. The lack of suitable weed-competitive cultivars, however, has been a major constraint in this direction and there is a need to exploit the role of rice cultivars for weed management in DSR. The traits that are likely to be most helpful for weed management in direct seeding include seed germination in anaerobic conditions and tolerance of early submergence for uniform crop establishment, high and early seedling vigour with rapid leaf area development during the early vegetative stage for weed suppression, cultivars having an allelopathic effect, and herbicide-resistant rice cultivars.

Studies were conducted to determine the effects of light on germination; seed burial depth and rice residue on emergence and growth; and flooding time and depth on emergence, survival and growth of this species. Light stimulated seed germination but it was not an absolute requirement for germination. The proportion of seeds germinating was greatest for seeds placed on the soil surface (92%), and emergence declined with increasing burial depth in soil; no seedlings emerged from the depth of 8 cm. A burial depth of only 0.4 cm reduced seedling emergence by 50%. Seedling emergence and seedling biomass were reduced by the addition of high level (6 ton ha−1) of rice residue to the soil surface. Early and deep flooding significantly suppressed growth of E. crus-galli seedlings. In flooded conditions, with increased water depth the weed allocated more biomass to shoots at the expense of roots. The information gained from this study could contribute to improve weed control approaches. Soil inversion by tillage to bury weed seeds below their maximum depth of emergence, use of crop residue as mulch and early flooding of the crop could serve as important tools for managing E. crus-galli and other weed species with similar germination requirements. These management options, however, would need to be compatible with other crop management requirements. "

This study describes a series of experiments designed to determine the effects of nitrogenous fertilisers on snail fitness. We examined the possibility of a two-phase model of snail response to nitrogen, whereby fertilisers initially increase snail mortality through toxicity, but once assimilated into the rice ecosystem, eventually favour snail reproduction and survival. In experimental arenas, fertiliser had lethal effects: Complete fertiliser (14:14:14), urea, ammonium sulphate and organic fertilisers were associated with snail mortality, generally affecting adult snails more than juvenile snails, and with greater effects when applied to saturated soil that was subsequently flooded (as opposed to direct application to flooded soil). Snail mortality was found to decline considerably when snails were added to arenas one day after fertiliser application – this occurred in arenas with soil and water, but not in arenas with water only, suggesting that soil can reduce the toxic effects of fertilisers. In a field experiment, snail numbers declined in both fertilised and non-fertilised plots at the time of crop establishment. Numbers increased in all plots after rice tillering, with significantly more recruitment in plots with high nitrogen. Although the responses were generally weak in the field experiment, they did support the two-phase model. The consequences of fertiliser applications for snail management and ecosystem health are discussed. "

Rice yields in the wet season ranged from 170 kg ha−1 where weeds were not controlled throughout the crop duration to 2940 kg ha−1 in weed-free treatment, indicating a 94% yield loss with uncontrolled weed growth. Similarly in the dry season, plots with no weed control (140 kg ha−1) compared to weed-free plots (3640 kg ha−1) indicate a 96% yield loss with no weed control. Gompertz and logistic equations were fitted to yield data resulting from increasing durations of weed control and weed interference, respectively. Critical periods for weed control in the wet season, to obtain 95% of a weed-free yield, were estimated as between 18 and 52 days after sowing (DAS) for crops in rows at 15-cm, 20–51 \{DAS\} at 10–20–10-cm, and 15–58 \{DAS\} at 30-cm. These intervals in the dry season were 17–56 \{DAS\} for crops in rows at 15-cm and 17–60 \{DAS\} at 10–20–10-cm and 15–64 \{DAS\} at 30-cm. Durations of the critical periods in the wet season were 31 days at 10–20–10-cm, 34 days at 15-cm and 43 days at 30-cm, while in the dry season, these were 43 days at 10–20–10-cm, 39 days at 15-cm and 49 days at 30-cm. In both seasons, crops in the wider spacing (30-cm) were vulnerable to weed competition for the longest period. The information gained from this study suggests that the aerobic rice yields better in 15-cm rows and 10–20–10-cm arrangements than in 30-cm rows and there is very little benefit of weed control beyond 8 weeks after sowing.

abstract = "Farmers have adopted alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation to cope with water scarcity in rice production. This practice shifts rice land away from being continuously anaerobic to being partly aerobic, thus affecting nutrient availability to the rice plant, and requiring some adjustment in nutrient management. The use of a chlorophyll meter (also known as a \{SPAD\} meter) has been proven effective in increasing nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) in continuously flooded (CF) rice, but its use has not been investigated under \{AWD\} irrigation. This study aimed at testing the hypotheses that (i) SPAD-based N management can be applied to \{AWD\} in the same way it is used in \{CF\} rice, and (ii) combining chlorophyll meter-based nitrogen management and \{AWD\} can enhance NUE, save water, and maintain high rice yield. Experiments were conducted in a split-plot design with four replications in the 2004 and 2005 dry seasons (DS) at IRRI. The main plots were three water treatments: CF, \{AWD\} that involved irrigation application when the soil dried to soil water potential at 15-cm depth of −20 kPa (AWD−20) and −80 kPa (AWD−80) in 2004, and AWD−10 and AWD−50 were used in 2005. The subplots were five N management treatments: zero N (N0), 180 kg N ha−1 in four splits (N180), and three SPAD-based N-management treatments in which N was applied when the \{SPAD\} reading of the youngest fully extended leaf was less than or equaled 35 (NSPAD35), 38 (NSPAD38), and 41 (NSPAD41). In 2005, \{NSPAD32\} was tested instead of NSPAD41. A good correlation between leaf N content per unit leaf area and the \{SPAD\} reading was observed for all water treatments, suggesting that the \{SPAD\} reading can be used to estimate leaf N of rice grown under \{AWD\} in a way similar to that under CF. \{SPAD\} readings and leaf color chart (LCC) values also showed a good correlation. There were no water × nitrogen interactive effects on rice yield, water input, water productivity, and N-use efficiency. Rice yield in AWD−10 was similar to those of CF; yields of other \{AWD\} treatments were significantly lower than those of CF. AWD−10 reduced irrigation water input by 20% and significantly increased water productivity compared with CF. The apparent nitrogen recovery and agronomic N-use efficiency (ANUE) of AWD−10 and AWD−20 were similar to those of CF. The \{ANUE\} of \{NSPAD38\} and \{NSPAD35\} was consistently higher than that of \{N180\} in all water treatments. \{NSPAD38\} consistently gave yield similar to that of \{N180\} in all water treatments, while yield of \{NSPAD35\} about 90% of that of CF. We conclude that a combination of AWD−10 and SPAD-based N management, using critical value 38, can save irrigation water and N fertilizer while maintaining high yield as in \{CF\} conditions with fixed time and rate of nitrogen application of 180 kg ha−1. Treatments AWD−20 and \{NSPAD35\} may be accepted by farmers when water and N fertilizer are scarce and costly. The findings also suggested \{LCC\} can also be a practical tool for N-fertilizer management of rice grown under AWD, but this needs further field validation. "

Progress was made in developing varieties tolerant of complete submergence through transfer of the Submergence-1 (SUB1) gene into popular varieties. However, \{SUB1\} may not be effective under partial stagnant flooding (SF), as the new varieties may not elongate and continue growth when fully or partially submerged because of the SUB1-mediated suppression of elongation. We tested a set of rice genotypes, including a pair of near-isogenic lines (NILs), Swarna and Swarna-Sub1, under either \{SF\} or \{SF\} following complete submergence of 12 d. Swarna-Sub1 had higher survival and yield than Swarna following 12 d of submergence, but survival and grain yield of all lines decreased substantially when \{SF\} of 15–30 cm followed complete submergence, with the sensitive lines experiencing greater reductions in growth and yield. This suggests the importance of combining \{SUB1\} with tolerance of \{SF\} in areas where both stresses are expected during the season. Swarna and Swarna-Sub1 are more sensitive to long-term partial \{SF\} than \{IR49830\} and \{IR42\} because of their short stature, and Swarna-Sub1 showed slightly higher reduction in tillering than did Swarna when subjected to deeper \{SF\} alone, possibly because of further inhibition of elongation by \{SUB1\} if induced in submerged tissue. The results suggest that tolerance of these genotypes to \{SF\} depends less on \{SUB1\} introgression and more so on the genetic background of the recipient genotype, with better performance of the genotypes that are inherently taller, such as \{IR42\} and IR49830. The \{SUB1\} donor landrace \{FR13A\} and its derivative breeding line \{IR49830\} had better survival and relatively less reduction in grain yield under \{SF\} following complete submergence and under longer-term partial SF, indicating that these genotypes may have genes other than \{SUB1\} for submergence and \{SF\} tolerance. For better adaptation to prolonged SF, \{SUB1\} should be introgressed into genotypes that tolerate partial \{SF\} through better tillering ability and taller shoots, because \{SUB1\} may not be effective in shorter genotypes, as it promotes survival of submerged plants by hindering shoot elongation to conserve energy reserves. Varieties combining tolerance of prolonged \{SF\} with \{SUB1\} will have broader adaptation in flood-prone areas and greater impacts on yield stability. "

The rice yield in this production system is highly variable. A survey was conducted during the kharif seasons of 2011 and 2012, comprising 320 randomly selected farmers covering all the major agroclimatic regions of Punjab State of India to understand the cultural practices, farmers’ perceptions, and reasons for the yield gap in DSR. Farmers used seeding rates from 15 to 40 kg ha−1, depending upon the type of seed drill used and agroecological conditions. About 65% of the farmers used drills with inclined plates, a seed-metering device, and on a “custom hiring” basis. More than 90% of the farmers chose cultivars for dry seeding by considering their yield potential, suitability to agroecological zones, and being easy to sell. Among the farmers surveyed, about 45% of them adhered to recommended practices of fertilizer application. Weeds were reported as the main biological constraints in \{DSR\} culture. Only 46% of the farmers applied both pre- and postemergence herbicides for weed control. About 67% of the farmers used flood jet or cone-type nozzles for herbicide spray, resulting in additional hand-weeding by 42% of the farmers due to poor weed control. The survey revealed that non-adherence to a recommended fertilizer schedule and weed control package (appropriate herbicides, optimum application time of herbicides, optimum volume of water for spraying, and selection of the right nozzles) is one of the reasons for the existing yield gap. Site-specific agrotechnologies for \{DSR\} need to be developed and transferred to farmers to achieve high yield. The survey also revealed that tailoring cultivars for dry-seeding conditions is needed for further productivity gains in DSR. "

Available soil N was lower in year 2 (20 kg ha−1) than in year 1 (64 kg ha−1). In both years significant differences in grain yield, N uptake and N-utilization efficiency (NUE) were observed among genotypes within each growth-duration group. Genotypes varied in their response to change in available soil N. The average increase in grain yield for each kilogram increase in N uptake was 61.9 kg in year 1 and 82.7 kg in year 2. However, some genotypes absorbed similar amounts of N but produced different grain yields and/or total dry matter. Some genotypes with similar harvest index exhibited significantly different \{NUEs\} — e.g., IR50363-61-1-2-2 (NUE = 64.4 in year 1 and 71.9 in year 2) and IR51009-155-2-3-3 (55.3 and 60.8) in the early-duration group; BG380-2 (70 and 78.8) and IR50391-100-2-3-3-2 (56.3 and 58.9) in the medium; and IR27325-63-2-2 (69.7 and 69.8) and BR51-46-1-C1 (57.9 and 60.5) in the late. Those with higher \{NUE\} had lower percentage straw N at maturity. Grain N concentration also affected NUE, but the coefficient of variation in percentage grain N among genotypes was less than that of percentage straw N. The relative performance of genotypes in terms of \{NUE\} was more consistent than plant N uptake, based on rank correlations between the two trials. High N uptake and \{NUE\} were observed in IR13429-150-3-2-1-2 (NUE 65.4, N uptake 9.1 g m−2) in the early-duration group, \{IR44\} (NUE 67.2, N uptake 8.3 g m−2) in the medium-duration group and IR39323-182-2-3-3-2 (NUE 64.8, N uptake 9.3 g m−2) in the late-duration group. The study identified genotypes which may possess promising traits for improved N uptake and utilization efficiency. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved in high N uptake and N-use efficiency. "

Experiments were conducted to quantify Pfp and the contributions of indigenous and applied N to the N efficiency of lowland rice systems. Enormous variation was found in the indigenous N supply among farmers' fields in two rice-growing domains of Central Luzon, Philippines. Fertilizer-N rates farmers applied to these fields also varied greatly, but there was no relationship between applied N rate and indigenous N supply estimated by rice N uptake. Likewise, in the same treatment plots of a long-term experiment, season-to-season variation in the contributions of indigenous and applied N were large and reflected differences in yield and N uptake in plots without applied N. These results indicate that the ability to adjust the quantity of applied N in relation to variation in the indigenous N supply is as important to increased Pfp as are the timing, placement and source of applied N. We conclude that the indigenous N supply of lowland rice systems is highly variable among fields with similar soil types and in the same field over time, that field-specific N management is required to respond to this variability, and that Pfp is a useful parameter for identifying constraints to improved fertilizer-N-use efficiency in farmers' fields.

Fields were sampled for soil pH, soil total N and available P, plant production and N content close to the arrival of the flood (pre-flood) and again at maturity. Start of flooding ranged from 22 to 122 days after emergence, with a mean of 66 days. Maximum water depths ranged from 0.30 to 2.10 m. Data from 32 fields in 1988 and 53 fields in 1989 were included in the analyses. Thirty seven \{DWR\} varieties were found. The mean farmer application of N for the 52 fields sampled in 1989 was 15.2 kg ha−1. Above-ground plant dry mass at maturity ranged from 2.7 to 20.5 t ha−1, with a mean of 10 t ha−1. Nitrogen content at maturity ranged from 23 to 115 kg ha−1, with a mean of 66 kg. Eighty percent of N was accumulated during the flood, but pre-flood plant production had a significant correlation with above-ground dry mass at maturity, indicating the importance of good early crop development for DWR. Yield ranged from 0.65 to 4.87 t ha−1, with a mean of 2.13 t ha−1. Factors closely correlated with yield were dry mass at maturity (r=0.69∗∗), panicles m−2 (r=0.59∗∗) and rate of N uptake during flooding (r=0.33∗∗). Nitrogen content was most closely related to grain yield through total dry mass, but as most N was accumulated during the flood, a question still not answered is what proportions of this N came from the soil and from other sources, and how can the natural supply of N be sustained. These observations are also relevant to other rainfed lowland rice crops in Asia. "

We compared the cumulative effects of P input regimes on yield, N and P budgets, and soil P availability in four consecutive soybean crops in a 2-year period on a Humoxic tropohumult. In each crop cycle, nodulating (nod) and nonnodulating (nonnod) isolines were subplots in P-regime mainplots (kg P ha−1 by crop cycle): \{P0\} = control without P inputs; \{LP\} = 50, 35, 35, 35; \{MP\} = 100, 70, 70, 70; and \{HP\} = 300, 210, 210, 210. Seed yields of the nod isoline in the \{HP\} regime were 3700 kg ha−1 in the two summer seasons and 2400 to 2500 kg ha−1 in the fall seasons, with a mean increase of 85% compared to yields of the nod \{P0\} control. Nonnod seed yields and N accumulation were unaffected by the P regime, averaging 870 and 48 kg ha−1, respectively. The contribution of \{BNF\} to nod soybean N assimilation was linearly related to P uptake, and mean P uptake by nod plants was 60% greater than by nonnod soybaen, despite 35% greater root length of nonnod plants at 0–50 cm depth. For the four crop cycles, total \{BNF\} input to the system ranged from 330 kg N ha−1 (P0, or 65% of total aboveground N, to 710 kg N ha−1 (HP), which was 78% of total aboveground N. After accounting for P removal at harvest, a net P input of just 99 kg P ha−1 after four crops increased cumulative seed yield by 3600 kg ha−1 and \{BNF\} by 227 kg N ha−1 in the \{LP\} treatment. A positive net P balance also resulted in (1) an increase in extractable P in the 0 to 25 cm topsoil, (2) a reduction in the proportion of P that would be fixed from subsequent additions as indicated by a shifted P sorption isotherm, and (3) greater apparent P uptake efficiency from applied fertilizer in subsequent crop cycles. As a result, the yield response of nod soybean per unit P input increased from 13 kg seed kg−1 P applied in the first crop to 44 kg seed kg−1 P applied in the fourth crop of the \{LP\} treatment. Cumulative effects of this magnitude emphasize the need to consider the longer-term nutrient balance of the crop system in developing cost-effective P management strategies on highly weathered soils. The potential for greater P input use efficiency with time when inputs exceed outputs means that farmers' average and marginal return from investment in P fertilizer will also increase with time. "

Three varieties, IR43, Kinandung Patong and UPLRi-7, and one line, IR9560-2-6-3-1, were used. Regression techniques were used to identify the environmental variables that have a major impact on the yield of each variety and line.

Production is often limited by either waterlogged or dry soils in the wet-dry transition period following rice because periodically saturated soils are followed by progressively severe drought. An optimum fit of cultivar phenology to these situations is crucial to higher, stable yields. The responses of a set of diverse cowpea differing in maturity were compared under a line-source moisture gradient applied during the vegetative stage on isohyperthermic, clayey, Typic Tropudalf with a fluctuating shallow water table, during two dry seasons in the Philippines. In 1986–1987, in saturated soil, the mean yields of the medium-maturing grain (460 kg ha−1) and dual-purpose (460 kg ha−1) types exceeded yield of the early-maturing grain (250 kg ha−1) and vegetable (210 kg ha−1) types, with a similar ranking (920, 730, 470, and 390 kg ha−1) without irrigation. In 1988, the medium-maturing cultivar group had a mean yield 985 kg ha−1 in saturated soil and 1389 kg ha−1 in unirrigated, again exceeding the early-maturity group with yields of 544 and 985 kg ha−1, respectively. Saturated soil reduced seed yields by 10 to 71% in 1986–1987 and 10 to 42% in 1988. Pods per plant, seeds per pod, and individual seed mass of the cultivars were reduced 13 to 32%, 12 to 19%, and 3 to 12%, respectively. The results suggest that the best medium-maturing cultivars had superior adaptation to that of the best early-maturing cultivars in a post-rice environment with prolonged high rainfall and a high water table. Contrasting results are expected in post-rice niches with a deep water table and limited soil water reserves. "

The plant water relations, and root and shoot growth of two cowpea cultivars (IT82D-889, early maturing, and TVX1948-012F, medium maturing) were compared in saturated and drier soil moisture regimes on an isohyperthermic, clayey, Typic Tropudalf soil by using a line-source sprinkler differential irrigation system. Saturated soil reduced total dry matter accumulation, plant height, crop growth rate and leaf area index by 20 to 50%, 7 to 10%, 20 to 50% and 20 to 30%, respectively. Root length density (RLD) measurements showed that in saturated soil, roots of both cultivars were concentrated in the top 0.1 m during the vegetative stage, but in the reproductive stage, grew down to 0.8 m. Leaf water potential (LWP) was higher by 0.3 MPa, and conductances were higher by 5 to 29% in dry than saturated soil. The cultivar TVX1948-012F had greater RLD, conductance and \{LWP\} than did with IT82D-889 under saturated conditions. Results suggest that the medium-maturing cultivar is better adapted than the early-maturing to high rainfall and high water table conditions in the post-rice environment. Its shallow rooting under saturated soil conditions enables more effective oxygen uptake in the vegetative growth phase. Deep rooting provides for effective water uptake and increased plant water status under subsequent drought conditions in the reproductive growth phase. "

abstract = "Wet direct-seeding is becoming an increasingly popular alternative to transplanting in Asian rice (Oryza sativa L.) culture. Modern tropical rice cultivars, when direct-seeded, because of vegetative overgrowth and foliar N dilution during reproductive growth, often fall short of their biological yield potential. A field study using ‘IR72’ rice during the 1989 dry season in the Philippines evaluated the effect of late-season N top-dressing on canopy \{CO2\} exchange rate (Pn), growth and yield of a transplanted (TP), hillwise dibbled (DS) and broadcast seeded (BS) crop. In \{BS\} the higher seeding rate and absence of transplant shock led to a higher tiller number and leaf area index (L) than in TP. Foliar N concentration decreased faster in \{BS\} because of more rapid growth. Late-season N top-dressing, broadcast or applied as foliar spray, increased foliar N concentration and Pn, and led to greater spikelet number and grain-yield. Higher spikelet number was explained by reduced spikelet degeneration after top-dressing. Grain weight limited grain-yield when no N was applied, but was equal among N-fertilized treatments. Panicle number limited yield for TP, whereas grain number per panicle was more limiting for \{BS\} and DS. The Pn during various reproductive growth stages was correlated with grain-yield, whereas dry-matter at maturity depended more on L. Harvest index (hi) gave best correlations with foliar N concentration. The Pn depended on both L and foliar N concentration, but the latter became more limiting as plant development advanced. It is concluded that late-season foliar N application raised grain-yield by enhancing the assimilate source through increasing foliar N concentration at a stage when it was limiting, and by enhancing the sink through the reduction of spikelet degeneration. Considering that both foliar N concentration and filled spikelet number are commonly limiting factors for \{BS\} yields, late-season foliar top-dressing may be a means specifically improve \{BS\} rice culture.

A field experiment was conducted during the 1989 dry season in the Philippines to determine relationships between canopy structure and \{CO2\} assimilation rates at anthesis with yield and yield components at maturity. Canopies of broadcast-seeded flooded rice had greater leaf area index (L), dry matter, N uptake, and tiller number than had canopies of transplanted rice. Grain-yields were equal for both planting methods. Early and midseason N fertilization increased dry-matter, L and tiller number, whereas late-season foliar N application increased foliar N concentration and delayed senescence. The N status of leaves affected stomatal conductance, \{CO2\} assimilation and leaf width. Despite N content being greater in the uppermost than in lower leaf positions, N limited photosynthesis for all leaves. Potential canopy \{CO2\} assimilation rates (Pn) depended linearly on L, whereas actual Pn was little affected by L. High tiller number was detrimental to Pn, possibly because of shading by panicles, whereas high N uptake and flag-leaf N concentration promoted Pn. The Pn at anthesis was linearly correlated with grain-yield, whereas the harvest index (hi) was high at a combination of high Pn, low L, and high flag-leaf N content. Late-season foliar N application favored these canopy characteristics, thus improving grain-yields and hi. It is concluded that late-season foliar N application can improve yields of tropical semidwarf rices, particularly for direct-seeded culture. Future breeding efforts for rices adapted to direct seeding should reduce L and tillering activity while increasing the N concentration of the uppermost leaves during the reproductive growth phase.

After participating in the exercise, farmers reduced their insecticide sprays for stem borer control by 22% and their intended insecticide expenditures by 45%. The control farmers on the other hand did not reduce their sprays and reduced their intended expenditures by only 14%. Farmers who had done the exercise reduced their estimated loss from white head by 27%, while there was no reduction in control farmers. Similarly, farmers also reduced their control expenditures and perceptions of loss by 43% and 54%, respectively, while control farmers’ reductions were lower, 22% and 31%, respectively.

Ethylene stimulated coleoptile elongation of both genotypes to the same degree. The coleoptile elongation of the tolerant genotypes remained greater than that of the controlseven in the presence of Co2+ and l-α-(2-aminoethixyvinyl)glycine. Thus, the longer coleoptile of the tolerant genotypes might be explained by a mechanism that is independent of ethylene and O2. Mesocotyl and shoot elongation of the tolerant genotypes was more stimulated by ethylene than that of control genotypes. These developmental characteristics of tolerant genotypes may accelerate seedling establishment in flooded anaerobic soil. "

Furthermore, Asia is home to approximately 70% of the world’s 1.3 billion poor, and the most severe malnutrition in the world occurs in South Asia. These considerations mean that rice research has a key role to play in global poverty alleviation. Rice research contributes to poverty alleviation through several pathways, and these contributions benefit both producers and consumers. The direct pathway leads to higher productivity and higher profits for farmers. The indirect pathway arises from the lower prices for consumers that are the inevitable result of higher farm productivity for any given level of demand. In the short run, lower prices for consumers reduce poverty because many poor people (the urban poor, the rural landless, and nonrice farmers) are net buyers of rice, and lower prices increase their effective incomes. In the long run, lower prices for consumers reduce the cost to employers of hiring workers (without sacrificing any welfare on the part of those workers). This stimulates job creation in the higher productivity industrial and service sectors of the economy, and eventually draws labor out of agriculture. This structural transformation of the economy is essential for long-term poverty alleviation. In fact, no country has ever become wealthy without removing a significant fraction of its labor force from the agricultural sector. After the initial success of the Green Revolution, rice yields have stagnated or grown slowly in many countries, and this slow growth retards the process of poverty alleviation. Creation of a \{C4\} rice plant has the potential to generate substantially higher farm yields and make an important contribution to global poverty alleviation efforts. "

In a growing season of fixed duration, it is inevitable that increased rates of resource capture and retention are required for higher-yielding crops. In this chapter, I assume that mass accumulation is translated into the crop structural and architectural properties required to sustain maximum rates of resource capture. The components of yield and of solar radiation conversion into biomass have been explored using simple theory. I conclude that the upper yield limit of rice crops with conventional photosynthetic pathways will only take us halfway to IRRI’s stated goal of a 50% increase in yield. Future increases in production have to be achieved with less land, less water, less labor, and less pollution. A \{C4\} rice plant may satisfy all of those requirements and improve yields. Indeed, its greatest impact may be in areas of low rainfall and poor soil conditions. However, the potential yield of such a crop in irrigated systems could be limited by the intrinsically low N content characteristic of \{C4\} crops. "

Precipitation and degradation reactions, not discussed here, are also important. A full understanding of the behaviour of chemicals in soils requires that we also have detailed information relating to the pore structure, which determines transport processes and the extent to which surfaces are accessible to chemicals in the soil solution.

The (experimental) aerobic rice crop replaced the farmer's practice of wet-season lowland rice and dry season sweet potato cropping. We hypothesized that abiotic factors, especially the inter-relationship between high soil pH and impaired micronutrient uptake, restrict plant growth, and that ammonium sulfate has an ameliorating effect. Experiment 1 used “sick soil” collected from around yellowing and dying plants in a field experiment with aerobic rice yield failure, and “healthy soil” collected from around well-growing plants in the same field. We used three N fertilizer treatments (ammonium sulfate, urea, no application) and two soil water conditions (well drained and water-logged). In experiment 2, the treatments were a combination of sick and healthy soil, N fertilizer, soil acidification, and foliar application of Fe. Experiment 3 compared the irrigation water used at the experimental field site with reverse-osmosis water. Irrigation with water from the field site increased soil pH, impaired plant growth, and induced chlorosis. The application of ammonium sulfate reduced soil pH to values below 6 and increased plant micronutrient (Fe, Mn and Zn) contents and plant growth. In early vegetative plant growth, the high soil pH appeared to be the key determinant of “sick soil”, while root knot nematodes were most likely secondary causes for poor plant growth. "

The effects of four amounts of N (0, 60, 120, and 180 kg ha−1) applied with or without P and K fertilizers under two irrigation regimes (10 and 20 kPa; irrigated when soil water potential at 15-cm soil depth reached 10 and 20 kPa, respectively) were studied on rice yield, and N- and water-use efficiencies. Grain yield with irrigation threshold increasing from 10 to 20 kPa did not decrease with the application of P and K fertilizers at 120 kg N ha−1, leading to substantial savings in irrigation water. At the soil moisture potential of 20 kPa, application of P and K fertilizers along with 120 kg N ha−1 resulted in a 14% increase in rice vis-à-vis when P and K fertilizers were not applied. However, this effect was not observed at the soil moisture potential of 10 kPa. Applying P and K fertilizers along with N at 20 kPa compared with 10 kPa resulted in higher water- and N-use efficiencies. Water-use efficiency was significantly correlated with yield-contributing parameters when P and K were supplied along with N; whereas, without P and K application, water-use efficiency was not correlated with any yield-contributing parameters. It was concluded that, in DSR, the addition of P and K along with N could compensate for the yield loss under water-stress conditions. Our study suggests that there is a need to study the effects of applying different amounts of P and K along with N under a range of water regimes on dry matter partitioning and soil characteristics to understand the mechanism of yield loss in DSR.

Acquisition efficiency is considered in terms of root properties influencing the absorption and assimilation of NH+4 and other N species, and their regulation; root-induced changes in the rhizosphere affecting N mineralization, transformation and transport; and root-associated biological \{N2\} fixation. Efficiency of internal use is considered in terms of the translocation, distribution and remobilization of absorbed N in different plant organs, flag leaf N import/export and leaf senescence patterns, and the efficiency with which N is used in \{CO2\} fixation.

Salinity is the main obstacle to high yields in coastal areas in the humid tropics and in arid and semiarid areas where evaporation exceeds precipitation. To develop sustainable rice-production systems in areas where these stresses occur, cultivar tolerance is often essential although improved management also plays an important role. In the last 15 years, \{IRRI\} research has focused on germplasm improvement. Intensive screening and breeding have resulted in high tolerance to Zn deficiency in IRRI's late elite lines; screening methods are available, but tolerance mechanisms and genetics are not yet fully understood. Recent work has shown the importance of root-induced changes in the rhizosphere for solubilizing Zn and increasing its plant uptake. Repeatable screening methods are not yet available for isolating genotypes with tolerance to Fe toxicity. Pot and field methods earlier developed do not allow screening of sufficient numbers of rice lines for an effective breeding program. A greenhouse screening procedure using a 400 mg l−1 iron solution is being tested. Genetic studies are required but may only be feasible when additional knowledge of mechanisms is available. Prebreeding efforts for salinity have resulted in adequate knowledge on mechanisms, genetics and reliable screening techniques. Salt-tolerant rice cultivars with targeted agronomic characteristics and yield potentials are now available. "

The nutrient-use efficiency of rice cropping systems must be improved, along with yield potential of rice cultivars, in order to improve profitability of rice production and prevent environmental degradation in irrigated areas. Part of the projected demand for rice will be met through production increases in rainfed environments, where yields need to double from their present average of 2.0 t ha−1.

Although the rice plant is well adapted to aquatic environments, it is unable to survive if it is completely submerged in water for an extended period. Germplasm improvement for submergence tolerance is likely to be the best option available for alleviation of the submergence damages, other than construction of extensive drainage systems which require a large investment. The germplasm improvement may be successful if physiological mechanisms for submergence tolerance are well understood and floodwater environments are characterized. The plant response to submergence stress varies greatly depending on conditions of floodwater such as light intensity and concentrations of \{O2\} and CO2. This suggests that various physiological mechanisms are involved for survival from the submergence stress. This paper reviews the current understanding of submergence tolerance in rice plants from physiological aspects and then discusses possible strategies to improve the tolerance. "

It is not clear to what extent rice yields in rainfed lowlands are limited by water, nutrients, and the interactions between them, over diverse soil types, cultural practices and seasonal conditions. Research must determine what really limits root growth, water extraction and nutrient uptake. Some evidence suggests that manipulation of controlled-release fertilizer and root system development may be the key to optimizing nutrient release and capture in fluctuating environments.

Workshop participants reviewed current research in crop management and genetic improvement of rice, and concluded that increased rice production will depend on explicit considerations of nutrient supply. For intensive irrigated rice systems, research priorities include understanding how soil nutrient supply is linked to cropping intensity, what pattern of nutrient supply is required to achieve the high yield levels needed to meet the needs of rice consumers in the next century, and how to improve congruence of nutrient supply and crop demand through management. In rainfed environments, nutrient demand is closely linked to water availability, and participants saw a need to characterize environments accoring to the different patterns of resource limitations. Soil and climate databases will be important in this effort. An explicit conceptual framework must underlie field work in these variable environments, and simple simulation models were identified as essential tools for targeting experiments and pre-testing improved technologies. Cultivar improvement for efficient nutrient use can complement agronomic approaches. The potential gains in improved nutrient acquisition and/or improved physiological efficiency are not clear for all nutrients, and these need to be estimated in order to set breeding priorities. Improved screening techniques related to specific mechanisms of nutrient efficiency will facilitate genetic improvement. Promising research approaches are described to address each of these constraints to improving nutrient-use efficiency in rice. "

abstract = "The mass-rearing method for efficient production of rice caseworm Nymphula depunctalis (Guenée) was improved. Moths oviposit most in ventilated cages on the undersides of floating cut rice leaves aged 4–8 weeks after transplanting (WT). There was no effect of leaf width on oviposition. Greatest egg production occurs with a 12 h scotophase. Moths are highly tolerant of crowding in oviposition cages, as up to 40 females averaged 86–115 eggs per female in 0.14 m3 cages. Honey as a carbohydrate energy source increases the rate of oviposition but not total oviposition. Larvae require standing water to fill their cases as respiration occurs with tracheal gills. Larval survival was equal when reared in distilled water, pesticide-free ricefield water, or chlorinated tap water, whether aerated or not. Larvae survive better, grow larger, mature more rapidly, and become more fecund adults when reared on plants 2–6 WT. Pupae are non-aquatic. The caseworm's inability to develop satisfactorily on post-vegetative rice may be attributed to poor nutrition and less favourable oviposition substrates. Females prefer to oviposit on dropping leaves floating on the water surface. As the crop matures, fewer leaves touch or float on the water surface. Eggs desiccate if laid on aerial portions of plants and are more exposed to natural enemies. "

Control plots were irrigated several times each week to maintain soil moisture near field capacity, while stress plots experienced periods of soil drying. In an experiment comparing 35 lines and cultivars, control grain yield in the dry season was correlated with \{RWC\} measured during a period of water exclusion (r=0.72,P&lt;0.01). This correlation was strongly influenced by genetic differences in yield potential and maturity. In a mapping population comprising approximately 80 lines, leaf \{RWC\} in the irrigated control was significantly correlated with %SS (r=−0.43,P&lt;0.01) and yield (r=0.45,P&lt;0.01). No correlation was observed between leaf \{RWC\} at the end of a 14-day stress period and %SS or yield in stress plots. In a set of \{BC3\} introgression lines, \{RWC\} was not associated with yield or %SS in either stress or control treatments. Leaf water status appears to be related to yield and %SS in some cases, but the relatively weak correlations indicate that other characteristics of the lines are also important in determining the integrated response to reproductive stage drought stress. When the range of contrasting characteristics was reduced through the use of introgression lines, the association between yield and \{RWC\} disappeared, even though lines differed significantly in their yield response to water deficit.

The main plots were two water treatments (well-watered and drought-stressed for 20 days from panicle initiation). The subplots comprised of three crop establishment methods. In the sub-subplots, prilled urea was compared with Polyon 12 and POC-S120. Drought prolonged crop maturity by about 20 days and greatly reduced grain yield but not the total biomass and total N uptake. Dry-seeded rice had a lower yield in the well-watered treatment but higher yield in the stress treatment compared with transplanted and wet-seeded rice. The higher yield of dry-seeded rice under stress could be related to its significantly higher root length density, higher root–shoot ratio, and more uniform root distribution with respect to soil depth, and higher available soil moisture in the root zone during the stress period. Under the well-watered condition, yields in all fertilizer treatments were comparable. In the stress treatment, Polyon 12 produced the lowest yield probably because of the mismatch between drought-induced prolongation of crop duration and the release period of Polyon 12. "

The problem of salinity is compounded by mineral deficiencies (Zn, P) and toxicities (Fe, Al, organic acids), submergence, deep water and drought. These soil stresses vary in magnitude and interactions over time and place, making long-term adaptability of a cultivar dependent on its level of tolerance to all the stresses that occur in its growing environment. Thus, in breeding rice for saline environments, multiple stress tolerance traits must be considered. Some degree of cultivar tolerance for these stresses is in rice germplasm. However, understanding the physiological mechanisms of these traits, their biochemical basis, inheritance and efficient screening techniques are needed to hasten breeding progress. Recent progress in breeding for rice for saline environments includes the development of rapid and reliable techniques of screening for elongation ability and tolerance for salinity, submergence, iron toxicity, aluminum toxicity and phosphorus efficiency. Donor germplasm has been identified and improved, and its inheritance for tolerance for most soil-related stresses has been studied. Physiological mechanisms of some stresses are now fairly well understood. Rice lines developed with tolerance for multiple stresses have been successfully used as donor parents, and released as cultivars for salt-affected areas by national agricultural research and extension systems (NARES). Present studies are directed toward increasing the selection efficiency and accelerating pyramiding of various soil-related tolerance traits. \{F8\} recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping populations for various abiotic traits were developed and genotyped. Major genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for elongating ability tolerance and for tolerance for salinity, submergence, P deficiency, and Al and Fe toxicities were mapped. Genotyping is in progress for other tolerance traits. Refined mapping using near-isogenic lines for the development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based marker-assisted selection (MAS) is now possible and pursued. \{MAS\} techniques are being developed for elongation ability and tolerance of salinity, submergence, Al toxicity, P deficiency and Zn deficiency.

The \{NPT\} is derived from tropical Japonica germplasm and has fewer and larger stems and panicles than do semidwarf Indica varieties. We compared stem borer damage and resistance in \{NPT\} lines and semidwarf Indica varieties under field and greenhouse conditions. Stem borer damage in field plots of the \{NPT\} lines \{IR65564\} and \{IR68011\} was higher than in plots of the Indica varieties \{IR64\} and \{IR72\} during the 1999 dry season but not the wet season. In both seasons, \{IR68011\} had higher densities of egg masses of the striped stem borer (SSB, Chilo suppressalis) than did the other three entries. There were no consistent differences among entries in density of egg masses of the yellow stem borer (YSB, Scirpophaga incertulas). In the 2000 wet season, stem borer populations were low, but \{SSB\} egg masses were found only on IR68552-100, the only \{NPT\} line in the experiment. In all three seasons, \{NPT\} lines had higher proportions of \{SSB\} larvae and pupae in stems after harvest, and lower proportions of YSB, than did Indica varieties. In artificially infested field cages, \{SSB\} larval survival was highest on reproductive stage plants of \{IR68011\} in the 1999 dry season and there was a trend of higher \{YSB\} adult weight on \{IR68011\} in the 1999 dry and wet seasons. Three \{NPT\} lines and three Indica varieties evaluated under greenhouse conditions showed no consistent differences in resistance to either stem borer species, as measured by percent survival from egg to adult and female development time and weight. The lack of consistent differences in stem borer survival and development between the \{NPT\} lines and Indica varieties was contrary to the expectation that the morphology of the \{NPT\} would render it more susceptible to stem borers. Our results indicate that \{NPT\} lines are not consistently or strongly more susceptible to stem borers than are improved Indica varieties and suggest that ovipositional attractiveness to \{SSB\} is a factor contributing to higher stem borer damage to some \{NPT\} lines.

abstract = "In Southeast Asia, upland rice (Oryza sativa) is an annual crop typically grown for subsistence on hilly lands that are at risk for soil erosion. If perennial cultivars of upland rice were developed, they would provide farmers with an inexpensive tool to produce a preferred food while conserving soil. O. rufipogon, the undomesticated progenitor of O. sativa, includes perennial and stoloniferous forms. To evaluate the feasibility of developing perennial cultivars by combining genes of O. sativa and O. rufipogon, four trials were conducted in an upland field at IRRI: O. sativa/O. rufipogon \{F1\} clone and cutting height trial, \{F2\} family trial, and two O. sativa/stoloniferous-selection factorial mating design trials. Plants were established at the beginning of the rainy season, then subjected to a 6-month dry season and evaluated for survival after 1 year. Of the 2101 cultivar control plants, only three IR47686-1-4-B individuals survived and none produced stolons. The 18 \{F1\} clones, which were selected from previous trials with less drought stress, ranged in survival from 4.4 to 91.4%. Cutting height at harvest did not affect survival. Survival among the \{F2\} families ranged from 9.4 to 31.9%. Segregation for stolon presence did not differ from a 3:1 ratio for five of the six \{F2\} families, suggesting the effect of a single dominant gene. Average yields per plant for the \{F2\} families were 1/3 to 1/9 of yields for the cultivars. However, by crossing the \{F1s\} to cultivars, yield potential was almost fully recovered. For the full-sib families of the factorial trials, survival ranged from 0.0 to 48.6%. Azucena and IR47686-1-4-B, both japonica cultivars, exhibited greater general combining ability for survival relative to the six other cultivar parents. Thus, the process of developing perennial cultivars of rice should include screening annual cultivars to identify those with the best combining ability for survival. To develop cultivars of perennial upland rice, drought avoidance and/or tolerance from annual upland cultivars must be combined with the capacity for perennial growth from wild perennial species. The frequency of stolonifereous testcross progeny was lower than expected and was affected by the O. sativa parent. Thus, additional genes likely affected stolon penetrance and expression. Analyses of covariance indicated that stolons improved the likelihood of survival for progenies of the factorial trials but the effect was small (b &lt; 0.1), and that yield (g/plant) had a small negative effect on percent survival (b = −0.13 to −0.32). This study demonstrated that it was possible to introgress genes for perennial growth from wild O. rufipogon accessions into domesticated O. sativa. Additionally, strategies for developing perennial cultivars of upland rice were improved. "

In this study, we examined an intermated Oryza sativa/Oryza longistaminata population and assessed how fertility barriers affected selection for long rhizomes, a polygenic trait. Rhizomes are typical of O. longistaminata but not found in O. sativa. In the intermate population, we observed that pollen-fertility and self-fertility were generally low but exceptional individuals of high fertility were found in nearly all generations. About 1/5th of the genotypic variation for self-fertility was accounted for by pollen-fertility, based on a significant linear regression. Intermating improved self-fertility more than backcrossing for one generation. Heritability estimates via parent-offspring regression were 17 ± 7% for pollen-fertility and 39 ± 9% for self-fertility. The data indicated that many genes contributed to the fertility barriers. Individuals with relatively high fertility or long rhizomes (&gt;8 cm) were observed infrequently in the intermated population, and there was no evidence of association between low fertility and presence of long rhizomes. By evaluating a large population, we were able to obtain a few rare recombinants that had both self-fertility greater than 10% and long rhizomes. "

Both stresses interact and contribute to the low productivity and widespread poverty in this environment. The objective of this study was to improve the understanding of interaction between the two factors and to identify varietal characteristics beneficial for productivity in a water- and nutrient-limited rice environment. For this purpose, we screened 19 rice genotypes adapted to different rice environments under two water and two nutrient treatments during the wet season of 2004 and 2005 in southern Luzon, Philippines. Across all genotypes tested and in comparison with the irrigated control, rainfed conditions reduced grain yield of the treatment without N application by 69% in 2004 and by 59% in 2005. The mean nitrogen fertilizer response was highest in the dryer season of 2004 and the rainfed treatment, indicating that water stress had no effect on fertilizer response. Nitrogen application reduced the relative yield loss to 49% of the irrigated treatment in 2004 and to 52% of the irrigated treatment in 2005. Internal efficiency of N (IEN) and recovery efficiency of applied N (REN) were significantly different between genotypes, but were not affected by water availability (REN) or by water and nutrient availability (IEN). In contrast, grain yield and total N uptake were affected by cultivar, N and water availability. Therefore, germplasm for rainfed environments should be screened under conditions of limited and good nitrogen and water supplies. The four best cultivars, CT6510-24-1-2, IR55423-01, IR72, and IR57514-PMI5-B-1-2, performed well across all treatments and both years. Except for IR72, they were all characterized by medium height, medium duration, high early vigor, and a moderate level of drought tolerance. This combination of characteristics seems to enable the optimal use of limited water and nutrient resources occurring in many shallow rainfed lowlands. We also concluded that moderate drought stress does not necessarily affect the response to moderate N rates, provided that drought does not induce high spikelet sterility and that fertilizer N is properly managed.

Greenhouse experiments were designed to examine the effects of the less stable environmental conditions in submergence- and drought-prone rainfed rice cropping systems on soil microbiota. Successions of cultivable groups of microorganisms (guilds) with assumed key functions in nutrient cycling were assessed under different water regimes. Frequently, microbial population dynamics for both planted and unplanted trials converged both in the flooded field and under controlled submergence in the greenhouse. An induced mid season drought as is typical for rainfed rice cropping systems proved not long enough to reverse prevailing trends in population dynamics of most of the functional groups investigated. Irrespective of the water regime, total bacterial cell counts declined toward the end of the cropping period. In contrast, a fast build-up of heterotrophic biomass by copiotrophic bacteria peaked at the flowering stage. This trend was most pronounced under drought conditions, but also significant under submergence. It leveled off towards harvest and the subsequent fallow period. Fungi as primary microbial digesters of crop residues showed a negative correlation with the soil water content and were predominant only under drought or post-harvest fallow conditions. N-remobilizing, proteolytic bacteria declined strongly in the flooded field, whereas drought reversed this trend in the greenhouse. Observations of successive increases of anaerobic guilds in the field were confirmed under permanent flooding in the greenhouse. Peaks of denitrifiers, mainly triggered by post-season puddling, appeared and disappeared early in the plant growth cycle. Ammonium oxidizing nitrifiers showed extremely low titers under submergence, but also in planted trials under drought. This suggested a negative rhizosphere effect under water limitation. For other guilds, differences between planted and unplanted trials were less pronounced. "

The factors affecting weed seed germination, however, are often poorly understood. Depleting the soil seed bank and influencing germination patterns are common goals of enduring cultural weed management practices. Greater understanding of the factors influencing the germination of weed seeds could facilitate the development of more effective cultural weed management practices through either suppressing germination or encouraging germination at times when seedlings can be readily controlled. Such cultural methods may contribute to overcoming problems such as feral crops (e.g., weedy rice), crop volunteers, and the evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds that have, in some systems, increased to a point where the lack of sustainable practices is a threat to productivity. Weed seed germination is commonly influenced by light exposure, soil moisture, burial depth through tillage, the use of mulches, fire for land clearance, and flooding of the soil. Harnessing these factors to influence germination can serve as major entry points for improved weed management. Diverse crop production systems provide a wide range of examples to illustrate how recent advances in the understanding of the responses of weed seed germination can be used to develop new and sustainable cultural management of weeds. Crop management practices, such as adopting no-till crops or delaying tillage, that increase weed seed exposure to predators (ants, beetles, etc.) could be incorporated into integrated weed management programs. Retention of crop residue on the soil surface under no-till systems can suppress weed seedling emergence, delay the time of emergence, and allow the crop to gain an advantage over weeds, and reduce the need for control. Rotation of tillage or crop establishment system could also be adopted to deflect the “trajectories” of likely weed population shifts. In rice, flooding after herbicide application or hand weeding can largely prevent the growth of weeds and reduce the need for further interventions. "

abstract = "Abstract Cereals such as rice, wheat, maize, and barley account for major proportion of global food grain production. High temperature, drought, and other climate change drivers are predicted to increase in frequency and magnitude, posing serious challenges to sustain global food production under changing climate. These climate change drivers often interact with each other under realistic field conditions resulting in impacts that are notably different compared to individual stress exposure. Till date, there has been no systematic synthesis comparing the impacts of different combinations of high temperature, drought, and elevated \{CO2\} [eCO2], across cereals. Hence, the major objective of this chapter is to capture the overall agronomic and physiological impact of different combinations of these three factors compared with their independent exposure. High temperature or drought affects almost all growth and developmental phases during crop cycle leading to significant decline in photosynthesis, floral abnormalities, spikelet/kernel sterility, grain yield, and quality losses. Combined high temperature and drought stress can result in additive detrimental effect on growth physiology and productivity. On the other hand, interactive effect of [eCO2] with either high temperature or drought varies with species (C3 and C4), and also depends on other factors such as phenological stage, intensity and duration of stress, etc. Constraints and available avenues for breeding multiple abiotic stress tolerant cereals, role of modern genomic tools, precision phenotyping, and trait-based breeding program are highlighted. Finally, the chapter summarizes future research direction, in addressing combined stress resilience to ensure sustained global food security under warmer and drier climate. "

Parameters from the model were derived either empirically or by numerical optimisation from published data, and from a field experiment. A separate field experiment was conducted for model evaluation. The model has the potential to adequately account for actual epidemics. Sensitivity analysis showed that the intrinsic rate of secondary infection had a large effect on simulated epidemics, while effect of the intrinsic rate of primary infection was comparatively small. The aggregation parameter had a strong effect on simulated epidemics in their later stages. The model adequately simulated the pattern of actual epidemiological data, except in the later stage of epidemics, when it failed to account for decrease in disease incidence at the tiller level.

Uptake of N from the soil, on the other hand, is often limited by root uptake properties. Modeling and experimental work have shown that rates of N transport through the flooded soil to root surfaces will generally not be limiting. Using the short-lived tracer 13N, measurements have been made of the kinetics of N absorption and assimilation by rice and their regulation, and of interactions between NH4+ and NO3− uptake. Rice roots are particularly efficient in absorbing and assimilating NO3−, and NH4+ absorption and assimilation are stimulated by NO3−. Calculations indicate that the uptake of NO3− formed in the rice rhizosphere by root-released \{O2\} may be more important than previously thought, with beneficial consequences for overall N efficiency. In some soils, root-induced acidification of the rhizosphere resulting from excess absorption of cations over anions by roots, and from oxidation of mobile reductants, can impede access of NH4+ to roots by depressing HCO3−. Absorption of NH4+ is also sensitive to inhibition by organic acids in the soil solution formed under strongly reducing conditions. Implications of \{C4\} photosynthesis for rice N nutrition are discussed. "

Mass maturity (defined as the end of seed filling period) among the cultivars was attained between 18.5 and 21.6d after anthesis (DAA). The seed moisture content at mass maturity varied between 24 and 40%. Germination ability of seeds in the early stages of development varied significantly, but as mass maturity approached, germination increased to the maximum and no significant differences were found among cultivars. The seeds were stored hermetically at 35 °C with 15±0.2% moisture content and the resultant seed survival data were analysed by probit analysis. Potential longevity (quantified by the value of seed lot constantKiof the seed viability equation) was greatest between 33 and 37 DAA, i.e. about 2 weeks after mass maturity. The stage during development at which seeds achieve maximum potential longevity is described by the term storage maturity. Lowlandjaponicacultivars, large seeded accessions (seed mass ≥40mg) andO. glaberrimahad shorter storage longevity ( σ, standard deviation of the frequency of seed deaths in time=1.47 weeks) while cultivars with purple pericarp survived longer than other cultivars ( σ=2.33 weeks). The initial germination of thejaponicacultivars at storage maturity was high (99 –100%) and the estimates of maximum potential longevity (Ki) which ranged between 3.3 (Shuang cheng nuo) and 4.4 (Minehikare) were close to those of theindicacultivars.

Results showed also that saving water by decreasing the season's total of percolation from 3000 to 120 mm could be achieved without any concurrent penalty of \{IR36\} grain yield, and that percolation rate was much influenced by sub-surface hydrology and regional and local drainage. Soil strength decreased more when puddling was made under standing water rather than at field-capacity wetness; rototiller puddling weakened a deeper zone of soil (0–19 cm depth had cone penetrometer strength &lt;0.4 MPa) than did wet plouging and harrowing (0–16 cm). Measurements of water-release characteristics showed that puddling increased storage porosity from 6 to 16% and residual porosity from 34 to 42% at the expense of transmission porosity, which declined from 26 to 4%. Most porosity in both puddled and non-puddled soil was contributed by elongated pores, which would facilitate percolation. "

Seedling and reproductive stages are the most sensitive growth stages; however, association between tolerances at the two stages is very weak, suggesting their regulation through different processes and sets of genes/QTLs. There are numerous reports on seedling-stage salinity tolerance in rice, but hardly on reproductive-stage salinity tolerance mainly because of the lack of reliable reproductive-stage-specific phenotyping. There are two major challenges, first, how to stress plants at the reproductive stage without stressing them at the seedling or late vegetative stage. Second, how to impose the stress on different genotypes or mapping populations at equivalent growth stages of development as they may mature differently. We devised a methodology that allows salt translocation to the reproductive organs such as the flag leaf (the largest source for the sink) and panicle as quickly as possible just at the initiation of booting when the genotypes are at the same stage of tissue/organ development rather depending on age of the plant. Extra leaves were clipped, leaving only a minimum number of leaves needed by the rice plant that will not significantly affect grain yield and yield components. Salt stress equivalent to \{EC\} 10 dSm-1 was imposed on rice plants with trimmed leaves starting from boot leaf emergence up to 20 days in a pot experiment under controlled conditions. The stage-specific effect of salt stress was verified by observing salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant genotypes. Leaf cutting before the booting stage efficiently directed the salt concentration to the reproductive stage and helped in discriminating tolerant genotypes from sensitive ones as evidenced by the lower pollen viability and higher accumulation of toxic ions in the flag leaf of the sensitive genotype (IR64). The opposite was found true for the tolerant genotype (IR4630-22-2-5-1-3). Details will be discussed during presentation. "

In this study, field experiments were conducted on selected genotypes with known tolerance to severe reproductive-stage drought in order to identify those that would produce high and stable grain yield across seasons and soil moisture conditions varying from well-watered to mild and moderately severe drought stress. Mild stress generally occurred during wet seasons and moderate stress happened during dry seasons. The drought stress was mild enough such that the time to flowering was similar under drought stress and well-watered conditions in either season. However, significant grain yield reductions were incurred even at mild drought levels. Using an \{AMMI1\} biplot analysis, IR83142-B-7-B-B, Binuhangin, IR77298-14-1-2-13, IR70215-70-CPA-3-4-1-3 and IR77298-14-1-2 were identified as the genotypes with the highest and most stable grain yields in both well-watered and mild to moderately severe drought stress environments. In a characterization of traits conferring drought tolerance among the highest yielding genotypes under mild to moderate drought stress, genotypes Binuhangin and IR70215-70-CPA-3-4-1-3 stood out for multiple physiological traits under drought. However, no direct correlations among genotypes between stomatal conductance, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or root dry weight with grain or total dry matter yield were observed under any soil moisture level. These results reflect the complex interaction of drought response traits contributing to grain yield. The genotypic variation and physiological responses observed in this study point to the potential of developing varieties targeted to mild and moderate drought stress using yield as the selection criterion.

However, plant tissue temperature can be different from air temperature, depending on transpiration cooling which is a function of relative humidity (RH). Controlled environment studies involving heat stress are generally conducted at targeted RH, hence excluding the dynamics associated with this factor. Using 81 diverse indica cultivars over three years (wet season-2012, dry season-2013 and 2014), flag leaf temperature (FLT), panicle temperature (PT) and air temperature (AT) were measured during flowering under field conditions. On average the \{FLT\} and \{PT\} were 10.4 and 8.7 °C lower than \{AT\} during the wet season and were 9.9 and 8.0 °C lower when averaged across all three seasons. Spikelet sterility in dry seasons ranged between 1.6 and 67% compared to &lt;1 and 35.5% during the wet season. Spikelet sterility was significantly correlated with \{PT\} (r = 0.50; p &lt; 0.01) and \{FLT\} (r = 0.55; p &lt; 0.01), compared with a weaker relationship with \{AT\} (r = 0.23; p &lt; 0.05) among the tested 81 cultivars, pooled across both 2013 and 2014 dry seasons. By employing an unbiased Z score approach, cultivars with (i) consistent and contrasting for sterility percentage and (ii) phenology (duration from seeding till 50% flowering) based on flowering date confirmed the strong relationship between \{FLT\} or \{PT\} with spikelet sterility compared to AT. In conclusion, we recommend using either \{PT\} or \{FLT\} (tissue temperatures) instead of \{AT\} for future field based heat stress phenotyping. Where direct \{PT\} measurements are not available, mechanistic and empirical models can be used to derive \{PT\} or \{FLT\} from weather station data, or remotely sensed canopy temperature might be used as a proxy in large scale phenotyping experiments.

Several barriers impeding the collection of rice straw from the fields as well as the lack of knowledge on alternative uses of rice straw led to the practice of burning which causes air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. To identify the benefits and uses of rice straw for energy generation is the main objective of this research. The study evaluated the energy balance of the rice straw supply chain and energy conversion through anaerobic digestion (AD). The input energy was categorized either as direct and indirect energy. Direct energy included agricultural inputs, fuel consumption and manpower. Fuel consumption was measured directly from the vehicles and equipment used in the experiment while manpower was measured using the metabolic equivalent of task (MET) based on labor time per ton of straw. Indirect energy was calculated based on the energy for the manufacture, lubrication, and maintenance of machines and equipment. The net energy of the rice straw supply chain for biogas generation through \{AD\} is 3,500 \{MJ\} per ton of straw. This rice straw management option can provide a 70% net output energy benefit. The research highlighted the potential of rice straw as a clean fuel source with a positive energy balance, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared with the existing practice of burning it in the field.

abstract = "Two important factors influencing rice plant survival during submergence are limitations to gas diffusion under water, and reduced irradiance that impair photosynthesis and efficient utilization of carbohydrates. Thus, survival during submergence may largely depend on accumulation of high carbohydrate concentrations prior to submergence and a capacity for maintaining energy production through rapid alcoholic fermentation under oxygen shortage. During flash flooding, a third factor thought to affect survival is the aerobic shock during the post-submergence period when floodwaters recede. Changes in the level of antioxidants and enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) suggest that tolerant rice cultivars develop protective systems to air after exposure to hypoxic or anoxic environments. These responses are similar to other wetland plants. The capacity to survive submergence depends not only on specific environmental factors, but also on the strategy that plants have evolved for adoption to particular flood-prone environments. In rice the two main strategies are to elongate and escape, or not to elongate and conserve resources. For rainfed lowland rice exposed to flash flooding, elongation growth during complete submergence has major adverse effects on survival, presumably since this competes with maintenance processes which require carbohydrates and energy. Selection for minimal elongation during submergence is currently being exploited as a trait for submergence tolerance by rainfed lowland rice breeders in south and southeast Asia. Gene mapping for submergence tolerance has been useful in identifying one prominent locus for submergence tolerance. Fine scale gene mapping and sequencing may facilitate further progress in the physiology and genetics of submergence tolerance. Recently published data demonstrate that improving submergence tolerance may be possible through up-regulation of genes for particular traits such as pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) for alcoholic fermentation. Validation of appropriate mechanisms in other cultivars for target environments, and development and utilization of molecular markers to follow these traits in breeding programs, will therefore be high priorities for future work on submergence tolerance of rice.

Growing economies and urbanization also increase the claims on land and water by non-agricultural uses. As a result, decisions related to the management and planning of scarce resources become increasingly complex. Technological innovations at the field/farm level are necessary but not sufficient – changes in resource use at regional scale will also be essential. To support decision-making in such situations, we advocate a multi-scale modelling approach embedded in a sound participatory process. To this end, the Integrated Resource Management and Land use Analysis (IRMLA) Project is developing an analytical framework and methods for resource use analysis and planning, for four sites in Asia. In the envisaged multi-scale approach, integration of results from field, farm, district and provincial level analysis is based on interactive multiple goal linear programming (IMGLP), farm household modelling (FHM), production ecological concepts and participatory techniques. The approach comprises the following steps: (i) inventory/quantification of current land use systems, resource availability, management practices and policy views, (ii) analysis of alternative, innovative land use systems/technologies, (iii) exploration of the opportunities and limitations to change resource use at regional scale under alternative future scenarios, (iv) modelling decision behaviour of farmers and identification of feasible policy interventions, and (v) synthesis of results from farm to regional level for negotiation of the most promising options by a stakeholder platform. In the current paper, the operationalisation of dual-scale analysis is illustrated by the outputs (development scenarios, promising policy measures and innovative production systems) from various component models for the case study Ilocos Norte, Philippines. An approach is discussed for the integration of results from the different model components at two different decision making levels (farm and province). "

The soil is an Fluvaquentic Humaquept representative of much of the double-cropped rice area in the Mekong Delta. The eight treatments were N-P-K fertiliser at the following rates in kg element ha−1: 0-0-0 (check), 80-0-0, 0-17.5-0, 0-0-25, 80-17.5-0, 80-0-25, 0-17.5-25, and 80-17.5-25 in a randomised complete block with 4 replications. Mean grain yields 1986–1994 ranged from 2.1 t ha−1 for nil fertiliser in the \{WS\} to 5.9 t ha−1 with N + P in the DS. Wet season yields showed significant decline with time. The most rapid decline was 376 kg ha−1 year−1 from an initial level of 3.9 t ha−1 for the treatment of N without P. Dry season yields of the N + P treatments increased at a rate of 293 kg ha−1 year−1 to over 5 t ha−1. Nitrogen fertiliser-use efficiency declined rapidly in WS, even in combination with P. There was no significant benefit from K throughout. The main yield component reduced in \{WS\} was the number of grain per panicle. Phosphorus in combination with N returned up to 180 kg grain per kg P for \{WS\} and around 80 kg ha−1 in DS. Summed over all 16 crops, the application of N + P returned an additional 26 t grain ha−1 over the check or treatments with N alone. This was after deduction of the cost of fertiliser as grain equivalent. Phosphorus is a key factor for productivity in this environment, and if adequately supplied can prevent \{WS\} yield decline.

Tolerant genotypes were identified and key traits such as high levels of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC, starch and soluble sugars) and limited underwater elongation were found to be associated with tolerance. In this study, we evaluated the role of \{NSC\} before and after submergence and shoot elongation during submergence in submergence tolerance using genotypes that contrast in initial \{NSC\} content and elongation ability during submergence. The traits were further manipulated using a growth promoter, GA3, and a potent gibberellin synthesis inhibitor, paclobutrazol (PB). Submergence for 10 days resulted in higher mortality of \{IR42\} (intolerant), followed by Sabita and Hatipanjari. The latter two cultivars have a high initial \{NSC\} similar to that of the tolerant cultivar, FR13A, but elongated to higher extent under water. Exogenous \{GA3\} enhanced underwater elongation and depletion of \{NSC\} and reduced survival. Conversely, \{PB\} suppressed elongation, improved the retention of \{NSC\} and enhanced survival. \{FR13A\} is less responsive to \{PB\} but more responsive to GA, suggesting its inherently low \{GA\} concentration under submergence. Underwater elongation is associated with \{NSC\} consumed during submergence but not with \{NSC\} level before submergence. Seedling survival showed a stronger association with \{NSC\} maintained after submergence (r2 = 0.74) than with \{NSC\} before submergence (r2 = 0.27). This suggests that carbohydrates maintained after submergence, being the result of both initial level, and the level used during submergence, is more important for survival. "

Eight lines (CT9993, IR52561, IR58821, IR62266, KDML105, Mahsuri, Namsagui19, and IR20) were grown in three experiments: irrigated early, rainfed early, and rainfed late. As drought intensified from heading to dough stage, soil penetration resistance increased to 3.0 \{MPa\} at 15–25 cm depth in both rainfed experiments. A high proportion of the total root length was found in the surface layer, particularly in IR20. \{CT9993\} and \{IR58821\} had thicker roots than other lines. Root length density (RLD) increased in deeper soil layers in rainfed with time, but lines differed in their capacity to penetrate the compacted layer as drought intensified after heading. Only \{IR58821\} and Mahsuri were able to increase \{RLD\} below 15 cm depth after heading to values greater than 1.6 cm cm−3, and only in the rainfed early experiment. In rainfed late, soil penetration resistance tended to increase after heading in IR20, \{IR52561\} and IR62266, implying these lines were able to extract water below 15 cm depth, but without the concomitant increase in RLD.

This study was conducted to determine genotypic variation in lodging resistance and lodging-related morphological traits among hybrid and non-hybrid check varieties, and to identify the key morphological traits associated with lodging resistance. Lodging behavior of 16 rice genotypes, including 12 hybrids and four inbreds, was studied at the International Rice Research Institute farm during the 2004 wet season (WS) and 2005 dry season (DS). Grain yield and visual score of lodging were determined at maturity. Lodging-related morphological traits were measured at 30 days after flowering. Large genotypic differences in lodging-related morphological traits were observed. Among these traits, dry weight per unit length, breaking resistance, and lodging index (bending moment/breaking resistance × 100) of lower internodes were significantly correlated with visual score of lodging. Several hybrids demonstrated high lodging resistance although their average plant height was over 120 cm. The lodging-related morphological traits and visual score of lodging in these hybrids were comparable with those of the non-hybrid check varieties with strong lodging resistance. These results suggest that increases in dry weight per unit length and breaking resistance of lower internodes are primary targets for reducing lodging index, thus improving overall lodging resistance of hybrid rice in a breeding program.

However, the nonlinearity between \{DR\} and temperature and the temperature amplitude effect are often confounded, as the amplitude effect can be explained by the nonlinearity. This paper investigates the effect of temperature amplitude per se on development to flowering in rice (Oryza sativa L.), using controlled-environment data for 16 cultivars. The response of \{DR\} to diurnally constant temperatures was quantified by a nonlinear model and subsequently used to predict days to flowering under diurnally fluctuating temperatures. The often large discrepancies between predicted and observed days indicated an effect of the diurnal temperature amplitude on DR. This effect was significant at different probability levels in 11 cultivars, but not in the other five P &gt; 0.10). The trend of this effect, where significant, also strongly differed among cultivars: temperature amplitude accelerated flowering in one cultivar but delayed flowering in others. The nonlinearity between \{DR\} and temperature and the effect of the temperature amplitude can explain a large part of the often observed variation among environments for thermal unit requirements for flowering.

Thus, plant disease risk can readily shift under climate change. Predicting changes in risk under climate change is complicated by the many biological interactions that result in disease. For example, some plant diseases occur when the phenology of plant and pathogen are aligned, in the case of Fusarium head blight so that spores are ready to infect during wheat flowering. There are numerous examples of experiments involving simulated climate change that have shown changes in disease risk. Finding indicators of climate change effects on disease in real agricultural or natural systems is more challenging because of the correlative nature of the observations and the potential for many other factors to influence disease, such as changes in host abundance. Assessments of global disease databases suggest some pathogen range shifts consistent with predicted outcomes for climate change. There are also several cases of emerging tree diseases in which climate change has likely played a role. "

Findings show that beushening is a combination of the practices of dry seeded and puddled systems of rainfed lowland rice cultivation. Beushening involved direct dry seeding and wet plowing and laddering of the field, 25–35 days after germination. Farmers practiced beushening only on lands where 15–20 cm of water accumulation was possible and used traditional tall rice cultivars (over 120 days duration), that gave no advantage with transplanting. Semi-dwarf short-duration cultivars were unsuitable for beushening as their grain yield decreased significantly owing to plant breakage during wet plowing and laddering. Rice grain yield with beushening even with lower fertilizer rates was comparable with that from transplanted rice. Beushening helped control weeds, especially Echinochloa colona, which is difficult to distinguish from rice, and lessened labor demands in other field operations. Labor demand was also spread over a longer period of time. Beushening is a time-tested traditional agronomic technique for resource management specific to land type, hydrological condition, and rice cultivar. "

The use of a systems approach for photoperiod-sensitive varieties is constrained by the lack of crop growth models that can simulate the varieties’ photoperiod response. This study used data from the literature, from a controlled-growth experiment, and from multi-location field experiments to determine the photoperiod-sensitivity parameters of Jasmine rice grown in north-east Thailand, and incorporated these in the \{ORYZA2000\} model. Next, the model was used to analyse yield gaps by comparing yields in farmers’ fields with the simulated attainable yields with an adequate N supply (60 kg ha−1) under irrigated conditions. The \{ORYZA2000\} model adequately simulated growth, development, and yield of Jasmine rice over a 0–150 kg N ha−1 range under irrigated and normal to above-normal rainfall conditions. The simulated attainable yields ranged from 3.47 to 5.96 Mg ha−1. A simulated yield gap of 1.76 Mg ha−1 (41%) currently exists in rainfed rice farmers’ fields. Yield gaps could be substantially reduced by 1.48 Mg ha−1 (34%) through improved N-management practices. The yield gap caused by water limitation was small (0.02 Mg ha−1, &lt;1%) during the study period, when rainfall was normal to above normal. The large yield gap beyond the farmers’ current fertilizer level suggests considerable scope for increasing yields through site- and time-specific nutrient management. A long-term simulation study including years with rainfall below normal is needed to comprehensively quantify yield gaps caused by water limitation. Such long-term simulation is hindered by the lack of long-term groundwater depth measurements. "

Little work has been done examining the implications of the explosion of new media and web technologies, which may offer potential for improving food risk and benefit communication. First, this study examines the views of stakeholders (n = 38) and experts (n = 33) in the food domain on the potential use of these emerging media for food risk/benefit communication. Based on in-depth interviews in six European countries (Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Spain and The Netherlands), strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of social media in food risk and benefit communication were identified. Second, a Strategic Orientation Round (SOR) was used to evaluate the relative importance of the \{SWOT\} components according to stakeholders (n = 10) and experts (n = 13). Results show that both stakeholders and experts confirm a future role of social media in food risk and benefit communication. Strengths as speed, accessibility and interaction make social media an interesting tool in crisis communication or issue awareness raising. Weaknesses as the lack of a filter, low trust, the risk of information overload and a communication preference for traditional media are acknowledged. "

To address this contradiction, this study, conducted in central and southern Laos, intended to test existing fertilizer recommendations in farmers’ fields and under their crop management, to evaluate the effect of topographic field position on fertilizer response, and to conduct an economic evaluation of fertilizer use based on farmers’ input and output prices. Trials were conducted for two seasons in three different agroecological environments (rainfed rice in lower fields and in middle/upper fields, and irrigated rice in lower fields). Tested were five different fertilizer treatments in four farmers’ fields per site and season. Commercial organic fertilizer increased yields but resulted in negative economic returns in almost all cases because of its unfavorable nutrient/price ratio. In lower fields, farmyard manure and inorganic fertilizer gave good yield responses and positive economic returns but the average value/cost ratios of 1.3–1.6 were at the lowest level required for widespread adoption of fertilizer use. Water limitation reduced attainable yields in middle/upper fields and in this environment good fertilizer response was observed only for farmyard manure and half the recommended rate of inorganic fertilizer. The actual benefit of fertilizer use depended strongly on the input/output price ratios at each site. Thus, site-specific fertilizer management options, including economic parameters, are required to make fertilizer use in rainfed lowland rice more profitable. The necessary information for such guidelines is available but needs to be prepared in the form of decision tools to help farmers choose the optimal nutrient management option for their agroecological and socioeconomic production environment.

In recent years this approach has increased in sensitivity and power as a result of improvements in two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2DE), protein detection and quantification, fingerprinting and partial sequencing of proteins by mass spectrometry (MS), bioinformatics, and methods for gene isolation. 2DE provides information on changes in abundance and electrophoretic mobility of proteins, the latter reflecting post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and free-radical cleavage. Here we review the technical aspects of proteomics and demonstrate its use in analyzing the response of rice plants to drought and salinity. More than 2000 proteins were detected reproducibly in drought-stressed and well-watered leaves. Out of &gt;1000 proteins that were reliably quantified, 42 proteins changed significantly in abundance and/or position. We identified several leaf proteins whose abundance increased significantly during drought and declined on re-watering. The three most marked changes were seen with actin depolymerizing factor, a homologue of the S-like ribonucleases and the chloroplastic glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase. Proteomic comparisons of salt stress-tolerant and stress-sensitive genotypes revealed numerous constitutive and stress-induced differences in root proteins. Among them was caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, an enzyme of lignin biosynthesis. The abundance of ascorbate peroxidase was much higher in salt-tolerant Pokkali than in salt-sensitive \{IR29\} in the absence of stress. "

Reliable location-specific estimates of yield gaps, either derived from research plots or simulation models, are available only for a limited number of locations and crops due to cost and time required for field studies or for obtaining data on long-term weather, crop rotations and management practices, and soil properties. Given these constraints, we compare global agro-climatic zonation schemes for suitability to up-scale location-specific estimates of Yp and Yw, which are the basis for estimating yield gaps at regional, national, and global scales. Six global climate zonation schemes were evaluated for climatic homogeneity within delineated climate zones (CZs) and coverage of crop area. An efficient \{CZ\} scheme should strike an effective balance between zone size and number of zones required to cover a large portion of harvested area of major food crops. Climate heterogeneity was very large in \{CZ\} schemes with less than 100 zones. Of the other four schemes, the Global Yield Gap Atlas Extrapolation Domain (GYGA-ED) approach, based on a matrix of three categorical variables (growing degree days, aridity index, temperature seasonality) to delineate \{CZs\} for harvested area of all major food crops, achieved reasonable balance between number of \{CZs\} to cover 80% of global crop area and climate homogeneity within zones. While \{CZ\} schemes derived from two climate-related categorical variables require a similar number of zones to cover 80% of crop area, within-zone heterogeneity is substantially greater than for the GYGA-ED for most weather variables that are sensitive drivers of crop production. Some \{CZ\} schemes are crop-specific, which limits utility for up-scaling location-specific evaluation of yield gaps in regions with crop rotations rather than single crop species. "

abstract = "Deepwater rice is grown widely in areas flooding every year to depths of 0.5 to 3.5 m in the valleys and deltas of South and Southeast Asia. In Bangladesh alone, 1.7 million ha are planted to this especially adapted type of rice. The agronomic practices and yield performance of deepwater rice were investigated in Bangladesh from 1977 to 1980 by farmer survey and crop-cut assessment. Land preparation consists usually of seven ploughings and eight harrowings in January to April with simple cattle-drawn implements; usually dry seed, but occasionally pre-germinated seed, is broadcast at 87–95 kg/ha in March to May and a small amount of transplanting takes place; 58% of the fields were sown to pure stands of deepwater rice, 32% were mixed sown with a short duration rice (‘aus’), and 10% were mixed with other non-rice crops. Small amounts of dung and compost are applied; fertilizer was used on one-quarter of the fields, mainly in the eastern, high-rainfall areas; virtually no pesticides are applied. Weeds were controlled in the preflood period (April to mid June) by two cultivations and two handweedings. Harvesting (October to December) is by hand and by cattle are used for threshing; the straw serves mainly as animal fodder and the more bulky stubble is used for fuel in the village or as a mulch for dry season crops. From December to March 80–87% of the fields were planted to dry season crops; more than 90% of the fields were double- or triple-cropped during the year. Favourable preflood rainfall and mild flooding regimes in 1977 and 1978 produced average yields of 2.5 and 2.3 t/ha unmilled paddy, respectively. In 1979 an early drought, and in 1980 severe late flooding, were mainly responsible for reducing the average yield to 2.1 t/ha. The overall 4-year yield average of 2.3 t/ha represents a higher yield level than that quoted in many previous reports. Deepwater rice yields appear to be higher and more stable than the short duration aus crop which is planted at the same time. Higher yields were associated with: (a) the Meghna floodplain having higher early rainfall and a milder flooding pattern; (b) vareties such as Pankaish, Khama, and Kartik Sail yielding &gt; 3 t/ha in one-third of the fields; (c) maximum water depths of 1.5–1.8 (although some varieties yielded well in 3.4 m of water); and (d) pure stands of deepwater rice. The mean yield of fertilized fields was similar to that of unfertilized ones. Farmers use simple wooden implements and few inputs except for the relatively high labour requirements of land preparation, weeding and harvesting. The stable yields are probably due to: (a) natural sources of fertility (crop residues, pulse crops, alluvium and algae); (b) the development of intensive cropping patterns using different crops and special varieties accompanied by a set of versatile agronomic practices; and (c) the absence of a water deficit during the reproductive phase. Yields are clearly governed by the distribution of preflood rainfall, flooding regime, the deepwater rice variety selected, the cropping pattern followed, and the incidence of several pests. "

We analyzed yield trends in 25 \{LTE\} (seven R–R, 18 R–W systems) across a wide geographical range in Asia. Three main conclusions emerged from this analysis. First, application of either manure or straw did not improve grain yield trends in R–R and R–W cropping systems. Second, depending on socio-economic conditions, use of manure or straw in these cropping systems may be profitable, provided these \{OA\} are used as a complement to a recommended dose of inorganic \{NPK\} (i.e. organic materials should not be used as the primary nutrient source). Third, current experimental designs to assess the suitability of \{OA\} need to be improved in order to allow a better comparison of the relative advantages of inorganic and organic fertilizers. The major shortcoming of current designs is that they do not properly adjust mineral fertilizer rates in the inorganic treatments to account for the macronutrient input from OA.

Much of the world’s rice is produced and consumed in Asia where cropping intensity is often greater than 100% (more than one crop per year), yet this intensity is not sufficiently represented in many land use products. Agricultural practices and investments vary by season due to the different challenges faced, such as drought, salinity, or flooding, and the different requirements such as varietal choice, water source, inputs, and crop establishment methods. Thus, spatial and temporal information on the seasonal extent of rice is an important input to decision making related to increased agricultural productivity and the sustainable use of limited natural resources. The goal of this study was to demonstrate that hyper temporal moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data can be used to map the spatial distribution of the seasonal rice crop extent and area. The study was conducted in Bangladesh where rice can be cropped once, twice, or three times a year. \{MODIS\} normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maximum value composite (MVC) data at 500 m resolution along with seasonal field-plot information from year 2010 were used to map rice crop extent and area for three seasons, boro (December/January–April), aus (April/May–June/July), and aman (July/August–November/December), in Bangladesh. A subset of the field-plot information was used to assess the pixel-level accuracy of the MODIS-derived rice area. Seasonal district-level rice area statistics were used to assess the accuracy of the rice area estimates. When compared to field-plot data, the maps of rice versus non-rice exceeded 90% accuracy in all three seasons and the accuracy of the five rice classes varied from 78% to 90% across the three seasons. On average, the MODIS-derived rice area estimates were 6% higher than the sub-national statistics during boro, 7% higher during aus, and 3% higher during the aman season. The MODIS-derived sub-national areas explained (R2 values) 96%, 93%, and 96% of the variability at the district level for boro, aus, and aman seasons, respectively. The results demonstrated that the methods we applied for analysing and interpreting moderate spatial and high temporal resolution imagery can accurately capture the seasonal variability in rice crop extent and area. We discuss the robustness of the approach and highlight issues that must be addressed before similar methods are used across other areas of Asia where a mix of rainfed, irrigated, or supplemental irrigation permits single, double, and triple cropping in a single calendar year.

abstract = "Rice-based (Oryza sativa L.) rainfed lowlands are the major cropping system in northeast Thailand. Earlier research on nutrient management of rainfed lowland rice produced conflicting results with respect to inherent soil fertility, fertilizer response, and the importance of organic fertilizers, most probably because of highly variable soil quality and water resources. The objectives of this paper were to advance the understanding of soil fertility and fertilizer response in northeast Thailand and thereby provide a basic framework for improved nutrient management of rainfed lowland rice. For this purpose, we analyzed an existing database on fertilizer trials conducted between 1995 and 1997 at eight different sites in northeast Thailand, which were previously described by Wade et al. [Wade, L.J., Amarante, S.T., Olea, A., Harnpichitvitaya, D., Naklang, K., Wihardjaka, A., Sengar, S.S., Mazid, M.A., Singh, G., McLaren, C.G., 1999a. Nutrient requirements in rainfed lowland rice. Field Crops Res., 64, 91–107]. Average annual rainfall across sites and seasons was 1300 mm, but half of all rainfed trials (12 of 23) experienced substantial water stress during the growing season. Average grain yield in N-omission plots was low (1.6 t ha−1), even when compared with that of rainfed lowlands in neighboring Lao PDR. Nitrogen was clearly the most limiting element, whereas \{PK\} treatments increased yields significantly in only 6 out of 78 observations. Average agronomic efficiency of applied N was good (16 kg grain kg−1 N), but highly variable among sites. Two groups of soils (i.e., sites) were separated because of their distinct differences in reaction to inorganic and organic fertilizer. Better nutrient availability improved crop performance at all field water stress levels occurring at the trial sites. However, yield reductions caused by water stress seemed to interact with the level of nutrient supply, that is, absolute yield differences between different fertilizer treatments decreased with increasing water stress. We concluded that efficient fertilizer use in rainfed rice of northeast Thailand can be achieved, but that existing uniform recommendations do not provide farmers with much useful advice. Therefore, we proposed a set of basic guidelines for improved nutrient management, which, after further efforts of all stakeholders involved, could contribute to increased system productivity. "

Surveys for the incidence of stem borers in deepwater rice in Bangladesh from 1977 to 1980, and in Thailand during 1981 and 1982, showed that borer incidence and species composition were remarkably similar. Scirpophaga incertulas (Walker) usually comprised more than 90% of the borer population and was almost exclusively present during the main flooding period. Chilo polychrysus (Meyr.) comprised 11% and Sesamia inferens (Walker) 6% of the population in the pre-flood and ripening stages. Low borer activity in the early part of the season was explained by a low nucleus population, the synchronous planting of deepwater rice, and severe moisture stress and high temperatures in the pre-flood period. In Bangladesh, a severe drought in 1979 limited Scirpophaga incertulas populations to unusually low levels until the flowering stage. In Thailand, drier conditions, the lack of an intervening rice crop in the dry season and a longer pre-flood period, appeared to severely restrict early season borer activity. The onset of flooding and stem elongation provided a more favourable environment for S. incertulas. Borer activity increased steadily during the first 3–4 months of flooding, to average 23% damaged stems (26 m−2) and 13 borer immature stages/100 stems (13 m−2) by the flowering stage. Borer activity continued at about the same level as the water receded, to reach maximum annual levels of 38–44% damaged stems (35 m−2) at the late-ripening stage. At harvest, 60% of the fields were at outbreak level (&gt;40% damaged stems). Such high levels of damage are explained by the long growth period of deepwater rice, favourable weather during the flooding period, and the optimum habitat of the elongated stem. S. incertulas populations then crashed to low levels; the larvae entering diapause in the field stubble. Although related to actual damage, the deadheart and whitehead symptoms grossly under-estimated the extent of stem damage. "

No acetylene reduction activity or accumulation of N (Kjeldahl analysis) was observed in the surface oil when the light was not allowed to penetrate to the water and soil surface.

We characterized the inter-seasonal daily variations of actual crop evapotranspiration (ET), transpiration (T), and evaporation (E) using the eddy covariance (EC) technique during 2011 and 2012 dry seasons. The average growing season \{ET\} rate of maize was 3.90 mm d−1 in 2011 and 3.74 mm d−1 in 2012. For the dry-seeded rice, the average growing season \{ET\} rate was 4.36 mm d−1 in 2011 and 4.13 mm d−1 in 2012. Growing season \{ET\} of maize (484 mm) and dry-seeded rice (523 mm) in 2011 were higher than during 2012 (453 mm for maize and 475 mm for dry-seeded rice) because of higher net radiation (Rn) in 2011. Partitioning \{ET\} showed that T accounted for 66–74% of seasonal \{ET\} for maize and 53–60% for dry-seeded rice. On average, dry-seeded rice had 6.5% more \{ET\} than maize due to higher irrigation water inputs. The average total water input (irrigation + precipitation) for maize was 618 mm while that of the dry-seeded rice was 908 mm. The large difference between crop coefficient (Kc) and basal crop coefficient (Kcb) values during the initial and crop development stages of both maize and dry-seeded rice provides a good opportunity to optimize irrigation water input by designing a more efficient irrigation schedule that is appropriate to the water needs of the crops.

In our study, the response to management intensification of fertilizer application at rates of 40 N ha−1, 13 P ha−1, and 16.7 K ha−1 and two weed control treatments as compared with no fertilizer, and one hand weeding practice commonly followed by farmers in rainfed upland areas was examined with a large set of advanced breeding lines and adapted upland varieties tested over 3 years in multi-location trials. Highly significant genotype × environment interaction was observed in combined analyses across environments, leading to sub-grouping of sites into the high-yielding or favorable and low-yielding or unfavorable upland environment groups. A significant effect of management regime was observed. Averaged over 15 environments, the moderate-input treatment out-yielded the low-input treatment by nearly 65% or 0.8 t ha−1 under favorable environments and by nearly 48% (0.3 t ha−1) in unfavorable environments. A significant genotype effect and genotype × input management interaction for yield at favorable sites was observed. However, the same was not significant at unfavorable sites. Varietal differences were relatively small at unfavorable sites across input levels. The heritability estimates for grain yield were moderately high in both moderate- and low-input conditions in favorable environments. The genetic correlation between yields in moderate- and low-input conditions was high in both favorable and unfavorable environments. The study indicated that improved varieties performed well relative to landraces under low-input management. Improved varieties along with modestly intensified management offer an attractive option to increase the productivity of rainfed upland environments. For both favorable and unfavorable environments, indirect selection under moderate-input conditions was less efficient than direct selection for grain yield in low-input conditions, indicating upland breeding programs to adopt selection for grain yield under both moderate- and low-input conditions.

Irradiation was for 6 h daily for 21 days starting at 9 days after planting. After irradiation, plants were inoculated with one or two blast isolates.

In a second experiment the dose-response relationship between the cultivars \{IR30\} and \{IR72\} and UV-B was established in the presence and absence of disease. Increasing levels of UV-B significantly reduced leaf areas, dry weights, and heights of both cultivars. Disease severity was either unaffected or decreased by UV-B. However, disease significantly changed the effects of UV-B on plant growth and recovery from UV-B damage. \{IR30\} but not \{IR72\} recovered from UV-B damage in the absence of disease within 5 days. No recovery occurred when inoculated. \{IR72\} suffered even greater reductions of leaf area and dry weight by UV-B when inoculated.

Experiments to understand the effectiveness of foliar Zn application at different growth stages in enriching grain Zn of biofortification breeding lines were conducted during the dry season at an experiment station and in a farmer's field with moderately and severely Zn-deficient soils, respectively. Foliar Zn applications at 4 kg Zn ha−1 as zinc sulfate were given at different growth stages: active tillering, heading, and both active tillering + heading. Foliar Zn application at active tillering had no effect on brown rice Zn concentration, but, at heading, there was a range in genotype response from 1 to 10 mg kg−1 increase, with an average increase of 4 mg kg−1 at the moderately Zn-deficient site and 7 mg kg−1 at the severely Zn-deficient site. At the moderately Zn-deficient site, two biofortification breeding lines (IR83668, IR91152AC) reached the target of 30 mg kg−1 Zn in brown rice without Zn fertilization at heading stage, while two other genotypes (IR68144, IR91143AC) reached the target with heading-stage foliar Zn application. At the severely Zn-deficient site, only one of the tested genotypes (IR68144) reached the target Zn concentration even after foliar Zn application at both active tillering and heading stage and the same genotype recorded the greatest response to foliar Zn (10 mg kg−1 increase). Greater total leaf area at spraying time increased the effectiveness of foliar Zn application at the severely Zn-deficient site only. Foliar Zn application at the two tested growth stages failed to overcome agronomic Zn deficiency. Three of the biofortification breeding lines (IR68144, IR85800, and IR83668) had high grain Zn content that was independent of grain yield. In a separate experiment to test a wider range of spraying times at the severely deficient site with IR64, the spraying at the early milk stage emerged as the most effective stage for increasing brown rice Zn concentration. Our results show that agronomic Zn biofortification through foliar Zn application is likely to be much more effective at increasing grain Zn concentration of genotypes with strong Zn-remobilization capacity than those with weak remobilization capacity.

The treatments in Bangladesh included a researchers managed minus-N plot (0–22–42) and the farmers’ practices. Rice and wheat yields were higher in all treatments than the 0–22–42 control plots, with the exception of rice with the farmers’ practices at one location in Bangladesh. The researchers’ treatment of 100–22–42 in Nepal resulted in larger yields of both rice and wheat than the farmers’ practices, indicating that farmers’ rates of N-fertilizer (mean 49 kg N ha−1) were too low. Delaying wheat seeding reduced yields in the fertilized plots in both countries, especially as N-fertilizer dose increased. Soil N-supplying capacities (SNSC), measured as total N accumulation from the zero-N plots (0–22–42), and grain yields without N additions were greater for rice than for wheat in both Nepal and Bangladesh. Higher \{SNSC\} in rice was probably due to greater mineralization of soil organic N in the warm, moist conditions of the monsoon season than in the cooler, drier wheat season. However, \{SNSC\} was not correlated with total soil N, two soil N availability tests (hot KCl-extractable NH4+ or 7-day anaerobic incubation), exchangeable NH4+ or NO3−. Wheat in Nepal had greater N-recovery efficiency, agronomic efficiency of N, and physiological efficiency of N than rice. Nitrogen internal-use efficiency of rice for all treatments in both countries was within published ranges of maximum sufficiency and maximum dilution. In wheat, the relationship between grain yield and N accumulation was linear indicating that mobilization of plant N to the grain was less affected by biotic and abiotic stresses than in rice. "

This challenge has lead to the notion that crop water productivity (WP) needs to be increased. The debate on how to increase \{WP\} is confounded by different definitions and scale levels of analysis. Moreover, improvements in \{WP\} do not necessarily mean the production of more food. A systematic framework built on generic principles for the analysis of \{WP\} can help to identify interventions that can contribute to the dual goal of increasing food production and saving water. In this paper, a conceptual framework with four principles is proposed that can be applied at different scales: (1) increase transpirational crop water productivity, (2) increase the storage size for water in time or space, (3) increase the proportion of non-irrigation water inflows to the storage pool, and (4) decrease the non-transpirational water outflows of the storage pool. These principles can be applied to the improvement of genetic resources and to the improvement of natural resource management. The framework is illustrated with examples at the plant, field and (small) agricultural landscape level, for cropping systems found in semi-arid areas to flooded rice in monsoon climates. "

It was hypothesized that the losses can be reduced by measures that minimize crack development during the soil drying period or impede the flow of water through these cracks. The effect of straw mulching and shallow surface tillage on crack formation during the fallow period, and on water flow components during land preparation was investigated in field experiments on an Epiaqualf and a Pellustert in the Philippines. Cracks did not completely close upon rewetting, resulting in high loss (152–235 mm of water) during land preparation of the control (i.e. no soil management treatment) plots. Straw mulching helped conserve moisture in the soil profile, and reduced the mean crack width by 32% of the control. Mulching did not significantly reduce mean crack depth and the amount of water used in land preparation. Shallow tillage formed small soil aggregates which made the crack water flow discontinuous and impeded groundwater recharge from the water flow through cracks, reduced total water input for land preparation by 31–34%, equivalent to about 120 mm of water. The average surface irrigation water flow advanced faster and less time was needed for land preparation in the shallow tillage plots compared to the control. Shallow tillage offers a practical means for improving water-use efficiency of irrigation systems. In rainfed areas, it may facilitate early crop establishment and, thus, reduce the risk of late-season drought. "

Perceived susceptibility was also high, with 59% of farmers believing that a loss of 450 kg/ha would be “extremely or very likely”. Farmers believed insecticides could destroy natural enemies but placed only moderate importance to conserving them.

A pilot effort that drew on these results found friction between farmers and the irrigation authority over fee collection and system rehabilitation to be the major constraint to achieving greater synchrony. It is argued, however, that in the long run, financial pressures may favour the cooperation such a scheme requires.

Three field experiments were conducted to compare the performance of this ‘plunger planter’ seeding method against five other methods to establish mungbean (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilzeck) following rainfed rice (Oryza sativa L.). The experiments were conducted on a silty clay Tropaquept during the 1990 and 1991 dry seasons (DS) at the International Rice Research Institute. Planting depths from 2 to 14 cm did not significantly affect seedling emergence (which varied from 88–97%) or grain yield. The apparent optimum depth was 6–8 cm. A needle-like pont attachment to the end of the plunger increased mungbean stem diameter and facilitated vertical rooting, but had no significant effect on seedling emergence or yield. Plunger planting (PP) was successful at 50% soil moisture content (g/g). The other seeding methods could only be employed at a soil moisture content of 34% or less. Grain yields with \{PP\} in the 1990 \{DS\} (1.3-1.6 t/ha) were significantly greater than with all other methods (yield range of 0.4-0.8 t/ha). In the 1991 DS, yields with \{PP\} (2.2 t/ha) exceeded those with the other methods by 0.4-0.7 t/ha. Seedling emergence, plant density at harvest, and total dry matter were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) increased with \{PP\} in 1990, but not in 1991 (a season of less severe water stress). The \{PP\} method proved to have promising potential as a means of establishing mungbean in saturated soils, gaining time for germination and root growth before soil strength becomes prohibitive to root penetration, and enabling greater water use from deep soil layers. The plunger planter principle is adaptable to mechanical seeding. "

A study was conducted during the wet season of 2012 and the dry season of 2013 at the International Rice Research Institute to evaluate the effect of the tillage systems (ZT and CONT), seeding rate [low seeding rate (LSR) at 50 kg ha−1, and high seeding rate (HSR) at 100 kg ha−1], and weed control treatments (oxadiazon applied as pre-emergence, oxadiazon applied as pre-emergence followed by a commercial mixture of fenoxaprop + ethoxysulfuron as post-emergence at 21–24 days after sowing, and weedy) on weed growth and grain yield in \{DSR\} systems. The efficacy of herbicides 14 days after the application of post-emergence herbicide was similar between the tillage systems and between seeding rates. At crop harvest, weed biomass was higher in the \{ZT\} plots than in the \{CONT\} plots, and higher at \{LSR\} than at HSR. At the same time, herbicide applications decreased weed biomass by 73–96%, compared with the weedy plots. Compared with the \{ZT\} plots, \{CONT\} plots had 9–18% higher grain yield. Similarly, plots sown at \{HSR\} had 17–19% higher grain yield than at LSR. Weedy plots had 81–84% less yield than the herbicide-treated plots (3060–3380 kg ha−1 in the wet season and 5820–5950 kg ha−1 in the dry season). "

Therefore, over the past few years in many countries, there has been a growing trend toward conservation agriculture (CA) to enhance sustainability without compromising land productivity. Three important pillars of \{CA\} are minimal tillage operations, permanent residue cover, and rotation of primary crops. Adoption of CA, however, influences weed populations differently from conventional agriculture. Weed control in \{CA\} is a greater challenge than in conventional agriculture because there is no weed seed burial by tillage operations and soil-applied herbicides are not incorporated, resulting in reduced efficacy. The behavior of weeds and their interaction with crops under \{CA\} tend to be complex and not fully understood. A large proportion of weed seed bank remains generally on or close to the soil surface after crop sowing under CA. Weed species, in which germination is stimulated by light, are likely to be more problematic in CA. In addition, in the absence of tillage, perennial weeds may also become more challenging in this system. On the other hand, weed seeds present on the soil surface are more prone to desiccation and greater predation activity of insects, especially ants. Crop residues, when uniformly and densely present, under \{CA\} could suppress weed seedling emergence, delay the time of emergence, and allow the crop to gain an initial advantage in terms of early vigor over weeds. Where pre-emergence herbicides are applied, crop residues may also intercept a considerable proportion of the applied herbicide and may result in lower herbicide efficacy. Approaches such as stale seedbed practice, uniform and dense crop establishment, use of cover crops and crop residues as mulch, crop rotations, and practices for enhanced crop competiveness with a combination of pre- and post-emergence herbicides could be integrated to develop sustainable and effective weed management strategies under \{CA\} systems.

This study tested the ability of the \{ORYZA2000\} model to simulate the effects of water management on rice growth, yield, water productivity (WP), components of the water balance, and soil water dynamics in north-west India. The model performed well as indicated by good agreement between simulated and measured values of grain yield, biomass, LAI, water balance components and soil water tension, for irrigation thresholds ranging from continuous flooding (CF) to 70 kPa soil water tension. Using weather data for 40 different rice seasons (1970–2009) at Ludhiana in Punjab, India, the model predicted that there is always some yield penalty when moving from \{CF\} to alternate wetting and drying (AWD). With an irrigation threshold of 10 kPa, the average yield penalty was 0.8 t ha−1 (9%) compared with CF, with 65% irrigation water saving, which increased to 79% at 70 kPa with a yield penalty of 25%. The irrigation water saving was primarily due to less drainage beyond the root zone with \{AWD\} compared to CF, with only a small reduction in evapotranspiration (ET) (mean 60 mm). There were tradeoffs between yield, irrigation amount and various measures of WP. While yield was maximum with CF, water productivity with respect to \{ET\} (WPET) was maximum (1.7 g kg−1) for irrigation thresholds of 0 (CF) to 20 kPa, and irrigation water productivity (WPI) increased to a maximum plateau (1.3 g kg−1) at thresholds ≥30 kPa. Because of the possibility of plant stress at critical stages known to be sensitive to water deficit (panicle initiation (PI) and flowering (FL)), treatments with additional irrigations were superimposed for 2 weeks at one or both of these stages within the 10, 20 and 30 kPa \{AWD\} treatments. Ponding for two weeks at \{FL\} was more effective in reducing the yield penalty with \{AWD\} than ponding at PI, but the biggest improvement was with ponding at both stages. This reduced the average yield loss from 9% (0.8 t ha−1) to 5% (0.5 t ha−1) for \{AWD\} with thresholds of 10 and 20 kPa. However, maximum \{WPI\} (1.1 g kg−1) was achieved with an irrigation threshold of 20 kPa combined with more frequent irrigation at \{FL\} only, but with a greater yield penalty (8%). Thus the optimum irrigation schedule depends on whether the objective is to maximise yield, \{WPET\} or WPI, which depends on whether land or water are most limiting. Furthermore, the optimum irrigation schedule to meet the short term needs of individual farmers may differ from that needed for sustainable water resource management. "

We review evidence for the impact of apple snails on natural and managed wetlands focusing on those studies that have elucidated impact mechanisms. Significant changes in wetland ecosystems have been noted in regions where the snails are established: Two species in particular (Pomacea canaliculata and Pomacea maculata) have become major pests of aquatic crops, including rice, and caused enormous increases in molluscicide use. Invasive apple snails have also altered macrophyte community structure in natural and managed wetlands through selective herbivory and certain apple snail species can potentially shift the balance of freshwater ecosystems from clear water (macrophyte dominated) to turbid (plankton dominated) states by depleting densities of native aquatic plants. Furthermore, the introductions of some apple snail species have altered benthic community structure either directly, through predation, or indirectly, through exploitation competition or as a result of management actions. To date much of the evidence for these impacts has been based on correlations, with few manipulative field or mesocosm experiments. Greater attention to impact monitoring is required, and, for Asia in particular, a landscape approach to impact management that includes both natural and managed-rice wetlands is recommended. "

We studied the energy efficiency of irrigated lowland rice production in double-rice cropping systems in farmers’ fields, experimental triple-rice systems, and experimental diversified cropping systems in the Philippines. The mean total agronomic energy input (AEI) expended on rice crops in farmers’ fields varied from 12.4 to 13.1 \{GJ\} ha−1. The \{AEI\} for rice varied from 12.8 to 22.8 \{GJ\} ha−1 in the triple-rice system and 15.3 to 30.9 \{GJ\} ha−1 in diversified rice-based systems. The combined energy use in N fertiliser and fossil fuel accounted for more than 60% of total \{AEI\} used in farmers’ fields and over 75% of total \{AEI\} used in experimental fields. Manual labour accounted for less than 3% of the total \{AEI\} in these systems. Mean net energy yield productivity (NEYp) of the rice produced varied from 11.3 to 12.3 \{GJ\} Mg−1 of grain yield in farmers’ fields, 12 to 12.5 \{GJ\} Mg−1 of grain yield in triple-rice production, and 9.3 to 10.2 \{GJ\} Mg−1 of grain yield in diversified rice-based systems. Future rice production systems will require more mechanisation as labour supply becomes insufficient to meet demand. Such rice production systems of the future will require innovative agronomic practices to achieve high yields, high fertiliser use efficiency, and low fossil fuel demands in order to match or exceed the energy efficiency of current rice farming.

To build understanding necessary to develop effective field drainage practices for pre-rice crops, pot and field studies were undertaken on a Typic Tropaquept lowland rice soil in the Cagayan Valley, Philippines. The objective of the studies was to quantify effects of excessive moisture on mungbeans (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek) encountering variable regimes of duration and elevation of water table height in the root zone during a shortterm waterlogging event. Small differences in level and duration of the root zone water table markedly affected plant performance. Yields were reduced by 40–100% when the water table level reached the soil surface for 6 days compared with the unstressed treatment, but were reduced by only 12–17% when the water level was 5 cm below the surface for the same time period. Regression analysis revealed a 4% reduction in yield per centimetre increase in water table level between 5 cm below to 5 cm above the soil surface during the vegetative stage, and a 6.5% reduction per centimetre during the reproductive stage. Field experiments evaluated two prospective surface drainage techniques that farmers could employ to elevate the crop above the zone of saturation during waterlogging events. Planting in furrows, and subsequently hilling up (HU) to create ridges was unsuccessful in improving plant performance (as the base of the plant was not elevated). Planting on 25 cm high ridges formed by a plow dramatically improved growth and yield of mungbean ( ≥ 360% advantage compared with the other treatments) when subjected to a range of waterlogging stress events. Standing water occurred for 5–7 days on the soil surface of HU, broadcast seeded (B), and drilled (D) treatments, but was 56 6 cbelow the base of the plants in the ridge treatment during the two flooding events. The ridging method was observed to be effective for farm-scale use in cultivating pre-rice mungbeans with either animal or tractor power. "

abstract = "Deepwater rice (DWR) grows on rainfed dryland or with shallow flooding for 1–3 months, and is then flooded over 0.5 m for a month or more. In some areas, water may reach 4 m. Survival depends on elongation of stems, and panicle emergence occurs at about maximum water level. Most fields drain before harvest. Nitrogen balances are not known, and grain-yield responses to N are inconsistent due to the crop's long growth duration, extremes of drought and deep flooding, its sprawling growth habit and prostate condition at harvest, the possible movement of N with floodwaters, and unknown contributions of N from floodwater and biological fixation. To assess the fate of applied N, we measured N uptake of \{DWR\} at two sites in Thailand: at Huntra, where soil with pH 5.5 usually has no grain response to added N; and at Prachinburi, with soil pH 4.0, where responses commonly occur. Fertilizer treatments were single application or split combinations of urea N as basal incorporation, broadcast three weeks after emergence or pre-flood, and super granules placed in the soil at the commencement of flooding, with rates of 37 or 75 kg N ha−1 in 1986 and 1987, and 56 kg N ha−1 in 1988. Plants were sampled for dry-weight and N content at intervals from before flooding to harvest. Crop response to N was affected particularly by time and severity of flooding. Deep flooding before plants were 50 days of age reduced N uptake and dry-matter production to low levels. Maximum water depth was around 1 m. In two trials, early fertilizer N ensured survival with rapidly increasing floodwater. Late N gave initially high plant N% and rates of uptake. Most treatments showed a sharp decrease in uptake immediately after flooding, but in two seasons the crop at Huntra had increased rates of N uptake during the later part of the flood, indicating continuing availability of N. The source of this N is yet to be identified, but crop uptake in the absence of fertilizer can integrate inputs of N from all other sources, and may be useful for predicting N requirements. Grain-yield was reduced if dry-matter was less than 1.50 t ha−1 or N uptake less than 20 kg ha−1 at the onset of flooding. "

Despite past extension campaigns to the contrary, farmers based their decisions more on crop monitoring than prophylaxis. Farmers were deficient in pest identification skills using terms such as worms, moths, and hoppers while some farmers targeted beneficials. Farmers mostly based decisions on planthoppers, leafhoppers, and moths by seeing the insect pest, on whorl maggot, defoliators, and leaffolders by noting damage, and on rice bug and seedbed pests by prophylaxis. Decision protocols were largely site specific based on different pest complexes and outbreak histories as well as being highly farmer specific. A large proportion of prophylactic applications during the early crop stages was timed with fertilizer application. Farmers’ frequency of field visitation was as recommended for pests, but reasons to visit the field at the time of a spray decision were predominantly water management. A generalized pattern emerged with monitoring starting on the way to the farmer's field. Some decisions were prompted upon seeing infestation in an earlier planted field or a neighbour spraying. A number of farmers sought lower lying more flooded parcels or downwind sides of parcels to visit first as these microhabitats favour greater pest densities. Most decisions were made while walking along the field border observing patches of damage or flushed moths with the unit of measure being the parcel. The field was entered only as a last resort. Farmers’ action thresholds were lower than those of researchers and sampling was less rigorous. A minority of farmers, however, expressed insect pest abundance in quantitative terms using sampling units of several rice hills, distance of rice rows, and per panicle. Some of the more innovative farmers’ pest assessment methods were tested later by researchers. "

Settlement by in-migration began early in the twentieth century. By 1949 9% of the land was cultivated, but grassland (59%) and forest (14%) were the dominant land uses. From 1949 to 1967 the cultivated area doubled to 20%, and the proportion of grassland decreased to less than 50% of the land. The forested area remained unchanged. Subsequently, settlement by small-scale farmers accelerated. Between 1967 and 1988 the area cropped annually doubled again to 41%. Forest land declined drastically during this period to 1%, while perennial cropland (mainly coffee) increased to 30%. Land use on the steeply sloping lands (more than 15%) was particularly affected during the 21 year period: 27% was converted to field crop production, and 43% to perennial crops. More than 33% of the food crop area is now on steep slopes.

In transplanted rice, hand weeding is the most common weed control method in South and Southeast Asia. Phenoxy acid herbicides such as 2,4-D and \{MCPA\} and some selective herbicides such as butachlor and thiobencarb are used by a few rice farmers. As labor costs rise, chemical methods of weed control combined with cultural practices and other direct methods provide attractive alternatives to hand weeding. Furthermore, with area under wet seeding increasing in some places, chemical weed control will play a more important role. Countries with high cost of labor and good control over irrigation water such as Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, use herbicides on 75 to 100% of their rice. "

Field experiments were conducted during 1994–1996 on a Chromic Vertisol in central Luzon, the Philippines, to study the effect of water, tillage and herbicide levels on total water use, weed growth and yield of wet seeded rice. The treatments included three water regimes (i) shallow-water ponding (5 ± 2 cm) throughout the crop growth period (W1), (ii) shallow-water ponding until panicle initiation and then saturated soil (W2), and (iii) saturated soil (W3); two tillage levels (i) one ploughing + two harrowings (T1), and (ii) two ploughings + two harrowings (T2); and three herbicide levels, pretilachlor at a rate of (i) 0.30 kg a.i. ha−1 (H1) and (ii) 0.15 kg a.i. ha−1 (H2), and (iii) no herbicide (H3). Water ponding effectively suppressed weeds, irrespective of the herbicide dose applied. Both, the herbicide levels (H1 and H2) were equally effective and produced statistically similar rice yields. More intensive tillage (T2), produced significant positive effect in controlling weeds in the dry season. The T2-W1-H1 combination produced the highest rice yield. Saturated soil (W3) saved about 40% of water compared to continuous shallow ponding (W1) and produced statistically the same rice yield when weeds were controlled by herbicide. Proper use of herbicide can thus substitute the excessive water-consuming practice of continuous submergence in rice fields. "

Management strategies that reduce the irrigation amount and labour requirement while maintaining or increasing yield are urgently needed. Dry seeded rice (DSR) has been proposed as one means of achieving these objectives, but little is known about optimal water management for DSR. Therefore a field study was conducted on a clay loam soil in Punjab, India, during 2008 and 2009, to investigate the effects of irrigation management on the performance of puddled transplanted rice (PTR) and dry seeded rice. Irrigation scheduling treatments were based on soil water tension (SWT) ranging from ponding/saturation (daily irrigation) to alternate wetting and drying (AWD) with irrigation thresholds of 20, 40 and 70 kPa at 18–20 cm soil depth. Rainfall was above average and well distributed in 2008 (822 mm), and average and less well distributed in 2009 (663 mm). With daily irrigation, crop duration of \{PTR\} and \{DSR\} was the same. Shifting from daily irrigation to \{AWD\} delayed crop maturity by 8–17 d, and \{DSR\} was more affected than PTR, and more so in the drier year. Crop performance in terms of tiller density, leaf area index and growth rate was better in \{DSR\} than \{PTR\} with daily and 20 kPa irrigation scheduling. However, crop performance was poorer in \{DSR\} than \{PTR\} at higher (40 and 70 kPa) irrigation thresholds, more so in the drier year when \{DSR\} showed signs of severe iron deficiency which was not overcome with iron sprays. Yield components were similar in both establishment methods when irrigation was scheduled daily or at 20 kPa, but panicle density and the number of filled grains per panicle were significantly lower at 40 and 70 kPa in \{DSR\} than PTR. Each year, yield of \{DSR\} and \{PTR\} were similar when irrigation was scheduled daily or at 20 kPa. Yields of both \{PTR\} and \{DSR\} declined under higher water deficit stress (40 and 70 kPa irrigation thresholds), but more so in DSR, and more so in the drier year. There was a very large and significant decline in irrigation water input with irrigation at 20 kPa compared to daily irrigation in both establishment methods, but only a very small decline in irrigation amount when the threshold was increased from 20 to 40 and 70 kPa. Irrigation water use in DSR-AWD treatments was significantly lower than in respective \{PTR\} treatments (e.g. by 33–53% when irrigation was scheduled at 20 kPa). The results suggest the feasibility of reducing irrigation amount while maintaining yield by replacing \{PTR\} with \{DSR\} with AWD, provided that soil tension is kept lower than 20 kPa at 20 cm depth, but that this threshold needs to be tested over a wider range of seasonal and site conditions and varieties.

Dry seeded rice (DSR) has been proposed as one of the technologies to achieve these objectives, but little is known about tradeoffs between land and water productivity of rice as affected by irrigation schedule. This study tested the ability of the \{ORYZA2000\} model to simulate the effects of irrigation schedule of \{DSR\} on yield, various measures of water productivity, and soil water dynamics. The study showed that under conditions of no or mild water stress (up to 20 kPa SWT) \{ORYZA2000\} performs well in simulating the effects of irrigation schedule on crop growth, yield, soil water dynamics, water balance components and water productivity of \{DSR\} in north-west India. However, the model overpredicted crop growth and yield at higher irrigation thresholds (40 and 70 kPa) which was atleast partially due to the fact that the \{DSR\} suffered from iron deficiency at higher irrigation thresholds. Using weather data for 40 rice seasons, the model predicted that there is always some yield penalty when switching from continuous flooding (CF) to alternate wetting and drying (AWD) of DSR. The yield decline varied from 6% with an irrigation threshold of 10 kPa to 26% at 70 kPa. However, there was large irrigation water saving when changing from \{CF\} to alternate wetting and drying (AWD) at only 10 kPa, and only a small rate of decline in irrigation input as the threshold increased from 10 to 70 kPa. The water saving with \{AWD\} was primarily because of less drainage. There were tradeoffs between yield, water productivity and water depletion in relation to irrigation schedule. Maximum yield occurred with CF, maximum \{WPI\} and WPI+R with an irrigation threshold of 30 kPa and maximum \{WPET\} with a threshold of 20 kPa. "

Genetic variation has been identified for both broad adaptation across target rainfed lowland environments and specific adaptations to some of the abiotic stress environments, e.g. late season drought, and submergence during vegetative development. However, in general progress in genetic improvement of adaptation that contributes to higher and more stable yields has been extremely slow. The opportunities for increasing the rate of genetic improvement of grain yield is examined under the four headings: (1) the complexity of the target genotype–environment system; (2) the genetic resources available to the breeding programs; (3) clarity of the breeding objectives, capacity of the adopted breeding strategy to achieve the necessary genetic modifications and selection strategy; and (4) the physical and human resource capability to implement, evaluate and manage the necessary breeding strategies. Recommendations are made on priority research areas that are required to integrate the growing understanding of rainfed lowland rice adaptation and the needs of the breeding programs. "

The 136 accessions represented six groups defined on the basis of isozyme classification, with isozyme group six further subdivided on the basis of origin and morphology. An additional 28 rice cultivars were evaluated for seminal root xylem vessel diameter when grown in pots in a growth chamber. Rice groups differed in root thickness, root xylem vessel diameter, root:shoot ratio, and patterns of root distribution. Isozyme group 1, which corresponds generally to the indica subspecies, had thin, superficial roots with narrow vessels and a low root:shoot ratio. The other major isozyme group, group 6, comprising japonica types, was characterized by thick roots with wider vessels, a greater proportion of the root weight below 15 cm, and a larger root:shoot ratio. On an average, the bulu and temperate group 6 accessions were similar to the non-bulu types except that their root:shoot ratios and proportion of root weight above 15 cm were more similar to group 1. Group 2, with aus types from South Asia, was characterized by intermediate root thickness, but vertical root distribution and root:shoot ratio were more similar to group 6. The minor isozyme groups 3–5 were represented by few accessions, and in general, they had root thickness and root distribution profiles more similar to group 1 than to group 6. While significant differences were observed among isozyme groups for all the traits under study, there was significant variation within groups and groups overlapped for all traits measured. This study highlights the wide range of variability for constitutive root traits in rice. For example, root thickness ranged from 0.68 to 1.04 mm, seminal root xylem vessel diameters from 30 to 58 μm, root:shoot ratios from 0.05 to 0.21, and accessions had from 44 to 73% of the total root weight concentrated in the surface 15 cm of soil. For the 28 cultivars evaluated, root xylem vessel diameter was highly correlated with reported values of leaf epicuticular wax content (r=0.89). These values indicate the range of genetic variation within the rice genome for root morphological traits. "

This assumption has rarely been tested, and there are no reports on H for yield under drought stress from experiments repeated over seasons in rainfed lowland rice. To assess the potential for improving yield under drought stress via direct selection, and to identify associated quantitative trait loci (QTL), doubled haploid lines with a narrow range of flowering dates, derived from the population CT9993-5-10-1-M/IR62266-42-6-2, were screened under full irrigation and severe drought stress induced by draining the paddy before flowering in 2000–2002 at Raipur, India. Drought stress reduced mean yield by 80%. H was similar in stress and non-stress trials, as was the relative magnitude of the genotype and genotype × year variances. The genetic correlation between yield in stress and non-stress conditions was 0.8, indicating that about 64% of the genetic variation for yield under stress was accounted for by differences in yield potential also expressed in irrigated environments. These results indicate that direct selection for yield under drought stress can produce yield gains under stress without reducing yield potential. There was no secondary trait for which selection resulted in greater predicted response in yield under stress than direct selection for stress yield per se. A \{QTL\} was detected on chromosome 1 near sd1 that explained 32% of the genetic variation for yield under stress, but only 4% under non-stress. Its effect was consistent across years. This \{QTL\} accounted for much of the variation in drought yield not accounted for by variation in yield potential. "

abstract = "Rice single-leaf photosynthesis was studied intensively in the 1960s and ’70s. However, these studies did not contribute significantly to rice crop improvement because of poor correlation between single-leaf photosynthetic rate and grain yield. Canopy photosynthesis has received more attention since then. There is little doubt that canopy net photosynthesis rate correlates with biomass production. Yield enhancement by conventional breeding has mainly resulted from improvement in plant type, which has increased canopy net photosynthesis, especially during the grain-filling period. It is argued that further improvement in canopy net photosynthesis by fine-tuning plant type is difficult because most high-yielding cultivars are close to the optimum canopy architecture. This suggests that increasing single-leaf photosynthesis could be the only way to substantially enhance rice yield potential. With a better understanding of limiting processes in photosynthesis, advances in measurement methodology, and the advent of biotechnology, which enables the modification of content or activity of individual enzymes, the possibility of enhancing biomass production by improving single-leaf photosynthesis should be reexamined. In this chapter, I review the characteristics of rice photosynthesis at the single-leaf and canopy levels by summarizing the external and internal factors that control single-leaf and canopy photosynthetic rates. I also discuss the scenario of increasing rice yield potential by improving single-leaf photosynthesis. "

Ten-day-old seedlings of \{IR45\} and \{IR74\} (UVB sensitive), and \{IR64\} and \{IR30\} (UVB less sensitive), were subjected to \{UVB\} radiation in a glasshouse for 6 h d-1 for 4 weeks. The unweighted \{UVB\} radiation was 1·94 W m-2 for \{UVB\} treatment and 0·15 W m-2 for control. Leaf area and plant dry mass were determined every 2 weeks while stomatal density and opening were recorded weekly. Results showed that a 2-week \{UVB\} treatment had no effect on the leaf area or plant dry mass of any test cultivar, but significantly reduced stomatal density and opening in \{IR45\} and IR74. Under 4-week \{UVB\} exposure, leaf area and plant dry mass of \{IR45\} and \{IR74\} were significantly reduced. Stomatal density decreased in all cultivars, except in IR64. Greater reduction of stomata on the adaxial surface than on the abaxial surface under 3 and 4 weeks of \{UVB\} exposure suggests a direct effect of \{UVB\} radiation on stomata. \{IR45\} and \{IR74\} showed significant reductions in stomatal opening after 2 weeks of exposure to UVB, while stomatal opening in \{IR30\} and \{IR64\} decreased significantly after only 4 weeks of \{UVB\} treatment. Difference in plant dry mass between \{UVB\} treated and control plants was significantly correlated with the reductions in stomatal opening and density on adaxial surface under \{UVB\} treatment. Thus, reduction in dry mass of rice plants under \{UVB\} in the glasshouse could be attributed to decrease in stomatal density and opening. "

Wilczek), is an important means to save foreign exchange on food imports and to exploit the residual soil water following paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.) harvest. Since the soil physical requirements for establishment and growth of upland crops are different from those for paddy rice, this study examined (1) soil physical properties that may limit mungbean emergence in rice soils, and (2) soil management techniques that will alleviate the soil physical constraints to mungbean establishment. Dry soil conditions and high soil resistance were the major soil physical constraints limiting mungbean seedling emergence in clay soils in a growth chamber experiment. Since seedzone water content is high after rice harvest, soil strength was viewed as the major constraint to mungbean emergence in paddy rice soils. This hypothesis was tested in a field experiment where tillage practices (moldboard plow, no-till), planting techniques (inverted-T, dibble, furrow), and delays to planting after rice harvest (1–3, 4–5, 7–8, 11–12, or 14–15 days after field drainage) were used to create varying soil strength conditions. The soil was Maahas silty clay (Vertic Tropaquept). Mungbean emergence and soil strength data showed that the maximum emergence corresponded to soil conditions where soil resistance to seedling emergence was lowest. There were few benefits from tillage on mungbean emergence. Inverted-T and furrow planting performed best in tilled and no-till plots, respectively. The optimum time for mungbean planting was from 1 to 8 days after field drainage for no-till, and from 3 to 5 days after field drainage for tilled soils. "

This paper seeks an improved understanding of these patterns of nutrient response, then considers likely approaches for increasing and stabilising yields of rainfed lowland rice in south and southeast Asia. At each of 78 locations across India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines during 1995–1997, three replicates of each of six treatments were established: (no fertiliser control (NIL), farmyard manure (FYM), phosphorus and potassium only (PK), application of nitrogen as well as P and K (NPK), a controlled-release formulation of N together with P and K (CR-NPK), and an all-nutrient dressing (ALL)). Combined analysis of variance and cluster analysis were used to examine the patterns of nutrient response. Yields obtained without applied fertiliser were not closely related to soil test values. The greatest nutrient response was to nitrogen, with \{NPK\} increasing yields from 2.25 to 4.00 t/ha on average. The effect of adding micronutrients was small, and \{PK\} was of little benefit unless N was added. But the magnitude of the N response varied substantially with water regime. We conclude that substantial yield gains are possible in rainfed systems with application of appropriate nutrients, especially if used in conjunction with cultivars suitably adapted to the target environments.

G × E interaction accounted for 32% of the total sum of squares, with environment and genotype responsible for 63% and 5%, respectively. More than 47% of the G × E sum of squares was captured by a nine genotype group by nine environment group summary. Sites with similar characteristics were tightly grouped, as were related genotypes. Environment groups included some with favourable water supply, and others with early drought, late drought, rapid-onset late drought, and submergence. Groupings of genotypes could be explained by their performance in relation to these conditions. PSBRc14, \{IR36\} and \{IR64\} had high yield potential and performed well over most environments, while CT9897-55-2-M-3-M and the \{F1\} hybrids \{IR64615H\} and \{IR68877H\} also had high yield potential but only performed well with adequate water supply and where standing water remained shallow.

To identify the genetic basis of these traits, we used 167 \{F2\} plants derived from a cross between \{IR64\} and \{YTH288\} to conduct \{QTL\} analysis for five agronomic traits: days to heading (DTH), culm length (CL), flag leaf length (FLL), flag leaf width (FLW), and filled spikelet number per panicle (FSN). Six putative \{QTL\} were detected: four on chromosome 4 (for CL, FLL, FLW, and FSN) and two on chromosome 2 (for \{DTH\} and FLL). All \{QTL\} with the IR66215-44-2-3 allele, except that for \{FLL\} on chromosome 2, had positive effects on each trait. To confirm the effects of these putative QTL, we developed \{NILs\} with the \{IR64\} genetic background by marker-assisted selection. We observed significant differences in several agronomic traits between \{IR64\} and \{NILs\} that carried these \{QTL\} on chromosomes 2 and 4. Additionally, four IR64-NILs carrying chromosomal segments derived from different \{NPT\} varieties on the long arm of chromosome 4 exhibited similar pleiotropic effects for unique agronomic traits. These \{NILs\} can be used as research materials for studying each trait and as breeding materials for yield improvement of indica rice cultivars. "

Relationships between shear strength, secant modulus and shear velocity were established to determine the velocity independent strength parameters. The values of these parameters and cone index decreased with increasing levels of puddling, but increased with time after puddling due to the thixotropic hardening of the soil.

High \{R2\} values and significant regression coefficients alone, however, are insufficient to validate a disease-loss model; additional important criteria are the absence of heteroscedasticity and presence of a functional relationship between disease and loss. These criteria were obtained by determining the separate contribution of leaves to total grain weight of single tillers. The flag, penultimate and antepenultimate leaf positions, respectively, were found to contribute 26, 12 and 3% to potential grain yield per tiller. An effective severity [leaf contribution × severity (SEV-c)] was obtained which had a one-to-one relationship with yield loss in grain weight. The effective severity could be used, therefore, to predict yield loss in total grain weight; it was possible to predict yield loss by knowing the disease severity on the three upper wheat leaves and each leaf's potential contribution to grain yield. A good correlation was also found between yield loss and the effective severity adjusted for leaf area (SEV-c+ A), suggesting that SEV-c+A, can be used in the place of SEV-c, especially when leaf area varies.

We also describe a simplified procedure for the easier preparation of \{PCR\} templates with very small quantities of \{DNA\} and a fast and direct characterization of the suppression-PCR products.

Considering that increasing biomass accumulation is the main target for higher yield potential in sub-tropical and temperate conditions, it is relevant to investigate in a wide range of growing conditions in the tropics if improved biomass partitioning plays a significant and consistent role in higher yield of hybrids. The growth pattern of two high-yielding and popular hybrid (H1) and inbred (I1) of the same maturity group was compared under six contrasted growing conditions to evaluate traits related to sink regulation. Grain yield of \{H1\} was consistently higher than that of \{I1\} by 16–32% with respect to the situation. Higher partitioning coefficients of the hybrid to key organs were confirmed over the whole crop growth for this set of environments whereas crop growth rates of hybrid were not consistently higher than that of inbreds. Sink strength index, as a way to express sink regulation at maturity more efficiently than harvest index, was higher with hybrids in five out of six environments. In search for promising traits related to sink regulation, higher specific leaf area of hybrids at very early stage was associated with higher leaf area, and earlier cessation of tiller production with hybrids coincided with higher partitioning of biomass to early culm growth: yet, maximum tiller number ranged from 548 to 962 tiller m−2 with \{H1\} and from 629 to 1427 tiller m−2 with \{I1\} while culm dry weight at 55 days after sowing ranged from 65 to 81 g m−2 with \{H1\} and from 46 to 53 g m−2 with I1.

These were screened (together with Moroberekan, \{SG329\} and \{IR36\} for comparative purposes) using a flooded wax-layer screen. Of the eight cvs, \{IR58821\} gave the best penetration of a 60% wax layer, with a mean penetration of 5.8 root axes per plant. The worst performer was IR52561, with a mean of 0.6 axes per plant. The cvs IR20, CT9993, \{KDML\} 105, \{IR58821\} were also screened (together with Azucena, Bala, Moroberekan, Kinandang Patong and \{IR36\} for comparative purposes) using a (non-flooded) sand-core screen. The sand-core screen allowed mechanical impedance of the whole sand core to be varied independently of aeration and water status. High impedance treatments were obtained by placing weights on the sand cores, which greatly decreased root growth, although differences between cvs in response to impedance in the sand-core screen were small. The ability of rice roots to penetrate wax layers did not appear to be related to their elongation through strong sand, but rather to their ability to resist buckling on encountering the wax layer. Comparison with field measurements showed that cvs with good performance in the wax-layer screen did not necessarily have good hardpan penetration in the field, although \{IR58821\} was the best performer in the field. It is concluded that further work is required to compare root penetration in the field with root penetration in laboratory screens. "

Some core PcG proteins, such as Enhancer of Zeste (E(z)), Suppressor of Zeste (12) (Su(z)12), and Extra Sex Combs (ESC), are conserved in plants. The rice genome contains two E(z)-like genes, OsiEZ1 and OsCLF, two homologs of Su(z)12, OsEMF2a and OsEMF2b, and two ESC-like genes, OsFIE1 and OsFIE2. OsFIE1 is expressed only in endosperm; the maternal copy is expressed while the paternal copy is not active. Other rice PcG genes are expressed in a wide range of tissues and are not imprinted in the endosperm. The two E(z)-like genes appear to have duplicated before the separation of the dicots and monocots; the two homologs of Su(z)12 possibly duplicated during the evolution of the Gramineae and the two ESC-like genes are likely to have duplicated in the ancestor of the grasses.

For the example of German marine waters, the overall-indicator shows that only 3 of 19 stocks (Baltic Sea dab, North Sea plaice and North Sea sprat) were above the limit reference point for the overall indicator in 2011. North Sea herring was close to reaching the threshold, but most other stocks were still far below. Apparently fishing mortality was too high to allow recovery of more stocks to levels capable of producing the maximum sustainable yield. The chosen indicators and reference points may prove useful to other scientists tasked with assessing the environmental status of their national waters. "

abstract = "The Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture (CA) seeks answers to the question of how freshwater resources can be developed and managed to feed the world's population and reduce poverty, while at the same time promoting environmental security. The \{CA\} pays particular attention to rice as this crop is the most common staple food of the largest number of people on Earth (about 3 billion people) while receiving an estimated 24–30% of the world's developed freshwater resources. Rice environments also provide unique—but as yet poorly understood—ecosystem services such as the regulation of water and the preservation of aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity. Rice production under flooded conditions is highly sustainable. In comparison with other field crops, flooded rice fields produce more of the greenhouse gas methane but less nitrous oxide, have no to very little nitrate pollution of the groundwater, and use relatively little to no herbicides. Flooded rice can locally raise groundwater tables with subsequent risk of salinization if the groundwater carries salts, but is also an effective restoration crop to leach accumulated salts from the soil in combination with drainage. The production of rice needs to increase in the coming decades to meet the food demand of growing populations. To meet the dual challenges of producing enough food and alleviating poverty, more rice needs to be produced at a low cost per kilogram grain (ensuring reasonable profits for producers) so that prices can be kept low for poor consumers. This increase in rice production needs to be accomplished under increasing scarcity of water, which threatens the sustainability and capability to provide ecosystem services of current production systems. Water scarcity is expected to shift rice production to more water‐abundant delta areas, and to lead to crop diversification and more aerobic (nonflooded) soil conditions in rice fields in water‐short areas. In these latter areas, investments should target the adoption of water‐saving technologies, the reuse of drainage and percolation water, and the improvement of irrigation supply systems. A suite of water‐saving technologies can help farmers reduce percolation, drainage, and evaporation losses from their fields by 15–20% without a yield decline. However, greater understanding of the adverse effects of increasingly aerobic field conditions on the sustainability of rice production, environment, and ecosystem services is needed. In drought‐, salinity‐, and flood‐prone environments, the combination of improved varieties with specific management packages has the potential to increase on‐farm yields by 50–100% in the coming 10 years, provided that investment in research and extension is intensified.

This approach advocates optimal use of indigenous nutrients originating from soil, plant residues, manures, and irrigation water. Fertilizers are then applied in a timely fashion to overcome the deficit in nutrients between the total demand by rice to achieve a yield target and the supply from indigenous sources. We estimated environmental impact of \{SSNM\} and evaluated economic benefits in farmers’ fields in southern India, the Philippines, and southern Vietnam for two cropping seasons in 2002–2003. On-farm research comparing \{SSNM\} and the farmers’ fertilizer practice showed increased yield with \{SSNM\} for the three locations, even with reduced fertilizer N rates in some cases. \{SSNM\} increased partial factor productivity (kg grain kg−1 fertilizer N) when fertilizer N use efficiency with the farmers’ fertilizer practice was relatively low such as at locations in Vietnam and the Philippines. Use of on-farm data with the \{DNDC\} model revealed lower percentage of total N losses from applied fertilizers with \{SSNM\} during an annual cycle of cropping and fallows. At the location in India, \{SSNM\} showed the potential of obtaining higher yields with increased fertilizer N use while maintaining low \{N2O\} emissions. \{SSNM\} in the Philippines and Vietnam showed greater yields with less fertilizer N through improved fertilizer use efficiency, which could reduce \{N2O\} emissions and global warming. Use of \{SSNM\} never resulted in increased emissions of \{N2O\} per unit of grain yield, and in environments where higher yield could be obtained with less fertilizer N, the use of \{SSNM\} could result in reduced \{N2O\} emissions per unit of grain yield. For the economic analysis, data were generated through focus group discussions (FGD) with farmers practicing \{SSNM\} and with other farmers not practicing SSNM. Based on FGD, the seasonal increase in yield of farmers solely due to use of \{SSNM\} averaged 0.2 Mg ha−1 in southern Vietnam, 0.3 Mg ha−1 in the Philippines, and 0.8 Mg ha−1 in southern India. Farmers practicing \{SSNM\} at the study site in India used less pesticide. The added net annual benefit due to use of \{SSNM\} was 34 US$ ha−1 year−1 in Vietnam, 106 US$ ha−1 year−1 in the Philippines, and 168 US$ ha−1 year−1 in India. The increased benefit with \{SSNM\} was attributed to increased yield rather than reduced costs of inputs. "

Monitoring long-term changes in crop yields and identifying the factors associated with such changes are essential to maintain and/or improve crop productivity. Long-term experiments (LTE) provide these opportunities. We analyzed 33 rice–wheat \{LTE\} in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of South Asia, non-IGP in India, and China to investigate the extent of yield stagnation or decline and identify possible causes of yield decline. In treatments where recommended rates of N, P and K were applied, yields of rice and wheat stagnated in 72 and 85% of the LTE, respectively, while 22 and 6% of the \{LTE\} showed a significant (P&lt;0.05) declining trend for rice and wheat yields, respectively. In the rice–wheat system, particularly in the IGP, rice yields are declining more rapidly than wheat. The causes of yield decline are mostly location-specific but depletion of soil K seems to be a general cause. In over 90% of the LTE, the fertilizer K rates used were not sufficient to sustain a neutral K input–output balance. Depletion of soil C, N and Zn and reduced availability of P, delays in planting, decreases in solar radiation and increases in minimum temperatures are the other potential causes of yield decline. A more efficient, integrated strategy with detailed data collection is required to identify the specific causes of yield decline. Constant monitoring of \{LTEs\} and analysis of the data using improved statistical and simulation tools should be done to unravel the cause–effect relationships of productivity and sustainability of rice–wheat systems.

The increasing scarcity of resources (water, labor and energy) and production costs further make the rice-based cropping system less sustainable and less profitable. We hypothesized that integrating the best compatible cropping patterns accompanied by best management practices into the portfolio of farmers’ own technologies would improve system productivity, resource use efficiency and economic profitability. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated four cropping system scenarios (S1–S4) designed to be adapted to current and future drivers of agricultural changes and varying from each other in best management practices (BMPs) and conservation agriculture (CA) principles (tillage and crop establishment, residue management, and crop rotation). Four cropping system scenarios were (i) current farmers’ practice (S1), (ii) \{BMPs\} with conventional tillage and farmers’ crop rotation (S2), (iii) \{BMPs\} with reduced tillage and farmers’ crop rotation (S3), and (iv) \{BMPs\} with reduce or zero tillage and crop diversification (S4). Scenario 2 alone compared with \{S1\} increased system productivity (24–33%), total water productivity (16–50%) and net economic returns (85–169%), and decreased specific energy (11–17%). The combination of \{BMPs\} in \{S2\} with reduced tillage and manual or mechanical transplanting (S3) did not further increase yield and save water. Crop diversification with potato in place of Boro rice and intensification with maize or mungbean in between Boro and Aman rice (S4) yielded 1.9–3.7 times higher net economic returns than S1. Results of a three-year study indicated that farmers’ productivity and economic returns can be improved by BMPs, which not only increase crop yields but also improve the efficiencies of resources such as water and energy.

Most research on N contributions from legumes in the tropics has been focused on short-duration legumes grown and subsequently incorporated solely as green manures immediately before the monsoon rice crop. Nitrification during nonflooded periods among rice crops and then subsequent denitrification when soil is flooded for rice may be an important avenue for N loss. The N contribution of legumes in lowland rice-legume sequences, as in upland crop-legume sequences, depend on the quantity of legume N derived from \{N2\} fixation, the NHI, the proportion of legume N mineralized, and the efficiency of use of this mineralized N by the succeeding crop.

Field research was conducted for 2 yr in the Philippines to determine whether the evolution of N gases formed by denitrification is influenced by a rice (Oryza sativa L.) establishment method. Quantification of denitrification was assessed by comparing the cumulative recovery of (N2 + N2O)-15N evolved from added 15N-labeled nitrate (5 kg N ha−1) with the total N loss by denitrification, which was estimated from the added NO3−-15N not recovered in the 15N balance at the conclusion of the 20 day gas collection period. In both years, rice was established by either transplanting (TPR) at 20 × 20 cm spacing between hills with three seedlings per hill (75 plants m−2) or wet broadcast seeding of germinated seed (BSR) with a plant population of 370 m−2 in 1989 and 250 m−2 in 1990. In 1990, wet seeding of germinated seed in 20-cm-wide rows (RSR) with 250 plants m−2 was also included. Nitrate addition and gas collection commenced at 11 days after transplanting (DT) 20 or 21-days-old seedlings and 21 days after wet sowing (DS). In 1989, the recovery of added N as evolved (N2 + N2O)-15N (54% for \{BSR\} and 47% for TPR) was comparable to total denitrification loss for \{BSR\} (53%) but not for \{TPR\} (61%). In 1990, the recovery of evolved (N2 + N2O)-15N (32% for TPR, 61% for \{BSR\} and 40% for RSR) underestimated denitrification loss (72% for \{TPR\} and 73% for \{BSR\} and RSR), but to a lesser extent for \{BSR\} than for \{TPR\} and RSR. The greater recovery of added N as evolved (N2 + N2O)-15N when chambers were placed over transplated rice rather than between plants (47 and 40%, respectively) suggested that rice was a conduit for transport of gas from soil. Underestimation of denitrification was attributed to entrapment of N-gases in soil. Results suggest that young BSR, because of high plant density and rapid extension of roots into the soil volume, was a more effective conduit for gas transport than \{TPR\} or RSR. "

Rice is the primary source of energy and protein for 4.5 billion people in the most populous nations of Asia. Rice produces more calories and carbohydrates per hectare than any other cereal under normal production practices. Crop researchers recognize that a wealth of genetic resources provides the building blocks for effective crop improvement. The rich diversity in rice stemmed largely from its wide geographic dispersal and ecogenetic diversification. Among major food crops, rice is one of the few staples that are continually expanding into new production areas. Rice can be grown in vast uncropped areas in Africa and Brazil. The rich diversity in rice presents great promises for rice researchers to alleviate various production constraints, most of which are known, while a few more remain to be identified. Reaction of rice cultivars and advanced lines to the principal field insects has been studied. The physicochemical properties and cooking characteristics of milled rice have been determined. The cooking characteristics of rice are correlated with the physicochemical characters of the grain. The physicochemical characteristics, such as amylose content, reactions in dilute iodine and dilute potassium hydroxide solutions, are commonly used to screen rice varieties for cooking quality. "

Two indica inbred and two indica/indica \{F1\} hybrid varieties were grown under 0 and 90 kg N ha−1 in 2003 wet season (WS) and under 0, 75, 145, and 215 kg N ha−1 in 2004 dry season (DS). Inoculation was done in 3.2 m2 in each experiment unit to achieve uniform disease development. Disease intensity was quantified by measuring relative lesion height (RLH) and ShB index (ShBI) of inoculated 10 hills at flowering and 14 days after flowering. Plant traits, grain yield, temperature, and relative humidity inside the canopy were also measured. Consistent and significant varietal differences in ShB intensity were observed across N rates in both \{WS\} and DS. Among the four varieties, \{IR72\} and \{IR75217H\} had higher \{RLH\} and ShBI than \{PSBRc52\} and \{IR68284H\} at all N rates. Sheath blight index at 14 days after flowering had the closest correlation with yield loss from ShB. Varieties with taller stature, fewer tillers, and lower leaf N concentration such as \{IR68284H\} generally had lower \{RLH\} and ShBI, and consequently lower yield loss from the disease. Disease intensity and yield loss from ShB increased with increasing N rates, but the magnitude of yield loss varied among varieties. This suggests that fertilizer N should be managed more precisely and differently for varieties with different plant type in order to reduce the disease development and maximize grain yield in the irrigated rice systems.

Correspondence analysis and discriminant analyses further indicated that crop health syndromes, and their change, are strongly associated with production situations, and patterns of germplasm deployment. A few specific hypotheses were tested, indicating that false smut is statistically associated with the involvement of hybrid rice in patterns of germplasm deployment. This highlights the need for research on the biology and the epidemiology of this disease in order to develop suitable management tools. Importantly, this work shows that national surveys, such as the Production-Oriented Surveys conducted by the Directorate of Rice Research, generate extremely valuable information to guide research and development through the characterization of production environments, contexts, and crop health responses, in times of unprecedented agricultural change. This work concurs with earlier results obtained at the field level, and thus opens important methodological questions regarding the up- and down-scaling of information between different scales (e.g., field, district). We propose that our ability to predict emerging diseases and crop health syndromes in the face of global and climate change will necessarily entail our ability to link different scales, where a range of different processes, biological and socio-economic, take place.

abstract = "Publisher Summary A realistic approach to crop protection should consider the various pests, including diseases that affect a crop. Epidemiologists are frequently confronted with large data sets representing information on the characterization, the dynamics, or the behavior of a pathosystem. A holistic description of a pathosystem should ideally involve characteristics as different as disease intensity over time and space, crop management, soil type and weather data, and socioeconomic information. Plant pathologists have been concerned primarily with quantifying epidemiological characteristics of pathosystems. Building contingency tables is an easy way to explore the relations between paired qualitative or coded quantitative variables of a data set represented by their successive classes. Correspondence analysis is a multivariate statistical method to represent contingency tables in pictorial and tabular form. Tungro is a major virus disease of rice in south and south-east Asia. Correspondence analysis shares common features with principal component analysis on the computational aspects. Categorization of quantitative information representing components of a pathosystem is one means to take into account the level of precision of the data. One strong advantage of dealing with categorized quantitative data is the rapid detection of complex, non-linear relations among several variables. In the process of devising the boundaries and the categories, it is possible to introduce key or threshold values, the relevance of which might be revealed in the analyses. "

The taxonomy of N2-fixing bacteria is undergoing substantial revisions due to the advent of molecular methods for phylogenetic analysis, and in certain cases this has proved useful in unravelling ecological relationships among confusing groups. Molecular methods are also proving useful in studies of biodiversity within populations of rhizobial species. Rhizobia are surprisingly competent free-living bacteria, although few fix nitrogen in the free-living state, and the major factors that determine their population sizes in the absence of legume hosts are environmental stresses (such as soil acidity factors), protozoal grazing and some factors associated with agricultural intensification such as increases in salinity or heavy metal pollution of the soil. Rhizobial populations generally increase in response to the presence of the host legume. Due to the high degree of host-specificity between legume hosts and rhizobial species, loss of a single rhizobial species can result in loss of N2-fixation by that legume, although many legumes can be nodulated by several species of rhizobia. However, as only a single, compatible rhizobial genotype or strain is necessary for establishment of effective N, -fixation (i.e. the basis of the rhizobial inoculant industry), it is questionable whether biodiversity within species is necessary to ensure function, although this may confer resilience in the face of further environmental stresses.

This study was conducted in Vietnam with the aim of evaluating the feasibility of farmers’ implementing \{DMC\} in a mountainous area. The method involved simulation of rational households maximizing their income subject to food security constraints and availability of resources. It generated insight into why farmers of a small region were reluctant to adopt \{DMC\} due to the extra labor and input required to implement these techniques during the first years, which hampers their economic performance. In another region, under different biophysical and economic environmental conditions, the study showed that \{DMC\} were more likely to be adopted provided that possible constraints at the community level are overcome. The method also allowed us to discuss the types of technical improvements that would make \{DMC\} more attractive to farmers. For most farm types, labor required by mulch establishment would have to be reduced by more than 30%. This would mean spreading much less biomass than the 7 t ha−1 currently necessary, compromising the weed-control function of mulch. This would be technically feasible only by using herbicides but this would not be economically sound since it would increase cash requirements. The study showed that subsidies of 50 to more than 200 \{USD\} ha−1 were necessary to enable the conversion of all conventionally managed sloping land into \{DMC\} in the simulations. These amounts are high relatively to gross margins (250–750 \{USD\} ha−1) under conventional management. "

Multiple linear and non-linear regression models were developed to predict topsoil salinity of the fallow land for both moderately saline and saline soils by using daily rainfall and evaporation as independent variables.

Nilaparvata lugens outbreaks and hopperburned plants were observed only in plots of the insecticide-treated susceptible varieties. In insecticide-free plots, the yield of the susceptible variety was lower than those of resistant varieties in only one of four seasons. In plots of a moderately resistant and a highly resistant variety, populations of N. lugens, S. furcifera, Nephotettix spp., and predators were generally similar, and yields did not differ, under both insecticide-treated and insecticide-free conditions. In insecticide-free plots, predator-N. lugens ratios were generally higher on resistant varieties than susceptible varieties. Two conclusions can'be drawn from our results relevant to the question of what levels of N. lugens host plant resistance are appropriate for farmers who do not overuse insecticides. First, susceptible varieties will not necessarily be damaged by N. lugens, even when N. lugens outbreaks occur in adjacent plots. Second, moderate and high levels of N. lugens resistance do not appear to be incompatible with biological control of N. lugens or other homopteran pests. "

Pests were most commonly listed as one of the three most important rice and coconut production constraints. Other major crop production constraints were typhoons and insufficient water. Farmers consider rats to be the major pest of coconut and of rice during the wet season rice crop, with average yield losses of 3.0% and 13.2%, respectively. Rice and coconut farmers practised a wide range of rodent management techniques. These included scrub clearance, hunting and trapping. Of the 42 rice farmers and 3 coconut farmers that applied rodenticides to control rodents, all used the acute rodenticide, zinc phosphide. However, only ten rice farmers (23.8%) applied rodenticides prior to the booting stage and only seven farmers (15.6%) conducted pre-baiting before applying zinc phosphide. The majority of farmers belonged to farmer organisations and believed that rat control can only be done by farmers working together. However, during the last cropping season, less than a third of rice farmers (31.2%) applied rodent management as a group. In order to reduce the impact of rodents on the farmers of the coastal lowlands of the Sierra Madre Biodiversity Corridor, integrated management strategies need to be developed that specifically target the pest rodents in a sustainable manner, and community actions for rodent management should be promoted.

However the average realizable yield in \{DZ\} and \{WZ\} are 8 t ha−1 and 5 t ha−1 respectively.

Farmers’ seed rate ranged from 87 to 220 kg ha−1 for intermediate bold-type varieties and from 71 to 176 kg ha−1 for varieties with short round grains. About 90% of the farmers in the \{DZ\} and the intermediate zone (IZ) consider both yield potential and duration as criteria in selecting a variety. Among the farmers surveyed, only 21% of the farmers in the DZ, 13% of the farmers in the IZ, and 29% of the farmers in the \{WZ\} adhered to the recommended method of basal fertilizer application. Farmers did not adhere to the correct timing of fertilizer application. More than 50% of the cost for rice farming goes to labor, followed by cost of inputs in all climatic zones. Farmers reported that the most important production constraint for direct-seeded rice in the \{DZ\} and \{IZ\} is the non availability of reliable labor followed by soil problems and weeds. While in the WZ, it is the soil problems specially iron toxicity followed by lower soil fertility. The survey revealed that smaller land holding size, non adherence to the optimum time of farm activity initiation, less efficient use of rain water, higher seed rate and higher cost of production are a few reasons for the existing yield gap. Location-specific technologies for different agro-ecological zones of Sri Lanka should be developed to reduce the cost of production and to increase resource-use efficiency and should be transferred to the farmers to achieve sustainable optimum direct-seeded rice yields.

Two populations were phenotyped for yield and yield-component traits under reproductive-stage drought-stress and non-stress conditions in the 2011 and 2012 dry seasons (DS) at IRRI. Bulk-segregant analysis, followed by whole genotyping with selected markers, was used to identify significant markers putatively linked with high grain yield under drought. Six polymorphic markers RM246, RM450, RM250, RM232, RM518, and \{RM19\} were found significant in bulk segregant analysis (BSA) of the Kali Aus/IR64 mapping population. Eight polymorphic markers RM495, RM572, RM246, RM211, RM250, RM231, RM3, and \{RM340\} were found significant in the Kali Aus/MTU1010 mapping population. Analysis revealed major-effect grain yield \{QTLs\} qDTY2.3 and qDTY2.2 under drought stress consistently over two seasons in the Kali Aus/IR64 and Kali Aus/MTU1010 populations, respectively. qDTY2.3 explained 9% of phenotypic variance, with an additive effect of 451 kg ha−1 whereas qDTY2.2 explained 6% of phenotypic variance, with an additive effect of 121 kg ha−1. The \{QTLs\} showed consistent effect over two years of combined stress conditions. The two consistent-effect \{QTLs\} qDTY2.2 and qDTY2.3 can be used to improve the grain yield of mega varieties \{IR64\} and MTU1010, respectively, across varying severity of drought stress through marker-aided backcrossing and thus provide farmers with improved varieties that effectively combines high yield potential with good yield under drought.

The Bph18 gene was introduced by marker-assisted backcross (MAB) breeding into Junambyeo. The backcrossed progenies were evaluated for desirable agronomic and grain quality traits and the selection of improved breeding lines while simultaneously evaluating \{BPH\} resistance by bioassays in the greenhouse and foreground selection. Of the 26 advanced backcross breeding lines (ABL), four lines showed agronomic traits similar to those of the recurrent parent, with strong resistance to BPH. Molecular genotyping of the four \{ABL\} revealed the conversion of genotypes closely resembling the genotype of Junambyeo. The percentage of donor chromosome segments in \{ABL\} decreased from 12.3% in the \{BC2\} to 9.4%, 8.4% and 5.3% in BC3, \{BC4\} and \{BC5\} generations, respectively. \{ABL\} retained small sizes of the donor chromosome segments on chromosomes 1, 2, 10, 11 and 12 but the genomes of ABL2, \{ABL3\} and \{ABL4\} were homosequential to the recurrent parent on chromosomes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 without donor chromosome segment introgression.

N timing and management were also evaluated under irrigated conditions at one location in the dry season in 2005. Yields were 3.1–4.9 t ha−1 with 60–150 kg ha−1 of applied N. Yields increased with N rate, up to rates of 60–150 kg ha−1 depending on site and season, but at rates beyond 90 kg ha−1 the risk of lodging increased, especially in the wet season. Yields were similar for different splits of N over time, and the regional practice for lowland rice of three to four splits can also be used for aerobic rice. Yields were similar for row spacings ranging from 25 to 35 cm. Although the number of panicles per square meter was significantly higher at 25-cm spacing than at 35-cm spacing, this difference was compensated for by significantly more spikelets per panicle at 35-cm spacing, while spikelet fertility and grain weight were similar for all row spacings. Lodging and bending resistance of stems were not affected by row spacing. The results suggest that a row spacing of 35 cm can be used to enable easier weeding between the rows, and allows for mechanized field operations in which tire tracks do not damage the crops. "

The analysis revealed that the greater competitive ability of Mahsuri was due mainly to a greater relative leaf area growth rate early in the season and larger maximum plant height. Comparison of experimental results and model outcomes indicated, however, that the present model is not entirely able to quantify the trade-off between competitive and yielding ability. The extent to which traits advantageous for competition may lead to increased lodging or a larger number of unproductive tillers is not quantified by the present model. This implies that use of \{INTERCOM\} for design of more competitive rice cultivars will require continuous interaction between modelling and experimentation. With those limitations in mind, the model was used to quantify the potential contribution of various attributes to competitive ability. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that competition for light is mainly determined by morphological characteristics of which early relative leaf area growth rate, early relative height growth rate and maximum plant height were found to be the most important. The ability of the model to identify key traits with respect to competitive ability makes it a useful tool for designing rice ideotypes. "

Rainfall is an important determinant of the yield of rainfed lowland rice, but other factors such as topography and soil fertility also affect grain yield and choice of cultivars. The growing environment and also rice yield vary greatly within small areas as well as across seasons. This causes great difficulty in determining the target population of environments for a rice breeding program. This paper reviews past work on characterising the variability in the physical environment, and rice production in the rainfed lowland ecosystem. It examines possible connections between this variability and slow progress in developing new cultivars that are widely adapted to the rainfed lowland rice ecosystem. "

In the present study, a fast (11 min) and simple method of preparing \{DNA\} suitable for amplifying avirulence genes of M. oryzae by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed. A piece of filter paper containing the fungus was removed from a glass bottle and placed in a 0.2 mL Eppendorf tube containing 100 μL 10 × TE. The suspension was heated for 10 min at 95 °C in a \{PCR\} machine. The tube was then centrifuged for 1 min at 3000 r min− 1. One μL of 10 × \{TE\} solution containing \{DNA\} was used for PCR. A total of 28 samples were \{PCR\} tested. As a positive control, fungal \{DNA\} was extracted using a conventional \{DNA\} preparation method. \{DNA\} samples obtained from both methods were stored at 4 °C. \{PCR\} was performed with \{DNA\} on the preparation day and after 4, 8, 10, and 18 days of refrigerated storage. In four samples, samples 12, 13, 14, and 28, AVR-Pi9 failed to be amplified. These four samples were tested with a different set of primers for AVR-Pi9, and for AVR-Pita1, confirming that the quality of the samples was insufficient for PCR. Overall, for nearly 90% (24/28) of the samples, the quality of the \{DNA\} prepared directly from the fungus on filter paper appeared suitable for a rapid survey of genetic identity of the rice blast fungus by PCR. This method will be useful and effective for reducing cost and time and could readily be adopted worldwide for analysis of M. oryzae and possibly other fungi. "

Online deliberation was operationalized as an individual metric based on the number of questions asked in relation to the information, the number of comments left, the number of glossary terms accessed, and the time spent on deliberative activity. This operationalization provided a coherent measure of deliberation which was positively correlated with information recall about the risks and benefits of red meat. Participants who perceived the information about red meat risks and benefits as too complex engaged less with the information. The study herewith presents a novel method of investigating consumers’ deliberation about food issues that conceptualizes consumer engagement as more than just information seeking. "

Both personal and societal risks were framed in terms of uncertainties about safety and health, and possible adverse societal consequences dealing with loss of farming and eating traditions and rural livelihoods. Further reflection pertained to skepticism about ‘the inevitable’ scientific progress, concern about risk governance and control, and need for regulation and proper labeling. "

Leersia hexandra Sw. vegetation in wet, fallow rice fields harbored significantly higher densities of Recilia dorsalis (Motschulsky). Nephotettix virescens (Distant) was relatively abundant in second-stage rice nurseries. Nephotettix nigropictus (Stål) and N. malayanus Ishihara et Kawase were only moderately abundant or absent in the habitats sampled. Nephotettix parvus Ishihara et Kawase, a reported vector, was not caught. Spiders, in particular hunting spiders and orbweb weavers, numerically comprised the major natural enemy guilds in all habitats except in direct-seeded rice and single-stage nurseries, where predatory insects were more abundant. Egg parasitoids were the only parasitoid guild in all habitats except in L. hexandra vegetation where low numbers of nymphal-adult parasitoids were recovered as well. Oryza sativa, Fimbristylis miliacea (L.) Vahl and L. hexandra were the most commonly encountered tungro hosts. All habitats with rice potentially perpetuate tungro, particularly ratoon and volunteer rice which carry tungro and vectors to the next season crop and nurseries which are more susceptible to vectors and tungro infection. Fimbristylis miliacea may act as a tungro reservoir when rice is absent but cannot support vectors. Leersia hexandra harbors high densities of vectors but its role as a tungro host is more limited. Elimination of fallows with rice or tungro hosts is recommended as a preventive practice. However, weedy habitats without tungro hosts are beneficial as they harbor a variety of natural enemies of tungro vectors. Such vegetation should be tolerated where possible. Resistant varieties or selective insecticides should be used to prevent tungro infection in the nursery stage without destroying the diverse natural enemy complex. "

The experiment consisted of seven rice cultivars and four replications where the line source sprinkler provided the plots with a water supply that diminished linearly with distance from the line. Up to the time of panicle emergence two tall upland cultivars produced more dry matter than lowland cultivars, particularly at lower rates of water application. Soil water measurements for one upland and two lowland cultivars, however, showed that this was due to increased water extraction from the soil profile, and that dry matter production until panicle emergence was a function of water used. There were no differences between these three cultivars in water use efficiency. Heavy rains at and after panicle emergence replenished the soil water. The lowland rice IRI529-430-3 was the most efficient in grain production, with the highest harvest index. The two tall upland cultivars Kinandang Patong and \{IAC\} 47 were shown to have deeper root systems, but their relative grain yield at low compared to high water supply was poorer than for IRI529-430-3. Other experiments have shown that this lowland rice has a stable yield across a range of upland environments, and the implications of this are discussed with reference to techniques of selecting for drought resistance. It is emphasised that vegetative assessments used in drought screening must be interpreted in relation to grain yield. "

Since we had only one \{EC\} system for monitoring two rice environments, we had to move the system from one location to the other every week. In total, we had to gap-fill an average of 50–60% of the missing weekly data as well as those values rejected by the quality control tests in each rice field in all four cropping seasons. Although the \{EC\} method provides a direct measurement of LE, which is the energy used for ET, we needed to correct the values of H and \{LE\} to close the energy balance using the Bowen ratio closure method before we used \{LE\} to estimate ET. On average, the energy balance closure before correction was 0.72 ± 0.06 and it increased to 0.99 ± 0.01 after correction. The G in both flooded and aerobic fields was very low. Likewise, the energy involved in miscellaneous processes such as photosynthesis, respiration and heat storage in the rice canopy was not taken into consideration. Average for four cropping seasons, flooded rice fields had 19% more \{LE\} than aerobic fields whereas aerobic rice fields had 45% more H than flooded fields. This resulted in a lower Bowen ratio in flooded fields (0.14 ± 0.03) than in aerobic fields (0.24 ± 0.01). For our study sites, evapotranspiration was primarily controlled by net radiation. The aerobic rice fields had lower growing season \{ET\} rates (3.81 ± 0.21 mm d−1) than the flooded rice fields (4.29 ± 0.23 mm d−1), most probably due to the absence of ponded water and lower leaf area index of aerobic rice. Likewise, the crop coefficient, Kc, of aerobic rice was significantly lower than that of flooded rice. For aerobic rice, Kc values were 0.95 ± 0.01 for the vegetative stage, 1.00 ± 0.01 for the reproductive stage, 0.97 ± 0.04 for the ripening stage and 0.88 ± 0.03 for the fallow period, whereas, for flooded rice, Kc values were 1.04 ± 0.04 for the vegetative stage, 1.11 ± 0.05 for the reproductive stage, 1.04 ± 0.05 for the ripening stage and 0.93 ± 0.06 for the fallow period. The average annual \{ET\} was 1301 mm for aerobic rice and 1440 mm for flooded rice. This corresponds to about 11% lower total evapotranspiration in aerobic fields than in flooded fields. However, the crop water productivity (WPET) of aerobic rice (0.42 ± 0.03 g grain kg−1 water) was significantly lower than that of flooded rice (1.26 ± 0.26 g grain kg−1 water) because the grain yields of aerobic rice were very low since they were subjected to water stress. The results of this investigation showed significant differences in energy balance and evapotranspiration between flooded and aerobic rice ecosystems. Aerobic rice is one of the promising water-saving technologies being developed to lower the water requirements of the rice crop to address the issues of water scarcity. This information should be taken into consideration in evaluating alternative water-saving technologies for environmentally sustainable rice production systems. "

A field experiment was done in Punjab, India, in 2008 and 2009 to compare water balance components and water productivity of dry seeded rice (DSR) and puddled transplanted rice (PTR). There were four irrigation schedules based on soil water tension (SWT) ranging from saturation (daily irrigation) to alternate wetting drying (AWD) with irrigation thresholds of 20, 40 and 70 kPa at 18–20 cm soil depth. There were large and significant declines in irrigation water input with \{AWD\} compared to daily irrigation in both establishment methods. The irrigation water savings were mainly due to reduced deep drainage, seepage and runoff, and to reduced \{ET\} in DSR. Within each irrigation treatment, deep drainage was much higher in \{DSR\} than in PTR, and more so in the second year (i.e. after 2 years without puddling). The irrigation input to daily irrigated \{DSR\} was similar to or higher than to daily irrigated PTR. However, within each \{AWD\} treatment, the irrigation input to \{DSR\} was less than to PTR, due to reduced seepage and runoff, mainly because all \{PTR\} treatments were continuously flooded for 2 weeks after transplanting. There was 30–50% irrigation water saving in DSR-20 kPa compared with PTR-20 kPa due to reduced seepage and runoff, which more than compensated for the increased deep drainage in DSR. Yields of \{PTR\} and \{DSR\} with daily irrigation and a 20 kPa irrigation threshold were similar each year. Thus irrigation and input water productivities (WPI and WPI+R) were highest with the 20 kPa irrigation threshold, and \{WPI\} of DSR-20 kPa was 30–50% higher than of PTR-20 kPa. There was a consistent trend for declining \{ET\} with decreasing frequency of irrigation, but there was no effect of establishment method on \{ET\} apart from higher \{ET\} in \{DSR\} than \{PTR\} with daily irrigation. Water productivity with respect to \{ET\} (WPET) was highest with a 20 kPa irrigation threshold, with similar values for \{DSR\} and PTR. An irrigation threshold of 20 kPa was the optimum in terms of maximising grain yield, \{WPI\} and WPI+R for both \{PTR\} and DSR. Dry seeded rice with the 20 kPa threshold outperformed PTR-20 kPa in terms of \{WPI\} through maintaining yield while reducing irrigation input by 30–50%. "

Two rice crops were grown each year: the first direct seeded (DS) in moist soil that was later flooded by monsoon rain; the second transplanted (TP) into flooded soil towards the end of the wet season. A soybean crop followed the \{TP\} rice in the first year. In all the fertilizer and manure combinations studied, removal of K in the crop exceeded K additions and the soil K balance was negative unless crop residues were incorporated. For \{DS\} rice the relations between grain yield and K uptake fell within the limits of maximum K dilution and maximum K accumulation expected for well-managed irrigated rice. But those for \{TP\} rice tended to fall below the limit of maximum accumulation, yield being constrained by factors other than mineral nutrition, especially water deficit. In the \{DS\} rice, grain yields per unit K uptake were close to maximal in the treatments that received no K, but they were well below that in the K-fertilized treatments. Uptake was well correlated with exchangeable K in the soil at maximum tillering measured by ammonium acetate extraction. The mass balances of K inputs, K uptake and exchangeable K in the soil however, showed that a large part of the uptake was from non-exchangeable pools. The mobilization of non-exchangeable K was apparently plant-induced and was greater in treatments with greater growth. A mechanism for root-induced solubilization of non-exchangeable K, peculiar to rice growing in flooded soil, is proposed. "

abstract = "Extremely infertile sandy soils and erratic rainfall are major constraints to rainfed lowland rice yields in northeast Thailand. Response to inorganic fertilizers is low and variable. Farmers rely on farmyard manure and leaf litter from trees and shrubs to stimulate yield responses in rice. Field experiments on an Aeric Paleaquult soil were conducted in two successive wet seasons to develop production systems for Sesbania rostrata as a green manure (GM) crop prior to lowland rice. In the first experiment sesbania was grown at seeding rates of 15, 30 and 60 kg ha−1 with or without P application at 22 kg/ha. Sesbania was soil-incorporated at 46 or 61 days after seeding (DAS). Biomass production and accumulation and their effects on rice were determined in comparison with the effect of zero or 50 kg ha−1 of inorganic N. The second experiment evaluated the effect of 2, 14, and 21 day intervals between incorporation of 50 day old sesbania and rice transplanting. P application, and increased growth duration (61 vs 46 DAS), significantly improved sesbania total dry matter yield (TDMY) and nutrient accumulation. The effect of seeding rate on yield was positive only when P was applied, unless incorporation was delayed to 61 days. P application to sesbania and delayed sesbania incorporation significantly increased rice grain and \{TDM\} yields. \{GM\} seeding rates did not significantly affect rice yield or TDMY. \{GM\} effects compared favorably to inorganic N. Rice yield response to inorganic N application was significant, but not to unfertilized, incorporated weeds. In the second trial \{GM\} (2.26 t ha−1 dry weight) contributed 76 kg N ha−1 to the rice crop and significantly increased grain yield and TDMY. Differences in the interval between sesbania incorporation and rice transplantation did not affect crop performance. Products of \{GM\} decomposition tended to depress seedling vigour and survival in the 2 d interval treatment but grain yield was still 159% higher than the no-GM control after replanting the affected rice hills. The optimum incorporation-to-transplanting interval at the site is about 5–7 days to avoid adverse effects of decomposition. "

Soil was compacted with six (C6) or nine (C9) passes of a 12-ton road roller over the soil surface with (+V) or without (- V) roller vibration. After compaction, soil was tilled to 20 cm depth. All plots except \{DT\} were puddled manually to 15 cm depth. Rice seedlings (Cultivar KDML105) were transplanted in all plots. Degree and depth of compaction increased with number of passes and with vibration of the roller. Treatment \{C9\} + V compacted soil to at least 60 cm depth. Percolation decreased from 11.8 mm d−1 in \{DT\} and 6.3 mm d−1 in \{PUD\} plots to 1.4 mm d−1 in \{C9\} + V plots. Compaction increased total days with surface water accumulation from 44 days in \{DT\} and 68 days in \{PUD\} plots to 90 days in \{C9\} + V. Rice in plots with subsoil compaction had nearly twice the root length and root mass densities in the 0–20 cm soil layer and significantly increased shoot growth as compared with rice in \{DT\} and \{PUD\} plots. As compared with PUD, the standard tillage practice of farmers, treatment \{C9\} + V increased grain yield by 1.48 Mg ha−1 (59%) in 1992 and by 0.98 Mg ha−1 (88%) in 1993, with 1.6 times greater water use efficiency (WUE) in 1992 and 1.9 times greater \{WUE\} in 1993.

Rice as key staple food for a majority of the human population is of crucial importance for global and particularly Southeast Asian food supply. As food provision is one key ecosystem service (ES), it is important to know which \{ESs\} are provided at which places. Therefore, an \{ES\} scoring exercise harnessing local experts’ knowledge in a ‘rapid assessment’ was conducted in seven rice cropping regions in Vietnam and the Philippines. The expert-based scoring values were linked in an ‘ES-matrix’ to the different land use/land cover (LULC) classes abundant in the study areas. The \{LULC\} classifications were based on \{SPOT\} satellite image interpretation. The matrices were used to compile \{ES\} supply maps that give first indications about \{ES\} in regions with different intensive agriculture. The outcomes provide a first ‘screening’ of \{ES\} supply related to different \{LULC\} types in rice-dominated regions enabling the communication of the relevance of specific ecosystems for local communities and decision makers.

The need to increase yields is commonly achieved by agricultural intensification that often comes along with negative impacts on the environment. In 2011, the interdisciplinary \{LEGATO\} project was launched with the aim to advance sustainable rice production. A key feature for sustainable rice production is silicon (Si) availability. Si can e.g. improve rice crop resistance against pathogens and prevent the uptake of toxic metals. Herein, we introduce the characteristics of the seven \{LEGATO\} study regions in Vietnam and the Philippines (i.e., climate, geology, soils, agricultural practices) ranging from lowlands with intensive production to mountain regions with extensive and traditional production systems. Secondly, we show data on concentrations of plant-available Si (Sipa) in topsoils of paddy fields (Ap + Arp horizons) and of sites with an alternative land-use (forest, upland crops), and discuss factors determining spatial differences in Sipa concentrations. Results show that Sipa concentrations in topsoils of paddies (assessed by acetate extraction) greatly differ between Philippine (141–322 mg Si kg−1) and Vietnamese (20–51 mg Si kg−1) regions. This can be explained by differences in geo-/pedologic conditions between the countries. Large Sipa concentrations in the Philippines are due to recent rock formation by active volcanism, hence, by a large Sipa input due to mineral weathering in recent geologic history. Land-use can also affect Sipa in topsoils: in Philippine regions, Sipa concentrations were significantly larger for paddies than for other land-use types. In some of the Vietnamese paddies, Sipa concentrations are below critical values, thus might limit plant growth. Many Vietnamese farmers export Si from fields by removing straw residues with the harvest. Our subsequent research thus aims to test whether changes in harvest residue management can improve the Si supply to plants in Vietnamese regions. "

Systematic knowledge on the activity pattern of fish in rice fields is lacking to date, but is crucial for understanding their role in this ecosystem as well as their potential as biocontrol agents of rice pests. We therefore conducted a study to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of Oreochromis niloticus (mixed sex), O. niloticus (all male) and Cyprinus carpio at three times of day (07:00 h, 12:00 h and 17:00 h) during early, middle and late rice crop development in the dry and wet season. Nets were installed in the rice fields that served as barriers against fish movement during sampling. In addition, ponds were netted to allow sampling of all fish. Results show that regardless of fish group or sampling time, more than 50% of the fish can be found in the rice field. In the wet season, fish distribution within the rice field was uniform with 16–18% of the fish sampled in each of the four field compartments, whereas in the dry season significantly (P &lt; 0.01) more fish were caught in the first compartment adjacent to the pond. The results are discussed in view of the changing conditions in the rice field due to crop development.

Harvested plants were fractionated into their component parts and physically and chemically analysed in order to demonstrate varietal differences in their characteristics and determine the environmental effects on these, as well as to attempt to identify predictors of straw quality. There were statistically significant differences (P &lt; 0.01) within the semi-dwarf and tall varieties in nutritive value, as measured by in vitro digestibility, but these differences were not consistent between the wet and dry seasons. Although a statistical comparison between the semi-dwarf and tall varietal groups was not possible, it was clear that there was no overall difference between them as the range of variety means was completely overlapping. This implies that breeding for increased grain yield, through the use of semi-dwarf varieties, does not necessarily increase or decrease straw quality. The effect on nutritional quality of added nitrogen to the soil varied with variety. In vitro dry matter cellulase solubility (IVDMS) and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) using rumen liquor were significantly correlated (r = 0.64** for wet season and 0.72** for dry season), although they did not rank the varieties in the same order of digestibility. Also, this order of ranking was inconsistent for the two seasons. \{IVDMS\} results demonstrated a difference between seasons which was not obvious in the \{IVDMD\} results. Although there were significant individual varietal effects (P &lt; 0.01) in both the crude protein and ash contents of the straw from the semi-dwarf and tall varieties, there appeared to be no consistent overall relationships between the two groups. No single plant characteristic was shown to be consistently reliable in predicting straw quality. However, multiple regression, using ash (silica) content of the harvested straw and days to maturity of the plant, produced the most promising coefficient of determination for all varieties (except for one traditional variety, Gam Pai) over two seasons (R2= 0.74** for wet season and 0.81** for dry season). This suggests that other physical or chemical characteristics, not measured in this trial, must also affect straw digestibility. The results from this investigation suggest that although there are differences between varieties in the in vitro digestibility of straw, there is no consistent difference between the modern and traditional varieties overall. Fundamentally, though, the taller varieties have the advantage of providing more nutrients per hectare from their straw. "

abstract = "Abstract Regaining the agricultural potential of sodic soils in the Indo-Gangetic plains necessitates the development of suitable salt tolerant rice varieties to provide an entry for other affordable agronomic and soil manipulation measures. Thus selection of high yielding rice varieties across a range of sodic soils is central. Evaluation of breeding lines through on-station and on-farm farmers’ participatory varietal selection (FPVS) resulted in the identification of a short duration (110–115 days), high yielding and disease resistant salt-tolerant rice genotype ‘CSR-89IR-8’, which was later released as ‘CSR43’ in 2011. Several agronomic traits coupled with good grain quality and market value contributed to commercialization and quick adoption of this variety in the sodic areas of the Indo-Gangetic plains of eastern India. Management practices required for rice production in salt affected soils are evidently different from those in normal soils and practices for a short duration salt tolerant variety differ from those for medium to long duration varieties. Experiments were conducted at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Central Soil Salinity Research Institute (ICAR-CSSRI), Regional Research Station, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India during 2011 and 2013 wet seasons, to test the hypothesis that combining matching management practices (Mmp) with an improved genotype would enhance productivity and profitability of rice in sodic soils. Mmp were developed on-station by optimizing existing best management practices (Bmp) recommended for the region to match the requirements of CSR43. The results revealed that transplanting 4 seedlings hill−1 at a spacing of 15 × 20 cm produced significantly higher yield over other treatments. The highest additional net gain was US$ 3.3 at 90 kg ha−1 N, and the lowest was US$ 0.4 at 150 kg ha−1 N. Above 150 kg ha−1, the additional net gain became negative, indicating decreasing returns from additional N. Hence, 150 kg N ha−1 was considered the economic optimum N application rate for \{CSR43\} in these sodic soils. Using 150–60–40–25 kg N–P2O5–K2O–ZnSO4·7H2O ha−1 in farmers’ fields grown to \{CSR43\} produced an average of 5.5 t ha−1 grain. The results of on-farm evaluation trials of \{CSR43\} showed that matching management practices (Mmp) increased yield by 8% over existing best management practices (Bmp) recommended by ICAR-CSSRI for sodic soils and by 16% over framers’ management practices; however, combining Mmp with \{CSR43\} resulted in 35% higher yields over farmers’ current varieties and management. This approach of combining cost effective crop and nutrient management options and a salt-tolerant variety can maximize the productivity and profitability of sodic soils in the alluvial Indo-Gangetic plains and in neighboring salt-affected areas of the Ganges mega delta in South Asia.

Quantitative insight into the behavior of the crop-weed system is needed to develop weed management systems. Recently, eco-physiological simulation models for crop-weed competition were introduced. These models simulate growth and production of species in mixtures, based on physiological processes in plants and their response to the environment. Such models help improve insight into the crop-weed system and can be used to develop simple predictive models for practical application. Several simple regression models for early prediction of yield loss by weeds have been developed. Recently, an approach has been developed in which the relative leaf cover of the weeds shortly after crop emergence is directly related to final yield loss. This approach has high potential as a predictive tool in weed control advisory systems. For strategic weed management activities, quantitative insight into the dynamics of weed populations is required. However, many processes, such as seed bank dynamics, are not yet adequately understood to allow accurate prediction of future weed populations. The use of systems approaches to bridge the gap between weed science research and practical weed management is discussed. "

They found that methane emissions from rice paddies ranged from 18 to 280 Tg year−1 which correspond to between 10 and 70% of the total anthropogenic methane emissions. For this paper, we have reviewed and replicated three published techniques to estimate methane emissions from rice paddies. We present the results obtained and we propose to include soil characteristics to revise these estimates. Since 90% of rice production occurs in Asia, we have only focused our study on rice in Asia. The first technique we replicated, uses the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)'s country statistics and crop calendars to determine the land area under rice cultivation each month. Assuming a constant emission rate, Asian rice fields emit about 82 Tg methane year−1. The second technique we replicated, assumes that methane emissions represent a constant fraction of the net primary production and uses empirical relationships between net primary production and temperature and precipitation records. Asian rice fields then only produce 57 Tg methane year−1. The third technique we replicated, relates methane emissions to rice grain production. It involves the calculation of total organic matter added to rice paddy soils and assumes that a constant fraction is emitted as methane. This leads to an estimate of methane emissions from Asian rice fields of about 63 Tg year−1. We propose to use a classification of rice soils to categorize rice growing locations from potentially methane producing to non-methane producing areas. Using this distinction with any of the three methods we discussed, Asian rice fields emissions are reduced by about 25%. "

Early immigration of leafhoppers into rice plots was greatest in wet seasons (WS) and was also high in a late-planted dry season (DS) crop which was out of synchrony with surrounding rice fields. Peaks in population density occurred by 50–65 days after transplanting in wet seasons, but varied more widely in dry seasons. Nephotettix virescens (Distant) was the most important vector species because of its earlier colonization of rice plantings, more rapid population development and higher transmission of tungro viruses than Nephotettix nigropictus (Stål) or Recilia dorsalis (Motschulsky). Early infected rice hills were randomly distributed and became increasingly aggregated as tungro disease developed, indicating that much secondary spread occurred within plantings. Tungro disease incidence was not directly related to the size of leafhopper vector populations. Rapid spread of tungro disease was recorded in the 1991 dry season, when leafhopper numbers were relatively low but infection pressure was high. The results suggest that vector numbers are not an accurate indicator of tungro disease risk, unless account is also taken of inoculum pressure. It is proposed that a tungro management strategy aimed at reducing the amount of inoculum is more likely to be effective in controlling the disease than a strategy based on reducing leafhopper numbers through insecticide applications.

The objectives were to (i) initially distinguish together with farmers different recommendation domains for rainfed rice within the landscape, (ii) document farmers’ respective management practices, and (iii) test existing fertilizer options in these different recommendation domains with farmers’ participation. Based on the surveys and structured group discussions, four major field categories were distinguished: fields on upper or lower terraces and fields far from or close to the house. These categories did not define clearly different soils, but the trend was that soils close to the house were the most fertile and fields far from the house were the least fertile. Almost all farmers applied less fertilizer in fertile fields. Organic fertilizer was preferably applied in fields close to the house and to non-rice crops in the dry season, whereas inorganic fertilizer was preferably applied to rice and in lower fields and fields far from the house. Upper fields received little inorganic fertilizer in the Mid-hills but normal rates in the Inner Terai. No clear preference for fertilizer use in drought-prone versus wetter fields was found. In the Mid-hills, across both experimental seasons and all fertilizer treatments, rice yields were highest near the house (4.38 t ha−1), similar in lower fields and far from the house (3.86 and 3.35 t ha−1, respectively), and lowest in upper fields (2.78 t ha−1). A medium fertilizer rate tested (60–30–20 N–P2O5–K2O kg ha−1) increased average yields by 1 t ha−1 compared with the control (no fertilizer applied), and by 0.5 t ha−1 compared with the farmers’ practice. Yield gains and agronomic efficiency of N were similar in both seasons, and the highest values for both indicators were found for fields near the house, whereas the lowest values for both characteristics were found in upper terrace fields. We conclude that grain yields can be substantially increased with applications of medium fertilizer rates, and that inorganic fertilizer use is most profitable in fields near the house, followed by lower terrace fields and fields far from the house. The application of organic and little inorganic fertilizer seems to be the best option in drought-prone upper fields. "

A main source for soil organic matter in paddy fields is the rice crop residue that is returned to fields if not burned. We investigated as an alternative treatment the amendment of rice paddies with rice residues that have been charred to black carbon. This treatment might avoid various negative side effects of traditional rice residue treatments. Although charred biomass is seen as almost recalcitrant, its impact on trace gas (CO2, CH4) production and emissions in paddy fields has not been studied. We quantified the degradation of black carbon produced from rice husks in four wetland soils in laboratory incubations. In two of the studied soils the addition of carbonised rice husks resulted in a transient increase in carbon mineralisation rates in comparison to control soils without organic matter addition. After almost three years, between 4.4% and 8.5% of the black carbon added was mineralised to \{CO2\} under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. The addition of untreated rice husks resulted in a strong increase in carbon mineralisation rates and in the same time period 77%–100% of the added rice husks were mineralised aerobically and 31%–54% anaerobically. The 13C-signatures of respired \{CO2\} gave a direct indication of black carbon mineralisation to CO2. In field trials we quantified the impact of rice husk black carbon or untreated rice husks on soil respiration and methane emissions. The application of black carbon had no significant effect on soil respiration but significantly enhanced methane emissions in the first rice crop season. The additional methane released accounted for only 0.14% of black carbon added. If the same amount of organic carbon was added as untreated rice husks, 34% of the applied carbon was released as \{CO2\} and methane in the first season. Furthermore, the addition of fresh harvest residues to paddy fields resulted in a disproportionally high increase in methane emissions. Estimating the carbon budget of the different rice crop residue treatments indicated that charring of rice residues and adding the obtained black carbon to paddy fields instead of incorporating untreated harvest residues may reduce field methane emissions by as much as 80%. Hence, the production of black carbon from rice harvest residues could be a powerful strategy for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from rice fields. "

abstract = "Abstract Drought is a major abiotic threat in rice production; thus, there is a need to develop adaptable rice varieties that can withstand drought stress and still produce high yield in non-stressed environments. Green Super Rice (GSR) cultivars address this issue. These cultivars are bred through an innovative introgression breeding strategy that requires less irrigation water and chemical inputs without compromising grain quality and yield. This study verified the physiological efficiency and performance of newly developed \{GSR\} cultivars that previously showed favorable response to drought during advanced yield trials. Five drought-tolerant \{GSR\} cultivars and two checks were subjected to continuously flooded (CF) and drought-stressed environments during the dry seasons of 2011 and 2012 at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) experimental farms in Los Baños, Philippines. The cultivars’ ability to allocate assimilates and accumulate biomass under drought stress during the reproductive stage was verified. Leaf area index (LAI), biomass dry weight, and panicle yield were measured at the panicle initiation (PI), flowering (FL), and physiological maturity (PM) of the sample cultivars. All the cultivars performed satisfactorily in the \{CF\} environment with grain yield ranging from 5 to 11.5 tons ha−1. Water stress during the reproductive stage significantly reduced grain yield by 75–88% in the moderate drought (soil water tension between 100 and 300 kPa in upper 15 cm soil layer) and 77–96% in the severe drought (soil water tension &gt;300 kPa in upper 15 cm soil layer) experiments. The shortened reproductive duration mainly contributed to the significant reduction in yield under drought stress. Two \{GSR\} cultivars, \{GSR\} IR1-5-S10-D1-D1 and IR83142-B-19-B, responded well in severe drought environments, with grain yield almost similar to the drought check (1.79 tons ha−1). Under moderate drought stress, there was a relative yield advantage of 25% and 40% for the two \{GSR\} cultivars over the drought check, respectively. Yield advantage across environments, varying from fully irrigated to drought-stressed, was 31–36%. These two \{GSR\} cultivars were effective in mobilizing stored carbohydrates from the vegetative organs to the panicles and not shortening the duration from flowering to maturity, to allow all reserved carbohydrates be allocated to storage organs as a mechanism to cope with drought stress. Lower leaf area index (LAI), which allowed balanced biomass accumulation and lower transpiration, without a significant decrease in grain filling duration, was another drought-coping strategy. These physiological responses and characteristics apparently enabled the \{GSR\} cultivars to withstand drought stress; these are key indicators for varietal selection in drought-prone environments, particularly in severe drought stress in the reproductive stage. Despite the poor ability of some cultivars to cope with severe drought, three out of five selected \{GSR\} cultivars produced grain yield (2.0–2.9 tons ha−1) that was the same or higher than the drought check in moderate drought stress. The introgression breeding technique applied in the newly developed drought-tolerant cultivars through the \{GSR\} breeding strategy was found to be effective. It could produce high yields in both \{CF\} and water-limited environments, and thus, it could serve as a model for other breeding programs to adopt. "

The degree of cross-hybridization of the legumeENODgenes with sequences in the genomes of various species, as revealed by hybridization differentials measured in terms of signal intensities, however, suggests that the homologues ofENODgenes are conserved to varied extents in differentOryzaspecies. The presence of homologues ofENODgenes in a wide variety of plant species denotes that the biological functions of early nodulins may be diverse, and not restricted to nodule organogenesis alone. The fact thatENODgene homologues exist widely both in dicots and monocots provides evidence that these homologues have arisen from a common ancestral plant. "

Significant progress has been made in the \{BC\} breeding program, which resulted in development of large numbers of introgression lines with improved tolerance to these stresses. Promising lines have been developed with excellent tolerances (extreme phenotypes) to salinity, submergence and zinc deficiency; resistance to brown plant hopper, ability to germinate under the anaerobic condition and low temperature. Our results indicated that there exist tremendous amounts of ‘hidden’ diversity for abiotic and biotic stress tolerances in the primary gene pool of rice. Furthermore, we demonstrated that despite the complex genetics and diverse physiological mechanisms underlying the abiotic stress tolerances, introgression of genes from a diverse source of donors into elite genetic backgrounds through \{BC\} breeding and efficient selection (careful screening under severe stress) is a powerful way to exploit this hidden diversity for improving abiotic stress tolerances of rice. We have developed three large sets of introgression lines, which not only provide an unique platform of breeding materials for developing new rice cultivars with superior yield and stability by trait/gene pyramiding, but also represent unique genetic stocks for a large-scale discovery of genes/alleles underlying the abiotic and biotic stress tolerances of rice using genomic tools.

Over 160 donor cultivars from 25 countries have been used in this project, representing a significant proportion of the genetic variation in cultivated rice. These cultivars were evaluated in field experiments in the Philippines to assess their responses to drought in terms of plant height, heading date, and grain yield. Drought was imposed near heading stage, in experiments that were established either in lowland (anaerobic) fields or upland (aerobic) soil. Despite the poor adaptation of some cultivars to the tropics, it was possible to identify significant variation in plant response to drought treatments, and contrasting effects on flowering delay and growth. Subsequently, 325 \{BC2F2\} bulk populations, developed by backcrossing many of these donors to one of three elite recurrent parents, were screened under drought in lowland or upland nurseries. Stress levels were managed to eliminate almost all seed set in recurrent parents, and those progeny that produced grain were selected as being putatively drought-tolerant. The selection intensity varied across years and in selection environments with more severe stress, higher selection intensity could be imposed. The number of plants selected within a population was not associated with the per se drought response of the donors in the direct evaluation, indicating the wide presence of cryptic genetic variation for drought tolerance in the apparently drought-susceptible cultivars. The genetic background of the recurrent parent affected the number of plants selected, as did the selection environment (upland versus lowland nurseries). These drought-selected introgression lines represent a useful genetic resource to develop improved cultivars for farmers in rainfed or water-scarce rice-growing regions, and also to improve our understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of drought tolerance in rice. Genetic analysis of the selected lines, reported elsewhere, indicated specific regions of high introgression. Yield evaluations of the selected lines are now underway across a range of drought scenarios. "

Oryza longistaminata is an undomesticated, perennial, rhizomatous relative of domesticated Asian rice (Oryza sativa). Using five sets of 4 × 2 factorial mating designs, we crossed rhizomatous interspecific genotypes (IGs) from an intermated O. sativa/O. longistaminata population with male-fertile \{IG\} selections from the intermated population, and with O. sativa CVs. Parents and progeny were planted in an upland field at \{IRRI\} using a randomized complete block design and evaluated for rhizome expression, survival after 1 year, vigor of the survivors, and yield. For the \{IG\} parents, rhizome expression was variable and penetrance of most genotypes was incomplete, but genotypes that demonstrated the potential for moderate rhizome expression had high penetrance (89% average). The \{CV\} parents yielded 11.0 g/plant on average but none produced rhizomes or survived 1 year. The \{IG\} parents averaged yields of 3.1 g/plant, 57% rhizomatous and 36% survival. The IG/IG progeny averaged yields of 4.2 g/plant, 32% rhizomatous and 37% survival. The IG/CV progeny averaged yields of 6.0 g/plant, 18% rhizomatous and 16% survival. Nine IG/IG progeny and six IG/CV progeny were rhizomatous, perennial, and yielded at least 5 g/plant, and five of these yielded more than 10 g/plant. For the \{IG\} parents and IG/IG progeny, rhizome presence and expression were positively associated with survival and vigor of the survivors. General combining ability effects were significant for percent survival and yield but not percent rhizomatous. Specific combining ability effects were significant for percent rhizomatous, percent survival and yield. By selecting female parents for long rhizomes and male parents for fertility, considerable gains in rhizome expression, survival and yield were made. The development of perennial upland rice \{CVs\} should be feasible via introgression of genes from O. longistaminata. "

The chapter also illustrates the \{CH4\} source strength of different rice ecologies and possible mitigation options. It is now well understood that emission of \{CH4\} from rice paddies into the atmosphere are triggered by the microbiological processes of \{CH4\} production in the anoxic layers of the soil, by aerobic \{CH4\} oxidation in the oxic surface layers of the soil, and the floodwater. Methane produced in rice fields escapes to the atmosphere initially by ebullition and diffusion from the flooded soil but as rice plant growth proceeds, it is emitted primarily by diffusive transport through the rice plant. Furthermore, based on differences among cultivars, it is feasible to select and breed high yielding rice cultivars with a reduced \{CH4\} transport capacity. This could be useful in formulating mitigation options and that may be realized in future rice breeding programs. "

The effect of a number of variables on disease incidence, including the proximity of a field to inoculum sources, was examined using ordinal regression analysis.

We conducted a study in controlled-environment chambers to determine the growth and physiological responses and spikelet differentiation of rice cultivars to \{HNT\} treatment at different growth stages. Plants were exposed to two temperatures: 30/21 °C (low) and 30/25 °C (high) day/night temperatures. At the end of the vegetative period, plants grown in the low (LNT) and high (HNT) night temperatures were further subdivided and plants were exposed to different temperature treatments in the reproductive growth period. Photosynthesis, night respiration rates, and plant growth parameters were measured at various stages. High night temperature had no significant effects on the growth of rice cultivars during the vegetative phase. Maximum photosynthesis at the vegetative phase was not significantly affected, but plant dark respiration increased (within the 14–20% range). Genotypic variation in dark respiration was observed at later growth stages. Rice plants that received \{HNT\} at the early reproductive stage had the lowest number of spikelets per panicle, presenting a 35.9% of degenerated spikelets, significantly higher than those observed in other treatment times. This study shows that the response of rice cultivars to \{HNT\} varies with time of treatment and that the occurrence of \{HNT\} during the reproductive period provided supportive evidence on how \{HNT\} might reduce yield by increasing plant’s dark respiration rate and spikelet degeneration (which consequently reduced sink size), thus, decreasing biomass production.

Severe yield losses were observed when a single stress or a combination of stresses coincide with flowering, but the physiological responses of rice floral organs leading to spikelet sterility are not known. Metabolic and transcriptomic profiling of anthers, pistils before pollination and pollinated pistils was performed to investigate physiological responses determining fertility under heat and combined drought and heat stress using the heat- and drought-tolerant \{N22\} and the heat-sensitive and drought-tolerant cultivar Moroberekan. Different metabolite patterns were observed between floral organs as well as between cultivars under non-stressed and stressed conditions. Several candidate metabolites were differentially accumulated in stressed anthers of \{N22\} compared to Moroberekan under non- stress conditions. More genes were regulated under heat-drought stress than heat stress in anthers of both cultivars with \{N22\} showing much less gene regulation under combined stress in comparison to Moroberekan. The functional class of genes related to stress was over-represented under all stress conditions in both cultivars while fewer bins were over-represented under heat stress compared to combined stress. Combining metabolite and transcriptomic analyses identified sugar metabolism in anthers as crucial for tolerance or susceptibility to stress. In the future, identification of candidate metabolites and genes will be useful for marker assisted selection procedures to breed more stress tolerant crop plants. "

In the tropics, \{BPH\} is usually regarded as a secondary pest which becomes a problem only due to misuse of insecticides. Thus the risk of inadvertently inducing resurgence by the planthopper must be considered when attempting to control other rice pests. In temperate rice systems, the number of immigrants entering the crop and the temperature during the growing season are the main driving variables determining \{BPH\} population size. Here decisions can be made both in response to early warnings of planthopper immigration and in response to monitoring of populations during the cropping period. With \{RTVD\} (which occurs only in tropical systems), measures to prevent plant-to-plant spread of the disease within a crop are relatively ineffective. Early warning of the risk of tungro infection, however, would allow preventive measures to be taken such as the adjustment of planting times or the targeted deployment of resistant varieties. "

abstract = "Abstract Rice is the major food crop in most flood-prone areas of South and Southeast Asia. Growing other crops during the wet season (monsoon/kharif, June–December) is difficult due to waterlogging caused by heavy rain. Lowland rice faces stagnant flooding (SF) risk during most of the wet season. Apart from that, farmers in coastal regions often implement suboptimal crop management leading to poor yields. Development of suitable management practices along with improved varieties is therefore, of prime importance for increasing rice productivity in tropical coastal regions. One on-station and five on-farm studies were conducted over two years to assess the effect of variety, seedling density and nutrient management on yield and economic benefits under rainfed lowland conditions. Improved variety (Amal-Mana) combined with improved management practices established in on-station trials were then evaluated in farmers’ fields. The best management practices were established as fertilizer rate of 50–20–10 kg N-P2O5-K2O + 5 t farm yard manure (FYM) ha−1 and transplanting of 2 seedlings hill−1 at spacing of 15 × 15 cm. This package was found to be optimum for increasing productivity and economic returns of transplanted kharif rice in coastal rainfed lowlands. Application of more than 50 kg N ha−1 through inorganic fertilizers did not increase grain yield, yet increased production cost. The variety Amal-Mana is tolerant of \{SF\} and performed better (yield 0.5–1.0 t ha−1 more) than other local varieties, both in on-station and on-farm studies. Combining improved management and tolerant variety resulted in higher grain yield (4.51 t ha−1) compared with farmers’ management and varieties (2.55 t ha−1) and increased the benefit-cost ratio from 1.32 for farmers’ management and varieties to 1.82. These yield advantages were consistent across locations with variable stagnant flooding stress of 38–62 cm during 2013 and 28–47 cm during 2014. Association of grain yield with stagnant flooding water depth was strongest with farmer's management and farmer's variety (R2 = 0.81**), but weaker for improved management combined with improved variety (R2 = 0.015), suggesting water depth becomes less significant when a tolerant variety and good management were combined. These technologies will help in sustaining higher productivity and profitability of rice-based cropping systems in the stagnant flood-prone coastal zones. "

A combination of high-yielding, stress-tolerant rice varieties and good management practices is necessary to enhance the productivity of these areas. Suboptimal nursery management using traditional methods practiced in these areas often leads to a reduced plant population because of seedling mortality leading to poor yields. Nursery management practices that suit the new stress-tolerant varieties recently becoming available need to be developed to increase the productivity of rice. On-station and on-farm trials on nursery management were conducted using improved rice varieties to study the effect of seed density, nutrient management in the nursery, and seedling age at transplanting on grain yield. Lower seed density and application of balanced nutrients produced healthy and taller seedlings with high seedling vigor index (SVI) in the nursery and with subsequent significant increase in grain yield after transplanting in the main field. Combining inorganic and organic fertilizers in the seedbed (50–30–15 kg N–P2O5–K2O ha–1 + 5 t ha–1 farm yard manures; FYM) enhanced seedling growth (dry weight, shoot and root length, number of green leaves, leaf area) and leaf nitrogen concentration. Forty-d-old seedlings produced significantly higher yield than 25-d-old seedlings. Transplanting older seedlings is important in systems without good water control, un-leveled fields, and soils affected by salt stress; and taller seedlings help avoid losses caused by floods. The highest benefit/cost ratios of 1.82, 1.72 and 1.91 were observed when transplanting 40-d-old seedlings using a seed density of 25 g m−2 and with balanced nutrient application of 50–30–15 kg N–P2O5–K2O + 5 t \{FYM\} ha−1, respectively. In the on-farm trials, the yield advantages when using new stress-tolerant rice varieties Swarna-Sub1 and Amal-Mana with improved nursery management practices were 23% and 47%, in comparison with farmers’ nursery management and farmers’ variety, respectively. These cost-effective nursery management approaches have great potential for enhancing yield in stress-prone rainfed coastal areas and will help sustain rice yield while ensuring sustainability of the cropping system.

Although this country is one of the most important rice exporters worldwide, a comprehensive picture of the occurrence of M. graminicola in Vietnamese rice fields is still not available. Therefore a nematode survey was carried out with the aim of better understanding the geographical distribution, and the pathogenic and genetic variability of the \{RKN\} in Vietnam. From the fields surveyed in a range of ecosystems, 21 \{RKN\} populations were recovered from infected rice roots. A diagnostic \{SCAR\} marker was developed showing that all Vietnamese populations belong to M. graminicola. Furthermore, sequencing of the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) of the rDNA genes confirmed this identification. These populations were then characterised using morphometrics and pathogenicity tests (host plant range diversity, reproduction and virulence diversity) revealing intraspecific variability. We showed that morphometric traits are mainly genetically heritable characters with significant differences among the studied populations. Finally, a distinctive trait signature was found for the populations isolated from the upland rice cultures. All together, our study reveals the prevalence of M. graminicola populations in Vietnamese rice. Further investigations need to be developed to explore the population dynamics and evolutionary history of this species in South East Asia. "

Seedlings ⩾ 30 days old were more tolerant of snail damage than younger seedlings. Drainage immobilizes snails. More preventative measures should be undertaken in high-risk (⩾ 2 snails m−2) than in low-risk (&lt; 2 snails m−2) fields. Snails can be controlled in low-risk fields by employing one or two cultural methods. Dapog or direct-seeded methods would benefit from drainage and mechanical control (hand-picking). If cultural methods cannot be carried out, snails can be controlled with molluscicide at low dosage. High-risk fields, on the other hand, should be protected with a combination of cultural and mechanical methods. These methods can be substituted with low or high dosages of molluscicide.

In 2001–2002, experiments with aerobic rice varieties \{HD502\} and \{HD297\} and lowland rice variety \{JD305\} were conducted under aerobic and flooded conditions. Under aerobic conditions, five irrigation treatments were implemented. Under flooded conditions, \{JD305\} yielded up to 8.8 t ha−1, \{HD502\} up to 6.8 t ha−1, and \{HD297\} up to 5.4 t ha−1. Under aerobic conditions, the aerobic varieties yielded higher than the lowland variety. \{HD502\} produced 3–3.5 t ha−1 with 450–500 mm total water input and 5.3–5.7 t ha−1 with 650 mm water input and more. \{HD297\} produced 3–3.5 t ha−1 with 450–500 mm total water input and 4.7–5.3 t ha−1 with 650 mm water input and more. The water productivity of aerobic rice under aerobic conditions was higher or on a par with that of the lowland variety under flooded conditions, reaching values of 0.6–0.8 g grain kg−1 water. The relatively high yields of the aerobic varieties under aerobic soil conditions were obtained under “harsh” conditions for growing rice. The soil contained more than 80% sand, was permeable, and held water above field capacity for a few hours after irrigation only. The groundwater table was deeper than 20 m, the soil moisture content in the rootzone was mostly between 50 and 80% of saturation, and soil moisture tension went up to 90 kPa. We conclude that the aerobic rice varieties \{HD502\} and \{HD297\} are suitable for water-scarce environments, and can stand being periodically flooded. "

Yields in \{TP\} \{ISU\} were higher than in wet-seeded (WS) \{ISU\} and those in \{WS\} \{ISU\} higher than in dry-seeded (DS) ISU, but the difference was significant (P&lt;5%) only between \{TP\} and \{DS\} ISU. Land preparation duration was significantly reduced in \{DS\} and \{WS\} \{ISU\} compared with \{TP\} ISU. This led to a significant reduction in irrigation and total water input (rainfall and irrigation) before crop establishment. However, during the crop growth period in the main field, \{TP\} \{ISU\} had a significantly shorter crop growth duration and total water input than \{DS\} and \{WS\} ISU. Over the whole crop season, the three crop establishment methods had a similar total water input, but \{DS\} \{ISU\} had significantly less irrigation water and higher water productivity with respect to irrigation water than \{WS\} \{ISU\} and \{TP\} ISU. This was attributed to the ability of \{DS\} rice to capture more rainfall after crop establishment. Site-specific management of \{WS\} rice versus \{TP\} rice has to be taken into account in assessing their relative advantage for water input and water productivity. "

Major challenges are to (i) save water; (ii) increase water productivity and (iii) produce more rice with less water. This study analyzes the ways in which water-saving irrigation can help to meet these challenges at the field level. The analyses are conducted using experimental data collected mostly in central–northern India and the Philippines. Water input can be reduced by reducing ponded water depths to soil saturation or by alternate wetting/drying. Water savings under saturated soil conditions were on average 23% (±14%) with yield reductions of only 6% (±6%). Yields were reduced by 10–40% when soil water potentials in the root zone were allowed to reach −100 to −300 mbar. In clayey soils, intermittent drying may lead to shrinkage and cracking, thereby risking increased soil water loss, increased water requirements and decreased water productivity. Water productivity in continuous flooded rice was typically 0.2–0.4 g grain per kg water in India and 0.3–1.1 g grain per kg water in the Philippines. Water-saving irrigation increases water productivity, up to a maximum of about 1.9 g grain per kg water, but decreases yield. It therefore does not produce more rice with less water on the same field. Field-level water productivity and yield can only be increased concomitantly by improving total factor productivity or by raising the yield potential. Total rice production can be increased by using water saved in one location to irrigate new land in another. If this is not done, a strategy of saving water at the field level potentially threatens total rice production at large. "

Importantly, agronomic management practices affect plant development, and water management is arguably the most important cultural practice in direct-seeded rice. Our objectives were to quantify the canopy development of rice and some important weeds in response to water management, and test the effects of those descriptions in DSRICE1, a rice–weed model of competition for light. Here we report results for rice (M-103; Japonica type), early watergrass (Echinochloa oryzoides), and ricefield bulrush (Scirpus mucronatus) in California, and for rice (IR72; Indica type) and Cyperus difformis (smallflower umbrellaplant) in the Philippines. Leaf and stem material were stratified over height. Leaf and stem drymass per meter per plant (g m−1 plant−1; \{LDH\} or SDH), plus leaf area per meter per plant (m2 m−1 plant−1; LAH) in the Philippines, were fit over fractional plant height by linear and nonlinear regression and evaluated using likelihood ratio tests. After standardization, no significant differences between rice \{LDHs\} and \{LAHs\} were detected, indicating that its drymass and area distributions were equivalent. Differences in \{LDHs\} and \{LAHs\} were detected for C. difformis, however, which was probably the result of having basal leaves. Shoot distributions were mostly consistent within each plant type, grass or sedge. Except for senescent early watergrass at 104 days after seeding (DAS), grass \{LDHs\} were best fit by a bottom-skewed function. Changes in skewness of \{LDHs\} corresponded with tillering dynamics in both grass species. \{LDHs\} for C. difformis and ricefield bulrush were conical, indicating a possibly large disadvantage competing for light. Grass \{SDHs\} were always conical, and early season stem height fractions (SF=stem height/plant height) of the grasses were about 0.5. Shoot distributions were very consistent across treatments, but water management modified competitive relationships via effects on plant heights. The model \{DSRICE1\} was used to test the effects of changes in canopy specifications on rice–watergrass and rice–Ammannia spp. (redstem; canopy traits measured previously) competition in the California system. Canopy descriptions in \{DSRICE1\} were changed singly and in combinations, and other tests used observed heights. Results were compared to baseline output. Competition predictions of rice and weed growth were much more dependent on canopy details than monoculture predictions, as expected. Rice–weed competition was most affected by \{LDH\} and \{SDH\} changes, while \{SF\} mediated \{SDH\} effects. Using observed heights for rice–watergrass competition further affected outcomes. Model changes were best understood by how they altered the dominance of one species over the other (e.g., watergrass over rice). Overall, results confirmed that shoot distributions were strongly related to plant architecture and leaf demography. Model analyses affirmed the fundamental role of shoot distributions in canopy light dynamics. The quantitative descriptions provided here are robust and should help standardize canopy specifications across rice–weed models. "

New spatial data on the distribution of poverty and the expenditure patterns of households below international poverty lines are used to offer more detailed assessment of the poverty relevance of alternative foci than possible previously. Patterns of impact potential are evaluated against evidence of impact to date to discern probabilities of success in achieving potential impacts. Impact patterns discerned are contrasted with current relative funding allocations across research areas in the subregion by National Agricultural Research Systems (NARSs) and International Agricultural Research Centers (IARCs) to identify key funding gaps. Research on rice, vegetables, fruit and aquaculture is identified as having the largest gap between current investments and expected impacts. The rice research gap is the most pronounced, as it is the single source of a substantial share of quantified potential future benefits for the poor, has positive expected environmental benefits, and has a strong record of documented impact to date in the subregion. Vegetables, fruit and aquaculture appear to have greater relative impact potential for the poor and nutritional benefits than their funding shares, but the track record of impact to date is more limited and the likelihood of success for such investments is more uncertain.

In a field in which cotton and cowpea were grown in rotation, cotton yield was more strongly related to total numbers of plant-parasitic nematodes than it was to numbers of any individual species. There were indications of incompatible or antagonistic associations among the plant-parasitic nematode species, especially at higher population densities.

In particular, the ultimate distributional impact of modern varieties will critically depend on the interregional labor-market adjustments through migration in response to regional wage differentials created by the differential technology adoption, since labor is the main resource of the majority of the rural population. We studied favorable and unfavorable rice-growing villages in the Philippines, and found that adoption of modern varieties during the 1970s was positively related to population growth rate. Contrary to popular belief, no association was observed between wage rates and adoption of modern varieties as of 1986. These findings support the hypothesis that the differential adoption of modern rice varieties induced interregional labor migration toward equalization of wage income across different production environments.

Rice plant density was greatly affected by weed control treatment. Lower density and lower uniformity of the rice plant stand occurred as a result of increased rates of herbicides. Increased rates of pendimethalin were more toxic than increased rates of oxadiargyl. Both herbicides effectively controlled Digitaria ciliaris, Echinochloa colona, and Phyllanthus niruri; however, they were unable to control Murdannia nudiflora. Oxadiargyl controlled Cyperus rotundus across rates by 31–55%, but pendimethalin was completely ineffective on it, and higher rates of both herbicides had no effect in controlling this weed. Both herbicides at higher rates reduced total weed biomass significantly. Among herbicide treatments, the highest yield (3.7–4.0 t ha−1) was recorded in plots treated with oxadiargyl at 160 g ai ha−1 and the lowest yield (2.4–2.8 t ha−1) was in plots treated with pendimethalin at 1600 g ai ha−1. Results from our study suggest that a higher rate of oxadiargyl can increase yield by suppressing weeds in dry-seeded rice systems. Similar to the results of oxadiargyl, pendimethalin at higher rates also greatly suppressed weeds; however, yield decreased due to phytotoxicity to rice seedlings. "

We examined whether the application of organic manures or crop residue can reduce the need for gypsum in calcareous soils. A long-term field experiment with annual rice–wheat cropping rotation was conducted for 15 years (1991–2006) on a non-saline calcareous sandy loam soil (Typic Ustochrept) in northwestern, India. The irrigation water treatments included good quality canal water (CW) and sodic water (SW) with residual sodium carbonate (RSC) of 10 mmolc L−1 from 1991 to 1999 and of 12.5 mmolc L−1 from 2000 onwards. Gypsum was applied at 0, 12.5, 25, and 50% of the gypsum requirement (GR), to neutralize \{RSC\} of the SW. Three organic material treatments consisted of application of farmyard manure (FYM) at 20 Mg ha−1, Sesbania green manure (GM) at 20 Mg ha−1, and wheat straw (WS) at 6 Mg ha−1. The organic materials were applied every year to the rice crop. Continuous irrigation with sodic water for 15 years without gypsum or organic materials resulted in a gradual increase in soil pH and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), deterioration of soil physical properties, and decrease in yields of both rice and wheat. The cumulative yield loss in \{SW\} irrigated plots without gypsum and organic materials remained &lt;1.5 Mg ha−1 for up to eight years in the case of rice and up to nine years in the case of wheat. Thereafter, marked increase in pH and \{ESP\} resulted in further depression in yields of rice by 1.6 Mg ha−1 year−1 and wheat by 1.2 Mg ha−1 year−1. Application of gypsum improved physical and chemical properties of the soil. The beneficial effects on crop yields were visible up to 12.5% \{GR\} in rice and up to 50% \{GR\} in wheat in most of the years. All the organic materials proved effective in mobilizing Ca2+ from inherent and precipitated CaCO3 resulting in decline in soil pH and ESP, increase in infiltration rate, and a increase in the yields of rice and wheat crops. Although the application of organic materials resulted in comparable reductions in pH and ESP, the increase in yield with \{SW\} was higher for both crops with FYM. Pooled over the last six years (2000–2006), application of \{FYM\} resulted in 38 and 26% increase in rice and wheat yields, respectively, over \{SW\} treatment; corresponding increases in 50% \{GR\} treatment (recommended level) was 18 and 19%. During these years, application of \{GM\} and \{WS\} increased wheat yields by 20%; for rice, \{GM\} resulted in 22% increase compared to 17% in \{WS\} amended \{SW\} irrigated plots. Combined application of gypsum and organic materials did not increase the yields further particularly in the case of \{FYM\} and \{GM\} treated plots. This long-term study proves that organic materials alone can be used to solubilize Ca from inherent and precipitated CaCO3 in calcareous soils for achieving sustainable yields in sodic water irrigated rice–wheat grown in annual rotation. The results can help reduce the dependency on gypsum in sodic water irrigated calcareous soils. "

One approach is to make the crop more competitive and reduce the effects of weeds on the crop by using higher rice seeding rates. A study was conducted in the Philippines and India in 2008 and 2009 to assess the relations of seeding rates (15–125 kg ha−1) of hybrid and inbred varieties to crop and weed growth in aerobic rice. Plant densities, tillers, and biomass of rice increased linearly with increased in seeding rates under both weedy and weed free environments. Weed biomass decreased linearly with increasing seeding rates from 15 to 125 kg ha−1. Panicles and grain yields of rice in competition with weeds increased in a quadratic relation with increased seeding rates at both locations; however, the response was flat in the weed free plots. A quadratic model predicted that seeding rates of 48–80 kg ha−1 for the inbred varieties and 47–67 kg ha−1 for the hybrid varieties were needed to achieve maximum grain yield when grown in the absence of weeds, while rates of 95–125 kg seed ha−1 for the inbred varieties and 83–92 kg seed ha−1 for the hybrid varieties were needed to achieve maximum yields in competition with weeds. On the basis of these results, seeding rates greater than 80 kg ha−1 are advisable where there are risks of severe weed competition. Such high seeding rates may be prohibitive when using expensive seed, and maximum yields are not the only consideration for developing recommendations for optimizing economic returns for farmers. Results of the present study do suggest however that increasing seeding rates of aerobic rice does suppress weed growth and reduce grain yield losses from weed competition. This information could be incorporated in integrated crop management packages to manage weeds more effectively. "

Flooded rice crops use large quantities of water, which becomes scarcer for farmers. New methods of saving irrigation water have been tested and released but they often suffer from a yield trade-off. A comparative study was carried out with a recent dual-adapted variety cultivated as either a flooded transplanted crop or a direct-seeded and soil water-saturated crop, referred to as an aerobic crop, to dissect the crop physiological differences induced by crop management. Experiments were conducted at IRRI's experiment station in Los Baños, Philippines, in the dry seasons of 2011 and 2012. Grain yields were 2 tons/ha or 25% lower in the aerobic crop as a result of a complex series of modifications and adjustments in plant architecture and yield components. Four main changes — higher plant density, slower rate of leaf appearance, lower nitrogen content, and reduced size of all organs — induced by the aerobic crop environment were responsible for three chains of modifications that resulted in lower biomass accumulation and finally lower grain yield. Leaf appearance rates were bilinear in both environments, initially similar in both environments and slower after an inflection point that occurred at the appearance of the 8th leaf in aerobic crops instead of the 11th leaf in flooded crops. As a consequence, two fewer leaves were produced by main tillers in aerobic crops, whose individual leaf area thus was much lower. In 2012, plant nitrogen content was about 1% lower in the aerobic crop than in the flooded crop during the entire crop duration. Biomass accumulation of the variety used was biphasic in both environments, with high radiation use efficiency during the two phases of effective biomass accumulation in flooded crops, and the standard radiation use efficiency expected with \{C3\} species in aerobic crops during the same phases.

Dry seeding also offers many other potential benefits, including reduced cost of crop establishment and improved soil structure for crops grown in rotation with rice. However, the optimum time for seeding in areas where farmers have access to water for supplementary irrigation has not been determined. We hypothesized that earlier sowing is safer, and that increasing seed rate mitigates the adverse effects of significant rain after sowing on establishment and crop performance. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed long term rainfall data, and conducted field experiments on the effects of sowing date (target dates of 25 May, 10 June, 25 June, and 10 July) and seed rate (20, 40, and 60 kg ha−1) on crop establishment, growth, and yield of dry seeded Binadhan-7 (short duration, 110–120 d) during the 2012 and 2013 rainy seasons. Wet soil as a result of untimely rainfall usually prevented sowing on the last two target dates in both years, but not on the first two dates. Rainfall analysis also suggested a high probability of being able to dry seed in late May/early June, and a low probability of being able to dry seed in late June/early July. Delaying sowing from 25 May/10 June to late June/early July usually resulted in 20–25% lower plant density and lower uniformity of the plant stand as a result of rain shortly after sowing. Delaying sowing also reduced crop duration, and tillering or biomass production when using a low seed rate. For the late June/early July sowings, there was a strong positive relationship between plant density and yield, but this was not the case for earlier sowings. Thus, increasing seed rate compensated for the adverse effect of untimely rains after sowing on plant density and the shorter growth duration of the late sown crops. The results indicate that in this region, the optimum date for sowing dry seeded rice is late May to early June with a seed rate of 40 kg ha−1. Planting can be delayed to late June/early July with no yield loss using a seed rate of 60 kg ha−1, but in many years, the soil is simply too wet to be able to dry seed at this time due to rainfall.

These responses were related to root-zone soil water status for use in a rainfed-rice simulation model. Results were very similar for both varieties. Drought responses in young plants occurred at a lower soil water status than in older plants. The first observed effect in a drought period in the vegetative phase was a decline in leaf expansion rate compared to well-watered plants. Leaf expansion stopped completely with root-zone soil water pressure potential h in the range −50 to −250 kPa, depending on crop age and growing season. The rate of transpiration, corrected for differences in LAI, remained roughly equal to that of well-watered plants in the range 0 &gt; h &gt; −100 kPa, depending on crop age. As the soil water status declined further, relative transpiration rate decreased with increasing values of log(|h|), following a logistic function. Leaf rolling and early senesence started at h &lt; −200 kPa or lower and were linearly related with log(|h|). Yield differences between plants that were transiently stressed in the early vegetative phase and well-watered plants were not significant. However, flowering and maturity were delayed. Severe drought in the reproductive phase resulted in large yield reductions, mainly caused by an increase in the percentage of unfilled grains and also in grain weight. "

Among these lines, tiller number, which reached a maximum in all duration groups about 50 days after transplanting, was not a useful index of N-use efficiency. Patterns and rate of N uptake were similar among duration groups up to harvest of short-duration lines. The longer period for N accumulation available to long-duration lines did not enhance values, though six of the most N-efficient lines were of medium duration and four were of long duration.

Resource capture and utilization efficiencies by intercrops were compared to those of sole crops by contrasting intercrop means against the weighted means of sole crops. Weightings were based on the proportion of each species in the intercrop. On average, intercrops took up 43% more P (−4 to 83%) and 35% more K (− 10 to 87%) than the sole crops. Where nutrients were not limiting, P and K uptake increased as dry-matter yield increased, evidence that uptake was a function of crop growth rather than conversely. Even where soil P was deficient, uptake by a dominated crop was decided more by factors that determined the outcome of competition than by P availability. The combined root systems, likely to be larger and functional for a longer duration under intercrops than under either sole crop, were postulated to explain the greater capture of non-mobile nutrients like P and K. An enlarged root system provides an expanded root surface area to which non-mobile nutrients can diffuse. For mobile nutrients which move to root surfaces largely by mass flow, shading of the dominated canopy may explain the positive association observed between intecrop dry-matter accumulation and Ca capture. Shading reduces carbon assimilation and transpiration of the understory canopy and, therefore, would reduce mass flow of Ca as well. Competition for P and K by intercropped species, even when nutrient supplies were abundant, was affected by degree of growth concurrency, canopy domination and planting geometry. When a dominating species was harvested much earlier than the dominated species, the uptake rate of the longer-duration crop usually recovered from competition after the first crop was harvested. Exceptions occurred when development of the dominated crop was so badly impaired during concurrent growth that vegetative enlargement was inhibited after harvest of the early species. Uptake rates by pigeon pea and cassava, which are exceptionally long-maturing species that have relatively low daily P and K uptake requirements, appeared capable of fully recovering even on soils in which nutrient availabilities were marginal for other species.

S. rostrata was grown twice a year during the 43-day dry-wet and wet-dry transition periods between the wet and dry season rice crops. Grain yield potential and fertilizer responsiveness of rice was generally highest in the dry season. On the other hand, S. rostrata growth was more vigorous in the wet season (long-day period) than in the dry season, regardless of establishment method. Green manure N accumulation was lowest with zero tillage (30 and 90 kg N/ha in dry and wet season, respectively) and highest when it was relay-cropped for two weeks (60 and 180 kg N/ha in dry and wet season, respectively). Land preparation for Sesbania ensured best green manure stand (&gt; 100 plants/m2 vs 20–40 plants/m2 at no-till establishments) but increased costs of green manuring by US$16/ha compared with other establishment methods. A quadratic response function between mineral fertilizer equivalence and green manure N indicated that up to 75 kg N/ha, lowland rice uses green manure N more efficiently than urea. Depending on season and establishment method, S. rostrata substituted for 35 to 90 kg of split-applied urea N. Benefit-cost ratios indicated that pre-rice green manure use in the wet season under the current fertilizer and labor prices in the Philippines was a less attractive economic option than mineral N fertilizer. This was true for all establishment methods. In the dry season, S. rostrata established by relay cropping gave the highest rate of return. The 2-week relay cropping of green manure with irrigated rice gave highest green manure N accumulation and rice grain yield, and may be economically viable where fertilizer prices are higher or labor costs are lower than in the Philippines.

Because the area devoted to rice and wheat cultivation in these favourable conditions has been stagnant or declining since the 1980s, with little prospect for reversing the trend, increases in grain production must come from increases in yield per hectare. To achieve the needed increases in yields of basic food grains, a broad range of constraints facing existing production systems must be removed. Additional inputs for crop production are needed, and new technologies, which have yet to be developed, are essential for managing crop nutrients, pests and diseases. Under normal economic conditions, optimal farm management of high-intensity agriculture produces grain yields that approach 80% of the technical ceiling achieved on experimental plots. As Asian farmers approach this 80% limit, pushing out the technical yield ceiling will be crucial for maintaining growth in cereal yields into the 21st Century. If management practices focus on short-run profitability rather than on long-run sustainability, the challenge to scientists seeking to raise yield potential becomes more complex because of the deteriorating soil environment in which crops are grown. Most of the agricultural land in the developing world has less-favourable endowments of soil and water resources than do the high-productivity farming areas of Asia. These regions are home to the majority of the world's poor. Developments in production ecology suggest that significant improvement is possible in the management of biological processes that govern the efficiency and sustainability of the agricultural systems that dominate in these poorly endowed areas.

In direct contrast to high yielding indicas, which have large numbers of tillers and relatively small panicles, the \{NPT\} has large panicles and low tiller numbers. To determine whether the \{NPT\} had a higher potential for spikelet production, and possibly yield, than an elite indica, the total number of juvenile spikelets (glumous flower primordia) was determined for plants grown in the field as a crop or widely spaced. The maximum number of juvenile spikelets produced by the temporal pattern of tillers in a hill was recorded at the time of late differentiation of each tiller’s panicle. The number was greater for spaced plants than crop plants and it decreased linearly with tiller age. For crop plants approximately one juvenile spikelet was produced per square centimeter of leaf area. In 1997, a large number of the juvenile spikelets were lost before harvest, that number increased significantly in the wetter year of 1999. To quantify potential yield and its reduction by the loss of spikelets between the juvenile and mature stages, the number of spikelets at harvest and the filled fraction (grains) was determined for each tiller and a simple empirical model of yield was constructed. The model predicted that if all of the juvenile spikelets were to be transformed into grains a potential yield more than double the actual yield would be produced in crops of high yielding indicas or the NPT, suggesting that source strength rather than sink size limited yield in this study. Differences in spikelet number at harvest could be offset by differences in individual grain weight and percentage filling of spikelets. Even in rice crops grown with large applications of fertilizer, at current atmospheric concentrations of CO2, yields are limited by the supply of resources necessary for the development and synthesis of the grain rather than sink capacity. The potential sink size of the crop is almost double that actually realized, even though the productive tillers of crop plants do not reach their full potential for spikelet production compared with spaced plants.

The degree of galling reached a level of 5 at flowering and harvest in 2004, and 3 at tillering and 4 at harvest in 2005. Results of a plant tissue analysis at mid-tillering for Fe, Mn, and Zn showed on average values above critical levels; individual replicates, however, indicated deficiencies for Mn. In addition to actual field observations, we used simulation modeling (ORYZA2000) as a tool to estimate attainable yield under actual water conditions and N inputs to explore how yield failure set in. Simulation results matched observed values for total above-ground biomass and leaf area index quite well when no N was applied. When high rates of N (200 and 165 kg ha−1) were applied, simulated values matched actual field data only until about the panicle initiation stage; afterward, observed values remained below the simulation. We interpreted this as evidence that growth-limiting factors other than water or N affected the crop from this growth stage on. Observations made in the field on root knot nematodes and micronutrients suggested that these two factors, especially root knot nematodes, may have been major constraints to crop development in this experiment.

Both species increased significantly the grain yield of rice. In the short-day period A. afraspera seemed superior-its productivity is higher than that of S. rostrata.

Lodging, i.e. the reduction in plant canopy height due to bending of the shoot from vertical, occurred in canopies of modern irrigated and \{DWR\} growing in the field under tropical conditions and ranged from 0 to 42% of canopies which were held erect using nets; this was associated with yield reductions of up to 2 t ha−1. A 1% reduction in grain yield occurred for every 2% lodging when data from different seasons, cultivars, and lodging treatments were plotted together. Lodging treatments which reduced canopy height by 75% (75% lodging) resulted in a suboptimal stratified light interception of the canopy. In lodged and non-lodged canopies, more than 80% of light was intercepted within the top 5 cm and 80 cm of canopies respectively. Lodging reduced canopy photosynthesis by 60 to 80% relative to erect canopies of \{DWR\} and irrigated rice respectively, and for \{DWR\} the reductions in canopy photosynthesis gave predicted reductions in yield which were equivalent to the measured yield.

Most work has focused on placement, form, and timing of applied N to reduce losses from volatilization and denitrification. In contrast, less emphasis has been given to development of methods to adjust N rates in relation to the amount of N supplied by indigenous soil resources. As a result, N fertilizer recommendations are typically made for districts or regions with the implicit assumption that soil N supply is relatively uniform within these domains. Recent studies, however, document tremendous variation in soil N supply among lowland rice fields with similar soil types or in the same field over time. Despite these differences, rice farmers do not adjust applied N rates to account for the wide range in soil N supply, and the resulting imbalance contributes to low N-use efficiency. A model for calculating N-use efficiency is proposed that explicitly accounts for contributions from both indigenous and applied N to plant uptake and yield. We argue that increased N-use efficiency will depend on field-specific N management tactics that are responsive to soil N supply and plant N status. N fertilizer losses are thus considered a symptom of incongruence between N supply and crop demand rather than a driving force of N efficiency. Recent knowledge of process controls on N cycling, microbial populations, and soil organic matter (SOM) formation and decomposition in flooded soils are discussed in relation to N-use efficiency. We conclude that the intrinsic capacity of wetland rice systems to conserve N and the rapid N uptake potential of the rice plant provide opportunities for significant increases in N efficiency by improved management and monitoring of indigenous N resources, straw residues, plant N status, and N fertilizer.

Crop requirements, input-output balance, and soil supplying capacity of P, K and S in irrigated lowland rice are reviewed. Based on projected rice production requirements, we estimate that the total annual nutrient demand for irrigated rice will be about 9 to 13 × 106 t N, 9 to 15 × 106 t K, 1.2 to 2.4 × 106 t P and 0.9 to 1.5 × 106 t S in 2025, amounts that represent an increase of 65 to 70% above 1990 requirements. At present, negative K balances are widespread and K deficiency has become a constraint to increasing yields, even on heavy-textured lowland soils with high inherent fertility. Because opportunities are limited for breeding cultivars that acquire more P, K or S from soil or have higher internal nutrient-use efficiencies, long-term management strategies must focus on maintaining adequate nutrient balances in the topsoil layer. Interactions among nutrients have a large influence on physiological and agronomic efficiency that result from nutrient applications. Strategies that only aim at increasing P or K application rates without considering the indigenous supply from soil reserves are inefficient; they may not sustain yield increases to meet rice demand. Little improvement in fertilizer use efficiency can be expected from the present system of providing blanket recommendations for a given production domain. Instead, site-specific nutrient-management approaches will be needed to accommodate the tremendous variability in indigenous nutrient supply found in the irrigated lowlands of Asia. "

This paper tests the hypothesis that farmers' perceptions of technology characteristics significantly affect their adoption decisions. The analysis, conducted with Tobit models of modern sorghum and rice varietal technologies in Burkina Faso and Guinea, respectively, strongly supports this hypothesis.

For this purpose, we used farm-level survey data collected for eleven cropping seasons in Central Luzon in the Philippines from 1966 to 1990. We found that while the yield advantage of first-generation \{MVs\} over traditional varieties was limited, the yield-increasing effect of second-generation \{MVs\} over first-generation \{MVs\} was highly significant.

If the key factors contributing to the high yield of these varieties are understood, rapid advancements can be made in developing aerobic rice varieties for water-scarce environments in other parts of Asia. In 2001–2002, we conducted experiments with aerobic varieties \{HD502\} and \{HD297\} and lowland variety \{JD305\} under aerobic and flooded conditions. Five irrigation treatments were implemented in aerobic soil to create different soil moisture regimes. Under flooded conditions, all three varieties had comparable radiation use (RUE) efficiencies of 2.09–2.26 g dry matter (DM) MJ−1 in 2001 and 2.40–2.53 g \{DM\} MJ−1 in 2002, and harvest indices (HI) of 0.38–0.40 in both years. Differences in yield among the varieties are explained by differences in growth duration. Under aerobic conditions, mean \{RUE\} over water treatments dropped to 1.70–1.72 g \{DM\} MJ−1 for all three varieties in 2001, and to 1.62 for HD502, 1.71 for \{HD297\} and 1.86 for \{JD305\} in 2002. With increasing dryness of the soil, the amount of intercepted light decreased at about the same rate for all varieties, but \{RUE\} decreased faster in the lowland than in the two aerobic varieties. The \{HI\} of \{JD305\} decreased dramatically with increasing soil dryness and reached values of 0.19–0.21 in 2002. In contrast, the \{HI\} of both aerobic varieties remained relatively high under aerobic conditions, with lowest values of 0.27–0.28 for \{HD297\} and 0.34–0.35 for \{HD502\} in 2002. The relatively high \{HI\} of the aerobic varieties compensated for their relatively short growth duration so that their yields were higher than that of \{JD305\} in all treatments. A high percentage filled grains is a key factor contributing to the high \{HI\} of the aerobic varieties under aerobic conditions. "

We performed detailed plant water status measurements on a subset of lines having similar crop growth duration but contrasting genotypes at qtl12.1 under field (24 genotypes) and greenhouse (14 genotypes) conditions. The Way Rarem-derived allele of qtl12.1 was confirmed to improve grain yield under drought mainly through a slight improvement (7%) in plant water uptake under water-limited conditions. Such an apparently small increase in water uptake associated with this allele could explain the large effect on yield observed under field conditions.

The field micro-plot experiment showed that micronutrients had insignificant effect on plant growth under continuous aerobic rice cultivation but the combination of N, P, and K mitigated the yield decline of continuous aerobic rice. A series of pot experiments studying the individual effects of nutrients indicated that N application improved plant growth under continuous aerobic rice cropping, while P, K, and micronutrients had no effect. Increasing the rate of N application from 0.23 to 0.90 g per pot in the continuous aerobic rice soil increased the vegetative growth parameters, chlorophyll meter readings, and aboveground N uptake consistently. Our results suggested that N deficiency due to poor soil N availability or reduced plant N uptake might cause the yield decline of continuous cropping of aerobic rice. "

This chapter discusses the ingredients needed for the large-scale gene discovery and the approaches that will benefit the improvement of traits needed in rice production. It highlights the importance of producing public resources and the need for international collaboration, and how gene discovery can be integrated into plant improvement programs. Rice is special because of its botanical history and biological attributes. The completion of the rice genome sequence is a major milestone in plant science; however, for the sequence information to be useful, it must be converted into a format that allows investigation with a variety of genetic materials. Functional genomics concerns the development of a resource platform by which the function of every gene and its interaction with other genes can be characterized and understood in an efficient manner. Developing countries have a unique role to play in rice functional genomics because they are rich in genetic resources and agronomic knowledge of the rice crop. "

This body of evidence is subjected to a systematic, quantitative scrutiny for the coverage and type of impact to derive patterns, gaps and trends in documented impacts of research in the subregion. The analysis offers compelling evidence that past investments in agricultural research in the region have been productive. In so doing, the study also reveals some persistent patterns and identifies a number of gaps between investments and documented impacts. Strikingly, the benefits are principally derived from rice improvement research, which has generated 86% of total documented benefits in the Southeast Asia region over the past five decades. In comparison with rice improvement research, evidence of impacts in other areas such as natural resource management and other commodities is minor. This suggests that there is considerably more certainty about the ability of rice research, particularly genetic improvement, to generate impact than is the case for other research foci. However, even for rice, the evidence has been patchy across time and space. There has been no comprehensive and subregion-wide attempt to inventory trends in adoption of improved rice varieties and document historical net benefits generated by this research effort. Despite the large-scale, long-term and sustained adoption of research generated rice technologies for smallholder farmers in this subregion, an impressive story on the impacts of agricultural research on long-term developmental goals still remains undocumented. The paper also reveals a declining trend in total documented net benefits from agricultural research in recent years, which is probably attributable to research lag times and changes in the intensity of impact assessment over time.

However, several studies carried out in the \{NW\} \{IGP\} have shown rice grain yields to decrease with the increasing age of the beds. The present study was conducted on a deep alluvial loam (Ustochrept) in a farmer's field at Phillaur, Punjab, India, to identify possible reasons for the declining grain yield of rice on the permanent raised beds (37.5 cm wide alternating with 30 cm wide furrows 15 cm deep) in comparison to fresh raised beds. The beds were formed with a bed planter drawn by a 35-hp 4-wheel tractor, which was also used to direct drill wheat on the permanent beds each year, and to reshape the beds prior to each rice crop. This paper reports a study of rice root distribution and mass at the end of the vegetative stage, and soil bulk density after harvest, for transplanted rice on permanent beds (4th rice crop, 8th crop) in comparison with transplanted rice on fresh beds (1st crop). Rice grain yield declined linearly with increasing age of the permanent beds. It decreased by 19% in 2004, 45% in 2005 and 59% in 2006 from 4.64 t ha−1 in 2003. In situ exposure of root profiles on permanent and fresh beds revealed that the horizontal spread of roots on permanent beds (6 cm from the base of the plant at 18 cm depth and 12 cm at 27 cm depth) was much less than on fresh beds (12 cm at 18 cm depth and 18 cm at 27 cm depth). The root mass density in at 0–15 cm the middle of the fresh beds was 59% higher than on the permanent beds. Bulk density was significantly higher under the shoulder and side of the permanent beds to the depth of sampling (0–15 cm) than under the fresh beds at the same positions across the furrow. The decline in performance of rice on beds as the beds aged was at least partly due to compaction of the permanent beds by the tractor tyres, which had width similar to that of the top of the furrow. This hindered the spread of the roots particularly towards the beds. "

The presence of \{O2\} in the floodwater was critical for the survival of 14-day-old seedlings: there was no effect of 4 d submergence in air-saturated water (0.24 mol· m-3 · O2), or floodwater containing \{O2\} concentrations down to 0.05 mol · m-3, whereas when seedlings were exposed to an «anoxic shock» (0.00 mol · m-3 · O2), death of all four cultivars occured within 24–42 h. Prior exposure of seedlings to a hypoxic pre-treatment (submergence with 0.05 mol · m-3 · \{O2\} for 24 h) greatly improved the tolerance to 24 h anoxia in all four cultivars. Two submergence tolerant cultivars (IR49830 and FR13A) showed much greater tolerance to anoxia than two intolerant cultivars (IR36 and IR42). Following the hypoxic pre-treatment, only the two tolerant cultivars could tolerate 42 h anoxia, and \{IR49830\} seedlings could withstand up to 3d of submergence in anoxia. The two enzymes of ethanolic fermentation alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH, \{EC\} 1.1.1.1) and pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC, \{EC\} 4.1.1.1) were induced by the hypoxic pre-treatment. The activity of \{ADH\} was correlated to cultivar differences in anoxia tolerance. However, this enzyme is unlikely to limit the rate of ethanol fermentation since its in vitro activity was two orders of magnitude greater than the observed ethanolic fermentation rates. The in vitro activity of \{PDC\} was an order of magnitude lower than that of ADH, and showed a clear correlation with ethanol fermentation rates but was not correlated with anoxia tolerance. Our results suggest that the complete absence of oxygen in floodwater will have a major adverse effect on rice plants during submergence, and that the rice plant’s ability to adapt to anoxic conditions is an important component of submergence tolerance. These findings are discussed in relation to metabolic adaptations to alleviate the adverse effects of anoxia during submergence. "

We computed the distribution of 20 soil constraints, and used these to categorize soils as ‘good’, ‘poor’, ‘very poor’, or ‘problem soil’ for rice production. These data were then combined with data of global rice distribution to determine soil quality in the main rice production systems around the world. Most rice is grown in Asia (143.4 million ha), followed by Africa (10.5 million ha) and the Americas (7.2 million ha). Globally, one-third of the total rice area is grown on very poor soils, which includes 25.6 million ha of irrigated rice land, 18.5 million ha in rainfed lowlands, and 7.5 million ha of upland rice. At least 8.3 million ha of rice is grown on problem soils, including saline, alkaline/sodic, acid-sulfate, and organic soils. Asia has the largest percentage of rice on good soils (47%) whereas rice production on good soils is much less common in the Americas (28%) and accounts for only 18% in Africa. The most common soil chemical problems in rice fields are very low inherent nutrient status (35.8 million ha), very low pH (27.1 million ha), and high P fixation (8.1 million ha); widespread soil physical problems especially severe in rainfed environments are very shallow soils and low water-holding capacity. The results of the analysis can be used to better target crop improvement research, plant breeding, and the dissemination of stress-specific tolerant varieties and soil management technologies. "

To assess the current soil fertility status in irrigated riceland of Nueva Ecija, Philippines, soil samples were collected from 384 farmers' fields in a 19,176 ha area. Block-kriged maps of topsoil properties (0–20 cm depth) were produced. Yields and nutrient uptake were measured for a subset of 63 farmers during the 1994 dry and wet seasons. Logical Boolean and fuzzy membership models for land classification with or without Monte Carlo simulation were compared. Crisp Boolean classification underestimated the potential area with severe soil fertility constraints to high rice yields by 0.2–5.2%. A combination of fuzzy membership functions with Monte Carlo simulation was used to produce maps of membership values for three soil fertility classes and two multivariate soil fertility qualities. Most of the area investigated had a high inherent fertility potential and was rated suitable for intensive rice production, but 97% of the land had limitations due to low soil status of one or more nutrients. Low available K, P, and Zn occurred on 54%, 64% and 63% of the land, respectively, whereas low S status was only found in minor areas. The average P balance in farmers' fields was positive, but both under- and overfertilization with P occurred. Long-term irrigated rice-rice monoculture has led to a significant depletion of soil K reserves in soils of Nueva Ecija. Although K uptake was larger than N uptake in both seasons, most farmers applied little or no K fertilizer. Average net K loss was 38 kg K ha−1 crop−1 and K is now one of the most important constraints to sustaining and increasing rice yields. "

Evidence of both interjurisdictional and intrajurisdictional capitalization of property taxes and public services has been argued to provide compelling evidence for the benefit tax view. This paper focuses on the latter — the intra-jurisdictional capitalization effects that underlie what is arguably the most plausible derivation of the benefit tax view of the property tax. The analysis provides a model in which the capital reallocations that characterize the capital tax view induce intrajurisdictional capitalization effects that are generally similar — indeed, in the benchmark case, identical — to those that arise under the benefit tax view, suggesting that empirical evidence supporting such capitalization effects cannot distinguish between the two views. In addition, the analysis shows that these capitalization effects imply that even under the stringent assumptions of the benefit view, the property tax is not a benefit tax for a property-tax-financed increase in local public services; rather, it only becomes a benefit tax for future home purchasers — after the modeled intrajurisdictional capitalization effects occur.

This study, carried out using Baguio gold district (Philippines), examines (a) the sensitivity of the \{RF\} algorithm to different sets of deposit and non-deposit locations as training data and (b) the performance of \{RF\} modeling compared to established methods for data-driven predictive mapping of mineral prospectivity. We found that \{RF\} modeling with different training sets of deposit/non-deposit locations is stable and reproducible, and it accurately captures the spatial relationships between the predictor variables and the training deposit/non-deposit locations. For data-driven predictive mapping of epithermal Au prospectivity in the Baguio district, we found that (a) the success-rates of \{RF\} modeling are superior to those of weights-of-evidence, evidential belief and logistic regression modeling and (b) the prediction-rate of \{RF\} modeling is superior to that of weights-of-evidence modeling but approximately equal to those of evidential belief and logistic regression modeling. Therefore, the \{RF\} algorithm is potentially much more useful than existing methods that are currently used for data-driven predictive mapping of mineral prospectivity. However, further testing of the method in other areas is needed to fully explore its usefulness in data-driven predictive mapping of mineral prospectivity. "

abstract = "Abstract The irrigated rice–wheat (RW) systems of north-west India are critical for food security. However, these systems are not sustainable due to over-exploitation of the groundwater resource on which they largely rely. Current farmer practice (FP) involves manual transplanting of rice into heavily tilled/puddled soil from 10 June to early July, prolonged periods of flooding, rice residue burning, and heavy tillage prior to sowing wheat. Inclusion of a short duration mungbean crop between wheat harvest and rice transplanting has also been promoted at times. Options for reducing irrigation input to the \{RW\} system include delaying transplanting until after the monsoon rains start (late June), switching to shorter duration rice varieties, and alternate wetting drying (AWD) water management for rice. However, the effect of such practices on groundwater depletion is not well-understood. Examining the effects of these options on cropping system yield and components of the water balance and water productivity is highly complex because of the need to consider the interactions between each crop in the system. Therefore, we used a cropping system model (APSIM) to compare the performance of \{RW\} systems with a range of rice transplanting dates (4 dates from 10 June to 10 August) and rice variety durations (long – 158 d, medium – 144 d, short – 125 d), with and without mungbean in the system. The results suggest that changing from long to short duration varieties would reduce \{ET\} by around 250 mm, more than enough to halt the groundwater decline, but with a reduction in rice-equivalent system yield of about 2.5 t ha−1 compared with current FP. On the other hand, inclusion of mungbean into the \{RW\} system results in much higher system yield than recommended farmer practice (by over 3 t ha−1), but the tradeoffs are much higher \{ET\} (by 250–300 mm) and irrigation requirement (by 300–450 mm). The results of this study suggest that more effort should be directed towards the development of higher-yielding, short duration rice varieties to reduce groundwater depletion of the \{RW\} system while maintaining yield, and that inclusion of short duration summer crops such as mungbean should not be recommended.

abstract = "Abstract The irrigated rice–wheat system of north west India is not sustainable, as currently practised, due to over-exploitation of groundwater, soil degradation, labour scarcity, high fuel and labour costs, and air pollution from stubble burning. Labour and water scarcity are driving farmers to change from puddling and manual transplanting of rice to mechanised dry seeding. The introduction of dry seeding to the rice–wheat system brings with it the potential to adopt conservation agriculture (CA), with reduced or zero tillage for all crops, and surface residue retention. This would further reduce fuel and labour costs for crop establishment, and air pollution, and also bring benefits for soil structure and nutrient cycling. However, whether conversion to \{CA\} rice–wheat systems would help solve the problem of groundwater depletion is less well-understood. In this region, evapotranspiration (ET) must be reduced to reduce groundwater depletion. We used the \{APSIM\} cropping system model to examine whether conversion from recommended farmer practice (rFP, comprising puddled transplanted rice, alternate wetting and drying rice water management, rice straw removal, tillage for wheat) to a \{CA\} rice–wheat system would reduce \{ET\} in Punjab, north west India. We also used the model to identify the optimum system management taking into account effects on total cropping system rice equivalent yield (REY), components of the water balance and water productivity. Maximum \{REY\} (mean 14.6 t ha−1) occurred in systems with 5 June sowing of a popular long duration rice variety, with similar yield for rFP and CA. Irrigation input with \{CA\} was much lower (by 390 mm) than with rFP, resulting in slightly higher irrigation water productivity (increased from 11.3 to 11.7 kg ha−1 mm−1). However, changing to \{CA\} only reduced \{ET\} of the highest yielding system by 4% (55 mm), and of other current practices (late May and early June sowing of medium and long duration varieties) by less than this. The only way to achieve a substantial reduction in \{ET\} was by growing short duration rice varieties in both the rFP and \{CA\} systems. However, with current short duration varieties, this came at the cost of both rice and system yields (system yield reduced by an average of about 1.8 t ha−1). This could be overcome by intensification to 3 crops per year in a \{CA\} rice–wheat–mung system (with short duration rice varieties), while still providing a substantial but smaller decrease in ET. This system also had considerable flexibility in rice sowing date, with similar system yields for sowings from 5 June to 15 July. These findings suggest that greater effort to increase the yield potential of short duration rice varieties is warranted. Field experimentation is needed to test the improved systems as suggested by the model simulations, particularly in terms of cropping system yield and ET, and alternatives to rice and wheat should also be evaluated. At the same time, spatial hydrological studies are needed to determine the sustainable level of \{ET\} from cropping systems that will allow matching of groundwater depletion and recharge. "

abstract = "Abstract The important contribution of rice to global food security requires an understanding of yield gaps in rice-based farming systems. However, estimates of yield gaps are often compromised by a failure to recognize the components that determine them at a local scale. It is essential to define yield gaps by the biological limitations of the genotype and the environment. There exist a number of methods for estimating rice yield gaps, including the use of crop growth simulation models, field experiments and farmer yields. We reviewed the existing literature to (i) assess the methods used to estimate rice yield gaps at a local scale and to summarize the yield gaps estimated in those studies, (ii) identify practical methods of analysis that provides realistic estimates of exploitable rice yield gaps, and (iii) provide recommendations for future studies on rice yield gaps that will allow accurate interpretation of available data at a local level. Rice yield gap analysis can be simplified without sacrificing precision and context specificity. This review identifies the comparison of the attainable farm yield (the mean of the top decile) with the population mean, as a practical and robust approach to estimate an exploitable yield gap that is highly relevant at the local level, taking into account what is achievable given the local socio-economic conditions. With this method we identified exploitable yield gaps ranging from 23 to 42% for one particular season in four different rice growing areas in Southeast Asia. To enable accurate estimation and interpretation of yield gaps in rice production systems, we propose a minimum dataset needed for rice yield gap assessment. Future studies on rice yield gaps should consider the region, season and crop ecosystem (e.g. upland rainfed, lowland irrigated) as a minimum to facilitate decisions at a local level. In addition, we recommend taking into account the cultivar, soil type, planting date, crop establishment method and nitrogen application rates, as well as field topography and toposequence for rainfed systems. A good understanding of rice yield gaps and the factors leading to yield gaps will allow better targeting of agricultural research and development priorities for livelihood improvement and sustainable rice production.

Multinomial logit (MNL) regression results indicate that, compared to men farmers, women farmers have much lower adoption of \{DT\} maize, mainly due to differences in resource access, notably land, agricultural information, and credit. Differentiation of women and men farmers by various characteristics reveals that whether a male farmer was younger or older, or poor or non-poor has no significant influence on \{DT\} maize adoption; but important differences among different categories of women farmers are identified. For example, the farmer group found least likely to adopt \{DT\} maize is young, poor women household heads. \{MNL\} results also show that wives strongly influence adoption of \{DT\} maize on plots controlled by their husbands.

Straw needs to be gathered from the field and compressed into bales to make it compact and easy to transport. With the introduction of combine harvesters, the collection of rice straw has become harder and more costly. This created negative impacts on other businesses that use rice straw. Mechanization of rice straw collection was introduced in Vietnam in 2013 and it has rapidly developed since. Most of the rice straw produced in the dry season in the Mekong River Delta (MD) of Vietnam is collected for mushroom and for livestock fodder production or for use as mulching materials. In order to quantify the performance of the mechanical operation of rice straw collection, this study conducted an analysis of energy efficiency, greenhouse gas emission (GHGE), and cost of rice straw collection in the \{MD\} for five collection machines that operated on the same field, the same rice variety, and the same harvest time under a demonstration in the MD. With rice straw yield of 4.72 t per ha, the collection machines operated at a capacity of 0.87–2.47 t per hour. This mechanized operation can reduce labor requirement by 90%. Specific weight of baled straw was from 73 to 104 kg per cubic meter, which is heavier by 50–100% than that of loose-form straw, at a moisture content of 12.4 (±1.21)% in wet basis. Total energy consumption, ranging from 351 to 588 \{MJ\} per ton of straw collected, accounted for 10–17% of the total energy input using this collected straw for biogas production. Energy consumption from fossil fuels results in \{GHGE\} of 60–165 kg \{CO2\} equivalent per ton of collected straw. The cost of straw collection, which ranged from US$12 to US$18 per ton of straw in the MD, accounted for 10–20% of the total investment cost of biogas or mushroom production. This study illustrated the feasibility of the mechanization of rice straw collection for further processing. Despite the \{GHGE\} of this may cause through the consumption of fossil fuels, mechanized rice straw collection creates more benefits such as avoiding in-field burning, producing feedstock for further sustainable processing, and adding value to rice production.

However, yield penalties generally accompany this evolution and ongoing research targets their mitigation. In a previous research, slower plant development rate was observed in aerobic crops, possibly caused by the increased plant density. This possible factor was tested in experiments conducted at IRRI’s farm, Los Baños, Philippines, in 2012 and 2013. One elite variety was direct-seeded at three plant distances (6, 10, and 20 cm × 20 cm) and sprinkler-irrigated to keep the soil water potential above −10 kPa. Weekly measurements were made to dissect crop and plant physiological differences. Data from previous experiments on tillering in the greenhouse of four varieties and in fields in aerobic and flooded conditions were added to strengthen the results from the current experiment. The last upper leaves of the main stem appeared faster at higher plant density, thus increase plant density was not the cause for the slower leaf appearance in aerobic than in flooded crops. Plants at higher plant density also had earlier panicle initiation, earlier earing, and 0.8 leaf less than plants at low density. The number of outgrowing tillers was linked to the number of leaves on the main stem by a variety-specific relationship that is independent from plant density and water management. Tiller density was regulated by the cessation of the outgrowth of tillers triggered by the onset of stem elongation at 20-cm plant distance and occurred earlier at shorter distances probably in response to the high root density. Grain yields were significantly higher at higher plant density (6-cm and 10-cm plant distances) and correlated with a higher tiller density. Thus for aerobic crops, seedling density higher than 50 plants m−2 remains the way to get high yields for the type of variety used in this study. "

A series of field experiments using the same research protocol was carried out to compare the effects of main environmental factors on population development of \{WBPH\} in tropical (Philippines) and subtropical (China) areas in 2010–2012 and to provide further evidences of ecological mechanisms involved that cause frequent outbreak in subtropical rice. Outcomes showed that \{WBPH\} population in subtropical area could be characterized as the higher population growth rates and higher peak densities. The average growth rate (116.60 ± 46.16) in subtropical area was significantly higher than that in tropical area (24.02 ± 11.25). The higher realized fecundity in subtropical area indicated that the higher growth rates and higher peak densities were mainly related to the poor natural regulating forces in subtropical area. Our results showed that resistant variety could significantly reduce the peak density in subtropical areas, but not in tropical areas. We inferred that the reason for not detecting the effect of resistant variety in tropical area was due to the dominant controlling effects provided by natural enemies, which means that the natural regulating effect in tropical area was strong enough to disguise the effects of resistant variety. The significant interactions between plant resistance and location demonstrated that integration of natural enemies and use of plant resistance could play important roles for reducing outbreak frequency of \{WBPH\} effectively in subtropical rice.

Any crop science experiment that measures key physiological processes, tests these productive processes, their interaction with other processes, environment, and intra- and inter-specific variation, is valuable to inform and refine crop simulation models. This paper focuses on crop science experiments in three key areas—crop development, seed or fruit-set at high temperature, and water use—illustrating some of the experiments used to understand key processes and, equally importantly, quantify these processes for crop models in a robust and repeatable manner. One particularly useful experimental method for determining stages of development responsive to photoperiod and temperature (the main drivers of ontogenic development), and sensitive to abiotic stresses such as temperature extremes and water deficit, is transfer experiments between different environments or treatments. Once sensitive stages are defined, then responses and genotypic differences can be accurately quantified. Understanding and modeling transpiration, and particularly genotypic differences in processes affecting transpiration is also key process for crop modeling. Experiments to determine genotypic differences in soil water availability thresholds that control when transpiration is reduced, relations between transpiration and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and patterns of soil water uptake are also described along with new insights from this work. One of the biggest constraints to improving models with crop science experiments—and exploiting advances in genomics—is the limited capacity to phenotype traits and physiological mechanisms. Most crop science experiments have quantified responses in only a limited number of genotypes and the diversity of genotypic responses is not well represented. Today there is an increased demand for good quality phenotyping which can serve both genomics and modeling, and there is an urgent need to re-invest in crop physiology for high quality phenotyping.

In a series of field experiments, we evaluated the agronomic performance of an \{IR64\} introgression line, \{YTH323\} (IR84640-11-27-1-9-3-2-4-2-2-2-B), with fewer tillers and larger leaves than IR64, derived from New Plant Type rice, under various water and nitrogen conditions. In flooded culture, \{YTH323\} yielded the same as \{IR64\} and 38% more than IR65564-44-51 (a New Plant Type rice) (9.0 vs. 6.6 t ha−1). In aerobic culture, in contrast, it yielded 81% more than \{IR64\} in slightly dry soils (5.1 vs. 2.8 t ha−1). \{YTH323\} had a higher leaf area index than \{IR64\} and IR65564-44-51 under slightly dry soil conditions and under a range of nitrogen conditions. The higher and more stable yield of \{YTH323\} in aerobic culture was attributable to greater early vigor, high specific leaf area, a high ratio of leaf weight to total biomass, and larger leaves, along with the characteristics of high-yield cultivars such as high responsiveness to fertilizers and good grain filling. We conclude that genetic modification of the aboveground architecture of IR64, a typical tropical lowland rice cultivar, to reduce tiller and leaf number improves adaptation to aerobic culture. "

In the field, we measured the above-ground architecture, carbohydrate partitioning, and consumption of non-structural carbohydrates by \{IR64\} (indica rice), a New Plant Type line (tropical japonica rice) and an \{IR64\} introgression line (IL) with large leaves and reduced tillering under fully irrigated and drought + rewatered conditions. In an ancillary pot experiment, we monitored changes in tiller number and leaf growth under fully irrigated, droughted and drought + rewatered conditions. There were genotypic differences in recovery growth patterns upon rewatering after drought: the New Plant Type lines prioritized individual tiller growth, while \{IR64\} and the \{IR64\} \{IL\} prioritized the production of new tillers and concomitantly consumed much carbohydrate. The increase in tiller number during the recovery period was lower in the \{IR64\} \{IL\} than in \{IR64\} owing to the longer phyllochron and larger amount of assimilate required to produce new tillers in the IL. Rice development during the recovery period depends on the plant type (constitutive tiller number to size ratio) and tillering response to soil moisture regime, which would be mediated mainly by phyllochron and tiller production per assimilate. Rapid increase in tiller number upon rewatering in \{IR64\} was associated with the low amount of assimilate required to produce new tillers rather than with the short phyllochron. "

Altruistic and cooperative behaviors are significantly influenced by the behaviors of neighbors only in the irrigated area, where social ties are strengthened through collective irrigation management. Through this effect, irrigated farmers’ social behaviors become similar to those of one another. Neighborhood effects for cooperative behavior are stronger among farm plot neighbors than among residential neighbors, which may reflect their interactions in irrigation management.

It is important to determine the spatial extent of the stress-prone areas to effectively and efficiently promote proper technologies (e.g., stress-tolerant varieties) to tackle the problem of sustainable food production. This study was conducted in Odisha state located in eastern India. Odisha is predominantly a rainfed rice ecosystem (71% rainfed and 29% canal irrigated during kharif-monsoon season), where rice is the major crop and staple food of the people. However, rice productivity in Odisha is one of the lowest in India and a significant decline (9%) in rice cultivated area was observed in 2002 (a drought year). The present study analyzed the temporal rice cropping pattern in various ecosystems and identified the stress-prone areas due to submergence (flooding) and water shortage. The spatial distribution of rice areas was mapped using \{MODIS\} (MOD09Q1) 250-m 8-day time-series data (2000–2010) and spectral matching techniques. The mapped rice areas were strongly correlated (R2 = 90%) with district-level statistics. Also the class accuracy based on field-plot data was 84.8%. The area under the rainfed rice ecosystem continues to dominate, recording the largest share among rice classes across all the years. The use of remote-sensing techniques is rapid, cost-effective, and reliable to monitor changes in rice cultivated area over long periods of time and estimate the reduction in area cultivated due to abiotic stress such as water stress and submergence. Agricultural research institutes and line departments in the government can use these techniques for better planning, regular monitoring of land-use changes, and dissemination of appropriate technologies.

abstract = "Abstract Habitat management needs comprehensive perspectives, considering multiple ecosystem services at local and landscape scales. Stakeholder involvement with participatory research and development programmes for farmers is an essential part of it. Currently, ecological engineering by habitat management and participatory programmes and mass media campaigns are developed to counteract the adverse effects of ongoing intensification of rice production in Southeast Asia. These schemes often suggest the establishment of flower strips. Flower strips are a common measure to promote biodiversity and ecosystem service conservation in industrialised countries, since they aesthetically enrich production landscapes and provide supplementary food resources and shelter for natural enemies and pollinators. We review management options for biological pest control, pollination and cultural services in rice production landscapes and evaluate the parallel development of participatory programmes and mass media campaigns for sustainable rice production. Biological pest control, pollination services and landscape aesthetics could benefit from the establishment of flower strips in rice production landscapes. However, more experimental studies are needed to test the benefits of different plant species, potential interactions between local and landscape scale and interactions between different ecosystem services. Rice farmers should better appreciate their benefits from regulating ecosystem services and should be involved in the development and implementation of ecological engineering. Mass media campaigns and participatory programmes can motivate farmers, but their efficiency needs to be tested in different regions. Combining participatory approaches and mass media campaigns with the establishment of flower strips and other beneficial habitats has potential to increase the sustainability of rice production in Asia.

The framework is set by three cardinal temperatures, namely the base (Tb), the optimum (To) and the ceiling (Tc) temperature. The model parameters Tb and Tc and three other coefficients μ, α and β can be used to derive the value of To and the maximum development rate. Parameter α also characterizes the curvature of the relationship with temperatures between Tb and To, and parameter β describes the curvature between To and Tc. The model has one parameter less than the Rice Clock Model (RCM); and in contrast to the RCM, it ensures that the maximum development rate occurs exactly at To. The model accurately described the response to temperature of several developmental processes, and was superior to two widely used thermal time approaches in predicting rice flowering time. "

abstract = "In northeast Thailand, the sustainability of rainfed lowland rice-based systems, the dominant land-use system (LUS) in the region, is a concern for the welfare of the population in this relatively poor region. Poor soil fertility and low inputs are seen as major causes of this lack of sustainability. In this context, the assessment of nutrient budgets is seen as a powerful tool for the assessment of critical components of the sustainability of this particular LUS. Biophysical, socioeconomic, and management-related data on the farming systems were collected for 30 farms in Ubon Ratchathani Province, northeast Thailand. A relational database system (RDBS) was developed to manage and analyze the data. The \{RDBS\} includes a calculation procedure for the semi-automatic generation of partial nutrient balances. Partial nutrient balances are good indicators for some critical components of sustainability, and important for decision support on soil fertility management when considered with the additional factors that are required for a full nutrient balance. For the rice-based systems of 30 farms, mean partial balances were 12 kg N ha−1, 8 kg P ha−1, and 7 kg K ha−1 per year. Large variations in partial N, P, and K balances exist among different farms and, even more so, for different land utilization types (LUTs). The \{LUTs\} are distinct cropping system–management combinations that occur down to the subfield level. Many of the partial balances assessed were negative. Farmers manage nutrients for similar parcels of land in very different ways. This results in the observed large variation in partial nutrient balances, even for the same type of land use within the same farm. These results confirm the high inter-farm and intra-farm variability for partial balances of N, P, and K of several preliminary studies. Farmer interviews and field surveys revealed that different socioeconomic factors appear to be related with inter- and intra-farm variability in nutrient budgets. In addition, the socioeconomic component of the case study revealed that diversification of income sources, particularly off-farm employment, had a larger impact on household income than rice production. Furthermore, while many less well-off households had a greater reliance on rice production, many farms with high off-farm and non-rice farm income had a higher total production of rice. The nutrient balance approach, starting with partial nutrient balances, may become an important component of a dynamic and site-specific decision support tool (DST) for nutrient management, and a relational database of the form used in this study may become a key element.

The hypothesis investigated here is that spikelet sterility under pre-anthesis drought is triggered by deficient plant water status that inhibits peduncle elongation, panicle exsertion and anther dehiscence. A set of 45 rice genotypes was grown in an upland field under well-watered and drought-stressed conditions. Irrigation was applied using a drip irrigation system, and the drought stress treatment was initiated differentially for each genotype at 10–15 days before heading. Drought stress substantially reduced grain yield, and the average yield in the drought treatment was only 20% of that of the control. Peduncle elongation rate (PER) was significantly inhibited by drought, simultaneously with the decrease of plant water status parameters. Yield was highly associated with spikelet fertility (r = 0.74***), \{PER\} (r = 0.47***), leaf water potential (LWP) (r = −0.4**), and peduncle water potential (PWP) (r = −0.38**). The sensitivity of anther dehiscence to drought stress, as determined by the anatomic structure of anther walls, did not differ among genotypes. Path analysis revealed that spikelet fertility and \{PER\} had a major positive effect on yield, while peduncle length and \{LWP\} had negative effects. \{PWP\} had a small direct effect, but had a high negative indirect effect on yield through spikelet fertility reduction. \{PER\} had a high and positive indirect effect on yield under drought through spikelet fertility. It is concluded that \{PER\} is key parameter that affects rice yield through the regulation of spikelet fertility by plant water status under drought. "

Experience with the use of this methodology in developing a dryland rice-based cropping systems test site in the Philippines is discussed. The potential for increased crop productivity in the major dryland rice-producing region of eastern Batangas province, where the predominant cropping pattern involves dryland rice followed by field corn, was studied by testing the impact of these cropping pattern alternatives: following rice with field crops other than the local Orange flint corn, an intercrop pattern, and a three-crop-per-year pattern. Cooperating farmers applied the alternative patterns on 1000 m2 plots adjacent to their rice-corn plots. Some patterns showed yield instability and poor pest resistance. None had any adverse effect on the yield of the next rice crop when compared with the traditional pattern. The research opened several directions in which dryland rice-based patterns may be improved. A shift to an improved corn variety showed promise as an effective means of increasing pattern productivity. Soybeans and sorghum were the outstanding alternative crops to follow rice. Intercrops with corn were productive, but may fit only if labour requirements are not excessive and labour productivity is fairly high. "

The efficiency of different \{QTL\} mapping approaches in identifying major-effect grain-yield \{QTLs\} under drought in rice was compared using phenotypic and genotypic data of two recombinant inbred line populations, Basmati334/Swarna and N22/MTU1010. All three genotyping approaches were efficient in identifying consistent-effect \{QTLs\} with an additive effect of 10% or more. Comparative analysis revealed that \{SG\} and \{BSA\} required 63.5% and 92.1% fewer data points, respectively, than \{WPG\} in the N22/MTU1010 F3:4 mapping population. The \{BSA\} approach successfully detected consistent-effect drought grain-yield \{QTLs\} qDTY1.1 and qDTY8.1 detected by \{WPG\} and SG. Unlike SG, \{BSA\} did not lead to an upward estimation of the additive effect and phenotypic variance. The results clearly demonstrate that \{BSA\} is the most efficient and effort saving genotyping approach for identifying major grain yield \{QTLs\} under drought. "

A percolation rate of 40 mm d−1 showed higher Kt, Dt and D than zero percolation. The values of Kt, Dt and D were highest with 50 mm and lowest with 10 mm flood- water depth. The Cv did not change with different flood-water depths or percolation rates. Consequently, puddling, 40 mm d−1 percolation and 50–100 mm submergence kept the maximum temperature of surface 100–150 mm soil at relatively low level under tropical conditions. These treatments also buffered soil against extreme diurnal temperature fluctuations. The time lag between maximum solar radiation and maximum temperature of submerged soil varied, on an average, between 1.2 hours at soil surface and 11.6 hours at 300 mm soil depth; which is more than that in an upland soil.

The fields studied were originally uncultivated and had been reclaimed 2 months, and 1 and 2 years prior to the initiation of the study.

The mean monthly aluminum concentration in the leachate from pineapple and yam raised beds was about three times greater than that from rice fields. The monthly total amount of aluminum released by the upland raised beds could be as high as 16 690 mol ha−1, and was three to five times greater than that from rice fields. Consolidation and crust forming in pineapple raised beds reduced the concentration and amount of aluminum released with respect to the age of the raised beds. Pollution from \{ASS\} leaching was probably greatest in June due to a combination of the highest total amount of aluminum released to the canal network and low river discharge. Environmental hazards make it imperative to plan carefully the reclamation of ASS, such that the toxicity carrying capacity of the surface water is not exceeded. "

Under moderately acid conditions, the soluble aluminum concentration after \{H3\} was not significantly different from after H1, but it was significantly lower after \{F3\} compared with F1. In severe ASS, \{H3\} combined with \{F3\} gave a significantly lower soluble aluminum concentration compared with F3H1. In addition to soluble Al, Al at the exchange complex was also investigated. The combinations of flushing and harrowing did not significantly change Al at the exchange complex. The \{F3H3\} treatment resulted in a significantly greater rice yield compared with other treatments (F3H1, \{F1H3\} and F1H1).

The cultivars of rice and wheat responded to irrigation and to N, with greater response to irrigation in rice, but to N in wheat. Delayed wheat seeding reduced wheat yields in all years. Agronomic N-use efficiency (kg grain yield per kg N applied), physiological efficiency (kg grain yield per kg N absorbed), and fertilizer N-recovery efficiency (kg N absorbed per kg N applied, expressed as %) for rice across treatments ranged from 2.8 to 10.8, 5.2 to 27.5, and 33 to 61, respectively, and all were greater for N application at 90 compared with 135 kg N ha−1.

The higher catena member is moderately Zn deficient, the lower member extremely Zn deficient. Soil analysis reveals Tiaong soil to be slightly alkaline, smectitic, strongly humic, of high \{CEC\} and base saturation, of low plant available Zn (Bray method). The higher catena member (H) leads in Si, Al, K, Na, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Cr, Ba, the lower member (L) in C, Ca, Mg, Mn, P. The very high deficiency in (L) corresponds with higher humus-, Ca, Mg, and P concentrations, all potential agents to Zn fixation. Clay minerals are higher in less deficient (H). This, and studies of \{VAN\} \{BREMEN\} et al. (1980) would point to strong Zn organic fixation. However, DTPA-, dithionite- and oxalate-extracts represent only 2.5–25% pedogenic zinc, the rest is lithogenic and insoluble. Previous combustion scarcely increases these rates. This points against Zn organic linkages as predominating Zn fixation mechanism. Partial correlation, applied to \{VAN\} BREMEN's data also annihilates the high correlation between zinc and organic matter, which is replaced by strong ZnMg and Znbicarbonate correlations. Field tests with 65ZnSO4 in plastic tubes of 35 and 25 cm diameter, inserted in the rice fields, showed, that mobility, i.e. lateral and vertical translocation of the zinc was much more pronounced at (H) than at (L). After air drying the removed soil cores replanting was accompanied by much less Zn deficiency than in loco in the rice field. Drainage and at least temporary oxidation seems to be the primary requirement for soil rehabilitation. Adsorption — desorption isotherms followed the Freundlich relation. Kvalues were very high, especially in (L), indicating strong adsorption of Zn. Kvalues of the \{DTPA\} desorption extracts were quite low, representative for easy desorption by chelate solution, whereas the 0.1 M \{HCl\} extract after \{DTPA\} elution had again high K-values as a sign of strong adsorption of the non \{DTPA\} extractable Zn. For rehabilitation mixed rice — fish farming with fishponds in the lowest points of the relief seems to be best with propagation of azolla as Ngreen manure for the rice and feed for the fish. "

Beyond 2020, further yield increases will probably require germplasm with greater radiation-use efficiency approaching that of plants with \{C4\} photosynthesis. "

Integrated management of such systems, established in both supply and demand areas, calls for thorough knowledge of the functioning of both the water table and its users, so models are usually required. This study is based on the case of the Kairouan water table, located in Tunisia, which has been continuously and globally decreasing for more than 20 years, due to overexploitation by private irrigators. The field study led to the hypothesis that the dynamics of the system is heavily influenced by local interaction between the resource and its users, and by direct, non-economic interaction between the farmers. The literature shows that several kinds of model have already been used to represent interaction between a water table and its users but none of them are able to take this kind of social behaviour into account. The simulator of a water table and user interaction (SINUSE) based upon multi-agent systems enabled us to overcome these limitations. This model proved to be very useful for representing a complex and distributed system such as the Kairouan water table. It enabled us to explore the interaction between the physical and socio-economic components of the system and to conclude that local and non-economic behaviour do have a major impact on the global dynamics of the system and must therefore be taken into account. The management interventions simulated with the \{SINUSE\} model have raised interesting questions, leading to the conclusion that this model could provide a useful tool for negotiating the integrated management of the water table system. Though this model is rather specific, the approach developed could be transferred to other water table systems, to improve the knowledge of their functioning and examine the possible impacts of different management tools.

The biochemical methane potential (BMP) of Haitian latrine waste was determined and compared to other waste streams, such as grey water, septage, and dairy manure. Average methane (CH4) production for the latrine waste (13.6 ml ml−1 substrate) was 23 times greater than septage (0.58 ml ml−1 substrate), and 151 times greater than grey water (0.09 ml ml−1 substrate), illustrating the larger potential when waste is source separated using the decentralized sanitation and reuse (DESAR) concept for more appropriate treatment of each waste stream. Using the \{BMP\} results, methane production based on various \{AD\} configurations was calculated, and compared with the full-scale field \{AD\} design. Methane potential from the \{BMP\} testing was calculated as 0.006–0.017 m3 person−1 day−1 using the lowest and highest latrine \{BMP\} results, which was similar to the values from the full-scale system (0.011 m3 person−1 day−1), illustrating the ability of \{BMPs\} to be used to predict biogas production from sanitation digesters in a smaller-scale setting.

One isoform (GSra) had a mobility similar to that of cytosolic \{GS\} in rice leaves (GSI).

Another isoform (GSrb) moved more slowly than \{GSra\} and occurred only in the presence of external N. Both ammonium-N and nitrate-N induced GSrb, but the activity of \{GSrb\} was higher under ammonium-N than nitrate-N. After the removal of N source from the solution, \{GSrb\} activity and \{GSrb\} protein disappeared as judged by native-PAGE and immunoblotting but \{GSra\} remained relatively constant.

One potential approach to improve the drought resistance and local adaptation of high-yielding rice varieties in rainfed regions of sub-Saharan Africa is to cross them with the African rice species Oryza glaberrima. In this study, 200 introgression lines (ILs) from crosses of O. sativa (IR64) and O. glaberrima (RAM90 and RAM54) were evaluated in three field experiments under different rainfed drought scenarios in Tanzania and the Philippines. The objectives of the study were to select \{ILs\} for yield and traits associated with drought resistance, and to analyze the genetic variation in water uptake, root growth, and drought response that were observed among the \{ILs\} in a previous greenhouse lysimeter study. Several \{ILs\} showed improved yield under drought stress and well-watered conditions compared with the recurrent parent IR64. One cluster of \{ILs\} that showed the highest yield across all environments included genotypes with the lowest canopy temperature under drought. In 10 selected ILs, root length density was negatively correlated with canopy temperature and soil moisture, and positively related to shoot biomass, but not significantly correlated with grain yield under drought. Although root growth in the field correlated well with root growth in the previous lysimeter study, only some of the highest-yielding lines under drought in the field were those that showed more water uptake in lysimeters. These results confirm the complex relationship among grain yield, root growth, and additional physiological mechanisms underlying crop growth and productivity in the field. The high-yielding \{ILs\} under both drought and well-watered conditions in this study can be used as donors to improve drought resistance in target rainfed rice environments in sub-Saharan Africa.

The effects of the \{GM\} on rice, with or without added urea, were compared with the effects of varying urea-N rates in the absence of the GM. Surface water was detrimental to pregerminated \{GM\} seeds. A. afraspera was more damaged by flooding because it emerged 4 d later than S. rostrata. Green manure effects on either the companion or succeeding rice crops varied as a function of \{GM\} crop stand and biomass production. Green manure biomass yield was greater with broadcasting than with row seeding. Green manure relayed into dry-season rice grew vigorously and increased the grain yield of the succeeding rice crop equivalent to the application of 30 kg urea-N/ha. The growth of \{GM\} relayed into wet-season rice was suppressed by the short photoperiod in that season. A urea-N topdress application did not improve the effect of \{GM\} on rice yield. The effect of relayed \{GM\} on the succeeding wet-season rice crop also was equivalent to or exceeded the effect of 60 kg urea-N/ha.

Endosymbionts within planthoppers, such as yeast-like endosymbionts (YLS) could play a role as they produce essential amino acids for planthoppers. We used a full factorial study to determine how natal rice variety, exposed rice variety, \{YLS\} presence, and the number of reared generations affected nymphal development, planthopper total nitrogen content, and planthopper hydrolyzed amino acid profiles. Nymphal development was strongly influenced by a four-way interaction between the exposed rice variety, natal rice variety, number of reared generations, and \{YLS\} presence. While symbiosis improved nymphal performance in the 8th generation, it appeared to be a drain on nymphs in the 11th generation, when the aposymbiotic nymphs actually showed higher performance than the symbiotic nymphs. This suggests that the symbiotic relationship may be acting beneficially in one generation while acting as a drain during another generation. Aposymbiotic planthoppers reared for 11 generations had a higher proportional concentration of rare amino acids than those reared for 8 generations, indicating that the planthopper itself appears to improve its ability to acquire rare amino acids. Therefore, the change in amino acid composition of planthoppers suggests an underlying change in protein expression or amino acid metabolism over time. "

These outputs were examined here by comparing high-yielding genotypes of similar crop duration and through an intense sampling schedule to identify key crop stages and processes involved in hybrid rice performance. Four contrasting hybrids and four contrasting inbreds were grown on the \{IRRI\} farm during a wet and a dry season under the same cultural practices. The grain yield of hybrids was significantly higher than that of inbreds by 14% in the wet season and 18% in the dry season. Crop growth rate (CGR) during each phenological phase, blade growth rate during the vegetative phase, stem growth rate during the reproductive phase and panicle growth rate during the ripening phase were consistently higher for hybrids than for inbreds. As a consequence, the shoot biomass of hybrids increased quicker with time than that of inbreds. And the larger biomass accumulation observed for hybrids at maturity, 2139 and 1906 g m−2 vs. 1952 and 1736 g m−2 for the dry and wet seasons, respectively, was systematically associated with a higher harvest index. In contrast to most of the previous studies aiming at characterizing the higher performance of hybrid rice, differences in leaf area production and in specific leaf area among plant types during the vegetative phase were inconsistent and rarely significant in this study and could not support the higher performance of hybrids. The tillering dynamics was similar between both plant types. This work highlighted the key role of each phenological phase in contributing to the higher biomass production of hybrid rice regardless of the cropping season, dry or wet, while the processes underlying this higher performance are still unclear.

Although higher sink size is generally claimed for being the driver of higher grain filling in hybrid rice, it is relevant to question whether efficient sink regulation, that is timing and magnitude of the successive sink activities over crop growth from early stage, plays a role in supporting higher harvest index and is a key feature ensuring higher performance of hybrid rice. The partitioning coefficient (PC), as the increase in dry matter of one single organ over that of shoot, was calculated over short and successive periods to quantify the dynamics of dry matter partitioning. Four hybrid and four inbred genotypes of similar crop duration were grown under the same cropping management on the \{IRRI\} farm during a wet and a dry seasons. While \{PC\} to blade and sheath was similar for both plant types in both seasons at the early stage, \{PC\} to culm of hybrids was higher than that of inbreds, and \{PC\} to blade was lower, in the late vegetative and early reproductive phases. During the late reproductive phase, \{PC\} to panicle of hybrids was higher than that of inbreds, and \{PC\} to culm was lower whereas culm elongation was similar for both plant types. During grain filling, \{PC\} to culm was significantly more negative with hybrids which indicated stronger remobilization with hybrids. Specific culm length before anthesis, as low as 40 cm g−1, accounted for storage ability, and at maturity, as high as 130 cm g−1, for remobilization ability. Sink strength index, as a better indicator of dry matter partitioning efficiency than harvest index, and unfilled grain size, as an indicator of assimilate wastage, were suggested as key indices to account for the better sink regulation in hybrid rice and to improve screening protocols for increasing yield potential and tolerance to lodging.

The grain yield-N uptake relationship for individual genotypes indicated significant differences in slope and in the yield obtained with soil N (GY0). Differences in \{GY0\} were due to genotypic variation in N uptake and efficiency of use. \{NHI\} was related to both N uptake and use efficiency. NPI, which integrated both \{GY0\} and PNUE, provided a better ranking of genotypes. The performance of efficient and inefficient genotypes over a range of soil and fertilizer N supply was consistent over three seasons of trials. "

Crop rotation experiments over 3 years (1996–1998) to quantify N supply and demand under rainfed lowland rice–chickpea and rice–fallow cropping systems on a loam Alfisol and a clay Vertisol in Raipur, India were conducted under direct-seeded rice culture. The rice growth, yield, development and N accumulation were affected most by N rates (0, 40, 80, 120 kg ha−1) followed by cropping system (rice–chickpea, rice–fallow) and soil types (Alfisol, Vertisol). The incorporation of chickpea in the cropping system helped in accumulating a greater amount of soil N than fallow. The rice yield, dry matter and N accumulated were significantly higher in rice–chickpea than rice–fallow systems on both soils and in all years. The lowest rice yields were recorded in 1997 due to unfavorable rainfall distribution. The total rainfall was the highest in this season, but most of it occurred during a short period at an early growth stage. The post-heading rains were lowest in this season and resulted in the lower rice yield as compared with that of 1996 and 1998. This indicates the significance of rainfall distribution in controlling yield in a rainfed environment. The rice yields were lower on Vertisol than Alfisol during periods of drought. The performance of chickpea was also better in Alfisol as compared with that in the Vertisol due to its better soil physical attributes. The residual effect of N applied to the preceding rice crop was non-significant on all yield, growth and N accumulation parameters of chickpea. The N balance computed from the top 70 cm soil layers indicated less N loss in the rice–chickpea system as compared with that in rice–fallow. The recovery efficiency at the highest N rate (120 kg N ha−1) was higher for the rice–chickpea (57–61%) than that of rice–fallow (49–53%) system. The improved N balance for rice–chickpea system from third year onwards was due to switch to dry seeding and improved soil N status. The inclusion of legume and the effective capture of biologically fixed N and soil N through direct-seeded rice system in rainfed lowlands may help in improving the rice yield of resource poor farmers.

Although higher sink size is generally claimed for being the driver of higher grain filling in hybrid rice, it is relevant to question whether efficient sink regulation, that is timing and magnitude of the successive sink activities over crop growth from early stage, plays a role in supporting higher harvest index and is a key feature ensuring higher performance of hybrid rice. The partitioning coefficient (PC), as the increase in dry matter of one single organ over that of shoot, was calculated over short and successive periods to quantify the dynamics of dry matter partitioning. Four hybrid and four inbred genotypes of similar crop duration were grown under the same cropping management on the \{IRRI\} farm during a wet and a dry seasons. While \{PC\} to blade and sheath was similar for both plant types in both seasons at the early stage, \{PC\} to culm of hybrids was higher than that of inbreds, and \{PC\} to blade was lower, in the late vegetative and early reproductive phases. During the late reproductive phase, \{PC\} to panicle of hybrids was higher than that of inbreds, and \{PC\} to culm was lower whereas culm elongation was similar for both plant types. During grain filling, \{PC\} to culm was significantly more negative with hybrids which indicated stronger remobilization with hybrids. Specific culm length before anthesis, as low as 40 cm g−1, accounted for storage ability, and at maturity, as high as 130 cm g−1, for remobilization ability. Sink strength index, as a better indicator of dry matter partitioning efficiency than harvest index, and unfilled grain size, as an indicator of assimilate wastage, were suggested as key indices to account for the better sink regulation in hybrid rice and to improve screening protocols for increasing yield potential and tolerance to lodging.

Urea was applied as 2–3 split application, while for \{UDP\} treatment, urea briquettes were deep placed (7–10 cm depth) between 4 hills of rice at alternate rows to meet recommended N rates in a single application. Treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications and \{N2O\} and \{NO\} measurements were done at every three-hour interval. \{N2O\} emissions were sporadic and event specific. Peaks in \{N2O\} emissions were observed after broadcast application of urea, during dry period and after re-flooding of the dry soil.

However, across the rice-growing seasons, \{UDP\} significantly (P &lt; 0.05) reduced \{N2O\} emissions compared with broadcast urea. Moreover, \{N2O\} emissions showed significant spatial and seasonal variations. They were higher during Boro season compared with Aus and Aman seasons and at \{BAU\} site than that of BRRI. Conversely, emissions between Aus and Aman seasons and between control and \{UDP\} treatments were similar. In contrast to \{N2O\} emissions, \{NO\} emissions were negligible and not affected by fertilizer treatment.

Plants were grown in a greenhouse and salt stress (100 mM NaCl) was imposed at the booting stage. Anther samples were collected from control and salt-treated plants at the anthesis stage. The Na+/K+ ratio in \{IR64\} anthers under salt stress was &gt;1.7 times greater than that under control conditions, whereas no significant change was observed in Cheriviruppu. We also observed an 83% reduction in \{IR64\} pollen viability, whereas this reduction was only 23% in Cheriviruppu. Of 454 protein spots detected reproducibly on two-dimensional electrophoresis gels, 38 showed significant changes in at least one genotype in response to stress. Using Mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF/TOF) analysis, we identified 18 protein spots that were involved in several processes that might increase plant adaptation to salt stress, such as carbohydrate/energy metabolism, anther wall remodelling and metabolism, and protein synthesis and assembly. Three isoforms of fructokinase-2 were upregulated only in Cheriviruppu under salt stress. This upregulation might result in increased starch content in pollen, which would support pollen growth and development under salt stress. The results also suggested that anther and pollen wall remodelling/metabolism proteins contribute to the tolerance of rice to salt stress. "

Our empirical results, based on 20 experiment stations during study periods of 14–25 years, indicate that rice yields were positively correlated to solar radiation, which primarily drives yield variation. At most stations, yields were positively correlated to temperature and there was no significant negative correlation between them. Therefore, our empirical results argue against the often-cited hypothesis of lower yields with higher temperature. We explain this by the positive correlation between temperature and radiation at our stations. Empirical analysis to yield at a regional scale (20 counties and 22 provinces) indicates a varying climate to yield relationships. In some places, yields were positively regressed with temperature when they were also positively regressed with radiation, showing the similar pattern at above experiment stations. But, in others, lower yield with higher temperature was accompanied by positive correlation between yield and rainfall, which was not happened at stations. We explain this by irrigation water availability, which played a crucial role in determining climatic effects (radiation or rainfall) on yield variability at a regional scale in China. However, temperature's negative effect is still weak at any scale. This study showed how rice yields respond to recent climate change from 1981 to 2005 at station and regional scales in China and identifies the major climatic driver for yield variation. The empirical findings presented here provide a foundation for anticipating climate change impacts on rice production in China. "

Recent short fallows have reduced soil fertility and rice productivity in these systems. Genotypes adapted to a range of soil fertility conditions are needed for their food security. Rainfed experiments were conducted to identify genotypes with high yield and to examine the nature of genotype by environment (G × E) interaction for grain yield. Two improved indica genotypes and seven traditional genotypes including indica and tropical japonica groups were grown without fertilizer in ten environments over the course of 2 years. The effects of G, E and G × E interaction were significant for grain yield, yield components, plant height and days to flowering. Two improved indica genotypes (B6144F-MR-6-0-0 and \{IR\} 55423-01) and a traditional indica genotype Chao Mat out-yielded the other genotypes across the environments (2.1 t ha−1 vs. 1.6 t ha−1). Pattern analysis showed that 40.2% of the G × E sum of squares was captured by a two genotype group by two environment group summary. One environment group had higher contents of soil organic carbon and extractable P and K, and mean grain yield than another environment group. The performance of one genotype group including consisting of improved and traditional indica genotypes was more stable across two environment groups than that of another group consisting of tropical japonica genotypes, which performed well only in the high soil fertility environment group. The low grain yield of tropical japonica genotypes in the low soil fertility environment group was the result of low sink size and grain-filling percentage. In conclusion, two improved genotypes are identified for high yield in both low and high soil fertility conditions and soil organic carbon appears to be a major factor contributing the G × E interaction for grain yield as well as overall productivity.

Introgression lines (INLs) of IR64, whose yield performances were previously evaluated in aerobic fields, were evaluated in the field and greenhouse under soil culture conditions using slant tube and root box methods. Under field conditions, greater root system development of \{INLs\} \{YTH183\} and \{YTH304\} in shallow soil layers contributed to greater shoot dry matter production than that of IR64. Furthermore, the line \{YTH183\} responded sharply to rewatering after drought in slant tube and root box systems by increasing root elongation and branching, which contributed to its higher shoot dry matter production and water extraction compared to IR64. Such growth responses to the different soil water regimes reflect the plastic root growth response of this INL. These results imply that the plasticity in root system development in response to rewatering after drought contributed to the promotion of shoot dry matter production. Since the \{INLs\} in this study are highly genetically similar, future work will focus on pinpointing the genetic control of rice root plasticity under rainfed lowland conditions. "

During 1977–1981, the annual population fluctuation pattern of the vectors Nephotettix virescens and N. nigropictus estimated by light trapping peaked at the end of the wet and the dry crop seasons. Average tungro incidence in monthly planted fields was higher in plots planted in the months when vector catches were greater. To solve tungro problems, an integrated management scheme was developed in 1983. The scheme had four components: (1) planting of two rice crops in those months in which the vector population is low; (2) scheduled planting to have nearly synchronous growth in each area; (3) rotation of cultivars with different degrees of resistance to N. virescens; (4) application of insecticide to reduce vector density in tungro-affected fields. Since 1983, tungro incidence has been generally low and the use of insecticide has been drastically reduced in those areas in which the integrated management scheme was adopted. To assess the relative importance of the practices for tungro management, tungro epidemiology was studied at Sidrap and Maros, South Sulawesi. Surveys in 1985 and 1986 at Sidrap revealed that 90% of rice fields were planted following the recommended planting schedule and therefore a definite fallow period was obtained for one or more months between the dry and wet crop seasons in each area. During this period in Sidrap, an average of 78–85% of rice growers planted recommended cultivars. At Maros, peak periods in the annual green leafhopper (GLH) population fluctuation pattern in 1985–1987 appeared 1 month ahead of those in the pattern obtained during 1977–1981. The shift was probably associated with a shift of 1 month in the crop establishment for dry and wet seasons. In the 1987–1988 dry season in Sidrap, where cropping was scheduled for planting in November, four rice cultivars were planted in the first week of October, November, December, January and February, and development of the vectors and tungro were compared. Vector density was low in the October planting; it increased slowly after transplanting in the November planting, and it increased rapidly and reached high levels in the December and later plantings. The average tungro incidence at 56 days after transplanting was negligible or zero in the October, November and December plantings, but it was 20% in the January planting and as high as 60% in the February planting. In the January and February plantings, tungro incidence was also high in cultivars recommended for that dry season in the area. In the similar trial in the same season at Maros, with wet weather, the tungro incidence was negligible or zero in all plantings but the vector density was high in the February and March plantings. These results indicate that the vector source was limited and the tungro source was scanty in the two locations at the time when planting was scheduled. Tungro infection could occur, but only at the maturing stage or when planting was delayed. Low tungro incidence under the management scheme was mainly because of slow rate of vector population increase and absence or scarcity of tungro source in the area. With regard to the component practices involved, the deployment of cultivar rotation appeared to have a limited role in reducing tungro incidence. Scheduled uniform planting may be of key importance.

This study was intended to monitor the environmental impact, in terms of C budget and heat exchange, of shifting from lowland rice production to aerobic rice cultivation as an alternative to maintain crop productivity under water scarcity. The aerobic rice fields had higher sensible heat flux (H) and lower latent heat flux (LE) compared to flooded fields. On seasonal average, aerobic rice fields had 48% more sensible heat flux while flooded rice fields had 20% more latent heat flux. Consequently, the aerobic rice fields had significantly higher Bowen ratio (0.25) than flooded fields (0.14), indicating that a larger proportion of the available net radiation was used for sensible heat transfer or for warming the surrounding air. The total C budget integrated over the cropping period showed that the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in flooded rice fields was about three times higher than in aerobic fields while gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Re) were 1.5 and 1.2 times higher, respectively. The high \{GPP\} of flooded rice ecosystem was evident because the photosynthetic capacity of lowland rice is naturally large. The Re of flooded rice fields was also relatively high because it was enhanced by the high photosynthetic activities of lowland rice as manifested by larger above-ground plant biomass. The NEE, GPP, and Re values for flooded rice fields were −258, 778, and 521 g C m−2, respectively. For aerobic rice fields, values were −85, 515, and 430 g C m−2 for NEE, GPP, and Re, respectively. The ratio of Re/GPP in flooded fields was 0.67 while it was 0.83 for aerobic rice fields. This short-term data showed significant differences in C budget and heat exchange between flooded and aerobic rice ecosystems. Further investigation is needed to clarify seasonal and inter-annual variations in microclimate, carbon and water budget of different rice production systems. "

A shift from current production of rice on flooded soils to production of rice on non-flooded soil with water-saving irrigation or to production of more water-efficient crops will have profound effects on carbon, water, and energy exchanges. This study used the eddy covariance technique to examine C uptake and water use efficiencies for water-saving, dry-seeded rice production and production of hybrid maize under overhead sprinkler irrigation as an alternative to flooded rice during two growing seasons. Maize with its \{C4\} physiology has greater photosynthetic capacity than rice. In 2011, maize had 1.4 times higher net C uptake than rice and twice as much grain yield as rice (10.4 vs 5.3 Mg ha−1). In 2012, lower solar radiation due to increased cloudiness and heavy rainfall during critical growth stages (late vegetative to early reproductive) decreased \{LAI\} and resulted to about 20% less net C uptake and maize yield (8.2 Mg ha−1), but the rice yield was unchanged (5.3 Mg ha−1) presumably because of improved crop management which included effective crop establishment at lower seed rate and efficient N application using fertigation. Canopy light use efficiency, crop water productivity (WPET), and photosynthetic water use efficiency were 1.8, 1.9, and 1.6 times higher for maize than rice, respectively, despite sensitivity of maize to excess water. Net C uptake, evapotranspiration, and \{WPET\} of dry-seeded rice under overhead sprinkler irrigation were comparable to those reported elsewhere for flooded rice. Average total water input (irrigation + rainfall) for rice was only 908 mm, as compared to 1300–1500 mm reported in literature for typical puddled transplanted rice. "

abstract = "Seasonal rainfall in the Philippines is known to be modulated by \{ENSO\} phenomenon, with El Niño frequently contributing to reduced rainfall and drought while La Niña resulting in excessive rainfalls, floods and more intense typhoons. The alterations in rainfall patterns can have considerable feedback on solar radiation, air temperature, and soil moisture which can affect the ecosystem \{CO2\} exchange. In this paper, we assessed the effects of the \{ENSO\} events (2008–mid 2010) on the seasonal climate conditions and determined how it affected the gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Re), and net ecosystem production (NEP) of two contrasting rice environments: flooded and non-flooded. The 2008 dry season (DS) was under a La Niña event while the 2008 wet season (WS) was a neutral one with strong tropical cyclones associated during the wet season. The 2009DS was also La Niña while the 2009WS was El Niño; however, the northern part of the Philippines experienced strong tropical cyclones. The 2010DS was under an El Niño event. The La Niña in 2008DS resulted in about 15% lower solar radiation (SR), 0.3 °C lower air temperature (Ta) and 60% higher precipitation compared to the 28-year climate normal patterns. Both flooded and non-flooded rice fields had lower \{NEP\} in 2008 \{DS\} (164 and 14 g C m−2, respectively) than in 2008 \{WS\} (295 and 82 g C m−2, respectively) because the climate anomaly resulted in \{SR\} – driven decrease in GPP. The La Niña in 2009DS even resulted in 0.2 °C lower air temperature and 40% more precipitation than the 2008DS La Niña. This cooler temperature resulted in lower Re in flooded rice fields while the higher precipitation resulted in higher \{GPP\} in non-flooded fields since the climate was favorable for the growth of the aerobic rice, the ratoon crops and the weeds. This climate anomaly benefitted both flooded and non-flooded rice fields by increasing \{NEP\} (351 and 218 g C m−2, respectively). However, \{NEP\} decreased in 2009WS in both flooded and non-flooded rice fields (225 and 39 g C m−2, respectively) due to the devastating effects of the strong tropical cyclones that hit the northern part of the Philippines. On the other hand, the El Niño event during 2010DS resulted in about 6% higher solar radiation, 0.4 °C higher air temperature and 67% lower precipitation than the 28-year climate normal pattern. The \{NEP\} of flooded and non-flooded rice fields were closely similar at 187 and 174 g C m−2, respectively. This climate anomaly resulted in Ta – driven increase in Re, as well as vapor pressure deficit (VPD) – driven decrease in \{GPP\} in flooded rice fields. The \{GPP\} and Re in non-flooded rice fields were less sensitive to higher \{VPD\} and higher Ta, respectively. It appears that the net ecosystem \{CO2\} exchange in non-flooded rice field was less sensitive to an El Niño event. "

In 1989, a major research project was initiated at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines to investigate relationships between climate change and rice production. A second project started in 1993 to investigate, in more detail, mitigation options that could be employed to help reduce \{CH4\} emissions from rice cultivation. An important component of all of this work was the quantification of these interactions between climate change and rice production into simulation models, and their subsequent use to upscale field measurements to national and regional levels. The first project developed such a model to integrate existing knowledge of effects of increased levels of \{CO2\} and temperature on rice growth, and used this to predict the impact of various climate change scenarios on rice production in \{SE\} Asia. In the second project, routines describing the dynamics of \{CH4\} production and emission from the soil were linked to a crop simulation model to estimate the effect of different crop management scenarios on national \{CH4\} emissions from various countries in the region. With the recent completion of the second project, it is timely to review this modelling work describing the relationships between the global environment and rice production, a task which we attempt in the present paper. The advantages and disadvantages of the modelling approaches used and other issues relating to the upscaling of field measurements to national and regional levels are discussed.

MANAGE-N was used to optimize N application with different soil N supply regimes. The results revealed that soil-N supply capacities assessed by both static and anaerobic incubation methods were related to plant N uptake up to first flowering (r2 = 0.64 to 0.85) but they failed to correlate with grain yield. Actual N uptake rates of the \{N0\} crops during different growth periods ranged from 0.28 to 1.17 kg ha1 day1. Some of. Some of the soils could supply N equal to that of a sufficiently fertilized crop in the initial period. Based on the soil-N supply capacities, the soils could be classified into those not requiring basal N and those requiring basal N.

Reported effects on grain yield were, however, contradictory: yield was reduced, maintained, or even increased when compared with continuously flooded (CF) conditions. This study was conducted in heavy clay soil to investigate yield variation among a range of genotypes grown under \{AWD\} and to determine some aboveground traits related to crop adaptation. The effect of \{AWD\} on grain yield, with a critical threshold of soil water potential for irrigation fixed at −30 kPa, varied among the 10 genotypes evaluated. Two adapted genotypes were identified with similar grain yield under \{CF\} and \{AWD\} in both experimental seasons. The grain yield of the aerobic-adapted cultivar included in the study was also maintained under AWD, however, its yield was comparatively low. The reduction in grain yield of the non-adapted genotypes ranged from 9 to 13% in the 2006 dry season and from 6 to 17% in the 2008 dry season. None of the yield components could explain by itself the variability in genotype response: in adapted genotypes, grain yield was maintained because of compensation from or maintenance of yield components, whereas, in non-adapted genotypes, grain yield reduction was not due to the decrease of one component only. Modified biomass partitioning appeared as a main driver for adaptation to AWD: adapted genotypes were characterized by larger sink size at flowering, and weaker stems and less unfilled grain number at maturity, suggesting an increase in the sink strength of the filling spikelets. The aboveground traits identified here will be of great help to further increase water productivity under the \{AWD\} strategies set up previously by \{IRRI\} water scientists. "

In addition, we used a theoretical model to predict maximum yields and compared those with reported yields for various locations, including China and Madagascar.

Overexpression of \{GF14e\} enhances resistance to panicle blast whereas silencing \{GF14e\} results in increased susceptibility to panicle blast, suggesting that \{GF14e\} plays a positive role in quantitative panicle blast resistance in rice. Our results also demonstrate that \{GF14e\} is regulated by \{WRKY71\} and GF14e-mediated panicle blast resistance is related to activation of SA-dependent pathway and suppression of JA-dependent pathway.

For increasing productivity and stabilizing yield, technologies and strategies that minimize the effects of uncertainties in water availability are needed. This study, conducted in northern Luzon, Philippines, during 1991–1992, established the benefits of the dry seeding technique of rice crop establishment over the traditional transplanted method. During the study period, farmers with dry seeded rice (DSR) were able to establish the crop about 40 days earlier than transplanted rice (TPR) and utilized about 400 mm of the initial monsoon rains. The advantage of \{DSR\} is reflected in higher expected seasonal relative water supply (RWS) values of 1·08 at 50% and 1·04 at 75% probability, compared to 1·04 and 0·52, respectively, for TPR. Thus, crop water availability would not be a problem for either system of rice culture in an average year, but \{TPR\} would be severely affected by water shortage once every 4 years. \{DSR\} was harvested about 10 days earlier than \{TPR\} and provided a better soil-water regime for the following upland crop. In an average year, farmers growing mungbean after \{DSR\} can expect to meet 50% of the potential crop water requirement from rainfall compared to 37% for those who grow mungbean after TPR. The average yield of \{DSR\} was equal to that of \{TPR\} during the study period, but the significantly higher yields of mungbean grown after the \{DSR\} substantially increased the productivity of the rainfed lowland rice systems.

abstract = "In the Mekong region, most rice paddies lie in gently sloping lowlands. An accurate estimate of paddy water availability is crucial for modelling rice (Oryza sativa L.) productivity in such environments. However, modelling of water balance in the sloping lowlands can be difficult due to problems in estimating lateral water movement from high to low positions in the toposequence. This paper describes a semi-empirical model for estimating net lateral water flow along a toposequence of rice fields. Net lateral water flow is separated into three sub-components: (i) lateral seepage through the bunds from field to field; (ii) surface runoff over the bunds from field to field; (iii) water run-on from the catchment above the toposequence. The lateral seepage is estimated using the Dupuit equation for steady unconfined flow. Surface runoff over the bund is calculated as excess water depth above the bund height, while run-on from the catchment is calculated using a rainfall–runoff relationship. The other water balance components used in the model are rainfall (measured), paddy evapotranspiration (ET), and downward water flow (within the field and under the bund). Paddy \{ET\} is estimated using the \{FAO\} crop \{ET\} model. The downward water flow is empirically determined for soil texture groups. Simulation results showed that field water levels computed by the model varied between the bund height (maximum) and the hardpan level (minimum). The daily change in the water level was satisfactorily validated using data collected from a field experiment in a toposequence in Cambodia. The component governing the water balance in the higher toposequence positions was the downward water flow (45% of seasonal rainfall at the top of the toposequence). However, the water balance in the lower positions was affected largely by the net lateral water flow (21% of seasonal rainfall at the bottom of the toposequence). Seasonal \{ET\} was 67–69% of seasonal rainfall. "

Leaching also produces large volumes of leachate for disposal or treatment.

Recovery above 90% was achieved with rejection of \{COD\} and ions other than carbonate also above 90%. Similar results would be expected to apply to other biomass leachates. Flux approaching a recommended 40 l m−2 h−1 was maintained at 90% recovery at a pressure half the maximum recommended pressure of the membrane tested. Flux declined above 90% recovery due to increasing osmotic pressure and probable fouling as salt concentrations likely exceeded solubility limits at the membrane surface. Cost of \{RO\} processing for a leaching facility handling 50,000 Mg year−1 of biomass and generating 1.9 Ml day−1 of leachate is estimated at $671 Ml−1 of leachate exclusive of brine disposal. The cost increases to $719 Ml−1 leachate for a facility of approximately half this capacity. \{RO\} costs add $7–8 Mg−1 to the cost of fuel processed. \{RO\} treatment reduces the volume of fresh water required for leaching and the volume of brine disposed. Where sufficient municipal wastewater treatment capacity exists the addition of \{RO\} to a leaching system may not be economically justified if costs assessed on the basis of strength are higher than costs assessed for flow. For treatment by evaporation ponds, \{RO\} offers a clear advantage over direct leachate disposal, reducing costs by 50% to 70%. Land application of both leachate and concentrate can take advantage of nutrients extracted from the biomass and could be used in the production of additional biomass. Application over an area one-tenth or more the original source area may be required to manage salts and to ensure that sustainable application rates are not exceeded. "

Mean squares due to genotypes were highly significant for all nine characters studied. Across genotypes, the seedling stage tolerance was associated with grain yield performance and adult stage salinity tolerance. The \{SALTOL\} lines \{IR\} 84645-305-6-1-B, IR84649-275-3-2-B and IR84649-292-3-1-B performed significantly better in terms of seedling stage tolerance, grain yield and \{STI\} (stress tolerance index) as compared to sensitive check under sodic as well as salinity stress environments. \{STI\} was found to be a better selection criterion than stress susceptibility index (SSI). Yield potential was directly correlated with yield under stress and \{STI\} under both stresses. Interestingly, \{STI\} values for sodicity stress were positively correlated with those of salinity stress, thus sodicity stress tolerance could be predictive of salinity stress tolerance or vice versa. The \{STI\} values under moderate sodic and high saline conditions were positively correlated with plant height, total and productive tillers, biomass, grain yield and harvest index in normal and both stress environments thus revealing importance of these traits for indirect selection in the \{MAB\} derived material.

Addition of acetate, glucose, or root exudates stimulated \{CH4\} production in soil with high production capacity (Pangil) (16.0 μmol \{CH4\} g−1) as well as low production capacity (Maahas) (0.171 μmol \{CH4\} g−1). However, the response triggered by a given amendment was more pronounced in Pangil soil than in Maahas soil. Similarly, application of rice straw triggered the fastest response in the soil with high inherent production potential (Pila) (peaking at 2 weeks after incubation at 25°C) as compared to the soil with moderate (Luisiana) (peaking at 3 weeks) and low production potential (Maahas) (peaking at 4 weeks).

The transformation efficiencies of added substrates decreased in the order of glucose &gt; acetate &gt; root exudates &gt; straw. High transformation efficiencies of acetate, glucose and root exudates indicated a priming effect, i.e. enhanced decomposition of soil organic matter through added substrate. This priming effect due to the reactivation of fermentative microflora by adding substrate C may also increase the effects of root exudates under field conditions. "

In order to assess differences among cultivars, we determined the methane transport capacity (MTC) of 18 inbred varieties and 4 hybrids at seedling, panicle initiation (PI), flowering and maturity using an automatic measuring system under greenhouse conditions. All cultivars showed a large increase in \{MTC\} from seedling to panicle initiation, but differed in \{MTC\} in the succeeding growth stages until maturity. Rice cultivars could be divided into three \{MTC\} groups: (a) four hybrids showing no change in flowering to maturity; (b) eight inbred varieties (Zhong yu 906, Zhong zuo 93, Pusa Basmati 1, \{PR\} 111, \{CSR\} 13, Cisadane, Dodokan, \{IR72\} and \{IR65598\} (new plant type, NPT)) showing either no or minor changes in \{MTC\} from panicle initiation to flowering; and (c) nine other inbred varieties (Zhong hua 15, \{PR\} 108, Pusa 169, Membarano, Basmati 370, \{KDML\} 105, \{CSR\} 10, Dular and \{HTA\} 60) showing significant increase from panicle initiation to flowering. Groups (b) and (c) had large decreases in \{MTC\} at maturity. Differences in \{MTC\} patterns among groups were attributed to growth parameters (root, shoot, and root+shoot biomass without grains, and tiller numbers) and the development of morphological characteristics of the aerenchyma. The results suggest that in inbred cultivars representing tall, dwarf and \{NPT\} groups, an increase in root or aboveground biomass during plant growth until flowering determines the corresponding increase in MTC. Further increase or any change in plant biomass at maturity does not affect MTC. However, in the case of hybrids, a positive relationship of \{MTC\} with root, shoot and total plant biomass including grain indicate continuous development of aerenchyma with plant growth resulting in enhanced MTC. In all cultivars, tiller numbers were linearly related to \{MTC\} indicating that the number of outlets determines \{CH4\} transport. The relative \{MTC\} of different cultivars for the complete season ranged from 62 to 445% of IR72. These results clearly demonstrate that rice cultivars differ widely in MTC. Therefore, the use of high-yielding cultivars with low \{MTC\} (e.g. \{KDML\} 105, \{IR65598\} and \{PR\} 108) could be an economically feasible, environmentally sound and promising approach to mitigate \{CH4\} emissions from rice fields.

It is not clear whether reported water savings in rice arise from the geometry of the beds per se or from the particular water management that keeps the soil in aerobic conditions and that can also be applied on flat land. Moreover, little research has been reported on direct seeding of rice on raised beds and on the effect of raised beds on the subsequent wheat crop. In this paper we compare the yield, input water (rainfall and irrigation) use and water productivity of dry-seeded rice on raised beds and flat land with that of flooded transplanted and wet-seeded rice, and analyze the effects of beds on the subsequent wheat crop. The experiment was conducted in 2001–2003 at New Delhi, India. Rice yields on raised beds that were kept around field capacity were 32–42% lower than under flooded transplanted conditions and 21% lower than under flooded wet-seeded conditions. Water inputs were reduced by 32–42% compared with flooded rice, but could also be accomplished with dry seeding on flat land with the same water management. Reduced water inputs and yield reductions balanced each other so that water productivity was comparable among most treatments. Wheat yield was 12–17% lower on raised beds than on flat land with conventional (20 cm) row spacing. Neither wheat nor rice on raised beds compensated for the loss in rows by extra tillering or leaf growth at the edges of the rows. There was no carry-over effect of type of land preparation in rice on the growth and yield of the subsequent wheat crop. Further research on raised beds should focus on the selection of suitable rice and wheat varieties, soil health issues such as nematodes and micro-nutrient deficiencies, weed control, bed stability and long-term carry-over effects from one crop to the other.

About 60% of global N fertilizer is used for producing the world's three major cereals: rice, wheat, and maize. Projections estimate that 50 to 70% more cereal grain will be required by 2050 to feed 9.3 billion people. This will require increased use of N of similar magnitude if the efficiency with which N is used by the crop is not improved. Fertilizer N‐recovery efficiency by the first crop is 30 to 50%. The remaining N either remains in the soil, the recovery of which in the following crops is very limited (&lt;7% of applied N up to six consecutive crops), or it is lost from the soil–plant system, causing serious disruptions in ecosystem functions. Much research has been conducted during the past decades to improve N‐use efficiency (NUE) by developing fertilizer management strategies based on a better synchronization between the supply and requirement of N by the crop. Importantly, some of these techniques are being adopted on a large scale by farmers. The two challenges ahead are to (1) improve farmers’ knowledge and (2) ensure that these techniques are cost‐effective and user‐friendly so that they provide attractive options for adoption. "

abstract = "Abstract Progress has been significant in climate science and the direct and indirect influences of climate on agricultural productivity. With the likely growth of the world's population toward 10 billion by 2050, demand for food crops will grow faster than demand for other crops. The prospective climate change is global warming (with associated changes in hydrologic regimes and other climatic variables) induced by the increasing concentration of radiatively active greenhouse gases. Climate models project that global surface air temperatures may increase by 4.0–5.8 °C in the next few decades. These increases in temperature will probably offset the likely benefits of increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide on crop plants. Climate change would create new environmental conditions over space and time and in the intensity and frequency of weather and climate processes. Therefore, climate change has the potential to influence the productivity of agriculture significantly. Climate variability has also become a reality in India. The increase in mean temperature by 0.3–0.6 °C per decade since the 1860s across India indicates significant warming due to climate change. This warming trend is comparable to global mean increases in temperature in the past 100 years. It is projected that rainfall patterns in India would change with the western and central areas witnessing as many as 15 more dry days each year, whereas the northern and northwestern areas could have 5 to 10 more days of rainfall annually. Thus, dry areas are expected to get drier and wet areas wetter. It is projected that India's population could reach 1.4 billion by 2025 and may exceed China's in the 2040s. If agricultural production is adversely affected by climate change, livelihood and food security in India would be at risk. Because the livelihood system in India is based on agriculture, climate change could cause increased crop failure and more frequent incidences of pests. Therefore, future challenges will be more complex and demanding. This chapter focuses on the variability of climate change and its probabilistic effects on agricultural productivity and adaptation and mitigation strategies that can help in managing the adverse effect of climate change on agricultural productivity, in particular for India.

Using longitudinal survey data of 1800 rural households from 12 districts of Bangladesh over the period 2007–2009, we estimated a three-stage hierarchical logit model to identify the key sources of household food insecurity. The first-difference estimator was then employed to compare pre- and post-shock expenditure for those households that experienced acute food shortages and those that managed to avoid the worst impacts of the shocks. On the basis of our results we conclude that: (1) the soaring food prices of 2007–2009 unequivocally aggravated food insecurity in the rural areas of Bangladesh; (2) the subsequent income shocks of 2007–2009 contributed toward worsening food insecurity; (3) the adverse impacts of these shocks appeared to have faded over time due to labor and commodity market adjustments, regional economic growth, and domestic policy responses, leaving no profound impacts on households’ economic well-being in most cases; and (4) although the immediate adverse consequences of rising food prices were borne disproportionately by the poor, the longer term consequences were distributed more evenly across the rich and poor and were favorable for the day laborers.

Positive midparent heterosis (HMP) was observed for most traits in the four \{TC\} populations in the two years.

abstract = "With decreasing water availability for agriculture and increasing demand for rice, water use in rice production systems has to be reduced and water productivity increased. Alternately submerged–nonsubmerged (ASNS) systems save water compared with continuous submergence (CS). However, the reported effect on yield varies widely and detailed characterizations of the hydrological conditions of \{ASNS\} experiments are often lacking so that generalizations are difficult to make. We compared the effects of \{ASNS\} and \{CS\} on crop performance and water use, at different levels of N input, in field experiments in China and the Philippines, while recording in detail the hydrological dynamics during the experiment. The experiments were conducted in irrigated lowlands and followed \{ASNS\} practices as recommended to farmers in China. The sites had silty clay loam soils, shallow groundwater tables and percolation rates of 1–4.5 mm per day. Grain yields were 4.1–5.0 t ha−1 with 0 kg N ha−1 and 6.8–9.2 t ha−1 with 180 kg N ha−1. Biomass and yield did not significantly differ between \{ASNS\} and CS, but water productivity was significantly higher under \{ASNS\} than under \{CS\} in two out of three experiments. There was no significant water×N interaction on yield, biomass, and water productivity. Combined rainfall plus irrigation water inputs were 600–960 mm under CS, and 6–14% lower under ASNS. Irrigation water input was 15–18% lower under \{ASNS\} than under CS, but only significantly so in one experiment. Under ASNS, the soils had no ponded water for 40–60% of the total time of crop growth. During the nonsubmerged periods, ponded water depths or shallow groundwater tables never went deeper than −35 cm and remained most of the time within the rooted depth of the soil. Soil water potentials did not drop below −10 kPa. We argue that our results are typical for poorly-drained irrigated lowlands in Asia, and that \{ASNS\} can reduce water use up to 15% without affecting yield when the shallow groundwater stays within about 0–30 cm. A hydrological characterization and mapping of Asia’s rice area is needed to assess the extent and magnitude of potential water savings. "

Assessment of the potential of these crosses indicated that it should be possible to obtain useful transgressive segregants for the majority of characters if 100 single-seed descent lines were raised from each, but that for a minority, it would be necessary to produce as many as 460 such lines. Three of these crosses displayed useful transgressive variation as early as the \{F3\} generation for the majority of characters, including yield and its components. The predicted yields of the best \{F3\} family of one of the crosses, whose parents were of the 4 12 months age class, and that of the top 1% of recombinant inbred lines that could be extracted from this cross were 9.65 t/ha and 11.37 t/ha, respectively.

However, though the best lines produced by these methods achieved the desired targets for every character considered singly, none were significantly better than the best single seed descent line for any character in either cross. These results indicate that while it has been possible to practice effective negative selection during the course of inbreeding, by culling plants of poor performance, attempts to carry out positive selection of plants of superior performance were less successful. An audit of the costs incurred in producing the most promising \{F6\} lines that were extracted by these methods from each cross revealed that the single seed descent lines were the cheapest and those of the pedigree and modified pedigree methods the most expensive. These results indicate, therefore, that single seed descent is at least as effective as the other methods, is less costly and, where three generations can be raised per annum, is more rapid. Comparison of the observed proportions of superior single seed descent \{F6\} lines, with those predicted from information obtained from the \{F3\} generation of these crosses showed that for the majority of characters, the former were close to the latter. Single seed descent, therefore, has the further advantage that it is possible to predict the potential of a cross on information obtained from the early generations of the pedigree. "

The experimental site was at Rajshahi in north-west Bangladesh. The hardpan soil layers had developed around 0.2 m soil-depth in the field. Soil water from either above or below the hardpan was collected non-destructively with porous cups installed into the field. Using an isotopic ratio mass spectrometer, δD value of each water sample was determined. During the sampling period, the field surface varied from water-saturated to unsaturated status with rainfall event. While the δD values fluctuated by the influence of rainfall, significant differences in the δD values were always detected between above and below the hardpan, revealing heterogeneity in the δD values persisted with the hardpan. The effect of hardpan on retention of the δD signature was further confirmed in a laboratory experiment using intact soil columns collected from a paddy field at Nagoya University. The natural δD signature in rainfed lowland rice field may be useful to identify certain genotypes that demonstrate in situ capability of water acquisition from below the hardpan through δD analysis of the xylem sap.

Even if the drought effect is negligible, nutrient uptake and rice yield may decrease because of chronic unsubmerged soil stress on coarse-textured soil. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of unsubmerged soil conditions on N and P uptake, biomass accumulation and grain yield of 20 diverse rice genotypes. Unsubmerged and submerged field trials were conducted at the Ubon Ratchathani Rice Research Center in northeast Thailand in the wet seasons of 2010 and 2011. In the unsubmerged trial, rice was grown aerobically by draining the perched water; soil moisture at 20-cm depth fluctuated between −10 and −30 kPa. On average, the yield decline in unsubmerged soil conditions was 47% compared with submerged soil conditions (3.75 vs. 1.99 t ha−1), which was attributable to reduced biomass accumulation and N and P uptake. Unsubmerged soil stress had minimal effect on harvest index, days to heading and N concentration. In unsubmerged soil conditions, N and P uptake and N-use efficiency (biomass/N uptake) positively correlated with biomass accumulation at heading stage. Rice plants showed severe P deficiency because of unsubmerged soil stress, which limited the contribution of P-use efficiency to biomass accumulation. Our results showed that the physiological traits improving P uptake and plant P nutrition under unsubmerged soil stress would be important targets for future research. We suggest that genotype screening under unsubmerged soil stress on coarse-textured soil may further improve rainfed lowland rice for the drought-prone plains. "

We evaluated yield potential and physiological adaptation traits to water deficit of BC3-derived lines with the genetic background of an elite indica cultivar, IR64, in the field and in pot experiments. One line, YTH183, had 26% higher yield than \{IR64\} under non-stress conditions (895 vs. 712 g m−2 on average). This was attributed to enlarged sink capacity due to large grain size, which contributed to more efficient use of assimilates and hence a higher harvest index. \{YTH183\} also showed better dehydration avoidance under intermittent soil drying, due to the adaptive response of deep rooting to water deficiency. The grain yield of \{YTH183\} exceeded that of \{IR64\} by 92–102% under moderate water deficit caused by limited irrigation in aerobic rice culture (143 vs. 72 g m−2). Two introgressed segments on chromosomes 5 and 6 might, at least in part, confer the higher yield potential and greater dehydration avoidance in \{YTH183\} simultaneously. Advanced backcross breeding combined with molecular genetics and physiological characterization of introgressed segments would be effective for developing new rice cultivars with high yield potential and drought adaptation traits.

The \{FTEs\} were adjusted for any cost differences per scientist time across the rice growing environments. Unadjusted \{FTEs\} indicated a high congruence in resource allocation while adjusted \{FTEs\} showed slight under investment in rainfed environment. The use of equity weights amplified the extent of under investment in rainfed environments.

Experimental treatments—two water supply levels (well-watered, rainfed) in the main plots and five fertilizer levels (0-22-90, 120-0-90, 120-22-0, 120-22-90, 144-27-108 kg \{NPK\} ha−1) in the subplots—were laid out in a split-plot design with four replications. Crop, soil, and water parameters were recorded and pest infestations were assessed. In all seasons, rice yield was significantly influenced by fertilizer treatments. Average yield reduction due to N omission was 42%, to K omission 33–36%, and to P omission 3–4%. Water by nutrient interactions did not affect rice yield and biomass production. In two of the three dry seasons, an average of 20% of the panicles were damaged by pests and estimated yield loss from pests was 56–59% in well-watered and well-fertilized treatments. In one out of six seasons, yields under rainfed conditions were 20–23% lower than under well-watered conditions. Drought, N and K deficiencies, and pest infestation are the major determinants for high yields in rainfed environments in Jakenan. Supplying adequate nutrient and good pest control are at least as important as drought management for increasing crop productivity of rainfed rice-growing areas in Central Java. The relative importance of drought, nutrient and pest management may vary in other rainfed areas. Yield constraints analysis should be systematically carried out to identify appropriate management strategies. "

Application of the test thus resulted in an 85% saving of measurement effort as compared with the original sampling scheme. The question of the design of the measurement scheme, i.e., which of the 8 measurements to select is addressed by means of selecting all possible combinations of the 8 observations among the 16 subplot centres, and calculating the mean squared error (MSE) and the mean variance of the prediction error (MVP) in a test set consisting of the 40 other measurements.

Down-regulation of either \{SBEIIa\} or \{IIb\} caused pleiotropic effects on \{SSI\} and starch phosphorylase (SP) and resulted in formation of novel protein complexes in which the missing \{SBEII\} isoform was substituted by \{SBEI\} and SP. In the ΔSBEIIb down-regulated line, soluble \{SP\} activity was undetectable. Nonetheless, \{SP\} was incorporated into a heteromeric protein complex with \{SBEI\} and \{SBEIIa\} and was readily detected in starch granules. In amo1, unlike other mutants, the data suggest that both \{SBEIIa\} and \{SBEIIb\} are in a protein complex with \{SSI\} and SSIIa. In the sex6 mutant no protein complexes involving \{SBEIIa\} or \{SBEIIb\} were detected in amyloplasts. Studies with Pro-Q Diamond revealed that GBSS, SSI, SSIIa, \{SBEIIb\} and \{SP\} are phosphorylated in their granule bound state.

abstract = "\{ABSTRACT\} Crop yield is most sensitive to water deficit during the reproductive stage. For rice, the most sensitive yield component is spikelet fertility and the most sensitive stage is immediately before heading. Here, we examined the effect of drought on the anther proteome of two rice genotypes: Moroberekan and IR64. Water was withheld for 3 d before heading (3DBH) in well watered controls for 5 d until the flag leaf relative water content (RWC) had declined to 45–50%. Plants were then re-watered and heading occurred 2–3 d later, representing a delay of 4–5 d relative to controls. The anther proteins were separated at 3 DBH, at the end of the stress period, and at heading in stressed/re-watered plants and controls by two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis, and 93 protein spots were affected reproducibly in abundance by drought during the experiment across two rice genotypes. After drought stress, upon re-watering, expressions of 24 protein spots were irreversible in both genotypes, 60 protein spots were irreversible in \{IR64\} but reversible in Moroberekan, only nine protein spots were irreversible in Moroberekan while reversible in IR64. Among them, there were 14 newly drought-induced protein spots in IR64; none of them was reversible on re-watering. However, there were 13 newly drought-induced protein spots in Moroberekan, 10 of them were reversible on re-watering, including six drought-induced protein spots that were not reversed in IR64. Taken together, our proteomics data reveal that drought-tolerant genotype Moroberekan possessed better recovery capability following drought and re-watering at the anther proteome level than the drought-sensitive genotype IR64. The disruptions of drought to rice anther development and pollen cell functions are also discussed in the paper. "

Using a whole rice genome microarray, the expression profiles of \{TCS\} genes of rice lines with different drought resistance were analyzed at various growth stages. The \{TCS\} genes showed greatly difference of expression pattern in various organs but in similar patterns in the same tissues at different stages. Genes for type-A response regulator (RR), a negative regulator of cytokinin (CK) signaling, were mostly repressed by drought stress, whereas, genes for type-B \{RR\} with an opposite role to type-A \{RR\} were mostly induced by drought stress. These changes were supposed to be related to the enhancement of \{CK\} signaling under drought stress. This supposition was confirmed by the down regulation of ethylene receptor genes and the cross-talk of hormones under drought condition. The His kinase genes (HK5 and HK3) that are homologous to \{CK\} receptor genes (AHK2, AHK3, and CRE1) in Arabidopsis were induced by drought stress. However, \{HK6\} homologous to \{AHK5\} (CK-independent 2, CKI2) was repressed when exposed to drought stress. These results provided further confirmations of the above supposition. In drought resistant introgression lines and IR64, no significant differences of \{TCS\} gene expression profiles were observed under drought stress. This result indicates that the \{TCS\} genes are probably in relation to drought responsiveness. "

The transition from the vegetative growth to the reproductive stage in rice appeared to have a large effect on \{QTL\} expression, reflected by the different behaviors of most \{QTLs\} affecting panicle length from other \{PH\} QTLs. The 17QTL regions associated with one or more basal internodal traits plus nine \{QTLs\} affecting two lower elongated internodes were expected to contribute to lodging resistance (LR) of rice.

In this study, a set of 55 overlapping introgression lines (ILs) in the Teqing (indica) background were used to genetically dissect several morph-physiological traits and their relationship with grain yield under water stress and non-stress conditions.

Clustered \{QTLs\} affecting Pn, gs, Tr, and Ci in the same genomic regions suggest common genetic bases for the physiological traits. Low or no phenotypic correlations between leaf morphological traits and photosynthetic traits and between morph-physiological traits and grain yield (GY) appeared to be due to inconsistence in \{QTL\} effect for clustered QTLs, unlinked \{QTLs\} affecting different traits, and to possible epistasis that could not be adequately addressed in this study. Our results indicate that improving drought tolerant (DT) of rice by selecting any single secondary traits is not expected to be effective and the identified \{QTLs\} for \{GY\} and related morph-physiological traits should be carefully confirmed before to be used for improving \{DT\} in rice by MAS.

Although both ecotypes exhibited cell death in response to the osmotic and salt stresses, they appeared to adapt to the two types of stresses through different timing and tissue specificity of cell death. Under the stresses, the occurrence of cell death was always delayed in IRAT109, a drought tolerant upland line, than in IR20, a drought sensitive lowland line. Under the salt stress, cell death progressed successively in a well regulated manner, starting from the outer layer cells in the epidermis and exodermis of roots and subsequently to the endodermis and stele, suggesting a possible function of the dead cells in preventing the influx of excess Na+ ions into the inner parts of roots and into shoots, leading to salt exclusion. In contrast, cell death induced by PEG-induced osmotic stress occurred randomly in roots, allowing a better ability to recover after stress. Thus, the coincidence of the difference in drought tolerance between the two rice ecotypes and their differences in the osmotic/salt induced cell death indicate that cell death may have played an important role contributing to rice tolerances to different abiotic stresses.

A mechanistic crop growth model was used to estimate yields of partially irrigated and strictly rainfed crops of IT82D-889, an early maturing cowpea cultivar, and TVX1948-012F, a medium maturing cowpea cultivar. Average yield and yield stability of these cultivars were determined for fields with a shallow and a deep water table before and after the growth of rice (Oryza sativa) in various parts of the Philippines. Long-term simulation results indicated that the yield of TVX1948-012F varied from 100 to 2250 kg ha−1, and that of IT82D-889 varied from 50 to 1600 kg ha−1 for fields with a shallow water table and for partially irrigated conditions. Yields were greater for the post-rice than for the pre-rice season. Partial irrigation increased long-term biomass compared with those for strictly rainfed situations by 30% in the pre-rice season and by 104% in the post-rice season. Yields were more stable at Davao than at Los Baños or Iloilo. The two maturity classes of cowpea cultivars appear to have somewhat different extrapolation domains. The study demonstrates that mechanistic simulation modelling can be a useful tool to delineate the extrapolation domains of crops and cultivars. "

The uptake of nitrogen was described by a first-order equation in which the uptake parameter combined the effects of root size and the uptake per unit root size. The loss of nitrogen was modeled using a similar equation. Using the model, the hypothesis that fertilizer nitrogen losses from high-yielding irrigated rice could be almost eliminated by delivering the precise amounts of nitrogen required to support growth at any given time was demonstrated to be false. The model was used to compute the effects of applying a constant amount of fertilizer nitrogen in eight ways (splits), and also the effects of a slow-release and of an ‘ideal’ fertilizer. Counter to intuition, the practicable limit to recovery of fertilizer nitrogen was about 57%, for the high rates of nitrogen considered here and with the values for the model parameters used here. This arises because it is necessary to have a certain concentration of nitrogen in the available soil pool (freely-exchangeable plus solution nitrogen) from which the crop can take up the nitrogen it needs, and concurrently the available soil pool will lose nitrogen at a rate controlled by various biophysical processes.

The current practice of growing puddled transplanted rice and maize with conventional, repeated tillage degrades soil structure, delays maize planting, and reduces its yield potential, increasing energy and labour requirements, ultimately leading to high production costs. Conservation agriculture (CA)-based tillage and crop establishment options such as strip or reduced tillage, and raised beds, may hold potential to increase yield, reduce crop establishment costs, and increase income of the farmers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the productivity and profitability of R–M systems under CA-based tillage and crop establishment options across a gradient of 69 farmers’ fields in Northwest Bangladesh. We evaluated four tillage and crop establishment options: reduced tillage; strip tillage; fresh beds; and permanent beds. Conventional-tilled (puddled) transplanted rice on flat followed by conventional-tilled maize on flat was included as a current practice. \{ANOVA\} for adjusted 4-year pooled mean revealed no significant treatment effects for yield and economic analysis parameters for rice (P ≥ 0.05), but they were significant for maize and the R–M system (P ≤ 0.05). Rice yields across tillage and establishment treatments over four years ranged from 4.6 to 4.9 t ha−1 while maize and R–M system yields ranged, respectively, from 7.8 and 12.5 t ha−1 under conventional tillage to 9.0 and 13.8 t ha−1 on permanent beds. Compared to conventional tillage, the average maize and system yield across fresh beds, reduced tillage, and strip tillage, was greater by 9.1% and 6.1%, respectively. Maize production costs ranged from \{US\} $922 ha−1 with fresh beds to \{US\} $1,027 ha−1 for conventional tillage. Maize net returns and benefit cost ratio (BCR), however, ranged, respectively, from $945 ha−1 and 1.9 under conventional tillage to $1350 ha−1 and 2.4 under permanent beds. We conclude that while CA-based tillage and establishment options may not have significant yield advantage over conventional tillage in rice, they have significant advantages in terms of reduced production cost and labour use, and increased net returns. For maize as well as for R–M system, while most options can provide yield benefits similar to conventional tillage, permanent beds exhibit a significant advantage (yield, net returns, etc.) over conventional tillage. Profitability was consistently greatest and significantly different (P ≤ 0.001) under permanent raised beds compared to all other treatments. Considering our assessment of the profitability distributions and risk analysis, we conclude that both rice and maize planted sequentially on permanent beds and strip tillage can result in higher net income and \{BCR\} compared to conventional tillage practice.

Egg laying by N. lugens was reduced on the indica variety IR60. Nymph biomass (N. lugens and S. furcifera) was also lower on IR60: this was associated with low honeydew production and a high proportion of xylem-derived honeydew in N. lugens but not in S. furcifera. Nitrogen increased egg-laying by S. furcifera and increased N. lugens nymph biomass on all varieties tested. Oviposition and egg mortality in both planthopper species were examined on plants at 15, 30 and 45 days after sowing (DAS). Sogatella furcifera laid more eggs on plants at 15 DAS, but laid few eggs during darkness; N. lugens continued to lay eggs on older rice plants (30 DAS) and during darkness. Egg mortality was high on cv. Asiminori, highest at 45 DAS, and higher for S. furcifera than for N. lugens. Mortality of S. furcifera eggs was associated with lesions around the egg clusters. These were more common around clusters laid during the day and suggested induction by Asiminori of an ovicidal response. Egg mortality declined under higher soil nitrogen levels. Results are discussed in the light of improving rice resistance against planthoppers and reducing rates of planthopper adaptation to resistance genes. "

No differences among cultivars were observed in either the rates of dry during the period of differential irrigation. The stress treatments imposed in the pre-flowering period delayed panicle emergence by 10 days in \{IAC\} 25 which was at the boot stage of development, when stress was most severe, and by 4 to 5 days in all other cultivars, some of which emerged up to 30 days after full irrigation had been restored.

As no differences among cultivars in the threshold stress or rate of decrease of osmotic potential below this threshold were observed, we conclude that the apparent differences in osmotic adjustment among the seven cultivars arose from differences in the development of stress. The daily rate of leaf extension was more sensitive to water deficits than leaf death, but was no more sensitive to midday leaf water potentials than was leaf conductance. Both leaf extension and leaf conductance had maximum values at midday water potentials of −0.8 \{MPa\} and minimum values at −2 \{MPa\} and below.

This means that yields must be increased by at least 50% over the next 40 years to prevent mass malnutrition for the 700 million Asians that currently rely on rice for more than 60% of their daily calorific intake. Since predictive models suggest that yield increases of this magnitude can only be achieved by improving photosynthesis, and because evolution has increased photosynthetic efficiency by 50% in the form of the \{C4\} pathway, one solution is to generate \{C4\} rice. However, this is an ambitious goal that requires proof of concept before any major investment of time and money. Here, we discuss approaches that should allow proof of concept to be tested. "

On average, \{RMSE\} was 690–1280 kg ha−1 for total biomass, 350–380 kg ha−1 for leaf biomass, 460–790 kg ha−1 for stem biomass, and 380–580 kg ha−1 for panicle biomass.

abstract = "Agriculture in limited resource areas is characterized by small farms which are generally too small to adequately support the needs of an average farm family. The farming operation can be described as a low input cropping system with the main energy source being manual labor, draught animals and in some areas hand tractors. These farming systems are the most important contributor to the national economy of many developing countries. The role of tillage is similar in dryland agricultural systems in both the high input (HICS) and low input cropping systems (LICS), however, wet cultivation or puddling is unique to lowland rice-based systems in low input cropping systems. Evidence suggest that tillage may result in marginal increases in crop yield in the short term, however, in the longer term it may be neutral or give rise to yield decreases associated with soil structural degradation. On marginal soils, tillage may be required to prepare suitable seedbeds or to release adequate Nitrogen through mineralization, but in the longer term, however, tillage reduces soil organic matter content, increases soil erodibility and the emission of greenhouse gases. Tillage in low input cropping systems involves a very large proportion of the population and any changes in current practices such as increased mechanization will have a large social impact such as increased unemployment and increasing feminization of poverty, as mechanization may actually reduce jobs for women. Rapid mechanization is likely to result in failures, but slower change, accompanied by measures to provide alternative rural employment, might be beneficial. Agriculture in limited resource areas must produce the food and fiber needs of their community, and its future depends on the development of sustainable tillage/cropping systems that are suitable for the soil and climatic conditions. These should be based on sound biophysical principles and meet the needs of and be acceptable to the farming communities. Some of the principle requirements for a sustainable system includes the maintenance of soil health, an increase in the rain water use efficiency of the system, increased use of fertilizer and the prevention of erosion. The maintenance of crop residues on the surface is paramount for meeting these requirements, and the competing use of crop residues must be met from other sources. These requirements can be met within a zonal tillage system combined with suitable agroforestry, which will reduce the need for crop residues. It is, however, essential that farmers participate in the development of any new technologies to ensure adoption of the new system. "

Two important water-saving technologies at field scale are alternately submerged–nonsubmerged (SNS) and flush irrigated (FI) rice. \{SNS\} allows dry periods between submerged soil conditions, whereas \{FI\} resembles the irrigation regime of an upland crop. The effects of these regimes on the water balance and water savings were compared with continuously submerged (CS) and rainfed (RF) regimes. The crop growth model \{ORYZA2000\} was used to calculate seasonal water balances of CS, SNS, FI, and \{RF\} regimes for two locations: Tuanlin in Hubei province in China from 1999 to 2002 during summer seasons and Los Baños in the Philippines in 2002–2003 during dry seasons. The model was first parameterized for site-specific soil conditions and cultivar traits and then evaluated using a combination of statistical and visual comparisons of observed and simulated variables. \{ORYZA2000\} accurately simulated the crop variables leaf area index, biomass, and yield, and the soil water balance variables field water level and soil water tension in the root zone. Next, a scenario study was done to analyse the effect of water regime, soil permeability, and groundwater table depth on irrigation requirement and associated rice yield. For this study historical weather data for both sites were used. Within seasons, the amount of irrigation water application was higher for \{CS\} than for any of the water-saving regimes. It was found that groundwater table depth strongly affected the water-yield relationship for the water-saving regimes. Rainfed rice did not lead to significant yield reductions at Tuanlin as long as the groundwater table depth was less than 20 cm. Simulations at Los Baños with a more drought tolerant cultivar showed that \{FI\} resulted in higher yields than \{RF\} thereby requiring only 420 mm of irrigation. The soil type determined the irrigation water requirement in \{CS\} and \{SNS\} regimes. A more permeable soil requires around 2000 mm of irrigation water whereas less permeable, heavy soil types require less than half of this amount. We conclude that water savings can be considerable when water regimes are adapted to soil characteristics and rainfall dynamics. To further optimize water-saving regimes in lowland rice, groundwater table dynamics and soil permeability should be taken into account. "

Goals at different scales may be conflicting and decisions at one scale have consequences for those at other scales. Performing analyses at more than one scale is, therefore necessary in analysing future options for resource use. This paper illustrates the use of a multi-scale method enabling assessment of multi-purpose natural resource management options. Three examples of analyses that it allows are presented for Ilocos Norte province in the Philippines, at the farm household, municipal (Batac municipality) and provincial levels. Results show that: (1) Differences in resource endowments of farm households strongly affect the potential adoption rates of five well-defined alternative technologies. (2) Limited markets, inadequate infrastructure and resource endowments of farm households have large effects on resource use and goal achievement in the municipality. Not including these factors in a resource use analysis results in a so-called aggregation bias. As these are significant, ignoring them may result in misleading simulation results and policy conclusions. The aggregation bias resulting from assuming spatially fixed input and output prices is significant for Batac, which has poor farm-to-market roads. This suggests large potential benefits from improving infrastructure. The factors investigated suggest that aggregate income in the municipality is most strongly affected by the size of the market for some vegetables. (3) The differences in resource allocations resulting from prioritizing objectives at different levels reveal potential conflicts. The municipal income was highest with crops which pose more risk to farmers; our farm household analysis shows that farmers tend not to select too much of these crops. Similarly, the provincial income is highest when resources in the province are allocated such that more of the staple crop rice and less of the highly profitable cash crops are cultivated in Batac, resulting in lower income for the municipality. It is anticipated that the presented multi-scale approach will provide valuable information for joint-learning, policy discussions and decision-making regarding agricultural land use. "

Water savings in rice can be realized by alternate wetting and drying (AWD) under lowland conditions, or by aerobic rice in which the crop is grown under nonflooded conditions with supplemental irrigation. Field experimentation and simulation modelling are a powerful combination to understand complex crop-water interactions and to extrapolate site-specific empirical results to other environments and conditions. In this paper, we present results from 4 years of field experiments on \{AWD\} and aerobic rice in 2001–2004 near Kaifeng, Henan Province, China. The experimental data were used to parameterize and evaluate the rice growth model ORYZA2000. A subsequent paper reports on the extrapolation of the experimental results using \{ORYZA2000\} and on farmer-participatory testing of aerobic rice. In the lowland area of the study site, rice yields under flooded conditions were around 8000 kg ha−1 with 900 mm total (rain, irrigation) water input. Irrigation water savings were 40–70% without any yield loss by applying AWD. In the upland area of the study site, aerobic rice yielded 2400–3600 kg ha−1, using 750–1100 mm total water input. \{ORYZA2000\} satisfactorily reproduced the dynamics in measured crop variables (biomass, leaf area, N uptake) and soil water variables (ponded water depth, soil water tension). The root mean square error of predicted yield was 11% for lowland rice and 19% for aerobic rice, which was only one and a half times the error in the measured values. We concluded that \{ORYZA2000\} is sufficiently accurate to extrapolate our results on \{AWD\} and aerobic rice to different management and environmental conditions in our study area. "

The components of the water balance of these systems need to be disentangled to extrapolate water savings at the field scale to the irrigation system scale. In this study, simulation modelling was used to quantify yield, water productivity, and water balance components of alternate wetting and drying and aerobic rice in the conjunctive surface-groundwater Liuyuankou Irrigation System, Henan, China. The study on aerobic rice was supported by on-farm testing. In the lowland rice area, where groundwater tables are within the root zone of the crop, irrigation water savings of 200–900 mm can be realized by adopting alternate wetting and drying or rainfed cultivation, while maintaining yields at 6400–9200 kg ha−1. Most of the water savings are caused by reduced percolation rates, which will reduce groundwater recharge and may lead to decreased opportunities for groundwater irrigation. Evaporation losses can be reduced by a maximum of 60–100 mm by adopting rainfed cultivation. In the transition zone between lowland rice and upland crops, groundwater tables vary from 10 cm to more than 200 cm depth, and aerobic rice yields of 3800–5600 kg ha−1 are feasible with as little as two to three supplementary irrigations (totaling 150–225 mm of water). Depending on groundwater depth and amount of rainfall, either groundwater recharge or net extraction of water from the soil or the groundwater takes place. "

Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that rearrangement had occurred in these segments, affecting the open reading frame. A polypeptide encoded by \{S12\} (Pns12) of RDV-P had a duplication of 28 amino acids while 1/3 of the carboxyl terminus of Pns12 was deleted in RDV-S-6 by premature termination due to a frameshift. RDV-S is always present in plants infected with the RDV-S-6 variant, suggesting that Pns12 of RDV-S-6 is defective. On the other hand, Pns12 of RDV-P was expressed and appeared to be functional in infected cells in spite of the duplication, as demonstrated by immunoblot analyses using antibody raised against Pns12 expressed inEscherichia coli.

Field strains of X. oryzae pv. oryzae displayed a diversity of phenotypes on rice ranging from complete to partial loss of these functions. To understand the molecular basis for variation in avrXa7 function, we sequenced the alleles from seven field strains. The avrXa7 gene is an avrBs3/pthA family member and contains nuclear localization signal sequences and an acidic activation domain (AAD) in the 3′ end and a central region containing repeated sequences, all of which are important for avirulence and aggressiveness. Sequence analysis revealed changes in the avrXa7 alleles ranging from a point mutation to multiple mutations spread throughout the alleles. Some strains with identical mutant alleles exhibited different levels of aggressiveness to rice, suggesting the presence of second mutations. A point mutation found at the beginning of the \{AAD\} of one avrXa7 allele was reconstructed in the wild type gene; this mutant exhibited partial loss of avirulence and aggressiveness. Our data suggest that adaptation of X. oryzae pv. oryzae to Xa7 rice fields involves not only alterations in avrXa7, but may include changes in other gene family members resulting from recombination between family members.

The methylene blue staining technique was used to characterize the water-conducting pores in terms of number, stained area, and total pore perimeter at 10 cm depth intervals of six 1 × 1 m subplots. Undisturbed 20 cm X 25 cm soil cores taken from the raised beds were subjected to three 30 mm h−1 rains. Volume, aluminum and sulphate concentration of the outflows were monitored. Consolidation with time decreased the area and perimeter of water-conducting pores in 2-year-old pineapple beds to about a third, and bypass flow rate to about 80% of those in newly constructed beds. Consolidation did not affect macropore network geometry in yam beds because they were subjected to annual tillage and yam tubers were uprooted regularly.

In the example described below, two genes in the rice α-amylase gene family (RAmy3D and RAmy3E) produce 20% to 40% of the total protein secreted in rice cell suspension cultures. The salient features of the rice cell fermentation system include high-level, regulated expression and secretion of α-amylase proteins into the culture medium. Furthermore, the lower temperatures required for plant cell culture and a simple medium based on sucrose instead of glucose may provide the cost advantage needed to make plant cell fermentation of proteins competitive with microbial fermentation systems. Cell culture also provides a model system to study the biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology of genes expressed in cell culture. Transgenic rice cell lines have been used to demonstrate the metabolic regulation of one of the rice α-amylase genes, RAmy3D. The transcription of \{RAmy3D\} in cell culture is induced 165-fold when sucrose is removed from the culture medium. Similar regulation of \{RAmy3D\} has been observed in the rice plant. The RAmy3D/GUS promoter–reporter gene fusion is just one of many gene constructs that can be used to investigate the transcriptional, translational and post-translational characteristics of this system. Such information is crucial for the development of efficient and economical protein expression systems based on plant cell fermentation. "

There are, however, many uncertainties that influence these predictions. Despite the significance of weather on plant diseases, comprehensive analysis of how climate change will influence plant diseases that impact primary production in agricultural systems is presently unavailable. Evaluation of the limited literature in this area suggests that the most likely impact of climate change will be felt in three areas: in losses from plant diseases, in the efficacy of disease management strategies and in the geographical distribution of plant diseases. Climate change could have positive, negative or no impact on individual plant diseases. More research is needed to obtain base-line information on different disease systems. Most plant disease models use different climatic variables and operate at a different spatial and temporal scale than do the global climate models. Improvements in methodology are necessary to realistically assess disease impacts at a global scale. "

This study was designed to characterize the genetic diversity within a subset of rice germplasm with different adaptations to saline soils using microsatellite markers. Salt tolerance was then analyzed among molecularly characterized genotypes. Plants of 33 genotypes were grown in sand tanks under greenhouse condition and irrigated with Yoshida nutrient solution. Two salt treatments were imposed with electrical conductivities of 0.9 dS m−1 (control) and 6.5 dS m−1 (6:1 molar ratio of NaCl and CaCl2). A total of 123 alleles were generated at 25 microsatellite loci among the 33 genotypes. Genotypes of japonica rice grouped into three clusters and those of indica rice grouped into two clusters based on microsatellite markers. Thirty percent of the alleles detected in 20 breeding lines were not identified in the cultivars analyzed. These alleles may provide favorable allelic combinations if the breeding lines are used for intercrosses. Physiological and morphological characters under salt stress were significantly (P=0.05) different among microsatellite clusters. There was a highly significant correlation (r=−0.25; P=0.005) between the matrices of Jaccard genetic similarity based on microsatellite markers and taxonomic distance based on ion data. These results indicate that the adaptation of rice to saline soils is different among genotypes with diverse genetic backgrounds. Implications for engineering salt tolerance are: (1) Improving salt tolerance can be achieved by selecting parental genotypes prior to intercrossing based on microsatellite markers. (2) Phenotypic variation of ion contents in segregating populations can be increased by selecting parental genotypes prior to intercrossing based on microsatellite markers. (3) Different salt tolerance components can be combined into a cultivar by intercrossing genotypes from different microsatellite clusters with diverse salt tolerance mechanisms. "

Modulation in the expression of the PrGH3:gusA fusion was assessed by histological \{GUS\} staining in rice tissues following the treatment of transgenic rice seedlings with or without auxins such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) or N-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), and the auxin transport inhibitors N-(1-naphthyl)phthalamic acid (NPA), kaempferol, quercetin, apigenin or Nod factors under axenic conditions. In this work we demonstrate that soybean \{GH3\} promoter is active in rice, and the GH3-gusA reporter system can be utilized as a molecular marker to monitor the changes in auxin levels during organogenesis of this monocot plant. Our studies revealed distinct patterns of \{GH3\} activity prior to and during various developmental phases of lateral root differentiation in rice. The \{GH3\} expression patterns during lateral root development in rice showed considerable similarities with those occurring during comparable stages of lateral root development in dicots, implying that the requirement of auxin for the morphogenesis of lateral roots is similar in evolutionarily distinct monocots and dicots.

Recent developments in crop growth modelling provide a physiologically based approach to simulate pest damage and crop interactions. A generic approach to simulate the damage effects of single or multiple pests is presented using the CERES-rice crop growth model. Pest or damage levels from field scouting reports can be entered and damage is applied to appropriate physiological coupling points within the crop growth model including leaf area index, stand density, intercepted light, photosynthesis, assimilate amount and translocation rate, growth of different plant organs and leaf senescence. Equations and algorithms were developed to describe competition among multiple pests and to link the computed total damage to the corresponding variables of the crop model. A sensitivity analysis was conducted for various individual damage coupling points and for the damage effects of defoliators, weed competition, leaf blast and sheath blight disease. The general response of the model compared favorably with values reported in the literature. The model was also tested for sensitivity to multiple damage. Multiple pest damage usually had less-than-additive effects on yield loss. The approach provides a basis to explore dynamic pest and crop interactions in determining pest management strategies which minimize yield loss. "

NGR234, and root colonization was assessed in comparison to comparably inoculated control plants. The data showed that expression of \{PSL\} and \{GS52\} significantly promoted rhizobial colonization of root epidermal cells including root hairs in rice. In addition, in the case of R. leguminosarum bv. viciae and B. japonicum \{USDA110\} colonization of the psl and gs52 transgenic rice plants, respectively, the bacterial cells were found to preferentially home towards and aggregate maximally at the root hair tip regions rather than on the root hair “stalks”. The above data suggest that the lectins \{PSL\} and GS52, which participate in rhizobial recognition by root epidermal cells in pea and soybean, respectively, are also able to facilitate rhizobial attachment and colonization of the epidermal cells in rice roots. Moreover, aggregation of R. leguminosarum bv. viciae and B. japonicum \{USDA110\} cells preferentially at root hair tip regions suggest that similar to legumes, the \{PSL\} and \{GS52\} lectins are targeted to the root hair tips in transgenic rice, enabling higher bacterial attachment/colonization at the tip region. Rhizobial colonization at root hair tips in the psl and gs52 rice plants frequently led to the localized dissolution of the cell wall creating perforations at the tip region. It is likely that the presence of lectins, such as \{PSL\} and \{GS52\} leads to structural modifications in cell wall organization of the root hair/epidermal cells, making them prone to localized dissolution by the hydrolytic activity of compatible rhizobia to permit invasion of the root cells.

Farmers generally overestimate the seriousness of the rice leaf folder from visible damage and apply insecticides early, and therefore, changing perceptions may help reduce the perceived benefits of unnecessary spraying. Farmers in Long An province, Vietnam, were motivated to ‘test’ a heuristic or rule of thumb, ‘insecticide spraying for leaf folder control in the first 40 days after sowing is not needed’, by the distribution of carefully designed communication media materials. The media reached 97% of the farmers in the study sites. Leaflets, radio drama and posters had the most effective reach. Thirty-one months after the media introduction, the number of insecticide sprays dropped significantly from 3.35 sprays per farmer per season to 1.56. The proportion of farmers spraying at early and late tillering and booting stages was reduced from 59%, 84% and 85% to 0.2%, 19% and 30%, respectively. Those who did not use any insecticides increased from 1% to 32%. Correspondingly, farmers' perceptions of leaf folder damage as indicated in a belief index, decreased significantly from 11.25 to 7.62. The proportion of farmers who believed that leaf folders could cause losses was reduced from 70% to 25%, as did those who believed that early season spraying was required, from 77% to 23%, respectively. Farmers' insecticide spray frequencies and the belief index were significantly correlated and were not significantly different between farmers who had attended farmer field school training and those who had not. The cost (insecticide and labour) saving was the most important incentive for farmers to stop early season spraying as cited by 89% of the farmers. A survey of 12 other districts in Long An showed that 82% of the province's 210000 households were reached. About 20% had not applied any insecticides, 77% had stopped early season spraying and the average number of insecticide sprays was 1.6 (compared with 1.55 in study sites).

Two weather generators, \{WGEN\} and WMAK, from the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), were utilized to produce estimated daily weather data for each location. Thirty years of daily weather data produced by one of the generators for each location were used as input to the combined model to simulate blast epidemics for each temperature change. Maximum blast severity and the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) caused by leaf blast resulted from 30-yr simulations were statistically analyzed for each temperature change and for each location. Simulations suggest that temperature changes had significant effects on disease development at most locations. However, the effect varied in different agroecological zones. In the cool subtropics such as Japan and northern China, elevation of temperature above normal temperature resulted in more severe blast epidemics. In warm/cool humid subtropics, elevation of temperature caused significantly less blast epidemics. However, lower temperature caused insignificant difference in disease epidemics compared with that in normal temperature. Conditions in the humid tropics were opposite to those in cool areas, where daily temperature changes by −1°C and −3°C resulted in significantly more severe blast epidemics, and temperature changes by +1°C and +3°C caused less severe blast. Scenarios showing blast intensity as affected by temperature change in different agroecological zones were generated with a geographic information system (GIS). "

The effect of straw mulching, soil surface ploughing and water table depths on aluminum dynamics during the dry season and the first three weeks of the rainy season 1994 were studied in field and lysimeter conditions in an acid sulphate soil, in Mekong Delta, Vietnam. More acidity was produced in the subsoil when the water table was maintained at 60 and 90 cm compared with 30 cm deep. The amount of aluminum that accumulated in the topsoil during the dry season was linearly proportional to the cumulated evaporation. Straw mulching significantly lowered the dry season aluminum accumulation (0.6 cmol(+) kg−1) in comparison with nonmulching treatment (2.0 cmol(+) kg−1). Surface ploughing also reduced aluminum accumulation, but the reduction was not statistically significant compared with nonploughed plots. Rains at the beginning of the rainy season raised the water table rapidly to the topsoil layer. Aluminum brought up with the rising water table greatly increased the toxicity level in the topsoil and nullified the positive effects of dry season soil treatments. Controlling groundwater level to below the topsoil and enhancing the leaching effects at the beginning of the rainy season are important for retaining the effects of the dry season treatments. "

Conditions in China have led to demand for high and increasing rice yields, resulting in intensive cultivation and adoption of fertilizer responsive varieties. The consequence has been widespread pest infestations. Many studies have estimated pesticide productivity, but few have estimated the productivity of alternative methods of pest control, namely host-plant resistance. None have estimated the substitutability between these methods of pest-control. The productivity of pesticides and host-plant resistance, and the substitutability between them is measured using two-stage Cobb–Douglas and translog production functions. Under intensive rice production systems in eastern China, pesticide productivity is low compared to the productivity of host-plant resistance. In fact, returns to pesticide use are negative at the margin. Host-plant resistance is an effective substitute for pesticides and substantial reductions in pesticide use could be achieved, with no loss in rice production, through improvements in host-plant resistance. These results suggest that pesticides are being overused in eastern China and host-plant resistance is being under-utilized. Government policies to promote increased pesticides in rice might be ill advised given the low productivity and negative returns, particularly in light of well known negative externalities associated with pesticide use.

This paper collates information from government surveys, farmer interviews and roadside mapping to track the distribution and rate of spread of the snail. The paper also examines the impact on the rice (Oryza sativa L.) sector of the snail invasion and farmers' preferred management practices in response to high snail densities. Since its initial introduction, and following severe flooding in Guayas and Los Rios Provinces during 2008, the snail has invaded most of Ecuador's major rice-growing regions. The snail invasion of Ecuador has been fundamentally different from other regional invasions because of the presence of a specialized snail predator, the snail kite, Rostrhamus sociabilis Vieillot. Snail kite densities increased in response to the snail invasion, but snail densities have remained high, particularly in areas of ‘stepped rice’ – where rice is planted to floodplains in response to natural receding of water levels. The Ecuadorean government responded to the snail invasion by investing in data collection, farmer training and molluscicide distribution. Farmers have overwhelmingly opted to control the snails using insecticides and molluscicides despite training in alternative control methods; however, farmers have experienced increased rice damage from insects and diseases that may be associated with high pesticide use. Farmers perceive snail kites as beneficial predators, but have not been pro-active in enhancing kite numbers or their efficiency. We present a series of recommendations for sustainable apple snail management in Ecuador. "

A subset of a doubled haploid (DH) line population of CT9993-5-10-1-M/IR62266-42-6-2 was evaluated for variation in plant water status, phenology, reproductive-growth traits, yield and yield components under reproductive-stage drought stress and irrigated (non-stress) conditions in the field.

Total dry matter, number of panicles per plant, harvest index, panicle harvest index, panicle fertility, pollen fertility, spikelet fertility and hundred grain weight had significant positive correlations with grain yield under drought stress. A total of 46 \{QTLs\} were identified for the various traits under stress and non-stress conditions with phenotypic effect ranging from 9.5 to 35.6% in this study. \{QTLs\} for panicle exsertion, peduncle length and pollen fertility, identified for the first time in this study, could be useful in marker-assisted breeding (MAB) for drought resistance in rice. A total of 97 \{QTLs\} linked to plant growth, phenology, reproductive-growth traits, yield and its components under non-stress and drought stress, identified in this study as well as from earlier published information, were subjected to meta-analysis.

Hence, the aim of our three-year (six seasons) experiments during early-season (ESR; Luliangyou996) and late-season (LSR; C-liangyou396) rice in southern China was to identify key yield parameters and optimum resource use options to enhance the crop's climatic yield potential. Grain yield averaged across all three years with effective N management combined with post-anthesis shallow wetting and drying was 32.8% and 37.1% higher than the normal farmers’ practice in Liuyang County in \{ESR\} and LSR, respectively. More spikelets m−2 were the key to achieving high yield potential, further supported by increased leaf area index and high radiation interception and internal use efficiency. The split application of nitrogen in combination with shallow wetting and drying allowed for better N uptake, use efficiency and partitioning, leading to enhanced biomass and yield. The high yield potential, however, was not just a function of genetics and management but also depended on the climatic conditions prevailing, particularly temperature and radiation. In ESR, lower temperature during vegetative stage reduced overall biomass and sink size while subsequent higher temperature reduced the total grain filling period by 17 days compared with LSR, indicating a climatic condition-driven decline in yield potential rather than lower genetic potential of the super hybrids. A lack of correlation of spikelets panicle−1 and spikelets m−2 with grain-filling percentage in \{LSR\} provided evidence that a larger sink does not necessarily result in poor grain filling when sufficient time and assimilates for grain filling are provided, which is more climate dependent. Our work highlights the benefits of integrating nutrient, water and agronomic management options to achieve high \{NUE\} and grain yield. "

The ability to grow deep roots is currently the most accepted target trait for improving drought resistance, but genetic variation has been reported for a number of traits that may affect drought response. Here, we review variation in rice root response to drought from a physiological perspective in terms of morphology and function with respect to the different growth environments (upland and lowland) commonly used by farmers.

Agronomic approaches to reducing the water and labor demands of rice-based cropping systems include crop diversification to include crops with higher water productivity, direct-seeded rice, and irrigation scheduling based on soil water potential or alternate wetting and drying cycles. However, weeds are a major constraint to increasing rice productivity in these systems. A two-year study was conducted to identify the changes in weed population and to evaluate the efficacy of herbicides and their effect on crop performance in a sprinkler-irrigated maize-rice cropping system. The dominance of weed species shifted from a grass weed Echinochloa colona to broadleaved weeds, such as Hedyotis corymbosa, Lindernia spp., and Murdannia nudiflora. At 41 days after sowing (DAS) and at tasseling stage, glyphosate application provided a 90–100% decrease in total weed biomass of maize. The combined effects of all the herbicides applied in rice provided almost 100% control in total weed biomass at 40 DAS. However, the herbicide schedule in the cropping system was ineffective in controlling M. nudiflora. The weed control treatments had no significant effect on the yield of maize [8.7 and 11.5 (herbicide-treated) and 8.4 and 12.0 (partially weedy) Mg ha−1 in 2012 and 2013, respectively], but rice grain yield was influenced significantly. Rice grain yield in herbicide-treated plots in 2012 and 2013 were more than 1.5 and 8.5 times greater than yield achieved in the weedy plots, respectively. A significant negative relationship was found between rice grain yield and weed biomass in both years. Future research in maize-rice cropping systems should focus on the integration of appropriate agronomic practices with herbicide rotation to ensure that weed management strategies are sustainable and effective, and to avoid the risk of herbicide resistance developing in weed populations.

Apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) mapping may therefore be useful for characterizing spatial variability and improving phenotyping efforts in drought screening trials. \{ECa\} mapping was conducted over two seasons in lowland rice drought phenotyping trials. \{ECa\} was positively correlated with clay content and soil depth, and negatively correlated with volumetric soil water content during periods of moderate to severe drought. In addition, \{ECa\} was negatively correlated with indicators of plant performance including canopy temperature, normalized difference vegetation index, biomass, plant height, and grain yield. The results suggest that clay content and topsoil depth were the primary factors influencing the timing and severity of the drought response during the dry down of the field. Overall, the results illustrate the usefulness of \{ECa\} mapping for the spatio-temporal characterization of soil heterogeneity that influences plant performance under drought in lowland rice fields. \{ECa\} mapping can be useful for optimizing experimental plot layouts to ensure their uniformity and to improve validity of drought phenotyping and breeding trials.

There is a strong interest in identifying rice genotypes which effectively utilize resources on the land, and in developing low-cost production technology for tropical Asia. A method proposed earlier to evaluate N utilization efficiency of 24 rice genotypes, and initially tested on a soil with high N fertility, was tested on a soil with low N fertility in order to evaluate the performance of the genotypes under contrasting conditions. In six consecutive seasons on an infertile Vertic Tropaquept soil in Maligaya, Nueva Ecija, The Philippines, field performance was ranked on the basis of 12 parameters considered in the initial study. Significant differences among genotypes were observed in 68 out of 72 instances during the six seasons. Five parameters were selected for ranking in unfertilized plots and seven for ranking in plots receiving N fertilizer. Principal-component analysis showed that yield was the most significant single parameter in most instances. A two-parameter combination involving yield and ratio of panicle weight to either total N uptake or soil N uptake, however, correlated much better with rankings based on five or seven parameters. In contrast to the \{IRRI\} data on a fertile Andaqueptic Haplaquoll soil, significant differences among genotype means for soil N uptake in fertilized plots and total N uptake in unfertilized plots were found in all six seasons at Maligaya. Genotypes 11 and 18 ranked consistently high with all combinations of parameters, whether fertilized or unfertilized. For example, genotype 11 ranked first in all cases at IRRI, and either first or second in all cases at Maligaya. Others such as genotypes 5 and 12 ranked consistently low. The results indicate consistency in rice-genotype performance on soils deficient in N supply as well as those adequately supplied, in both wet and dry seasons, thus extending the applicability of the methodology.

The study used 27 cultivars, which include those often used for drought studies in rainfed lowland and upland ecosystems. Mild water-deficit conditions were generated by adding polyethylene glycol 1500 to nutrient solution to provide an osmotic stress of −0.5 \{MPa\} to 3-week-old seedlings. Water deficit caused a larger reduction in leaf area than in shoot dry matter, demonstrating the greater sensitivity of leaf enlargement to water stress than dry matter accumulation. Visual scoring to assess damage was found to be a reliable measure of tolerance for water deficit. Cultivars tolerant of mild water stress had a high relative transpiration (transpiration under stress compared with that under non-stressed conditions), low initial leaf area (leaf area before the onset of water stress), high carbon isotope discrimination in the leaf, and low specific leaf weight. These factors enabled tolerant cultivars to maintain high moisture in the leaf and to have high values of leaf area, shoot dry matter, and sugar and starch in tissues in stressed plants relative to the control. Mild water deficit increased water use efficiency in stressed plants, caused more degradation of starch than sugar in the leaf blade, and resulted in more accumulation of these carbohydrates in the leaf sheath.

abstract = "The primary determinant of yield in relation to solar radiation and photosynthesis is the radiation conversion factor (RCF, also called radiation-use efficiency): the amount of aboveground dry matter produced from each megajoule of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intercepted by the crop. The \{RCF\} of rice (2.2 g MJ–1) is lower than that of wheat (2.7 g MJ–1) or maize (3.3 g MJ–1). If genetic engineering could produce rice with \{C4\} photosynthesis that possessed the \{RCF\} of maize, a 50% increase in yield would be conceivable. Analysis of losses of potential fixed carbon when scaling up from quantum yield to \{RCF\} identifies the differences between \{C3\} and \{C4\} plants. The scaling-up progresses from photochemistry in the cell (nanoseconds) through leaf and canopy photosynthesis (seconds to hours) to crop growth (weeks to months). Rice and maize differ in several respects. Rice has losses from photorespiration but maize has a lower theoretical quantum yield because of the energy costs of the \{C4\} pathway. In the hierarchy of scale, there are losses at the cell level from inactive absorption of \{PAR\} and these are smaller in maize than in rice. The loss at the transition between leaf and canopy photosynthesis is also smaller in maize. Scaling up from leaf to canopy includes changing from leaf photosynthesis unsaturated for \{PAR\} (in which each additional unit of absorbed \{PAR\} produces the same additional amount of fixed carbon) to photosynthesis by the canopy with leaves at varying saturation depending on \{PAR\} incident on the leaf and on leaf age and photosynthetic capability. The analysis shows that a \{C4\} rice with improved RCF, approaching that of maize, must have higher quantum yield and higher rates of leaf photosynthesis. Suppression of photorespiration will increase quantum yield provided that the energy costs of the \{C4\} pathway, including leakage of carbon dioxide from the bundle sheath, are not much above the minimum observed in \{C4\} plants. Higher rates of leaf photosynthesis, arising from increased concentration of carbon dioxide around Rubisco, increase canopy photosynthesis and make it less prone to saturation by PAR. Many features of \{C4\} photosynthesis must be introduced into a \{C4\} rice, and must operate with high efficiency and coordination, if \{RCF\} and yield are to be improved significantly. "

With the onset of drought, a yield reduction due to a decrease in biomass was observed in both susceptible and tolerant lines. However, after an initial reduction in yield, tolerant lines were able to sustain a yield loss more effectively than susceptible lines by better maintenance of biomass and higher harvest index. Under intermittent drought stress, genotypes with the ability to maintain higher biomass, reflected in terms of high early vigor recorded 3 wk after transplanting, recorded higher grain yield than genotypes with low early vigor. Lines with high early vigor yielded higher under both irrigated non-stress and intermittent drought stress situations. Under intermittent stress, plants with high vigor, low vigor, or random plants with high or low vigor coming from tolerant × susceptible crosses yielded higher than did the plants with the same vigor coming from susceptible × susceptible crosses. Under both irrigated non-stress and intermittent drought stress situations, early vigor showed significant genetic correlation with grain yield and could be included as an efficient selection criterion to improve yield in the lowlands.

Field experiments were carried out in Punjab, India, during 2002–2006 to compare irrigation water use and productivity of transplanted rice and drill-sown wheat on fresh and permanent beds and conventionally tilled flats. Total irrigation applications to conventionally tilled wheat (CTW) and wheat on beds were similar on both soils, in both small plots and in a farmers’ field, with one exception—irrigation amount on fresh beds was 10% lower than on permanent beds in the farmers’ field. Yields on beds and \{CTW\} were similar on the loam, but were sometimes lower on beds on the sandy loam. In the small plots, irrigation water productivity (WPIW) on beds and in \{CTW\} was similar (mean 2 g kg−1) on the loam, but about 20% on the sandy loam, mainly due to lower yields. In the farmers’ field, \{WPIW\} (1.5 g kg−1) was 15% higher on the fresh beds than on the permanent beds due to lower irrigation amount. The amount of irrigation water applied to rice on permanent beds and puddled transplanted rice (PTR) was similar in the small plots on the sandy loam. However, on the loam, irrigation application to the permanent beds was significantly higher, by about 18%. There was a significant decline in grain yield on the permanent beds relative to that in \{PTR\} over the 4 years, on both soils. \{WPIW\} on the permanent beds decreased with time on both soils, mainly due to declining grain yield. Irrigation applications to rice on fresh beds were lower than applications to the puddled flats (by 11% on the sandy loam, and by 20–24% on the loam) while yields were 7 and 15% lower, resulting in similar \{WPIW\} on fresh beds and PTR. Reducing irrigation application from full-furrow to half-furrow depth in the farmers’ field reduced the irrigation amount on both permanent and fresh beds by 40–50%, but yield was also reduced by about 20%. The results show that beds do not always save irrigation water or increase \{WPIW\} in comparison with conventionally tilled flat fields, for both rice and wheat under our soil and environmental conditions. The effects of the beds depend on irrigation/water management (of both beds and flats), age of the beds and soil type. The effect of beds on irrigation amount is also likely to depend on factors such as depth to the water table, levelness of the soil surface, and size and shape of fields relative to irrigation flow rate.

Adapted varieties are usually direct dry seeded and the crop grown under aerobic soil conditions with supplementary irrigation as necessary. Occasionally, yield failures occur which may be related to soil health problems. In the dry season of 2006 and 2007, we conducted a field experiment in the Philippines, to identify the major causes of such yield failure. Four treatments were implemented: (i) Control of direct dry-seeded rice (improved upland variety Apo), (ii) Biocide application, (iii) transplanting into aerobic soil, and (iv) 1 year fallow. Yield in the Biocide treatment was 2 t ha−1 in both years. In all other treatments, yield was 0–0.3 t ha−1. Plants grown in the Biocide treatment showed a reduced degree of galling of roots caused by root-knot nematodes (RKN) and better general root health than the Control treatment. Potentially pathogenic fungi were isolated from root samples (Pythium sp., Fusarium sp., and a Rhizoctonia-like species). Abiotic effects of the Biocide treatment were an increase in KCl-extractable N (initial season 2007) and a decrease in initial soil pH. In the Control treatment, soil pH increased from 6.5 to 8.0 over the two seasons. In 2007, plant tissue analysis indicated Mn deficiency in the Control treatment. Plants that were subjected to foliar micronutrient sprays reacted positively to Fe and Mn sprays in the Control treatment, and Mn spray in the Biocide treatment. We concluded that the Biocide application led to favorable soil conditions by reducing biotic stresses such as \{RKN\} and improving nutrient availability. In the other treatments, an interaction of \{RKN\} and micronutrient deficiencies with increasing soil pH led to yield failure. "

High temperature during flowering resulted in increased pollen sterility with the degree of sterility exacerbated if rice was exposed to both high temperature and increased \{CO2\} concentration. The critical air temperature for spikelet sterility (as determined from the number of germinated pollen grains on the stigma) was reduced by ca 1°C at elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide. We speculate that this downward shift in critical temperature may be due to the observed increase in air temperature within the canopy at high \{CO2\} concentrations. This increase in air temperature, in turn, may be related to stomatal closure and reduced transpirational cooling in an elevated \{CO2\} environment. Data from this experiment indicate that increasing \{CO2\} concentration could limit rice yield if average air temperature increased simultaneously. "

Epistasis was found to be present between Hd3a and OsMADS50IR64, Hd3a and OsMADS50Lemont, and \{RFT1\} and OsMADS50IR64. The interaction between Hd3a and OsFTL13 was not detected by single environment analysis but detected by across-environment combined analysis. Genetic analysis using a bigenic model showed that the additive and dominant effects were more important than the overall epistatic effects for all pairs of QTLs. The additive-by-additive and additive-by-dominant effects were more important than the dominant-by-dominant effect. \{QEIs\} were significant for Hd3a, RFT1, OsMADS50IR64 and OsMADS50Lemont but not for OsFTL13. The additive-by-environment and dominant-by-environment interaction effects were significant while the epistasis-by-environment interaction was not. Utilization of the known major \{QTLs\} for heading date in breeding through gene pyramiding needs take epistasis into consideration. "

The pedigrees in the \{NPT\} programme have been initiated by crossing temperate japonica varieties from China, Japan and Korea with tropical javanica land races from southeast Asia and are, thus, of a novel kind. The parents, \{F1\} and \{F3\} families of each of the two crosses were raised in completely randomised blocks and their individuals scored for twelve quantitative characters, nine of which were those specified in the \{NPT\} ideotype. The results showed that every character was heritable in both crosses, except for harvest index in the first, their heritabilities being mostly moderate to high. An assessment of the potential of these crosses indicated that it should be relatively easy to obtain transgressive segregants from both for the six characters where the \{NPT\} targets take the form of an interval, such as days to heading, culm length, number of panicles per plant and number of spikelets per panicle, but more difficult, if not impossible to accomplish this for percentage of filled spikelets and grain yield, whose targets lie well above the parental range. A striking feature of the results obtained from the second cross was a marked loss of fertility, in terms of percentage of filled spikelets, in the \{F2\} and backcross generations which, it is argued, was caused by the disruption of the independently co-adapted gene complexes of the parents by recombination and segregation at \{F1\} meiosis. The pattern of genetic correlations between characters differed markedly between the crosses, suggesting that the chief cause of these correlations was the linkage disequilibrium of genes linked in their inheritance.

The key features of this procedure are: that selection within pedigrees is delayed until individuals are effectively homozygous; that all characters are measured directly; and that decisions are based on the performance of plants that are raised in replicated and randomised trials. The replacement of the pedigree method by the new method should allow breeders to recognise and exploit the genetical variation between and within their crosses for characters of interest more efficiently than hitherto at an appreciably lower cost. While this new method has been proposed in response to a specific problem with rice, it is applicable to all crop plant species where the end products of breeding programmes are inbred lines. "

Choosing an arbitrary mathematical relationship between yield and temperature can have bizarre implications for the expressions of temperature sensitivity; especially if the temperature range is small and the relationship is applied outside the range of data.

More productive upland systems, using more fertilizer and improved varieties, are emerging in China and Philippines, and could contribute to productivity increases in rainfed environments in other countries. Here, we evaluate, on-station and on-farm, the yield under upland management of improved indica upland cultivars selected for yield under high-fertility conditions. These cultivars are compared with traditional and improved tropical japonica upland varieties, and with elite indica high-yielding varieties (HYV) developed for irrigated lowland production, to characterize the features of varieties that produce high yields in favorable upland environments. Forty-four improved and traditional varieties and experimental lines were evaluated in irrigated lowland, non-stressed upland, moderately stressed upland, severely water-stressed upland, and low-fertility upland environments in southern Luzon, Philippines. Correlations between yields in non-stress and mild-stress environments were low but positive. Some cultivars, like IR55423-01, were among the highest yielding under both conditions, indicating that high yield and moderate water-stress tolerance can be combined. Upland-selected indica varieties yielded 3.56 t ha−1 in favorable upland environments on-station in southern Luzon, outperforming improved tropical japonica and irrigated varieties by 23 and 69%, respectively. They were also the highest-yielding class in infertile, acid soils. The improved upland indica cultivars are about 110 cm tall under favorable upland conditions and maintain a harvest index of nearly 0.4, or about one-third higher than other cultivar types. The best upland-adapted rice varieties produced average yields on-farm of 3.3 and 4.1 t ha−1 in southern Luzon and Yunnan, respectively, outyielding traditional checks by 30–50% with moderate N application. Screening under both high-fertility, non-stress conditions and moderate reproductive-stage stress appears to be needed to develop cultivars combining high-yield potential with drought tolerance. Upland-adapted indica cultivars offer a new approach to increasing productivity and reducing risk in Asian rainfed rice systems. "

We investigate that claim. A mechanistic and an empirical model of rice crop growth were used to make predictions of yield using the same weather data sets used in the regression analyses that supported the 15 and 10% claims. The models were used to predict yield with temperature changed by −2, −1, 0, +1 and +2 °C relative to the average for all the years (26 °C) with solar radiation held constant. Over the 4 °C temperature range, \{ORYZA2000\} and \{EEQ\} predicted yield declines of about 0.37 and 0.71 t ha−1 °C−1 (3.5 and 7.6% °C−1 from the base yield at 26 °C). When the actual weather data for each year were used in the models, there was no significant relationship between the predictions for each year and mean daily air temperature. Even though minimum temperature was not used for the simulation of any processes in the models, predicted grain yields were significantly correlated with minimum temperature. The slope of the regression line between predicted yield and minimum temperature for the models gave a yield decline of about 1.5 t ha−1 °C−1 (which was 13.7% °C−1 from the base yield at a minimum temperature of 22.1 °C). When the weather data for the years 1992–2003 were analyzed, there was a significant negative correlation between solar radiation and minimum temperature. The lowest yields occurred in the wettest years and there was a significant negative relationship between harvest index and rainfall. We conclude that temperature responses of the models are adequate for predicting the observed results. Crop responses to temperature (below the high temperatures that cause infertility in rice) are of the order of −0.5 t ha−1 °C−1 (or about −6% °C−1 at the base yield at average mean daily temperature of 26 °C), once they are separated from the effects of other environmental factors. Yield declines calculated by regression from selected weather elements can be misleading because of correlations among the weather elements. "

The objectives of this research were (a) to quantify the effects of high temperature on spikelet fertility and harvest index of rice; (b) to determine if there were species, ecotype, and/or cultivar differences in response to high temperature; and (c) to understand the reasons for lower and/or differential spikelet fertility and harvest index of rice cultivars at high temperatures. Fourteen rice cultivars of different species (Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima), ecotypes (indica and japonica) and origin (temperate and tropical) were exposed to ambient and high temperature (ambient + 5 °C) at Gainesville, Florida. High temperature significantly decreased spikelet fertility across all cultivars, but effects varied among cultivars. Based on decreases in spikelet fertility at high temperature, cultivar N-22 was most tolerant, while cultivars L-204, M-202, Labelle, Italica Livorna, WAB-12, CG-14 and CG-17 were highly susceptible and cultivars M-103, S-102, Koshihikari, IR-8 and IR-72 were moderately susceptible to high temperature. There were no clear species or ecotype differences, as some cultivars in each species or within ecotypes of tropical and temperature origin were equally susceptible to high temperature (for example M-202 temperate japonica, Labelle tropical japonica, CG-14 O. glaberrima, and WAB-12 interspecific). Decreased spikelet fertility and cultivar difference at high temperature were due mainly to decreased pollen production and pollen reception (pollen numbers on stigma). Lower spikelet fertility at elevated temperature resulted in fewer filled grains, lower grain weight per panicle, and decreased harvest index. There is a potential for genetic improvement for heat tolerance, thus it is important to screen and identify heat-tolerant cultivars. Spikelet fertility at high temperature can be used as a screening tool for heat tolerance during the reproductive phase. "

For cowpea, chilling tolerance during emergence has been associated with two independent seed traits: a specific dehydrin protein and slow electrolyte leakage in chilling conditions as a measure of membrane integrity. We screened \{F2\} and backcross populations for the presence of the dehydrin protein in seed using immunoblot analysis. Segregation of the dehydrin protein indicated a single dominant gene controls its expression. We screened four sets of cowpea accessions with diverse origins for the two traits that had been associated with chilling tolerance and the presence of hard seed that did not readily imbibe water. The hard seed trait also may enhance chilling tolerance since slower imbibition of water at low temperature can reduce chilling injury. We tested the hypothesis that the extent of these three chilling-tolerance traits may vary for germplasm populations of subtropical and tropical origins because tropical environments exhibit little chilling. The dehydrin protein was present in many landraces (59% out of 140) that evolved in subtropical zones around the Mediterranean sea where soils often are cool during emergence. However, the dehydrin protein also was present in most of the tropical accessions (88% out of 59), which suggests that it may have an additional adaptive role during seed maturation and/or germination since chilling tolerance would not be of significance in the tropics. Only three out of 61 \{US\} cultivars, which had been developed in subtropical zones where soils can be cool, contained the dehydrin protein. Only four out of 40 lines in a population of tropical origin that had been selected for chilling tolerance during vegetative and reproductive growth contained the dehydrin protein in their seed. Genotypes were identified that had similar slow electrolyte leakage from seeds at low temperature as the chilling tolerant line ‘UCR 1393-2-11’, but none of these accessions also contained the dehydrin protein as does ‘UCR 1393-2-11’. Frequency of hard seeds was high among Mediterranean landraces (48%) and \{US\} cultivars (21%) but low among tropical accessions (5%).

abstract = "Intensification of rice-based cropping systems in Asia has substantially increased production of food and associated crop residues. The interval between crops in these systems is often brief, making it attractive for farmers to burn residues in the field to hasten and facilitate tillage for the next crop. Open-air burning causes serious air quality problems affecting human health and safety, and it has been banned by many Asian governments. In this chapter, we evaluate for rice-based cropping systems existing and emerging in-field alternatives to burning residues based on criteria of productivity, profitability, environmental impact, and sustainability. In intensive rice monocropping systems, residue is typically managed under conditions of soil flooding and anaerobic decomposition during the rice crop. In systems, where rice is rotated with an upland (non-flooded) crop, there are two major categories: residue of upland crop managed during flooded rice and rice residue managed during the upland crop. One option during the flooded rice crop is incorporation of residues from the previous rice or upland crop into the soil. Many studies have examined incorporation of crop residue during land preparation for flooded rice. In the vast majority of cases there was no significant increase in yield or profit. Residue decomposition in anaerobic flooded soil substantially increases methane (CH4) emission relative to residue removal. Surface retention of residue during rice cropping is challenging to implement because residue must be removed from the field during conventional tillage with soil flooding (i.e., puddling) and then returned. Alternatively, rice must be established without the traditional puddling that has helped sustain its productivity. Mulch is a good option for rice residue management during the upland crop, especially with reduced and no tillage. Mulch can increase yield, water use efficiency, and profitability, while decreasing weed pressure. It can slightly increase nitrous oxide (N2O) emission compared with residue incorporation or removal, but N fertilization and water management are typically more important factors controlling \{N2O\} emission than residue management. Long-term studies of residue removal have indicated that removing residue from continuous rice systems with near continuous soil flooding does not adversely affect soil organic matter (SOM). The use of crop residue as a mulch with reduced or no tillage for upland crops should be promoted in rice-based cropping systems. On the contrary, residues from the crop preceding rice on puddled and flooded soil can be considered for removal for off-field uses. "

Direct observations of predation on field-exposed eggs showed that in two seasons Metioche vittaticollis (Stål) and Anaxipha longipennis (Serville) were the major predators of leaffolder eggs. Together these crickets took the largest part of all eggs consumed during observation (92%) and had the highest ratio of visits with predation to their total observed visits to plants with leaffolder eggs. Furthermore, the activity pattern of the crickets matched best the daily pattern of egg disappearance, and the seasonal trends in their observed visits correlated best with the seasonal trends in egg disappearance. Minor predators feeding on field-exposed rice leaffolder eggs were Ophionea nigrofasciata Schmidt-Goebel, Micraspis sp., and Conocephalus longipennis (de Haan). The latter species was the most commonly observed egg predator, but had a negligible share in the total predation. In petri dish tests the consumption of leaffolder eggs by the predatory crickets M. vittaticollis and A. longipennis was far greater than that of four other predators. Female cricket adults consumed at least 80 eggs per day, and all individuals accepted leaffolder eggs as food. According to daily egg consumption and acceptance rates, the predators ranked as follows: M. vittaticollis, A. longipennis &gt;Micraspis sp. &gt;O. nigrofasciata &gt;Paederus fuscipes Curtis, C. longipennis. Predator ranking according to the ratio of visits with predation to total visits in the field was identical to the ranking based on the egg consumption tests. Due to their large predation potential, predatory crickets will probably play an important role in leaffolder egg predation, even when their densities are low compared to those of other predator species.

Mass maturity (defined as the end of the seed-filling phase) varied only between 18 and 20 d after 50% anthesis. In five of the six treatment combinations maximum potential longevity was not achieved until 12-19 d after mass maturity. In contrast, the maximum potential longevity of seeds of a japonica rice cultivar produced in the warmer regime was obtained in the first harvest after mass maturity. After mass maturity, the potential longevity of the japonica rice seed lots produced in the warmer environment was much less than that for the cooler environments. Maximum potential longevity was also consistently greater in the cooler than the warmer regime for the two indica cultivars, although the difference in \{K1\} was small (0·3-0·5). The deleterious effect of increase in temperature on seed quality development was not detected until after mass maturity. Maximum potential longevity in the cooler regime was greatest in the glutinous indica (K1 = 3·9) and least in the japonica cultivar (K1 = 3·1). It is concluded that the japonica cultivar is not as well adapted to warm seed production regimes as the indica cultivars. Consequently, subject to confirmation, this research suggest that the seed production of japonica cultivars for long-term genetic conservation should be undertaken, whenever possible, in warm temperate environments.

This article summarizes the advances in aerobic rice management researches in the North China Plain, focusing on yield formation and its bottleneck. High-yielding and good-quality aerobic rice varieties adapted to aerobic soil conditions have been released officially and adopted by farmers in North China. The varieties Handao 502 and Handao 297 have been recognized as the most promising varieties reaching a yield level ranging 3.5-5.0 t ha−1 with 450-650 mm water input. Compared with lowland rice, water input in aerobic rice was more than 50% lower, and water productivity was 60% higher. Researches on responses of rice cultivars to nitrate nitrogen (N) and ammonium N supplied at early growth stages provided the first evidence for a preference of aerobic rice \{HD297\} for nitrate N supply, compared with the lowland rice variety. Zinc uptake studies demonstrated that introduction of aerobic rice system on calcareous soils may increase zinc deficiency problems. Sink size was identified as the limitation of aerobic rice yield, because its spikelet number m−2 was too low (20 000-24 000) compared with the lowland rice. For future research, more attention is suggested to be paid to yield formation focusing on effects of water regimes on tiller dynamics. Understanding of nutrient uptake and response to fertilization effects are also urgently required to establish optimized crop management technology. Additionally, alternative cropping systems based on aerobic rice should be established, and key sustainability and environmental impact issues in the systems need to be identified. "

These tolerant genotypes also had higher concentrations of K+ in their shoots and greater root and shoot biomass and green leaf area. Tolerant genotypes also maintained much lower concentration of Na+ and lower and more favorable ratios of Na+/K+, Na+/Ca2+, and Na+/Mg2+ in their active and developing tissues. Salt tolerance and shoot and root growth of both tolerant and sensitive genotypes were enhanced considerably when higher concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ were applied in culture solution.

The beneficial effects of higher calcium were greater than that of magnesium and application of higher concentration of K+ seems to have minor effects. Responses to salinity in rice can therefore be considerably enhanced through proper nutrient management, by increasing the concentrations of nutrient elements that have favorable effects such as Ca2+ and Mg2+.

Conditions following rice were simulated by flooding, puddling and then draining the plots. Mungbean was sown at 2–14 days after draining (DAD) as the soil dried. In one experiment, seeds were sown manually into plots that were either non-tilled or for which the surface 10 cm had been ploughed and harrowed. In a second experiment, manual sowing into non-tilled plots was compared with prototype machine seeding. Soil matric potential and temperature were monitored throughout the experiments, and germination and seedling emergence recorded. Surface cultivation slowed the rate of water loss from depths below 5 cm and resulted in lower thermal diffusivity than in non-tilled soil. Germination results indicated that following drainage of a seedbed in previously puddled soil, manual sowing at a depth of 5 cm could be delayed until 8 \{DAD\} (while soil matric potentials remained &gt; − 0.1 MPa) without a significant reduction in seed germination. The seeding machine was quicker and easier to use, but its constraint of shallow sowing (maximum depth 2 cm) meant that sowing could be delayed only to 5 \{DAD\} before germination and emergence were inhibited. Predictions of germination from measured values of temperature and water potential were made using equations derived from controlled-environment studies. Differences from germination observed could probably be accounted for by seed/soil/water contact effects, which appeared to be especially important in dry soil (&lt; − 0.7 MPa). Subsequent seedling emergence was, however, often severely restricted in non-tilled soil by soil mechanical constraints in the drying, strengthening seedbed. In the first experiment, these conditions were alleviated by the cultivation treatment; in the second, disturbance of surface soil before drainage resulted in greater emergence and faster seedling growth.

abstract = "Abstract Global changes will affect rice ecosystems at local levels. Although issues of climate change have received most attention, other global changes will have more immediate impacts on crop productivity and health. These changes include the phenomenal advances in modern industrial output, especially in China and India, in mechanization, in communications technology and advertizing, in transportation networks and connectivity, as well as demographic shifts toward urban centers. Driven by policies around food security, market impacts on crop production, and trade regulations, these changes will define crop production systems into the future, impacting rice biodiversity and ecosystem function and giving rise to new pest and disease scenarios. This paper presents a framework for a holistic approach to ‘rice ecosystem health’ aimed at securing food production while protecting farmer, consumer and ecosystem health. Recent advances in environmentally friendly agriculture, including ecological engineering, are central to the sustainability and resilience of rice ecosystems; but require support from policy to ensure their best effects. This paper introduces some recent advances in the methods of ecological engineering based on research conducted in the Philippines. "

abstract = "Abstract Changing rice cultivation method from puddling, manual transplanting and continuous ponding to dry seeding followed by alternate wetting and drying water management (AWD) has the potential to greatly reduce labour and irrigation requirement and crop establishment cost of dry season rice crops. However, in the case of boro crops (irrigated dry season rice) grown in Bangladesh, careful selection of sowing date and variety (duration) may be needed to avoid cold damage during both the vegetative and reproductive stages, and to avoid high temperature and rain storms during flowering and grain filling. Therefore, field experiments were undertaken to evaluate 5 sowing dates (1, 8, 15, 22, and 30 November) and two commonly grown cultivars with medium (BRRI dhan28, 140–145 days) and long (BRRI dhan29, 160–165 days) duration. The experiments were conducted during the 2011/12, 2012/13 and 2013/14 dry seasons at Jessore on the southern end of the High Ganges River Floodplain. Crops sown in early November emerged faster and had higher plant density than crops sown in late November, and also had better growth for the first couple of months after sowing, probably due to higher temperature during crop establishment and the early vegetative stage. Delaying sowing from 1 to 30 November reduced the time to flowering (FL) by 5–9 days, and the time to physiological maturity (PM) by 14–16 days. There was a consistent trend for highest grain yield (BRRI dhan28 4.7–5.0 t ha−1, \{BRRI\} dhan29 6.7–6.9 t ha−1) with 8 November sowing, significantly higher than yield of late November sowings, mainly due to lower floret fertility and more so for \{BRRI\} dhan29. Maximum yield of both cultivars was well below attainable yield of transplanted crops grown in the same location and season, and the reasons need to be elucidated in studies comparing the performance of both. Cultivation of November-sown dry seeded boro at Jessore is risky given the complete failure of all crops sown in 2012 due to cold damage in January 2013, and the severe low temperature stress experienced by the later sowings in 2011. While the 2013/14 crop did not show visual symptoms of cold injury during the early vegetative stage, crop growth was also very poor during the cold period. The risk of severe cold damage in dry seeded boro is even greater in the major boro producing area of north west Bangladesh, where December and January temperature is lower than at Jessore. Therefore, there is a need to develop boro varieties with greater cold tolerance during the early-mid vegetative stage to reduce the risk of failure and improve yield of dry seeded boro crops, thus enabling farmers to capitalise on the potential advantages of converting from puddling and transplanting to dry seeding.

The cluster mean revealed that the crosses between the genotypes of cluster I with those of clusters \{II\} and \{IV\} would exhibit high heterosis for maximum good characters.

The effects of changing establishment method and water management on N fertilizer requirement may also vary between crops grown in the dry and rainy seasons. Therefore, field experiments were conducted over two years in both the boro (dry) and aman (wet) seasons in Bangladesh to evaluate the effects of N rate and seed rate on crop performance and N use efficiency. Four N rates were used in the boro (0, 100, 140, and 180 kg ha−1) and aman (0, 80, 120, and 160 kg ha−1) seasons, and five seed rates (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 kg ha−1) were used in both seasons. There was a significant interaction between N rate and seed rate on grain yield of all crops. Maximum yield of all crops was achieved at the highest N rate with a seed rate of at least 40–60 kg ha−1, suggesting that \{DSR\} has a higher fertilizer N requirement than the recommended rate for PTR. However, there was lodging at physiological maturity of the aman crops at 20 and 40 kg seed ha−1 at the maximum N rate, but not at 60 kg ha−1, suggesting that at seed rates of 20–40 kg ha−1 a lower N rate than the maximum tested would be optimal. Agronomic fertilizer N use efficiency (15–20 kg grain kg−1) and N recovery efficiency (35–40%) were low and comparable to the values reported in Asia for PTR, indicating the need for methods to improve fertilizer use efficiency of DSR. The boro crops sown in mid November suffered from cold damage, resulting in some seedling death in the first year, and substantial seedling death in the second year. In the second year, all boro sowings from mid November to mid January failed due to low temperature. The results suggest that dry seeding of boro rice in mid November is risky because of low temperature in December–January. However, delaying sowing to early February reduced yield due to high temperature during anthesis and low solar radiation during grain filling. Therefore, boro varieties with greater cold tolerance during the vegetative stage are needed to enable the switch from \{PTR\} to November-sown dry-seeded boro rice in the High Ganges River Floodplain of western Bangladesh.

Two resistance classes (pre- and post-attachment) and several resistant genotypes have been identified among \{NERICA\} (New Rice for Africa) cultivars under laboratory conditions (in vitro) previously. However, little is known about expression of this resistance under field conditions. Here we investigated (1) whether resistance exhibited under controlled conditions would express under representative Striga-infested field conditions, and (2) whether \{NERICA\} cultivars would achieve relatively good grain yields under Striga-infested conditions. Twenty-five rice cultivars, including all 18 upland \{NERICA\} cultivars, were screened in S. asiatica-infested (in Tanzania) and S. hermonthica-infested (in Kenya) fields during two seasons. Additionally, a selection of cultivars was tested in vitro, in mini-rhizotron systems. For the first time, resistance observed under controlled conditions was confirmed in the field for NERICA-2, -5, -10 and -17 (against S. asiatica) and NERICA-1 to -5, -10, -12, -13 and -17 (against S. hermonthica). Despite high Striga-infestation levels, yields of around 1.8 t ha−1 were obtained with NERICA-1, -9 and -10 (in the S. asiatica-infested field) and around 1.4 t ha−1 with NERICA-3, -4, -8, -12 and -13 (in the S. hermonthica-infested field). In addition, potential levels of tolerance were identified in vitro, in NERICA-1, -17 and -9 (S. asiatica) and in NERICA-1, -17 and -10 (S. hermonthica). These findings are highly relevant to rice agronomists and breeders and molecular geneticists working on Striga resistance. In addition, cultivars combining broad-spectrum resistance with good grain yields in Striga-infested fields can be recommended to rice farmers in Striga-prone areas. "

Earlier efforts to improve rice yield under drought mainly focused on improving secondary traits because the broad-sense heritability (H) of grain yield under drought stress was assumed to be low, however gains in yield by selecting for secondary traits have not been clearly demonstrated in rice. In present study, the effectiveness of direct selection for grain yield was assessed under lowland reproductive stage stress at Raipur in eastern India and under upland reproductive stage drought stress at IRRI. The selection under severe stress (in both upland and lowland trials) resulted in greater gains under similar stress levels (yield reduction of 65% or greater under stress) in evaluation experiments than did selection under non-stress conditions, with no yield reduction under non-stress conditions. We observed similar H of grain yield under stress and non-stress conditions, indicating direct selection for yield under drought will be effective under both lowland and upland drought stresses. None of the secondary traits (panicle exsertion, harvest index, leaf rolling, leaf drying) included in our study showed a higher estimate for H than grain yield under stress. Secondary traits as well as indirect selection for grain yield under non-stress situation were predicted to be less effective in improving yield under drought in both lowland and upland ecosystem than direct selection for grain yield under the respective stress situations. The low, but positive values observed for genetic correlation (rG) between yield under stress and non-stress indicated that it is possible to combine drought tolerance with high-yield potential but low values also indicated that selection for grain yield needs to be carried under stress environments. The study also indicated that under lowland drought stress, the use of highly drought-tolerant donors, as parents in crosses to high yielding but susceptible varieties resulted in a much higher frequency of genotypes combining high-yield potential with tolerance than did crosses among elite lines with high-yield potential but poor tolerance. Breeding strategies that use drought-tolerant donors and that combine screening for yield under managed drought stress with screening for yield potential are likely to result in the development of improved cultivars for drought-prone rainfed rice producing areas.

Grimmett with similar time to anthesis were evaluated for grain yield and several attributes relating to growth and accumulation of grain yield in a range of environments. Significant variation existed for mean grain yield across environment, and for genotype×environment (GE) interaction. Principal component analysis was used in an attempt to identify systematic differences in response for grain yield across environments. The first component was positively correlated with grain yield in most environments, and most effectively accounted for this variation in the high-yielding environments. The second component was closely correlated with mean grain yield across the lower-yielding rainfed environments, although it was negatively correlated with grain yield at one irrigated environment. Line scores on the firsts component were closely related to grain number across the high-yielding irrigated environments, and weakly correlated with total dry matter and tiller number at anthesis in these environments. There was no correlation between line scores and \{TDM\} production following anthesis. This suggested that the ability of lines to partition assimilate to grains, perhaps limited by grain number, is of importance in determining relative yield potential under favourable growing conditions. Deliberate evaluation of lines under such conditions may be appropriate in the early stages of selection of progeny. Line scores on the second component were positively corelated with mean grain number, \{TDM\} at anthesis, \{TDM\} production after anthesis and single-grain mass, across the rainfed environments, A negative correlation between line scores on the second component and numbers of late-developing tillers in the rainfed environments suggested that production of such tillers may be detrimental to high grain yield in these environments. However, they may be useful in realising high grain yield in some irrigated environments. "

NO, N2O, \{CH4\} and \{CO2\} fluxes were measured simultaneously in a winter barley field under the maize/barley rotation. The fluxes of \{NO\} and \{N2O\} from the control were very low, and N fertilization increased the emissions of \{NO\} and N2O. \{NO\} and \{N2O\} from N fertilization treatments showed different emission patterns: significant \{NO\} emissions but low \{N2O\} emissions in the winter season, and low \{NO\} emissions but significant \{N2O\} emissions during the short period of barley growth in the spring season. The controlled release of the N fertilizer decreased the total \{NO\} emissions, while a deep application increased the total \{N2O\} emissions.

N2O, \{CH4\} and \{CO2\} fluxes were positively correlated (P&lt;0.01) with each other, whereas \{NO\} and \{CO2\} fluxes were negatively correlated (P&lt;0.05).

Planthopper virulence varied between regions; however only 6 varieties were generally less damaged than the susceptible check Taichung Native 1 (TN1) among ≥50% of the test populations. Each of these 6 varieties contained multiple resistance genes. One further variety, also with multiple resistance genes, and a modern cultivar (possibly with the Bph3 gene) were moderately effective against the South Asian populations, whereas a traditional variety with the Bph6 gene was effective against South East Asian populations. Bph1, bph2, bph5, bph7, bph8, Bph9, Bph10 and Bph18 were ineffective against most planthopper populations. Bph20, Bph21, and Bph17 have potential to be used in resistance breeding in both South and South East Asia, whereas \{BPH25\} and \{BPH26\} have potential for use in South Asia. The results indicate that only a few of the currently available resistance genes will be effective in monogenic rice lines; but that pyramiding of two or more genes with strong to weak resistance could improve resistance strength and durability as apparent with the most resistant, traditional varieties. Strategies to avoid planthopper adaptation to resistant rice varieties are discussed. "

Such rapid increase during the crop growth stages, particularly during extremely sensitive reproductive and early grain-filling stages of rice (Oryza sativa L.), leads to reduced biomass, grain yield and quality. Field experiments and lab analyses were carried out using three Basmati and two non-Basmati cultivars to study the effect of a wide range of diurnal temperatures and radiation. Night temperature had a significant negative effect on grain yield (P &lt; 0.001) and quality (P &lt; 0.01) beyond 22 °C. Reduced spikelet fertility followed by grain weight plant−1 accounted for the decline in yield. Radiation however had a positive influence on yield and grain quality. A definite relationship between maximum day temperature and grain yield could not be established as the temperatures were generally ≤the critical 35 °C during sensitive developmental stages. Environment 4 gave significantly highest yield, indicating a narrow window of optimum growing conditions for better yield and quality. Hence, increasing diurnal temperature tolerance in rice is a sustainable approach than altering well established cropping patterns, which will inevitably lead to yield penalties. "

Improvement of fertilizer N use efficiency can increase farmers’ profitability and reduce negative environmental externalities. This paper combines field experimentation with simulation modeling to explore N fertilizer management strategies to realize high yields, while increasing N use efficiency. The rice growth model \{ORYZA2000\} was parameterized and evaluated using data from field experiments carried out in Nanjing, China. \{ORYZA2000\} satisfactorily simulated yield, crop biomass and crop N dynamics, and the model was applied to explore options for different N-fertilizer management regimes, at low and high levels of indigenous soil N supply, using 43 years of historical weather data. On average, yields of around 10–11,000 kg ha−1 were realized (simulated and in field experiments) with fertilizer N rates of around 200 kg ha−1. Higher fertilizer doses did not result in substantially higher yields, except under very favorable weather conditions when yields exceeding 13,000 kg ha−1 were calculated. At fertilizer rates of 150–200 kg ha−1, and at the tested indigenous soil N supplies of 0.6–0.9 kg ha−1 day−1, high fertilizer N recovery (53–56%), partial N productivity (50–70 kg kg−1) and agronomic N use efficiency (20–30 kg kg−1) were obtained with application in three equal splits at transplanting, panicle initiation and booting.

abstract = "Rice yield is the result of the interaction between genotype (cultivar characteristics), environment (climate and soil conditions), and management. Few studies have attempted to isolate the contribution of each of these factors. Here the rice growth model \{ORYZA2000\} was used to analyse the variation in yield, nitrogen (N) uptake, and internal N use efficiency (INUE, grain yield per unit total crop N uptake) of rice in different environments. First, \{ORYZA2000\} was calibrated and evaluated using an empirical data set that spanned three varieties, three years, and eight locations in Asia. Next, we used the model to investigate the relative contribution of indigenous soil N and external N supply and of the weather factors temperature and radiation to observed variation in yield. With normalized root mean square errors (RMSEn) of 6–16%, \{ORYZA2000\} satisfactorily simulated crop biomass, yield, N uptake, and INUE, that strongly varied among genotypes and locations. Environmental factors contributed differentially to yield, N uptake, and INUE, and their contributions were modified by N management. Indigenous soil N supply affected yield and \{INUE\} more strongly than weather conditions at low fertilizer N rates, but its influence was less pronounced at higher fertilizer N rates. Under both, low and high fertilizer N rates, indigenous soil N supply affected N uptake more than weather conditions did. Temperature contributed more than radiation to the variation in yield, N uptake, and INUE. Results suggest that N fertilizer management should take into account indigenous soil N supply, while temperature is the major factor in the selection of genotypes and sowing dates in maximizing rice yield.

In greenhouse studies, four log concentrations of Integral (from 2.2×106 to 2.2×109 cfu/mL) were used as seed treatment (ST). After 25 d, seedlings were dipped (SD) into Integral prior to transplanting. At 30 d after transplanting (DAT), leaf sheaths were inoculated with immature sclerotia of the pathogen.

As the model accounts for different photothermal responses of three successive phases during preflowering ontogeny, it was referred to as the three-stage Beta model. The model was parameterized for 17 rice cultivars using data of two controlled-environment experiments. Model parameters which do not vary strongly among cultivars and parameters which can be estimated from values of other parameters were identified. This analysis reduced the number of parameters to be estimated to five. The parameters from the controlled-environment experiments were used to predict rice development as observed from an independent three-location field experiment with 12 cultivars. The model accurately predicted varietal and locational variation in rice flowering date. "

We used farmer participatory research for on-farm testing of N fertilization by standard and farmer-modified \{SSNM\} for irrigated rice. Our study was done in 14 villages in four provinces of China in 2003 and 2004. Twelve to 15 farmers were randomly selected in each study village in each year for a dialogue with the research team and for a rapid rural technology assessment (RRTA). Based on the information obtained from the RRTA, modified \{SSNM\} (MSSNM) schemes were developed through dialogue between a research team and farmers at a workshop in each village. Modification mainly involved decreasing the number of fertilizer-N topdressings and increasing the rate of basal N application. Among the 514 farmers surveyed during the workshops, 95% were willing to adopt \{SSNM\} and \{MSSNM\} technologies and 76% were willing to conduct \{SSNM\} or \{MSSNM\} experiments. More than two-thirds of the farmers preferred adopting \{MSSNM\} rather than the standard SSNM. Based on the farmers’ willingness, 144 farmers were selected to conduct an experiment to compare \{SSNM\} or \{MSSNM\} with the farmers’ fertilizer practices (FFP). The rate and distribution of fertilizer N during the growing season of \{MSSNM\} were in between those of \{SSNM\} and FFP. \{SSNM\} and MSSNM, compared with FFP, maintained rice yields with significantly less fertilizer N and no significant increase in total labour input. The reduction in fertilizer-N input averaged 48 kg N/ha for \{SSNM\} and 23 kg N/ha for MSSNM.

In half of the pure stand treatments of glutinous rice a metal frame was installed to prevent lodging.

In contrast, prevention of lodging of glutinous rice was identified as an important additional advantage of growing these rice varieties in mixture. "

abstract = "Abstract Responding to increasing demand from poultry and fish feed industries, maize area is rapidly expanding in South Asia. Current tillage and crop establishment (TCE) practices are however associated with high levels of input use, including direct and indirect forms of energy. In Bangladesh, policy makers emphasize the need to reduce the \{USD\} 1.4 billion year−1 agricultural energy subsidy. Bangladeshi farmers cultivate maize during the winter rabi season, when yield potential is high. But when poorly managed, farmers’ investments in \{TCE\} practices may erode farm-level profitability, while inefficiently utilizing energy. Resource-conserving \{TCE\} options may however provide an alternative for maintaining or raising yields, while increasing farmers’ income and reducing energy use. We present a multi-criteria assessment of the productivity, profitability and energetics of alternative \{TCE\} options, including zero (ZT), reduced (RT), and strip tillage (ST), in addition to fresh (FBs) and permanent bed planting (PBs), contrasted with conventional tillage (CT) in Bangladesh’s main maize producing agro-ecological zones (AEZs). Trials were conducted in 184 farmers’ fields in Bangladesh’s northwestern districts with coarse-textured soils (Rangpur and Rajshahi in \{AEZs\} 3 and 11, respectively) and in one eastern district with fine-textured soils (Comilla in \{AEZ\} 19). Trials spanned the 2009–2010 to 2012–2013 rabi seasons. Significant \{TCE\} effects on grain yield were observed in \{AEZs\} 3 and 11, but not in \{AEZ\} 19. Compared to CT, grain yields under FBs, \{PBs\} and \{ST\} were significantly higher in \{AEZ\} 3, and also under \{FBs\} and \{PBs\} in \{AEZ\} 11. Production cost was 7.8% lower, while net profit and benefit-to-cost ratios for the alternative \{TCE\} options were 13.7 and 20% greater than CT, although data were inconsistent in \{AEZ\} 19. Across AEZs, total energy inputs were significantly higher for \{CT\} (30.3.5 × 103 to 33.8 × 103 \{MJ\} ha−1) compared to alternative options (28.3 × 103 to 32.7 × 103 \{MJ\} ha−1). Permanent beds required the lowest diesel energy compared to CT. Similarly, energy use efficiency (EUE) was significantly higher for \{PBs\} and \{ST\} compared to \{CT\} in \{AEZ\} 3 (7.17–8.08 \{MJ\} MJ−1) and for \{PBs\} and \{FBs\} in \{AEZ\} 11 (8.55–10.26 \{MJ\} MJ−1). Among all options, PBs, \{FBs\} and \{ST\} provided greater benefits in terms of increased yield and profits, increased EUE, and reduced economic risks in \{AEZs\} 3 and 11, but less so in \{AEZ\} 19. Poor performance in the latter region was due mainly to poorly-drained low- to medium-low land types that delayed maize planting and impeded optimal establishment. Further efforts are needed to untangle the determinants of spatially variable performance to refine recommendation domains for \{TCE\} options for maize in South Asia. "

Though submergence-tolerant \{FR13A\} and -intolerant \{IR42\} both have comparable \{H2O2\} production during recovery, \{FR13A\} had less lipid peroxidation and had maintained a considerably higher level of ascorbate antioxidant during recovery than IR42. Only glutathione reductase (GR) activity had significantly different levels between the two cultivars with greater level in FR13A. The high levels of ascorbate and \{GR\} activity ensure a better operation of ascorbic acid–glutathione cycle that helps detoxify \{H2O2\} more efficiently in FR13A. However, in \{IR42\} where this cycle is expected to operate at much slower rate because of limited ascorbate and \{GR\} activity, \{H2O2\} becomes readily available for lipid peroxidation, producing more MDA.

Importantly, total root length under aerobic and near-saturated conditions was 10–30% of that under flooding by image analysis software, but not by the Comair scanner. Digital image analysis detected genotypic differences in fine root development in the subsurface layer in aerobic culture that the Comair root length scanner would have missed.

Cluster and data envelopment analyses enabled, respectively, grouping and ranking of irrigation schemes according to a set of pre-determined performance indicators: viz. energy costs, relative irrigation supply, irrigation intensity related to irrigable and equipped area, adequacy, and land productivity. Land productivity, which was highly variable, was compared to simulated land productivity for non-limiting conditions in order to determine yield gap variations. Few early sown crops were close to the simulated yield frontier of 10.6 t ha−1 and the mean yield was similar for large and small schemes (3.50 t ha−1 and 3.77 t ha−1, respectively). The analysis of the indicators revealed that, on average, large schemes performed similarly to small-scale schemes, but small schemes were more variable, particularly in input-use efficiency. Analysis of clusters identified three groups of irrigation schemes: viz. consuming and productive, precarious, and productive and economic. According to data envelopment analysis, four irrigation schemes were identified as technically efficient. Their average land productivity was relatively high (4.75 t ha−1) and energy costs were contained (59 € ha−1). Data envelopment analysis also identified the particular efficient schemes that should be taken as reference for improvement of each inefficient scheme. "

Of the cultivars tested, IR64, IR42, Cisadane and Ketan, \{IR64\} were the most susceptible and Ketan the least susceptible to feeding damage. Third and fourth instars consumed more stem dry matter than other stages, although yield reduction depended on the number of tillers injured. On the wider stemmed Ketan, fewer tillers were injured than the narrower IR64. Larvae are more likely to move among tillers in the third instar stage, which tends to coincide with maximum tillering and may result in more tillers injured and in yield reduction. Later instar larvae burrow downwards to the internode where they pupate. Larvae appear to move less among tillers in ‘resistant’ cultivars. Management strategies should target this pest at third instar and when its abundance in the field warrants control. Fewer than 10% of the neonates establish successfully on stems, and this mortality needs to be taken into account when deciding on control, as does the ability of rice plants to compensate for injury.

The resistance spectrum of the \{BILs\} was assessed by inoculating with 12 different Magnaporthe oryzae isolates that showed differential responses on the parental cultivars and the \{MXL\} that was used for phenotypic selection. All \{BILs\} showed highly resistant reactions (low disease score) to the \{MXL\} and to two blast isolates \{THL48\} and THL149. Four markers, i.e., RM246, RM241, \{RM303\} and \{RM164\} completely favoring the \{IR68835\} allele (shifting of allele frequencies from \{KDML105\} to IR68835) were identified on chromosomes 1, 4 and 5, respectively.

Seven \{DNA\} markers linked to specific resistance genes were identified, in which allele from \{IR68835\} at 6 markers, i.e., RM6, RM205, RM211, RM252, \{RM273\} and \{RM342\} reduced disease score (DS), against blast isolates THL16, THL329, THL458, THL831, \{THL868\} and \{THL96036\} while allele from \{KDML105\} at \{RM208\} (Pi-kd on chromosomes 2) reduce \{DS\} against THL84, THL191, \{THL557\} and THL1108. In this study, the use of \{DNA\} markers enabled the identification of specific resistance genes in the backcross breeding materials developed from routine rice breeding program through the conventional phenotypic selection. In this experiment, the usefulness of breeding materials from conventional breeding program in identifying genes corresponding to the selection was illustrated. Linked markers and their genomic location provide necessary information for further use of marker-assisted selection to improve blast resistance in rice breeding program. "

A multi-site experiment was conducted in Luang Prabang province to examine cultivar and fertilizer effects on grain yield. Three traditional and three improved cultivars were grown under four fertilizer treatments: no added fertilizer, nitrogen only (N; 90 kg N/ha), phosphate only (P; 50 kg P/ha), and N and P (NP) at three locations. No severe water stress developed at any location. The two improved cultivars, IR55423-01 and B6144-MR-6-0-0 out-yielded traditional cultivars in all locations and fertilizer treatments. They had higher total dry matter and harvest index, lower plant height and more panicles than traditional cultivars. N fertilizer application increased grain yields of the two improved cultivars from 3.1 to 4.0 t/ha while increasing those of traditional cultivars from 1.6 to 1.9 t/ha. Applying only P gave no effect on grain yield, and applying P with N increased grain yield only by 0.5 t/ha over N application alone on average over all cultivars at all locations. However, there was cultivar and location difference in the yield response to P applied with N. Further studies are required on the genotype-by-environment interaction in the effect of P applied with N under upland conditions. These results indicate that upland rice cultivars with high HI, which have been selected under favorable conditions, can perform well under low fertility conditions but also respond well to applied N fertilizer.

In plants including cereals, calcium is deposited in seed during its development which is mediated by specialized Ca transporters. Common cereal seeds contain very low amounts of Ca while the finger millet (Eleusine coracana) contains exceptionally high amounts of Ca in seed. In order to understand the role of Ca transporters in grain Ca accumulation, developing seed transcriptome of two finger millet genotypes (GP-1, low Ca and GP-45 high Ca) differing in seed Ca content was sequenced using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology and members of Ca transporter gene family were identified. Out of 109,218 and 120,130 contigs, 86 and 81 contigs encoding Ca transporters were identified in GP-1 and GP-45, respectively. After removal of redundant sequences, a total of 19 sequences were confirmed as Ca transporter genes, which includes 11 Ca2 + ATPases, 07 Ca2 +/cation exchangers and 01 Ca2 + channel. The differential expressions of all genes were analyzed from transcriptome data and it was observed that 9 and 3 genes were highly expressed in GP-45 and GP-1 genotypes respectively. Validation of transcriptome expression data of selected Ca transporter genes was performed on different stages of developing spikes of both genotypes grown under different concentrations of exogenous Ca. In both genotypes, significant correlation was observed between the expression of these genes, especially EcCaX3, and on the amount of Ca accumulated in seed. The positive correlation of seed mass with the amount of Ca concentration was also observed. The efficient Ca transport property and responsiveness of EcCAX3 towards exogenous Ca could be utilized in future biofortification program. "

However, after a duration of certification of one to ten years (average four years), no significant changes in fishing pressure or stock size were detected. In the last certified year with available data, seven stocks (44% of stocks with available data) were subject to overfishing and five stocks (21% of stocks with available data) were outside of safe biological limits. Certification should guarantee that fishing quotas are set correctly and are enforced. However, in 11 stocks quotas were set 20–60% above the level that fishers were taking, whereas in three stocks landings exceeded quotas by 30–50%. The study concludes that \{MSC\} should change its rules such that overfishing or unsafe stock sizes lead to immediate suspension of certification and that no certification is issued in the first place for a stock that is already in such a situation.

However, surface residue retention affects soil water and temperature dynamics, thus the optimum sowing date and irrigation management for a mulched crop may vary from those of a traditional non-mulched crop. Furthermore, the effects of sowing date and irrigation management are likely to vary with soil type and seasonal conditions. Therefore, a simulation study was conducted using the \{APSIM\} model and 40 years of weather data to evaluate the effects of mulch, sowing date and irrigation management and their interactions on wheat grain yield, irrigation requirement (I) and water productivity with respect to irrigation (WPI) and evapotranspiration (WPET). The results suggest that the optimum wheat sowing date in central Punjab depends on both soil type and the presence or absence of mulch. On the sandy loam, with irrigation scheduled at 50% soil water deficit (SWD), the optimum sowing date was late October to early November for maximising yield, \{WPI\} and WPET. On the clay loam, the optimum date was about one week later. The effect of mulch on yield varied with seasonal conditions and sowing date. With irrigation at 50% SWD, mulching of wheat sown at the optimum time increased average yield by up to 0.5 t ha−1. The beneficial effect of mulch on yield increased to averages of 1.2–1.3 t ha−1 as sowing was advanced to 15 October. With irrigation at 50% \{SWD\} and 7 November sowing, mulch reduced the number of irrigations by one in almost 50% of years, a reduction of about 50 mm on the sandy loam and 60 mm on the clay loam. The reduction in irrigation amount was mainly due to reduced soil evaporation. Mulch reduced irrigation requirement by more as sowing was delayed, more so on the sandy loam than the clay loam soil. There was little effect of mulch on irrigation requirement for late October sowings. There were large trade-offs between irrigation input, yield, \{WPET\} and \{WPI\} on the sandy loam with regard to the optimum irrigation schedule. Maximum yield occurred with very frequent irrigation (10–20% SWD) which also had the greatest irrigation input, while \{WPI\} was highest with least frequent irrigation (70% SWD), and \{WPET\} was highest with irrigation at 40–50% SWD. This was the case with and without mulch. On the clay loam, the trade-offs were not so pronounced, as maximum yield was reached with irrigation at 50% SWD, with and without mulch. However, both \{WPET\} and \{WPI\} were maximum and irrigation input least at the lowest irrigation frequency (70% SWD). On both soils, maximum yield, \{WPET\} and \{WPI\} were higher with mulch, while irrigation input was slightly lower, but mulch had very little effect on the irrigation thresholds at which each parameter was maximised.

This weed is a major threat to wheat productivity in north-western India, and as such needs to be addressed with integrated weed management approaches, including crop and herbicide rotations, herbicide combinations along with cultural and mechanical methods. Three field experiments were conducted during 2008–09 to 2012–13 along with large plot adaptive trials during 2012–13 with the objective to evaluate the efficacy of sequential applications of pendimethalin applied pre-emergent followed by clodinafop, sulfosulfuron, or pinoxaden applied post-emergent and tank-mix applications of metribuzin with these post-emergence herbicides for the management of herbicide-resistant P. minor in wheat. Clodinafop 60 g ha−1 or sulfosulfuron 25 g ha−1 at 35 days after sowing (DAS) and pendimethalin 1000 g ha−1 as pre-emergence did not provide consistently effective control of P. minor in wheat. An increase in the dose of clodinafop from 60 to 75 g ha−1 and of sulfosulfuron from 25 to 30 g ha−1 also did not improve their efficacy to a satisfactory level. However, pinoxaden 50 g ha−1 provided effective control (97–100%) of P. minor but not of broadleaf weeds. The tank-mix application of metribuzin with clodinafop 60 g ha−1 or sulfosulfuron 25 g ha−1 at 35 \{DAS\} and the sequential application of pendimethalin 1000 g ha−1 or trifluralin 1000 g ha−1 just after sowing followed by clodinafop 60 g ha−1 or sulfosulfuron 25 g ha−1 at 35 \{DAS\} provided 90–100% control of P. minor along with broadleaf weeds in wheat, thus resulting in improved grain yields (4.72–5.75 t ha−1) when compared to clodinafop 60 g ha−1 (3.85–5.60 t ha−1) or sulfosulfuron 25 g ha−1 alone (3.95–5.10 t ha−1). The efficacy of mesosulfuron + iodosulfuron (a commercial mixture) 14.4 g ha−1 against P. minor was not consistent across the experiments and over the years. The ready-mix combination of fenoxaprop + metribuzin (100 + 175 g ha−1) at 35 \{DAS\} provided effective control of weeds but its varietal sensitivity needs to be determined before its use in field conditions. The tank-mix or sequential application of herbicides would be a better option than their applications alone to manage the serious problem of herbicide-resistant P. minor in wheat. "

These viruses are considered cytolytic yet can persist for extended periods of time within certain host tissues requiring evasion from the host immune response and a greatly reduced rate of replication. A member of Picornaviridae family, \{CVs\} have been historically considered non-enveloped viruses – although recent evidence suggest that \{CV\} and other picornaviruses hijack host membranes and acquire an envelope. Acquisition of an envelope might provide distinct benefits to \{CV\} virions, such as resistance to neutralizing antibodies and efficient nonlytic viral spread. \{CV\} exhibits a unique tropism for progenitor cells in the host which may help to explain the susceptibility of the young host to infection and the establishment of chronic disease in adults. \{CVs\} have also been shown to exploit autophagy to maximize viral replication and assist in unconventional release from target cells. In this article, we review recent progress in clarifying virus replication and dissemination within the host cell, identifying determinants of tropism, and defining strategies utilized by the virus to evade the host immune response. Also, we will highlight unanswered questions and provide future perspectives regarding the potential mechanisms of \{CV\} pathogenesis. "

Environments were six seasonal climatic situations (sowing dates) in Senegal, ranging from cool to hot; and at two altitudes (857 and 1497 m asl) and two years in Madagascar. The apex temperature during the critical phenological stage was estimated from weather records and an empirical model estimating the daily minimum water temperature. Sterility incidence was regressed for each accession against apex temperature across all environments after discarding observations potentially involving heat induced sterility. From the correlations, the slope of the temperature response and sterility at 20 °C (no stress) and 15 °C (chilling stress) were derived and used to evaluate the accessions and establish clusters. Indicas were on average more sensitive than temperate and tropical japonicas. Among indicas, large diversity in cold sterility was observed that formed 6 clusters, which represented the different genetic sub-groups at a distinct frequency.

Optimum nitrogen (N) management for zero till (ZT) wheat sown into rice residues may to differ from that of conventional practice (in-situ burning of residues followed by intensive tillage prior to sowing). Therefore, we conducted several on-farm and on-station field experiments in 2007–2008 to 2012–2013 to evaluate N management practices for \{ZT\} wheat sown into rice residues using the Happy Seeder. The optimum N rate for wheat planted into rice residues in fields with no or only a short history of rice residue retention was 120 kg N ha−1, the current recommendation for conventional practice. Short-term (up to 20 d) soil N mineralization was lower in undisturbed soil than disturbed soil, while the total amount of N mineralization was similar after 40 d, suggesting that over the crop season, total soil N mineralization may be similar in tilled and non-tilled soil. Ammonia volatilization loss from urea broadcast over the residue covered surface, followed by irrigation, was low (&lt;2 kg ha−1) regardless of time of urea application. Band placement of 20% of the fertilizer N as diammonium phosphate at seeding, and topdressing of the remaining 80% as urea in two equal doses before first and second irrigations produced higher grain yield and N use efficiency than other treatments. However, surface residue retention reduces the rate of soil drying and in some situations this delays the time of the second irrigation and thus N fertilizer application beyond the optimum time. Therefore, the effect of banding various proportions of the urea N between the rows at sowing was investigated. The results showed that, on a loam soil, up to 75% of the recommended N fertilizer can be applied at sowing, 24 kg N ha−1 as \{DAP\} with the seed and 66 kg N ha−1 as urea drilled between every second wheat row, without loss of yield. In conclusion, a better applied N management strategy for \{ZT\} wheat than currently practiced is drilling of 24 kg N ha−1 as diammonimum phosphate into the soil at seeding followed by two top-dressings of 48 kg N ha−1 each just prior to first and second irrigations.

Distribution of δ13C, δ15N and δ18O in the \{SS\} and \{IS\} grains were found to be different. δ18O and δD can discriminate rice cultivation areas. However, δ13C and δ15N values in Fujin and Wuchang overlapped when the differences between \{SS\} and \{IS\} were considered, thus δ13C and δ15N cannot be used to discriminate cultivation areas. This exploratory study indicate the variation of the light stable isotopes in the grains located on different panicle positions could be used to discriminate the geographical origin but still need further systematic consideration and verification.

abstract = "Abstract In the extensive rice–wheat system of north-west (NW) India, harvesting is by large combines and the rice residues are normally burnt after harvest, followed by irrigation and intensive tillage prior to sowing wheat. While in-field retention of crop residues can play an important role in replenishing soil quality and reducing environmental pollution from stubble burning, until recently, there has been no suitable technology for seeding wheat in rice residues. To address this need, a series of machines (‘Happy Seeders’) was developed over the past 10 years, culminating in the development of version 2 of the 9-row Turbo Happy Seeder (v.2). The 9-row Turbo Happy Seeder(v.2) has a weight of 506 kg and can be operated by a 33.6 kW tractor at a work rate of 0.3 ha h−1. Numerous on-farm trials show that yield of wheat sown into rice residues with the 9-row Turbo Happy Seeder is similar to or higher than yield with straw burning and conventional tillage prior to sowing, while providing many benefits to the farmer. These include greatly reduced fuel consumption and cost of crop establishment, and the ability to sow as soon as desired after harvest, ensuring the possibility of sowing at the optimum time and reducing the need for irrigation. However, adoption has been low to date, despite a 50% price subsidy. Constraints to adoption include the low window of operation of the machine (25 days per year), the low machine capacity compared with conventional seed drills, the inability to operate in wet straw, and the lack of straw spreaders on combine harvesters. Removal of subsidies for diesel and electricity (for pumping groundwater) and implementation of the policy banning in-field straw burning would help to accelerate adoption of technology for direct drilling wheat into rice residues.

The sites covered were Isabela, Nueva Ecija, North Cotabato, and Bohol provinces as well as Bicol region. Tungro disease incidence in farmers’ fields was assessed visually based on typical symptoms. In addition, leaf samples were collected from each field and indexed serologically by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence of Rice tungro bacilliform (RTBV) and Rice tungro spherical (RTSV) viruses. Thus, relationships between the production environment variables and four disease variables — visual incidence and double \{RTBV\} and RTSV, single RTSV, and single \{RTBV\} infections — were examined. A higher association was observed between site and varieties planted as well as site and synchrony of planting than between site and agroecosystem or site and disease variables (visual incidence, double \{RTBV\} and \{RTSV\} and single \{RTSV\} infections). Disease variables depended on both varieties planted and synchrony of planting and correspondence analysis revealed that the low disease incidence in Nueva Ecija was associated with synchronous planting while the high disease incidence in Isabela was associated with the planting of susceptible varieties and asynchronous planting. Such findings suggest that the relationship between the last two factors at a given site is critical to predicting tungro occurrence. Moreover, correspondence analysis of the relationship among disease variables revealed that tungro incidence is associated with not only double \{RTBV\} and \{RTSV\} infections but also single \{RTSV\} infections. Implications of these results on tungro epidemiology and management are discussed. "

The low agronomic N use efficiency (AEN, kg grain yield increase per kg N applied) of this system has become a threat to the environment. The objective of this study was to determine the possibility to improve the \{AEN\} of irrigated rice in China by comparing the farmers’ N-fertilizer practices with other N management strategies such as real-time N management (RTNM) and fixed-time adjustable-dose N management (FTNM). Field experiments were conducted in farmers’ fields in four major rice-growing provinces in China in 2001 and 2002. The same experiment was repeated at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) farm in the dry seasons of 2002 and 2003. Agronomic N use efficiency was determined by the “difference method” using an N-omission plot. Maximum yield was achieved mostly at 60–120 kg N ha−1, which was significantly lower than the 180–240 kg N ha−1 applied in farmers’ practices at the Chinese sites. With the modified farmers’ fertilizer practice, a 30% reduction in total N rate during the early vegetative stage did not reduce yield but slightly increased yield and doubled \{AEN\} compared with the farmers’ practice at the Chinese sites. The total N rate in \{RTNM\} and \{FTNM\} ranged from 30 to 120 kg ha−1 at the Chinese sites, but their yields were similar to or higher than that of the farmers’ practice. Compared with the modified farmers’ practice, \{RTNM\} and \{FTNM\} further increased \{AEN\} at the Chinese sites. Overall, \{FTNM\} performed better than \{RTNM\} at the Chinese sites because the total N rate of \{FTNM\} was closer to the optimal level than RTNM. A quantum leap in \{AEN\} is possible in the intensive rice-growing areas in China by simply reducing the current N rate and by allocating less N at the early vegetative stage. "

Frictional polishing, similar to that of commercial mills, i.e. 8–10% loss of grain weight, reduced the concentration of Fe, Mg, P, K and Mn by 60–80% in all genotypes. Following gentler polishing (3–5% weight loss), genotypes classified as difficult to polish showed smaller decreases in Fe, Mg, P, K and Mn compared to genotypes classified as easy to polish.

The expected income from R-W system in the selected district ranged from rupees (Rs) 3.58 to Rs 4 billion (1996 values) and the income risk, expressed in terms of the coefficient of variation, varied from 5 to 7%. Conflict between income and income risk was controlled through water-use options. For realizing an income level of Rs 3.58 billion, farmers used 38% more water to reduce their income risk. Tradeoff between water use and income risk was moderate (10: 1) at the current water use levels due to favorable policy environment. Promoting efficient water use in R-W system calls for rational water/energy pricing policies to reduce water use by 25% from the current level. Supportive water management technology and institutional policies would be more effective to economize the water use beyond 25% wherein, the water use-income risk trade off became acute (1.5:1). "

CTB-specific IgG was secreted in the colostrum and transferred passively to the sera of suckling piglets. IgA antibodies in the colostrum and milk remained high with a booster dose after farrowing. Additionally, when weaned minipigs were orally immunized with MucoRice-CTB, production of CTB-specific intestinal SIgA, as well as systemic IgG and IgA, was induced. To evaluate the cross-protective effect of MucoRice-CTB against \{ETEC\} diarrhea, intestinal loop assay with \{ETEC\} was conducted. The fluid volume accumulated in the loops of minipigs immunized with MucoRice-CTB was significantly lower than that in control minipigs, indicating that MucoRice-CTB-induced cross-reactive immunity could protect weaned pigs from diarrhea caused by ETEC.

We investigated the effect of five wheat establishment methods (i) conventional tillage; (ii) reduced-tillage; (iii) rotavator tillage; (iv) raised bed planting; and (v) zero-tillage for their energy and economic efficiency in a Typic Ustochrept alluvial sandy loam soil in the \{IGP\} during 2005–2008.

We measured implement efficiency, energy inputs and outputs, tillage and seeding efficiency as well as wheat productivity and economics. The results of the study showed that zero-tillage improved the operational field capacity by 81%, specific energy by 17% and the energy usage efficiency by 13% as compared to the conventional tillage. But, higher total effective field capacity (9.93 h ha−1) on raised beds is in contrast with our second hypothesis. The enhanced net income in zero-tillage (33%) and reduced-tillage (20%) compared to \{CT\} support the third hypothesis. The overall results of the study revealed that CA-based crop establishment practices are a viable options for the farmers not only in terms of energy and time efficiency but also for attaining higher productivity and profitability. There exists a large potential of \{CA\} based crop establishment practices in South Asia not only in terms of crop productivity and profitability but also their energy efficiency, global warming potential and soil health.

The aim of the present study was to conduct a comparative growth analysis of nine genotypes to describe their performance under the prevalent conditions in the high Andes. We also simulated the performance of nine genotypes from the species Solanum tuberosum subspecies andigenum and tuberosum, Solanum ajanhuiri, and their hybrids as affected by frost. The simulations were run using a user-friendly simulation model based on the \{LINTUL\} framework. Three native genotypes: Ajanhuiri (S. ajanhuiri), Gendarme and Waycha (S. tuberosum ssp. andigenum); one introduced genotype: Alpha (S. tuberosum ssp. tuberosum); and five hybrids (Condori, Tunari, Sajama, Illimani, and Totoreña) provided the crop data required as inputs to the model, from field experiments conducted over four years under favorable management conditions. Each experimental location also provided daily weather data required by the model. Genotypic differences, ascribed to parentage and ploidy, were evidenced by differences in growth response observed under a range of simulated frost scenarios. The diploid ajanhuiri showed better canopy cover and yield than most tetraploids. However, the average yield of the tetraploids was reduced by including the long day Alpha genotype (tuberosum), which did not perform as well as the others. Nevertheless, Alpha showed higher harvest index than the average of the short day genotypes and hybrids. Andigenum genotypes showed 12% higher yields than the andigenum hybrids. Gendarme showed the best growth parameters overall followed by Waycha. The adapted \{LINTUL\} model was validated as it adequately (R2 &gt; 0.88) reproduced observed field responses in the calibration experiments. This correspondence between the simulations and the experimental results demonstrated the adequacy of the model, which explained more than 82% of the variations in growth parameters. All statistical metrics used to test the validity of the model to simulate potato yield and yield components in the high Andes showed the model's robustness. "

Renewed policy and donor emphasis on bridging gender gaps in development also emphasizes the potential social safety net benefits that weather-index insurance could bring to women farmers who are disproportionately vulnerable to climate change risk and have low adaptive capacity. To date, no quantitative studies have experimentally explored weather-index insurance preferences through a gender lens, and little information exists regarding gender-specific preferences for (and constraints to) smallholder investment in agricultural weather-index insurance. This study responds to this gap, and advances the understanding of preference heterogeneity for weather-index insurance by analysing data collected from 433 male and female farmers living on a climate change vulnerable coastal island in Bangladesh, where an increasing number of farmers are adopting maize as a potentially remunerative, but high-risk cash crop. We implemented a choice experiment designed to investigate farmers’ valuations for, and trade-offs among, the key attributes of a hypothetical maize crop weather-index insurance program that offered different options for bundling insurance with financial saving mechanisms. Our results reveal significant insurance aversion among female farmers, irrespective of the attributes of the insurance scheme. Heterogeneity in insurance choices could however not be explained by differences in men’s and women’s risk and time preferences, or agency in making agriculturally related decisions. Rather, gendered differences in farmers’ level of trust in insurance institutions and financial literacy were the key factors driving the heterogeneous preferences observed between men and women. Efforts to fulfill gender equity mandates in climate-smart agricultural development programs that rely on weather-index insurance as a risk-abatement tool are therefore likely to require a strengthening of institutional credibility, while coupling such interventions with financial literacy programs for female farmers.

To investigate the \{GEPs\} in the root and panicle of 3 rice genotypes, we used 2 near-isogenic rice lines from a common genetic combination backcross developed by Aday Selection and IR64. \{WDTs\} were applied using the fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW) for severe, mild, and control conditions. Transcriptomic analysis using a 44K oligoarray from Affymetrix and Agilent was performed on all the tissues. The majority of the OsWRKY genes that were activated were activated in the drought-tolerant IR77298-14-1-2-B-10 line but not in the drought-susceptible IR77298-14-1-2-B-13 or \{IR64\} lines. In IR77298-14-1-2-B-10, non-redundant genes (9) were very specific in their higher expression levels. Approximately 27 and 43% more genes from group \{III\} and subgroup IV-a, respectively, were activated in the panicle during severe stress than during the control treatment. We found 5 OsWRKY genes that introgressed in the drought-tolerant IR77298-14-1-2-B-10 line. Os01g43650 was up-regulated in the root under both \{WDTs\} and in the panicle under mild stress. OsWRKY up-regulated genes with tissue-specific expression patterns that contained at least 3 cis-elements in the tolerant line. These results provide a useful reference for the cloning of candidate genes for further functional analysis. "

Evident differences in gene expression between \{TN1\} and \{TW16\} instigated by \{RTSV\} included (1) suppression of more genes for development-related transcription factors in TW16; (2) activation of more genes for development-related peptide hormone \{RALF\} in TN1; (3) TN1- and TW16-specific regulation of genes for jasmonate synthesis and pathway, and genes for stress-related transcription factors such as WRKY, SNAC, and AP2-EREBP; (4) activation of more genes for glutathione S-transferase in TW16; (5) activation of more heat shock protein genes in TN1; and (6) suppression of more genes for Golden2-like transcription factors involved in plastid development in TN1.

To enhance productivity, alleviate environmental and management constraints, and enhance farmers’ income in the rice–wheat cropping system of the E-IGP, new approaches that are more productive and sustainable need to be developed. Conservation agriculture (CA) together with best management practices (BMP) used in other parts of the \{IGP\} offer potential to be extended in the E-IGP. A study was conducted during 2009–2011 with the objective of evaluating a range of approaches for enhancing the productivity and economic returns of rice-wheat-based cropping systems in the E-IGP. Four scenarios (S) involving a range of crop and resource management practices with crop rotations (including legumesθ) were compared with one another, of which Scenario 1 represented farmers practice. The lowest yields of wheat (2.78–3.07 t ha−1) and rice (4.38–6.52 t ha−1) were recorded with the current farmers’ practices (S1), consisting of intensive tillage (wet tillage or puddling in rice and dry tillage in wheat) followed by inefficient crop establishment practices (transplanting in rice and broadcasting in wheat) with complete removal of crop residues. Avoiding tillage in wheat (S2) and including mungbean increased the yields of wheat and the succeeding rice crop by 21–31% and 5–10%, respectively. The yields of wheat and rice increased further by 46–54% and by 10–24%, respectively, with the inclusion of more \{CA\} components (S3). In S4, which was designed to include higher cropping intensity and diversification (potato and maize–rice–cowpea rotation) with \{CA\} components, 144–163% higher rice equivalent system productivity was attained. Irrigation water productivity in the winter season increased by 39–48% in S2, by 72–84% in S3, and by 137–138% in \{S4\} when compared to \{S1\} while in the rainy season it increased by 14–18% in S2, by 46–56% in S3, and by 71–88% in S4. \{S4\} had the highest net returns ($2855–4193 ha−1), followed by \{S3\} ($1883–3246 ha−1). However, the system’s highest benefit–cost ratio was recorded with \{S3\} due to its lower cost of crop cultivation. The results of this study showed that there is enormous untapped potential to improve overall system performance through the adoption of \{CA\} in integration with \{BMP\} in the intensive system of the E-IGP of India.

In general, an increase in \{CO2\} level was found to increase yields while increases in temperature reduced yields. Overall rice production in the region was predicted by the \{ORYZA1\} model to change by +6.5, −4.4 and −5.6% under the GFDL, \{GISS\} and \{UKMO\} 2×CO2 scenarios, respectively, while the corresponding changes predicted by the \{SIMRIW\} model were +4.2, −10.4 and −12.8%. The average of these estimates would suggest that rice production in the Asian region may decline by −3.8% under the climate of the next century. Declines in yield were predicted under the \{GISS\} and \{UKMO\} scenarios for Thailand, Bangladesh, southern China and western India, while increases were predicted for Indonesia, Malaysia, and Taiwan and parts of India and China. Modification of sowing dates at high latitudes, where warmer temperatures allowed a longer growing season, permitted a possible transition from single-cropping to double-cropping at some locations, an adaptation that could potentially have a large positive impact on national rice production in some countries. Planting dates could also be adjusted to avoid high temperatures at the time of flowering which can cause severe spikelet sterility in some varieties, although a delay in planting in some cases may prevent a second crop from being obtained because of high temperatures later in the season. Selection for varieties with a higher tolerance of spikelet fertility to temperature was shown to be capable of restoring yield levels to those predicted for current climates. The use of longer-maturing varieties to take advantage of longer growing seasons at higher latitudes may instead result in lower yields, due to the grain formation and ripening periods being pushed to less favorable conditions later in the season. A better strategy might be to select for shorter-maturing varieties to allow a second crop to be grown in these regions. "

The phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA sequences of two representative strains \{IRBG\} 500 and \{IRBG\} 501 indicated that they were closely related to S. marcescens(more than 99% identity). Physiological and biochemical tests corroborated that the isolates were highly related to each other and to S. marcescens. In cluster analysis, all six isolates were clustered together at 93% similarity level and grouped closely with Serratia marcescens at 86% similarity level. DNA-DNA hybridization studies revealed that the isolates shared high similarity levels with S. marcescens(≥86% DNA-DNA binding), indicating they belong to the same species. However, the isolates differed in several biochemical characteristics from the type strain. They produce urease and utilize urea and L(+) sorbose as a substrate, which is different from all known Serratia reference strains. These results suggest that the six endophytic isolates represent a novel, non-pigmented subgroup of S. marcescens. "

Possible causes of the outbreak such as introduction of a new pathogen race, unusual weather patterns and changes in agricultural practices were investigated and yield losses analysed. Weather data were examined for unusual patterns and farmers from the affected areas were interviewed to determine possible changes of cultural practices. Blast isolates were collected from various affected rice areas and analysed for variability of the pathogen population by \{MGR\} (Magnaporthe grisea repeat 586) fingerprinting. Rice yields declined parabolically with increasing disease with losses for some farmers being nearly 100%. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using \{MGR\} fingerprints of 71 isolates resulted in 58 haplotypes that grouped into 13 lineages. Lineage BhR1 and BhR4 were represented by 22 and 13 isolates, respectively, whereas the other lineages were represented by only one to six isolates each. Haplotypic diversity both in the early and late season’s collections was very high suggesting that the blast epidemic was not caused by a new introduction or race change of the pathogen. There was no drastic shift in agricultural practices or rice cultivars which could explain the blast outbreak. However, the weather data indicated that the climatic conditions in 1995 favoured blast and these unusual conditions, in combination with the ubiquitous presence of the pathogen, probably account for the epidemic.

Salt-tolerant mutants are promising varieties for salt-affected soils and they constitute unique genetic stocks for gene discovery. Out of the 60,000 \{IR64\} mutant lines generated at IRRI, 5000 mutants were screened for salt-stress tolerance at the seedling stage using hydroponics. Mutants that are either more tolerant or more sensitive than \{IR64\} were identified and advanced through single seeds after phenotyping for salt tolerance at each generation. Furthermore, the genetic background of the selected mutants was confirmed using \{SSR\} markers. Tolerant mutants absorbed less Na+ and more K+, resulting in lower Na+:K+ ratio in their shoots, and produced more shoot biomass through faster growth that can further dilute the absorbed Na+. Contrastingly, the sensitive mutants had higher Na+ and Na+:K+ ratio and lower survival and produced less biomass under salt stress. Four tolerant and three sensitive mutants were selected and, together with tolerant and sensitive checks, were evaluated in a series of field trials under non-saline field conditions to compare their agronomic performance with that of IR64, and in saline fields to confirm their responses relative to \{IR64\} and to assess the impacts of these mutations on growth and yield in salt-affected fields. When evaluated under control conditions in the field, the sensitive and tolerant mutants were similar to \{IR64\} in the majority of growth and yield traits. However, in saline fields, the tolerant mutants had lower Standard Evaluation System (SES) scores and better survival and growth than either \{IR64\} or the sensitive mutants. They also produced an average of 0.8–1.0 t ha−1 higher yield than \{IR64\} and 1.2–1.47 t ha−1 than the sensitive lines. This yield enhancement was associated with more productive tillers and heavier panicles with more fertile spikelets in the tolerant mutants. \{IR64\} was intermediate for most traits. These salt-tolerant mutants are potential varieties for salt-affected coastal areas provided that other quality traits of \{IR64\} have not been significantly altered to ensure acceptance by farmers. Mapping and cloning of these mutations can help understand their genetic and physiological bases and identify new genes for use in breeding, which is currently being pursued. "

Maize yields in Southeast Asia are typically less than their potential because of sub-optimal fertilizer management, particularly nitrogen. We evaluated a range of N-fertilizer treatments on irrigated maize grown on medium-textured soils in Indonesia and Vietnam during the dry seasons of 2008–2009. The treatments included split applications with rates adjusted according to leaf color. We found no advantage in more than two splits in terms of yield or agronomic efficiency. Adjusting applications according to leaf color gave 0.80 t ha−1 more grain than fixed rates and US$ 182 ha−1 higher profit. N-use was highly efficient in the range of 30–65 kg kg−1 N. "

In order to support the identification of sustainable land-use options and to support decision making with respect to land use, a tool was developed for quantifying inputs and outputs of cropping systems at the field level. TechnoGIN, the tool described in this paper, integrates systems analytical and expert knowledge and different types of agronomic data enabling the assessment of inputs and outputs of a broad range of cropping systems and the evaluation of their resource use efficiencies. By using methods of spatial aggregation in combination with linear programming, results can also be used to explore trade-offs in resource-use efficiencies at higher levels such as the farm household, municipality and province. New features in TechnoGIN compared with similar tools include the annual rotation of up to three crops, the distinction between aerobic and anaerobic growing conditions of crops, and the procedure for estimating crop nutrient uptake. TechnoGIN is illustrated with results from the Tam Duong district in North Vietnam. The design of TechnoGIN enables easy access to its data, parameters and assumptions, and rapid generation and evaluation of input–output relationships of cropping systems in order to add new information and to improve data. TechnoGIN raises awareness about the assumptions incorporated and thus supports data collection and setting of the research agenda with respect to agro-ecological processes for which knowledge is incomplete, and is relevant for showing trade-offs between production, economic and environmental impacts of different land-use systems.

In Europe, data on the prevalence of pathogen spillover from commercial to wild bumble bee populations is lacking, despite the widespread production and transport of hives within the \{EU\} since the early 1980s. We determined the permeability of cropping systems to commercial bumble bees, and quantified the prevalence of four pathogens in commercial Bombus terrestris hives and adjacent conspecific populations at increasing distances from greenhouses in Ireland. Commercial bumble bees collected from 31% to 97% of non-crop pollen, depending on the cropping system, and hives had markedly higher frequencies of two gut parasites, Crithidia spp. and Nosema bombi, compared to adjacent populations, but were free of tracheal mites. The highest prevalence of Crithida was observed within 2 km of greenhouses and the probability of infection declined in a host sex- and pathogen-specific manner up to 10 km. We suggest implementing measures that prevent the interaction of commercially reared and wild bumble bees by integrating the enforcement of national best management practices for users of commercial pollinators with international legislation that regulates the sanitation of commercial hives in production facilities.

To help meet this challenge, advanced genetic and statistical methods of analysis have been used to identify new resistance genes through global screens, and studies of plant–pathogen interactions have been undertaken to uncover the mechanisms by which disease resistance is achieved. The informed deployment of major, race-specific and partial, race-nonspecific resistance, either by conventional breeding or transgenic approaches, will enable the production of crop varieties with effective resistance without impacting on other agronomically important crop traits.

These insights may form the basis prediction and decision support systems. Several approaches have been developed to link pest models with crop models. Several coupling points for pest-crop models were identified for different pest-crop combinations. These were modeled on the basis of experimental research on the quantification of the physiological damage mechanisms. Examples are given of the use of the models that simulate the impact of pests on crops as an important research tool. Recently, approaches to simulate multiple pest damage have been developed and evaluated. Special attention is given to the use of such models to understand and predict the effects of weeds on crops.

Walp.) in rice-based cropping systems in the humid tropics as a source of proteins for humans, forage for ruminants, and for improvement of soil fertility. Seasonal and yearly variability is, however, a major constraint. A statistical stability model and a mechanistic simulation model were used to quantify yield variability of early and medium maturity groups of cowpea cultivars in pre- and post-rice environments at Los Baños, Philippines. Four field experiments, with 24 cultivars in each experiment, were conducted in pre- and post-rice environments, to determine the response of the cultivars to varying moisture and to water table depth regimes, and a stability analysis was performed across the regimes using a statistical model. In the post-rice environment, irrespective of moisture and water table depth regimes, the medium maturing cultivars tended to outyield early maturing cultivars, whereas in the pre-rice environment, early maturity demonstrated a distinct yield advantage. The statistical stability model indicated that medium maturing cultivars performed well in high-yielding environments, whereas in low-yielding environments their yields were comparable with those of early maturing types. However, results of the statistical stability model are limited because of the short time series of basic data. To broaden the analysis, a simulation model of the cowpea crop was calibrated and validated for its performance. Measured and simulated dry weights of crop parts (leaves, stems and pods) and soil moisture contents at 10-cm soil depths throughout the growing season indicated satisfactory performance of the simulation model. Long-term simulation results using the validated model indicate that TVX1948-012F (medium maturity) performs betters (800–2250 kg ha−1) than IT82D-889 (early maturity) (430–1620 kg ha−1) with a fluctuating shallow water table in the post-rice environment, whereas IT82D-889 is superior (80–1150 kg ha−1) to TV1948-012F (30–1150 kg ha−1) in the pre-rice environment. Yields are highest and least variable for the 15 January planting in the post-rice environment, and for the 15 April planting in the pre-rice environment. "

The root systems were grown for one month in root boxes with 25 cm in length, 2 cm in width and 40 cm in depth, which were filled with soil. The root systems were sampled by following the needle-pinboard method, and then spread on the transparent plastic films with nets after carefully washing out the soils. The two-dimensional images of root systems were digitized by using a scanner. The digitized images were used for analysis based on fractal geometry with the box-counting method. The reductions in shoot dry weight, photosynthesis rate and transpiration rate of \{IR62266\} by soil drought were greater than those of CT9993. The change of fractal parameters in response to soil moisture conditions differed between the two rice genotypes. The values of fractal abundance (FA) and fractal dimension (FD) in well-watered \{IR62266\} plants were larger than in CT9993. The value of \{FA\} of \{IR62266\} was decreased more by drought stress than that of CT9993, indicating that the volume of soils explored by the whole root systems of \{CT9993\} was maintained or less decreased under drought stress in comparison to IR62266. Moreover, the values of \{FD\} tended to increase in \{CT9993\} while it tended to decrease in \{IR62266\} in response to drought. These root responses detected by the fractal analysis in \{CT9993\} may be advantageous for its extracting more water from drying soils, which explains its better growth under drought-stressed condition.

No data until now have shown that after commercial milling the micronutrient concentration remains higher than that of the control. In our experiment, expression of the soybean ferritin gene under the control of the glutelin promoter in rice has proven to be effective in enhancing grain nutritional levels, not only in brown grains but also in polished grains. Besides determining the iron levels in transgenic rice grains, we also checked for zinc concentration, and it was found to be higher in transgenic seeds than in the control. Moreover, we introduced this gene in an elite indica rice line that has highly desirable agronomic and field-performance traits. Prussian blue staining reaction clearly revealed the presence of iron in the endosperm cells of transgenic rice grains, and immunolocalization revealed the presence of the expression gene in the endosperm of the transgenic material.

Three examples are provided to demonstrate different degrees of participation and different indicator identification tools. The first shows participatory research to determine farmer constraints in Zambia and to explore the use of kraal manure and inorganic fertiliser in a traditional grassmound farming system. The second study concerns participatory research in rural areas of Bangladesh to explore a wide range of new technologies relating primarily to small-scale rice-based systems. The third study concerns participatory rapid rural appraisal to investigate biodiversity in a forest and a grassland area in Uganda. Participatory processes generate traditional knowledge that is broader and more descriptive than scientific information. Such knowledge can also be used to plan future research. The role of the interactive farmer–researcher process is discussed. It is concluded that participatory research has many benefits provided it is managed tactfully and farmers are encouraged to feel that they own the research process. "

It combines a dynamic crop growth model (ORYZA-0) with a numerical optimization procedure and a user interface reading local weather and soil and crop characteristics as inputs to generate site-tailored recommendations for N-fertilizer management. These have the form of generalized logistic curves expressing the ideal temporal pattern to apply any user-defined total N dose. ORYZA-0 simulates crop N uptake, N allocation, growth and yield with only seven equations and a number of empirical constraint parameters. A single exponential relation describes crop growth rate as a function of daily incident global radiation (R, \{MJ\} m2 d1), bulk leaf nitrogen (NL, g N per m2 ground area) and a site calibration factor ƒv. Leaf area and light interception are not explicitly distinguished. Harvest index is calculated from biomass at flowering and cumulative incident radiation after flowering. Values of model parameters are provided based on 16 data sets from China, India, The Philippines and Australia covering 94 nitrogen management treatments (doses, timing). The corresponding 94 growth curves are used to evaluate three aspects of the growth equation, using observed time series of R and L as boundary conditions: (i) goodness of fit of growth curves after calibration of ƒv (ii) variation in ƒv w within and across locations; and (iii) errors in predicted crop biomass at flowering and harvest, using cross-validation between treatments within each site. All curves were fitted with correlation coefficients from 0.97 to 0.99. Parameter ƒv varied more between sets (experiments) than within sets (p &lt; 0.001), with preflowering values between 0.68 and 0.97 and postflowering values 0.38 to 0.96.

Duration from \{PI\} to flowering was positively correlated with the photoperiod experienced after PI; the effect of a 3-h change in photoperiod varied from negligible in some cases to more than 10 days in others. No consistent carryover effect of photoperiod before \{PI\} on the PI-to-flowering duration was detected. As expected, the total main-culm leaf number was influenced by photoperiod before PI, but not thereafter. Although the leaf number varied greatly both among cultivars and among pre-PI photoperiods, the number of unexpanded leaves at \{PI\} was nearly constant, with an average of about three leaves. This study further supports the earlier experimental finding that rice photoperiod sensitivity continues some days after PI, suggesting the inadequacy of the assumption in crop simulation model CERES-Rice that the PI-to-flowering duration is influenced only by a carryover effect of pre-PI photoperiod.

Changes in the optical properties of rice panicles throughout maturity were evaluated under field conditions by measuring (i) effective quantum yield of photosystem \{II\} efficiency (ΦII), (ii) steady-state chlorophyll fluorescence (FS) and (iii) ratio of emitted chlorophyll fluorescence at 690 and 735 nm, under excitation at 435 nm (F690/F735).

abstract = "Abstract Rice fields are considered as one of the major sources of methane (CH4), and they also emit nitrous oxide (N2O). A field experiment was conducted at the International Rice Research Institute, Philippines, in 2010–2011 using a temperature free-air controlled enhancement (T-FACE) system. Our objectives were to assess (i) the suitability of the T-FACE system for flooded rice fields and (ii) seasonal variations in greenhouse gas emissions with and without experimental warming. This observation period included one wet season (WS), one dry season (DS), and a fallow season. The experimental warming, i.e., T-FACE system, was maintained by using six infrared heaters deployed in a hexagonal pattern over each plot (7.1 m2). Set-point canopy temperatures of the warming treatment were 1.5 and 3.0 °C higher than the reference plots during daytime and nighttime, respectively. Two warming treatments (i.e., heated and reference) were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Infrared warming increased rice canopy temperature by 1.1 and 2.6 °C (0.4 °C below the targeted set-point) during daytime and nighttime, respectively. On the other hand, only a marginal (0.4–0.5 °C) increase was observed for both water and soil temperatures, likely because flood irrigation water flowed across the field. The warming (elevated canopy temperature) had no significant effects on \{CH4\} or \{N2O\} emissions during the dry, wet, and fallow seasons. However, diel and seasonal variations in \{CH4\} emissions were observed during the rice-growing and fallow periods. \{CH4\} emissions were higher during the early afternoons, which was positively correlated with both soil and air temperatures. Similarly, \{CH4\} emission rates increased with rice growth stage up to the reproductive stage. Moreover, cumulative \{CH4\} emissions were 1.5 times higher in the 2011 \{DS\} than in the 2010 \{WS\} (50 and 34 g \{CH4\} m−2, respectively). The 2-month fallow season (late May–early July 2011) under continuous flooding emitted 51 g \{CH4\} m−2, which is similar to that in the 2011 DS. On the other hand, \{N2O\} emissions were not detected throughout the growing season, but an emission peak was observed after final drainage at maturity during the 2011 DS. Both rice-growing and fallow seasons were the major sources of \{CH4\} emissions as long as the field was continuously flooded, while \{N2O\} was not detectable in continuously flooded soil. Infrared warming did not affect rice yields or yield components, probably because the general growing temperatures were near optimum, and the warming treatment was not sufficiently large to cause a significant effect.

Based on this result, we developed nine near-isogenic lines (NILs) targeting eight resistance genes – Pik, Pi7(t), Pi3, Pi5, Pita-2, Piz-5, Pish, and Pi9 – by recurrent backcrossing. The introgression of each resistance gene in the \{NILs\} was confirmed by reaction patterns to the blast isolates, allelism tests, and \{DNA\} marker analysis. In addition, a genome-wide \{DNA\} marker survey revealed that most of the chromosome regions in each \{NIL\} were of the IR49830-7-1-2-2 type. The agricultural characteristics of most of the developed \{NILs\} were almost the same as those of IR49830-7-1-2-2.

abstract = "Abstract Rice is a staple cereal of India cultivated in about 43.5 Mha area but with relatively low average productivity. Abiotic factors like drought, flood and salinity affect rice production adversely in more than 50% of this area. Breeding rice varieties with inbuilt tolerance to these stresses offers an economically viable and sustainable option to improve rice productivity. Availability of high quality reference genome sequence of rice, knowledge of exact position of genes/QTLs governing tolerance to abiotic stresses and availability of \{DNA\} markers linked to these traits has opened up opportunities for breeders to transfer the favorable alleles into widely grown rice varieties through marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB). A large multi-institutional project, “From \{QTL\} to variety: marker-assisted breeding of abiotic stress tolerant rice varieties with major \{QTLs\} for drought, submergence and salt tolerance” was initiated in 2010 with funding support from Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, in collaboration with International Rice Research Institute, Philippines. The main focus of this project is to improve rice productivity in the fragile ecosystems of eastern, northeastern and southern part of the country, which bear the brunt of one or the other abiotic stresses frequently. Seven consistent \{QTLs\} for grain yield under drought, namely, qDTY1.1, qDTY2.1, qDTY2.2, qDTY3.1, qDTY3.2, qDTY9.1 and qDTY12.1 are being transferred into submergence tolerant versions of three high yielding mega rice varieties, Swarna-Sub1, Samba Mahsuri-Sub1 and \{IR\} 64-Sub1. To address the problem of complete submergence due to flash floods in the major river basins, the Sub1 gene is being transferred into ten highly popular locally adapted rice varieties namely, \{ADT\} 39, \{ADT\} 46, Bahadur, \{HUR\} 105, \{MTU\} 1075, Pooja, Pratikshya, Rajendra Mahsuri, Ranjit, and Sarjoo 52. Further, to address the problem of soil salinity, Saltol, a major \{QTL\} for salt tolerance is being transferred into seven popular locally adapted rice varieties, namely, \{ADT\} 45, \{CR\} 1009, Gayatri, \{MTU\} 1010, \{PR\} 114, Pusa 44 and Sarjoo 52. Genotypic background selection is being done after \{BC2F2\} stage using an in-house designed 50K \{SNP\} chip on a set of twenty lines for each combination, identified with phenotypic similarity in the field to the recipient parent. Near-isogenic lines with more than 90% similarity to the recipient parent are now in advanced generation field trials. These climate smart varieties are expected to improve rice productivity in the adverse ecologies and contribute to the farmer’s livelihood. "

Results Rice variaty \{BR5\} of aman and \{BRRI\} dhan28 of boro season comparatively showed higher \{TPC\} and Antioxidant properties than the other rice varieties. \{BR22\} of aman season showed the highest hydroxyl ion scavenging activity although it displayed the lowest TPC. Except for hydroxyl ion scavenging activity, aman rice varieties displayed comparatively higher total phenolic content and antioxidant property than the boro rice varieties. Conclusions The results of the present study implies that the selected rice varieties possess moderate antioxidant capacity and therefore, can be considered as health supplements and nutraceuticals foods as rice is the staple food of Bangladesh.

This paper reviews recent findings on direct effects of UV-B on rice growth and yield as well as indirect effects via impacts on other organisms in the rice (Oryza sativa) agroecosystem. The findings are based on research by scientists at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in Los Baños, the Philippines, and their collaborators in China and the United States; with comparison to research by scientists in other countries. Current results indicate that while enhanced UV-B directly impacts many aspects of rice growth, physiology, and biochemistry under controlled phytotron conditions; in general rice growth and yield are not affected under natural field conditions. The difference in response may be related both to the levels of UV-B exposure used in phytotron vs. field studies and the lower ratio of UV-A to UV-B in the phytotron compared to field. In terms of indirect effects on rice blast disease, enhanced UV-B affected both the fungus itself (Pyricularia grisea) and the susceptibility of the rice plant to the fungus. Based on these data, simulation models estimated potential impacts of higher UV-B levels on blast severity and rice yield in different countries of southeast and east Asia. Ultimately, results from rice studies can be used to identify strategies to minimize any negative effects of UV-B on rice productivity. "

abstract = "Abstract Increasing the productivity of the rice–wheat (RW) system in north-west India is critical for the food security of India. However, yields are stagnating or declining, and the rate of groundwater use is not sustainable. Many improved technologies are under development for \{RW\} systems, with multiple objectives including increased production, improved soil fertility, greater input use efficiency, reduced environmental pollution, and higher profitability for farmers. There are large reductions in irrigation amount with many of these technologies compared with conventional practice, such as laser land leveling, alternate wetting and drying (AWD) water management in rice, delayed rice transplanting, shorter duration rice varieties, zero till wheat, raised beds, and replacing rice with other crops. However, the nature of the irrigation water savings has seldom been determined. It is often likely to be due to reduced deep drainage, with little effect on evapotranspiration (ET). Reducing deep drainage has major benefits, including reduced energy consumption to pump groundwater, nutrient loss by leaching, and groundwater pollution. The impacts of alternative technologies on deep drainage (and thus on irrigation water savings) vary greatly depending on site conditions, especially soil permeability, depth to the watertable, and water management. More than 90% of the major \{RW\} areas in north-west India are irrigated using groundwater. Here, reducing deep drainage will not “save water” nor reduce the rate of decline of the watertable. In these regions, it is critical that technologies that decrease \{ET\} and increase the amount of crop produced per amount of water lost as \{ET\} (i.e., crop water productivity, WPET) are implemented. The best technologies for achieving this are delaying rice transplanting and short duration rice varieties. The potential for replacing rice with other crops with lower \{ET\} is less clear. "

The number of such measurements can be reduced considerably if “classical” soil horizons that are to be sampled can be merged into broader, hydraulic functional horizons. A hydraulic-functional horizon comprises one or more soil horizons that are similar in terms of soil hydraulic functions. A detailed soil survey was carried out in a 50 ha dryland rice area to test the concept of hydraulic-functional horizons and to obtain soil hydraulic input data for a crop growth simulation model. The feasibility of identifying hydraulic-functional horizons from visual appraisal of texture and structure during the field survey was demonstrated. Soil water retention and conductivity data determined for the functional horizons and weather data from a nearby weather station were used to simulate potential and rainfed rice yield for 25 years. A variability analysis showed that the effect of variation in soil hydraulic properties on simulated rice yield was relatively small compared to the effect of variation in year to year weather conditions. It was concluded that sampling strategies for soil hydraulic functions should be based on a first rough comparison of the impact of weather variability and soil heterogeneity on yield variability using simulation and sensitivity analyses.

The objective of this study was to identify and characterize quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for SN/PnN with emphasis on their interactions with growth environments using recombinant inbred (RI) and heterogeneous inbred family (HIF) lines. One-hundred-and-ninety-one \{RI\} lines (F7) derived from a cross between two genetically divergent high-yielding varieties, Milyang 23 (M23, Indica type with a large SN/PnN) and Akihikari (AK, Japonica type), were grown for three crop seasons in both Joetsu, Japan (temperate climate) and Los Baños, Philippines (tropical climate) to detect \{QTLs\} for SN/PnN at the \{LOD\} threshold of 2.0 using simple interval mapping. \{QTLs\} were detected repeatedly in eight genomic regions on chromosomes (chr.) 1 (two regions), 2 (two), 4 (two) and 6 (two). Two closely linked \{QTLs\} located on the short arm of chr. 1 (the nearest \{RFLP\} marker, XNpb359) increased SN/PnN with the \{M23\} allele more significantly in Joetsu (LOD=14.0–18.2) than in Los Baños (LOD=5.7–9.6). The \{QTL\} effect detected on chr. 4 (C513) was likewise enhanced in Joetsu, and those on chr. 2 (XNpb298) and 6 (XNpb12) for the Los Baños dry season. Thus, the interaction between \{QTL\} and environment was greatly involved in the determination of SN/PnN. For detailed characterization of the large-effect \{QTLs\} detected on chr. 1 (XNpb359), 20 \{HIF\} lines that segregated for the genomic region with the \{M23\} and \{AK\} homozygotes as being isogenic for other regions were evaluated in Los Baños for SN/PnN and other agronomic traits. For the heading stage, the \{M23\} homozygote resulted in a 29% decrease in tiller number relative to the \{AK\} homozygote, and for the harvesting stage, the \{M23\} homozygote resulted in &gt;25% increase and decrease in SN/PnN and panicle number (PnN), respectively. These results demonstrate that the \{QTLs\} on chr. 1 primarily affect tillering, thereafter SN/PnN and PnN in opposite directions depending on the alleles present, while interacting with the environment. SN/PnN \{QTLs\} are further discussed with respect to their positional relations to PnN \{QTLs\} previously reported, thereby showing key \{QTLs\} for improving either trait without suppressing the other trait. The information on the \{QTL\} locations, effects and interactions with the environments would be helpful for genetic improvement of SN/PnN and ultimately for increasing rice yields over different locations.

However, soil nutrient status and water conditions along toposequences in rainfed farmers’ fields may differ from those at the research station. Therefore, yield constraints need to be analyzed in farmers’ fields in order to design management strategies to increase yield and yield stability. We applied production ecological concepts to analyze yield-limiting factors (water, N) on rice yields along toposequences in farmers’ fields using data from on-farm experiments conducted in 2000–2002 in Indonesia. Potential, water-limited, and N-limited yields were simulated using the \{ORYZA2000\} crop growth model. Farmers’ fields showed large spatial and temporal variation in hydrology (354–1235 mm seasonal rainfall, −150 to 50 cm field-water depth) and fertilizer doses (76–166 N, 0–45 P, and 0–51 kg K ha−1). Farmers’ yields ranged from 0.32 to 5.88 Mg ha−1. The range in yield gap caused by water limitations was 0–28% and that caused by N limitations 35–63%, with large temporal and spatial variability. The relative limitations of water and N in farmers’ fields varied strongly among villages in rainfed rice areas and toposequence positions, with yield gaps due to water and N at the top and upper middle positions higher than at the lower middle and bottom toposequence positions, and yield gaps in late wet seasons higher than those in early wet seasons. Management options (e.g. crop establishment dates, shortening turnaround time, using varieties with shorter duration, supplemental irrigation) to help the late-season crop escape, or minimize the negative effects of, late-season droughts and supplying adequate N-fertilizer are important for increasing yield in rainfed lowland rice in Indonesia. More N-fertilizer should be given to upper toposequence positions than to lower positions because the former had a lower indigenous nutrient supply and hence a better response to N-fertilizer inputs. Systems approaches using production ecological concepts can be applied in yield constraint analysis for indentifying management strategies to increase yield and yield stability in farmers’ fields in other rainfed lowland areas.

In both diabetic populations, the reduction in glycemic index was similar at 24%, suggesting that the effect was reproducible, and also that glycemic response was not affected by previous daily exposure of the subjects to rice. The effect of extrusion appears to be related to the starch gelatinization and retrogradation which occurred during processing as indicated by the lower amylograph viscosity and softer gel consistency of the rice noodles compared to the milled rice, as well as by the retrogradation test. The low glycemic response to high amylose rice and particularly the rice noodles suggests that these foods may have health benefits to both normal and diabetic individuals. "

The temporal and spatial distribution of water quality tendency was observed. The water quality of each river is dependent on the hydrology effect such water gate and circulating irrigation system. We must consider the hydrology effect to accurately understand water quality variations of river in this study field. In river without highly circulating irrigation system or water gate effect, the downstream nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration increase occurred in area dominated by open field cultivation, whereas the NO3-N concentration was constant or decreased in area dominated by greenhouse land use. This result suggests that greenhouse covers the soil from precipitation, and nitrate load of greenhouse could be less than that of open field cultivation while the rainfall event. In the upper reaches of river, where is dominated by open field cultivation, there were no sharp increase dissolved molybdate reactive phosphorus and total phosphorus concentration, but P load was accumulated in the lower reaches of river, whose predominant land use is greenhouse. Although the P sources is unclear in this study, greenhouse area may have potential of P loads due to its high P content in greenhouse soil. Considering hydrology effect is necessary to determine what the major factor is influencing the water quality variation, especially in area with highly complicated irrigation system in this studying site.

Bypass flow processes were studied in a cracked, previously puddled rice soil. Vertical continuity of soil cracks (10-10 mm in width) was determined in the field using a morphological staining technique. Cracks reached a depth of 0.65 m. An infiltration experiment showed that water was mainly absorbed in the subsoil between 0.2 and 0.5 m epth. In a laboratory experiment, simulated rainfall was applied to large undisturbed soil columns taken from the field. High bypassing ratios (greater than 0.9) were obtained for low (10 mm h−1) and high (30 mm h−1) rain intensities. Shallow surface tillage (0–50 mm) in the field reduced bypass flow, and laboratory experiments showed 45–60% water savings as a result of making the cracks discontinuous. For rainfed rice areas, introduction of this tillage practice may lead to earlier transplanting and therefore reduced risk of late drought. In some areas this may broaden the scope for a second crop. In irrigated rice systems, water savings during land preparation may allow an increase in the command area of an irrigation system. "

This study investigates the impact of land ownership on the productivity and technical efficiency of rice farmers in the Philippines. We use a 2007–2012 Loop Survey from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and a stochastic frontier function method. Results show that land ownership has a significant impact on technical efficiency. In particular, counter to the theory, the \{CARP\} may have reduced the technical efficiency of leasehold farmers compared with owner operators. Additionally, results show that land area, fuel cost, fertilizer cost, irrigation cost, and labor cost are significant factors that affect rice production. We found a mean technical efficiency score of 0.79—still leaving room for improvement. Finally, educated females and farmers leasing land have higher technical inefficiency. "

The genetic potential of the yield components harvest index and grain number, which were targeted in the “green revolution” and subsequently by cereal breeders have largely been optimised in our two largest global cereal crops, rice and wheat. Physiologists and breeders are turning to the biomass portion of the yield equation and in particular radiation use efficiency, as a means to push the yield potential barrier. Consequently, in the last decade a large effort has been initiated to identify targets to improve photosynthetic performance both using non-transgenic Phenomics approaches and transgenic technologies. Efficiency of light interception, harvesting and energy utilisation have been targeted but most efforts have so far focussed on improving photosynthetic capacity and efficiency in photosynthetic carbon metabolism in rice, wheat and model plants. Here the targets for improving light harvesting and carbon fixation are reviewed, the progress thus far evaluated and the likelihood of success of these activities in improving crop yields discussed in the context of modelling and scaling from the leaf to the canopy.

Replacement of rice with less water requiring crops such as maize in the \{RWS\} and identification of effective strategies for alternate tillage systems will promote sustainable cropping systems in the IGP. To this effect a 3-year field experiment was established with annual maize–wheat rotation in the north-western \{IGP\} of India to evaluate the effect of 3 tillage systems (conventional flat, CTF; no-till flat, NTF; permanent raised beds, NTB) on crop production, water use efficiency, economic profitability and soil physical quality. Grain yield of maize was highest (8.2–73.4%) under \{NTB\} followed by \{NTF\} and \{CTF\} across the years. Wheat yield was significantly higher under \{NTF\} during the 1st year while tillage practices had non-significant effect in the succeeding two years. On average, maize planted on \{NTB\} recorded about 11% lower water use and 16% higher water use efficiency compared to CT. The \{NTB\} and \{NTF\} required 24.7% and 10.8% less irrigation water than \{CTF\} system, respectively with 11.5% higher system productivity and demonstrated higher water productivity. The \{NTB\} and \{NTF\} systems provided similar net returns (averaged over 3 years) in maize–wheat system (MWS), which were US$ 281 ha−1 higher compared to \{CTF\} system. The \{CTF\} system had higher bulk density and penetration resistance in 10–15 and 15–20 cm soil layers due to compaction caused by the repeated tillage. The steady-state infiltration rate and soil aggregation (&gt;0.25 mm) were higher under \{NTB\} and \{NTF\} and lower in the \{CTF\} system. Similarly, mean weight diameter (MWD) of aggregates was higher under \{NTF\} and \{NTB\} compared to CTF. The study reveals that \{NTB\} and \{NTF\} systems could be more viable options for \{MWS\} in order to save input costs and enhance profitability; however, the long-term effects of these alternative technologies need to be studied under varying agro-ecologies.

As rice is one of the most important food resources in the world, sustainable management of rice paddies is increasingly in demand. However, little is known about the influence of invertebrates on decomposition processes in these ecosystems. We hypothesized that invertebrates contribute significantly to the decomposition of rice straw in paddies and that their relative contribution is affected by the distance to other landscape structures within fields. We placed rice straw in litterbags of two different mesh sizes which prevent (20 μm × 20 μm) or allow (5 mm × 5 mm) access of invertebrates in six irrigated rice fields for 84 days. In each field, bags were set on three transects running from the bund to the center of the field. Invertebrates significantly increased total rice straw litter mass loss by up to 45% (total decomposition: fine-meshed bags 64%; coarse-meshed bags 83%). Litter mass loss in bags accessed by invertebrates decreased with increasing distance from the bund. Such a spatial trend in litter mass loss was not observed in bags accessed only by microbes. Our results indicated that invertebrates can contribute to soil fertility in irrigated rice fields by decomposing rice straw, and that the efficiency of decomposition may be promoted by landscape structures around rice fields.

abstract = "The present study was carried out to illustrate high-efficient detection of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with selected introgression lines (ILs) and the existence of ‘hidden genes’ conferring drought tolerance (DT). 52 selected \{DT\} ILs, derived from \{BC2F2\} population developed by crossing and backcrossing the susceptible recurrent parent (RP) \{IR64\} with the susceptible donor Khazar were planted under irrigation and drought condition. Four important agronomic traits, e.g., grain yield (GY), heading date (HD), panicle numbers per plant (PN), and plant height (PH) were evaluated and 83 \{SSR\} polymorphic molecular markers were used for genotypic analysis. Chi-square test based on genetic hitch-hiking and one-way analysis of variances (ANOVA) were used to detect drought-related loci. Nine and 36 loci were detected by chi-square test and one-way ANOVA, respectively. Five common loci were observed by comparing the results of the two methods, among which two \{QTLs\} linked with RM7, and \{RM241\} were detected under irrigation condition, both of the favorable alleles were from \{RP\} and explained 13% phenotypic variation (PV) for \{GY\} and 28% \{PV\} for PH, respectively. The other three \{QTLs\} linked with RM163, RM18, and \{RM270\} were detected under drought condition, the favorable alleles were all from the donor and explained 10, 24, and 19% \{PV\} for HD, PH, and PH, respectively. Five common loci were observed by comparing the results of chi-square test and one-way \{ANOVA\} including two \{QTLs\} (one for \{GY\} and one for PH) under irrigation condition and three \{QTLs\} (one for \{HD\} and two for PH) under drought condition. By combining phenotypic and genotypic analysis, drought escape could be inferred as the main mechanism for drought tolerance in the present study. The results in present study suggested that the selected \{ILs\} population analyzed by chi-square test and one-way \{ANOVA\} was quite effective for \{DT\} \{QTL\} detection with low inputs and could also produce useful materials for breeding with wide genetic diversity for drought tolerance.

We report the results of a case study of destruction in Tunceli, eastern Turkey, undertaken in order to evaluate support for such claims. We demonstrate the use of geospatial techniques in case-specific approaches to the study of armed conflict. Through the analysis of satellite images, we verified eyewitness reports and confirmed that substantial burnings did indeed take place in the study area between 1991 and 1994. We argue that this destruction was not irrational or wanton, but that it was part of a strategy used by the Turkish army in the early 1990s that aimed at actively transforming the war environment. "

abstract = "The implications of adopting alternative seeding methods for rice and wheat establishment were examined at three geographically separate sites in the rice–wheat system of the Indo-Gangetic plains, across northern India. Rice yields in cultivated plots, established by either wet or dry seeding methods, were evaluated in comparison to yields from zero-tillage plots and under conventional transplanting methods. In the same trials, the effects of crop establishment methods in wheat were assessed both on wheat yields and rice yields. Rice crop establishment methods markedly influenced the emerging weed flora and attainable yields were measured in relation to intensity of weed management. Over four years, average rice grain yields in the absence of weed competition were greatest (6.56 t ha−1) under wet seeding (sowing pre-germinated rice seed on puddled soil), and similar to those from transplanted rice (6.17 t ha−1) into puddled soil, and dry seeded rice after dry soil tillage (6.15 t ha−1). Lowest yields were observed from dry seeded rice sown without tillage (5.44 t ha−1). Rice yield losses due to uncontrolled weed growth were least in transplanted rice (12%) but otherwise large (c. 85%) where rice had been sown to dry cultivated fields or to puddled soil, rising to 98% in dry seeded rice sown without soil tillage. Weed competition reduced multiple rice yield components, and weed biomass in wet seeded rice was six-fold greater that in rice transplanted into puddled soil and twice as much again in dry seeded rice sown either after dry tillage or without tillage. Wheat grain yields were significantly higher from crops sown into tilled soil (3.89 t ha−1) than those sown without tillage (3.51 t ha−1), and also were elevated (5% on average) where the soil had been dry cultivated in preparation for the previous rice crops rather than puddled. The method of wheat cultivation did not influence rice yield. Soil infiltration rates in the wheat season were least where the land had been puddled for rice (1.52 mm h−1), and greater where the soil had been dry-tilled (2.63 mm h−1) and greatest after zero-tillage (3.54 mm h−1). These studies demonstrated at research managed sites across a wide geographic area, and on farmers’ fields, that yields of dry seeded rice sown after dry cultivation of soil were broadly comparable with those of transplanted rice, providing weed competition was absent. These results support the proposition that direct seeding of rice could provide an alternative to the conventional practice of transplanting, and help address rising costs and threats to sustainability in the rice–wheat rotation. Further, analysis of patterns of long-term rainfall data indicated that farmers reliant on monsoon rainfall could prepare fields for dry direct seeded rice some 30 days before they could prepare fields for either transplanting or seeding with pre-germinated seed. Dry, direct seeding of rice contributes a valuable component of an adaptive strategy to address monsoonal variability that also may advance the time of wheat establishment and yield. Whilst the results illustrate the robustness, feasibility and significant potential of direct seeded rice, they also highlight the critical nature of effective weed control in successful implementation of direct seeding systems for rice.

The three derived \{BB\} resistant restorer lines (Minghui63–Xa23, YR293–Xa23 and Y1671–Xa23) and their hybrid combinations with Zhenshan97A (Shanyou63–Xa23), NongfengA (Fengyou293–Xa23) and Zhong9A (Zhongyou1671–Xa23) demonstrated similar \{BB\} resistance spectrum as the donor parent, \{CBB23\} (B). The newly developed \{BB\} resistant restorers and their derived hybrids were identical to their respective original versions for agronomic traits especially under disease free condition. However, under severe disease condition, the three \{BB\} resistant restorer lines exhibited significantly higher grain weight and spikelet fertility as compared to the respective original restorer lines thus further resulting in \{BB\} resistant hybrids with significantly higher grain yields than their respective popular original hybrids. The results indicated that the Xa23 gene could completely express its dominant broad spectrum resistance in different backgrounds of both restorer and male sterile lines across different growth stages, suggesting its immense breeding value in \{BB\} resistance improvement for hybrid rice. Moreover, a reasonable utilization and deployment of Xa23 gene for efficient control of \{BB\} disease in hybrid rice production was recommended. "

Limited research has been done so far on optimizing nutrient management to produce high yields. In this study, we investigated yield formation and dry matter translocation of aerobic rice cultivar \{HD297\} in response to N application, grown under different irrigation regimes at two sites close to Beijing, North China. At the “experimental farm”, the groundwater table depth was 0.2–1 m; at the “experimental station”, it was deeper than 2 m. Fertilizer-N rates were 0, 75, and 150 kg N ha−1 applied in split dressings according to regional recommendations for lowland rice, with 30% being applied at sowing, 40% at tillering, and 30% at panicle initiation. The application of N increased grain yields from 3.4 to 4.4 t ha−1. There was no interaction between N rates and water management, and no effect of water treatment on the grain yield. Before anthesis, dry matter accumulation increased with N application, but after anthesis, it decreased with increasing N application. With high N applications, grain filling was limited by a low contribution of post-anthesis assimilates. This indicates that traditional lowland rice fertilizer application schedules are not suitable for aerobic rice. N rate and timing of N fertilizer should be adjusted to balance crop's demand before and after anthesis. Reducing N before anthesis and applying N at anthesis is necessary to increase post-anthesis dry matter accumulation and finally grain yield. Furthermore, germplasm improvement is suggested to increase the translocation of dry matter to grain for increasing grain yield. On average, yield was 14% higher at the “experimental farm” than at the “experimental station”. Differences in crop growth and Mn uptake between the farm and the station mainly resulted from the difference in hydrology. In target areas for aerobic rice with a deep groundwater table more research is needed to determine whether Mn deficiency is a potential cause of yield suppression of aerobic rice. "

It has been suggested that the relationship between the critical N concentration and dry matter per unit ground area for a wide range of crops is the same and is independent of climatic zone. Results presented in this paper support the concept of a critical N-dilution curve for yield of rice (Oryza sativa L.), which may be independent of climatic zone. The similarity between the nitrogen dilution curves for temperate and tropical environments indicates that there is no intrinsic difference in the ratio of carbon-to-nitrogen capture in those environments even though the final aboveground biomasses differed. Both the rate and duration of resource capture are probably limiting yields in tropical environments. In order to break through the current ceiling-yield barrier of approximately 10 t grain ha−1 in the tropics, superior germplasm must be lodging resistant and capable of acquiring 144 kg N ha−1 (N0.5) in the first 35 days following transplanting. An examination of the rates of nitrogen acquisition indicated that more emphasis must be placed on providing sufficient nitrogen during the early stage of crop growth if higher yields are to be obtained. The time course of nitrogen accumulation by the aboveground biomass was calculated for weights greater than 1 t ha−1; at weights less than this there were insufficient data to make calculations. At weights of aboveground biomass greater than 1 t ha−1, the rate of nitrogen acquisition per unit ground area declined. The decline probably reflected a lowering in crop demand for soil nitrogen caused by the internal cycling of nitrogen from aging to young developing tissues; roots' age may also play a part in the decline. The estimated rate of demand for nitrogen by the panicle exceeded the rate at which the aboveground biomass acquired it, emphasizing the importance of having a large `reservoir' of nitrogen in vegetative tissues. Such a reservoir would ensure that the nitrogen demand of the panicle could be met without causing the photosynthetic capacity of the crop to prematurely lose its ability to meet the carbohydrate demand of the panicle.

Plastic film mulching (PM) resulted in 12% higher average yield of rice while wheat straw mulching (SM) led to 14% lower average yield of rice compared with lowland rice under traditional flooding (TF). Biomass accumulation and nutrient uptake followed similar trends to grain yield. Changes in soil temperature in relation to root growth and nutrient uptake were likely to be the major factor responsible for the changes in rice yields under non-flooded mulching cultivation. Compared with TF, \{PM\} of preceding rice did not affect the grain yield of wheat, whereas \{SM\} of preceding rice resulted in comparable grain yields of wheat at a lower N rate (60 kg N ha−1) in the wheat season. The system productivity (total yield of rice+wheat) in \{PM\} was similar to that of \{TF\} and higher than that of SM. The yield decline in rice, however, could be partly compensated by the yield increase in wheat following rice, particularly at lower N rates. Apparent nutrient budgets showed positive nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) balances but negative potassium (K) balance in the \{TF\} and non-flooded mulching R–W systems. Compared with TF, \{PM\} led to lower \{NPK\} balance due to more nutrient removal by crops while \{SM\} led to greater \{NPK\} balance due to more nutrient inputs from straw but less nutrient removal by crops. After 3 years soil organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) were not significantly altered by \{PM\} and \{SM\} but soil Olsen-P (AP) and exchangeable K (EK) were significantly increased by \{SM\} compared with TF. The changes in soil properties under non-flooded mulching cultivation initially reflected the nutrient balances in R–W systems. In conclusion, non-flooded mulching cultivation as \{PM\} and \{SM\} could be applied to R–W systems in southwest China but nutrient (especially N) management should be optimized in the two systems.

Because floury mutants have physical attributes for milling processes, identification and characterization of those mutants are valuable. In this study we identified a floury endosperm mutant caused by a T-DNA insertion in Oryza sativa alanine-aminotransferase1 (OsAlaAT1). OsAlaAT1 is localized in the cytosol and has aminotransferase enzyme activity. The osalaat1 mutant has less amylose and its amylopectin is structurally altered. OsAlaAT1 is predominantly expressed in developing seeds during active starch synthesis. AlaAT catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate to alanine, and this pathway is activated under low-oxygen conditions. Consistently, OsAlaAT1 is induced by such conditions. Expression of the starch synthesis genes AGPases, OsSSI, OsSSIIa, and OsPPDKB is decreased in the mutant. Thus, our observations suggest that OsAlaAT1 plays an essential role in starch synthesis in developing seeds that are exposed to low concentrations of oxygen. "
