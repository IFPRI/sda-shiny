We describe two unusual, AT-rich minisatellites of the protozoan parasite Theileria parva whose sequences are unrelated to the G/C-rich `chi minisatellite superfamily' of vertebrate and plant genomes. The T. parva tandem repeats, one with a conserved sequence T2-5ACACA (6–17 copies), and the other with a 6-bp core sequence of either \{ACTATA\} or \{TATACT\} associated with additional variable sequences in repeats of 10–17 bp (3–7 copies), were closely linked at more than 20 sites in the T. parva genome, separated by 390, 510 and 660 bp at three loci analysed in detail. Such linkage is without precedent in minisatellites so far analysed in other organisms. The minisatellite loci were widely dispersed on 13 out of 33 genomic SfiI fragments, on all four T. parva chromosomes and did not exhibit a telomeric bias in their distribution. Analysis of flanking sequences revealed no obvious conserved sequences between the five loci, or other multicopy repeat sequences outside the minisatellite regions. The T2-5 \{ACACA\} minisatellite was highly effective as a multilocus fingerprinting probe for discrimination of T. parva isolates. Analysis of two individual minisatellite loci revealed variation between the genomic \{DNAs\} of two T. parva isolates in the copy number of the constituent repeats within the array, similar to that typical of vertebrate minisatellites.

Bovine lymphocytes were stained with the mAb at various intervals after infection in vitro and in vivo. The p67 sporozoite surface antigen was detected in only a small percentage of both, in vitro and in vivo infected cells. In contrast, expression of the polymorphic immunodominant molecule (PIM) of the parasite proved a useful indicator of infection and staining was correlated with the results of Giemsa analysis. \{PIM\} was detected from day 3 in in vitro-infected cells, but was not detected until day 5 in vivo after challenge with a 70% lethal dose of stabilized sporozoite. The p32 antigen was expressed only late in infection in vivo and its expression was associated with the development of merozoites. Less than 20% of in vitro-infected cells expressed p32. The immunohistochemical staining with anti-PIM mAb was found to be a useful tool for analysis of T. parva infection kinetics in cattle. "

The availability of infective larvae was monitored by monthly pasture sampling and larvae recovery. Infective larvae were recovered from the herbage collected from the plots contaminated in June, July, August, September and October of both years. The longevity of infective larvae varied between two and six weeks when eggs were deposited on pasture in June and October, respectively. During the dry and short rainy season (November through May), eggs failed to develop into \{L3\} stage. It is suggested that the long period (7 to 8 months) of lack of development of trichostrongylid infective larvae on the pasture can be efficiently used in a strategic treatment programme to interrupt transmission of H. contortus, L. elongata and T. colubriformis in sheep in this environment.

Nitrogen in sesbania leaves was mineralized more rapidly than that in leucaena leaves; one sesbania accession released as much N as that released from urea fertilizer applied at an equivalent rate of 60 kg N ha−1. Mineralizable N ranged from 15 to 53% of leaf N and it was negatively correlated with hemicellulose content and hemicellulose-to-N ratio.

Within each of these categories, progress made and future opportunities are discussed. In addition, a review is made of how veterinary epidemiology and economics has been institutionalised. We conclude that veterinary epidemiology and economics holds a unique role in the development of national policies and strategies for improved animal health world-wide. However, we consider that we must capitalise more on the unique comparative advantage of the partnership between veterinarians and agricultural economists. We believe that much remains to be done to improve the “institutionalisation” of veterinary epidemiology and economics, and the adoption and impact of the products of our unique partnership, particularly in countries of the developing world.

A key resource that could be useful in reversing this trend is manure from livestock. The N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn contents of manures collected from six experimental stations and twenty small-scale farms in the Ethiopian highlands were analysed. The manures contained, on average, 21.3 g K, 18.3 g N, 16.4 g Ca, 5.6 g Mg, 4.5 g P, 10776 mg Fe, 777 mg Mn, 92 mg Zn and 24 mg Cu per kg. Manures from experimental stations contained significantly more N, P, K, Mg, Cu and Zn than the manures from smallholder farms, probably due to differences in feed availability and quality. Fresh manures and stored (dry) manures were not significantly different in nutrient concentrations although stored manures had slightly higher nutrient concentrations, probably as a concentration effect after loss of carbon. Manures collected from farms in Deneba area had significantly greater contents of P, K, Mg, and Cu than manures collected in Ginchi area, but, due to scarcity of fuel wood, farmers in Deneba use manures for fuel for domestic cooking and heating instead of applying it to the soil. Afforestation programmes, or other programmes that would ease the energy problem for domestic use, may be necessary if manures are to be applied to soils. Whether the amount of manure in the livestock-dense Ethiopian highlands is sufficient to support crop production is unknown. Research in other parts of Africa indicates that, although adequate manure may be applied to some fields, insufficient manure is available to support crop production at a wider scale. "

In free range grazing systems, livestock nutrient deficiencies are mainly overcome by moving the animals to better grazing areas. This makes monitoring and managing of nutrients within a system very difficult. Nutrient recovery, cycling and synchronization of manure with other recycled or purchased sources are greater in mixed crop–livestock systems. In these systems, inclusion of nitrogen-fixing leguminous forage/tree crops as companions or rotation crops with cereals further improves the nutrient use efficiency and balance. With more favourable market and policies, commercialized dairy systems are developing around the urban areas of Africa. Such systems heavily depend on purchased feeds and nutrients, and have serious implications for the nutrient balance and sustainability of land use systems in the rural areas which supply the feeds, and for the urban areas because of the risk of pollution from the accumulating animal wastes.

The cellular and molecular bases of this so-called trypanotolerance are not known, but the trait is manifested by the N’Dama’s greater capacity to control parasitaemia and anaemia development during an infection. In order to examine the role of the haematopoietic system in trypanotolerance, we have exploited the tendency for the placentas of bovine twin embryos to fuse. Placental fusion in cattle results in bone marrow chimaerism in twins. By comparison with the N’Dama, cattle of the East African Boran breed are relatively susceptible. We evaluated the role of the haemopoietic system in trypanotolerance by comparing the performance of five Chimaeric Boran/N’Dama twin calves with that of singletons of the two breeds. Chimaeric Boran/N’Dama pairs of twins were produced in recipient Boran cows by embryo transfer, and the majority of haemopoietic cells in all twinned individuals were of Boran origin. Thus, N’Dama chimaeras differed from N’Dama singletons in that the bulk of their haemopoietic system was derived from their susceptible Boran twins, while Boran chimaeras differed little from Boran control animals. All cattle became parasitaemic and developed anaemia. The N’Dama chimaeras did not manage their anaemia and white blood cell counts effectively. However, they were able to limit parasitaemia development. These results suggest that trypanotolerance is the result of two mechanisms, one that improves parasite control and is independent of the genetic origin of the haemopoietic tissue, and another that is influenced by haemopoietic tissue genotype and which improves control over anaemia. The capacity to maintain growth during infection was similarly dependent on the genetic origin of the haemopoietic tissue. "

abstract = "The use of animal draft power for soil tillage has long been a major theme of agricultural development programmes in semi-arid West Africa. The rationale for animal traction utilization ranges from increasing agricultural productivity and income to relieving the drudgery in farm work. Yet, its adoption remains low and localized. Previous research has identified the conditions which favour the adoption of animal traction, but evidence on the potential benefits realizable from its use is mixed. The issue of how to improve the adoption and profitable utilization of animal traction in semi-arid West Africa remains an important topic given that mechanization of agriculture is inevitable. This paper uses data collected from villages in two different agroclimatic zones of Niger to demonstrate the regional variability of potential gains from animal traction. Production functions were estimated to determine the impact of animal traction use on area cultivated, labour input and aggregate yield. Multi-year partial budget streams were also estimated to evaluate the profitability of animal traction at each location. The results show that the use of animal traction did not have any significant impact on area cultivated, but increased the yields of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) and maize (Zea mays L.) by 12–15%. It increased labour input by 15 man-hha−1 (man hours per hectare) in the dry agroclimatic zone, but reduced it by 50 man-h ha−1 in the wet zone. Rates of return on animal traction investment ranged from −4 to 18% in the dry zone and from 14 to 58% in the wet zone. These results suggest that the impact of animal traction on agricultural production varies by region and depends on a broad set of agroecological and economic conditions. The absence of these conditions in marginal areas strictly limits potential utilization and profitability. On efficiency grounds, it is recommended that animal traction should be promoted only in areas where the climate, soil and economic conditions permit its intensive and profitable utilization. "

This paper considers four issues in ex-post evaluation of animal disease interventions: firstly, a counterfactual involves simulating disease trajectories without the intervention. But some diseases can become endemic or become dormant after an outbreak, making it a challenge to know the true trajectory without the intervention. Secondly, without adequate design of controls and treatments, how can the estimated impacts be attributed to a given intervention? Thirdly, how do we assess costs saved by the intervention? Fourthly, given data uncertainty, would a stochastic simulation give better estimates than a deterministic one in solving for key variables? This paper addresses these issues and proposes solutions that bridge the gap between household level analysis and macro-level simulations in modelling the impact of animal diseases outbreaks. "

The objective of this article is therefore to investigate gender roles and processes of smallholder goat production and marketing in Inhassoro District, Mozambique, by analysing sex-disaggregated baseline data for women in male-headed households (W-MHH), men in male-headed households (M-MHH) and women in female-headed households (FHH). The paper draws on baseline data from the imGoats project, which aimed to diversify smallholder goat producers’ livelihood options by supporting the commercialization of goat production. Building on the sustainable livelihoods framework, adapted for gender and assets, this paper demonstrates that women in male-headed households rarely have control over income from goat sales and that meanings of “joint” ownership, decision making and asset control differ by gender. Results also showed that the primary goal of selling goats is to cover emergencies and household needs, and that goat meat consumption is linked to market access and agro-ecological zone. Despite the challenges of undertaking robust gender studies in a real-life developing country setting, this study provides a practical technical example of how one can implement gendered quantitative analyses in the context of the livelihoods framework.

Cows that consume AFB1-contaminated feed excrete aflatoxin \{M1\} (AFM1) in their milk. The aim of this study was to detect and quantify the amount of \{AFM1\} in raw cow's milk and \{AFB1\} in dairy feed samples in the Greater Addis Ababa milk shed using a value chain approach. For this purpose, 100 milk samples from dairy farmers and ten milk samples from milk traders were collected. In addition, 114 feed samples from dairy farmers and 42 feed samples from feed producers, processors and traders were collected. Analysis for \{AFM1\} and \{AFB1\} were conducted by a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results showed the presence of \{AFM1\} in all milk samples, and contamination level ranged between 0.028 and 4.98 μg/L. Overall, only nine (8.2%) out of a total of 110 milk samples contained less than or equal to 0.05 μg/L of AFM1. Furthermore, 29 (26.3%) milk samples exceeded 0.5 μg/L. All the feed samples were contaminated with \{AFB1\} ranging between seven and 419 μg/kg. Overall, out of a total of 156 feed samples collected, only 16 (10.2%) contained \{AFB1\} at a level less than or equal to 10 μg/kg. At the same time, 41 (26.2%) of the feed samples contained \{AFB1\} at a level exceeding 100 μg/kg. All dairy farmers used concentrate feed daily, which commonly included the mixture of wheat bran and noug (Guizotia abyssinica or Niger seed) cake (a byproduct from noug oil factories). Analysis of individual wheat bran and noug cake samples revealed that the contamination levels of \{AFB1\} for wheat bran and noug cake were nine to 31 μg/kg and 290–397 μg/kg, respectively. Linear regression revealed significant associations between the presence of noug cake in the feed and the levels of contamination of both \{AFM1\} in milk and \{AFB1\} in feed. The level of aflatoxin contamination found in this study in milk and feed should prompt action to identify suitable interventions. These results suggest that risk mitigation should focus on noug cake to effectively reduce aflatoxin contamination in per-urban dairy value chains in Ethiopia. Risk assessment of aflatoxins in noug seed and its by-products in other food chains is also warranted. "

Ex-ante impact assessment using integrated models can help them with these decisions. This review analyses the state of affairs of the multi-scale modelling of policy interventions, with an emphasis on applications in developing countries and livestock systems. Existing models do not sufficiently capture the complexity of human–environment interactions across different scales, and especially the link between landscape and local market levels, and national and sub-national level policies and markets is missing. The paper suggests a step wise approach with increasing data needs to bridge this gap. Improvements need to be made at the description of effects of the distribution of local markets on price formation and the representation of farm diversity within a landscape. Analyses in contrasting agro-ecological systems are needed to derive generic summary functions that can be used as input for macro level model analyses. This is especially pertinent for macro level descriptions of crop and livestock production in relation to price developments and of the mosaic of different agricultural land use responses in regions with contrasting socio-economic conditions and developments.

Water productivity (WP), defined as the ‘ratio of the net benefits from crop, forestry, fishery, livestock, and mixed agricultural systems to the amount of water required to produce those benefits’, is one such indicator that has gained prominence, particularly in research-for-development efforts in the developing world. However, though \{WP\} is a framework well-suited to systems where water use is directly attributable, particularly via depletion, to definitive benefits, the suitability of the approach becomes questionable when these conditions are not met, such as in multiple use systems with high re-use and non-depleting uses. These factors furthermore make \{WP\} highly scale-dependent, complicating comparative studies across scales and systems. This research forwards ‘aqueous productivity’ (AP) as an alternative indicator that addresses some inherent limitations in the \{WP\} approach and enhances productivity estimates for water in integrated systems. Like WP, \{AP\} is expressed as a ratio of benefit to water volume. However, \{AP\} uses a systems approach and is based on the concept that elements within a hydrologic system are linked via water flow interactions, and that those elements either ‘extract’ value from associated water flows or ‘infuse’ value into them. The \{AP\} method therefore calculates the ‘aqueous productivity’, a ratio indicating the ‘dissolved’ production-related economic value of all downstream uses of an individual water flow, for each inter-element and cross-boundary flow in the system. The \{AP\} conceptual framework and analytical methodology are presented. The method is then applied to two example hydroeconomic systems and compared to equivalent \{WP\} analysis. Discussion compares and contrasts the two methods, with a particular focus on how the \{AP\} approach addresses limitations in the \{WP\} method through its treatment of multiple uses of water and water re-use, seamless integration of depleting and non-depleting water uses, explicit cross-scale linkages, and incorporation of water storage and other temporal aspects in the analysis. Appropriate contexts of application for \{AP\} in decision support and in contrast to other water valuation methods are consequently considered. "

Improving Livestock Water Productivity (LWP) is one of the approaches to address those problems. \{LWP\} is defined as the ratio of livestock’s beneficial outputs and services to water depleted in their production. Increasing \{LWP\} can help achieve more production per unit of water depleted. In this study we assess the spatial variability of \{LWP\} in three farming systems (rice-based, millet-based and barley-based) of the Gumera watershed in the highlands of the Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia. We collected data on land use, livestock management and climatic variables using focused group discussions, field observation and secondary data. We estimated the water depleted by evapotranspiration (ET) and beneficial animal products and services and then calculated LWP. Our results suggest that \{LWP\} is comparable with crop water productivity at watershed scales. Variability of \{LWP\} across farming systems of the Gumera watershed was apparent and this can be explained by farmers’ livelihood strategies and prevailing biophysical conditions. In view of the results there are opportunities to improve LWP: improved feed sourcing, enhancing livestock productivity and multiple livestock use strategies can help make animal production more water productive. Attempts to improve agricultural water productivity, at system scale, must recognize differences among systems and optimize resources use by system components. "

In order to determine whether this multiple-drug resistance was expressed by individual trypanosomes, clones were derived from two of the isolates and characterised in mice for their sensitivity to the three compounds; by comparison to drug-sensitive populations, the two clones expressed high levels of resistance to all 3 trypanocides. In experiments to characterise the uptake kinetics of [14C]-Samorin, the maximal rates of uptake (Vmax) for 4 Ghibe isolates ranged from 9.2 to 15.0 ng/108 trypanosomes/min. In contrast, Vmax for the isometamidium-sensitive clone T. congolense \{IL\} 1180 was 86.7±8.6 ng/108 trypanosomes/min. Lastly, molecular karyotypes were determined for eight isolates; seven different chromosome profiles were observed. These data indicate that in February 1993 there was a high prevalence of drug-resistant trypanosome populations with different chromosome profiles in cattle at Ghibe. Since a similar situation existed at the same site in July 1989, this suggests that the drug-resistance phenotype of trypanosomes at Ghibe had not altered over a 4 year period. "

S. sesban has a lower content of soluble phenolics than A. albida pods (196 vs. 270 g/kg). Dietary treatments during trial 1 comprised teff (Eragrotis tef) straw given ad libitum supplemented per day with the following: 168 g of \{OSC\} alone (T1), or 100 g of \{OSC\} plus 135 g of sesbania leaves (T2) or 100 g of \{OSC\} plus either 50 (T3),100 (T4) or 200 g (T5) of acacia pods. During trial 2 dietary treatments comprised T1, T2, \{T5\} and an additional treatment comprised 100 g sesbania leaves plus 200 g pods which were fed to sheep as a mixture. One strategy (sequence) was to give the \{OSC\} following complete consumption of either sesbania leaves or acacia pods while the other strategy (mixture) was to mix \{OSC\} with either of these forages before feeding. The sequence strategy was used in trial 1 while both strategies were used in trial 2. Each experiment used 30 sheep in a \{RCB\} design. During trial one incremental intake of pods resulted to linear increases (P&lt;0.05) of live weight gain (LWG), organic matter (OM) and nitrogen (N) intake but had no effect on straw intake. \{T5\} and \{T2\} had similar \{LWG\} (60 vs. 56 g) and intake. During trial 2 total nitrogen (N) intake was within the range 12.0 to 12.9 g/day for diets containing OSC. Dietary treatments had no effect on the intake of teff straw, but the diet supplemented with \{OSC\} alone had lower dry matter (DM) intake (g/day; ≈595) than the sesbania leaves (637; P&lt;0.08) and acacia (694; P&lt;0.001) diets. The digestibilities of DM, \{OM\} and neutral detergent fibre were similar among diets. Faecal N (g/day) was similar between the sesbania leaves (5.11) and acacia (5.29) diets which were higher (P&lt;0.01) than on \{OSC\} alone. Sheep fed on the sesbania diets excreted similar urinary N as did those on acacia (4.04 v. 3.39 g/day) but more (P&lt;0.05) than those on \{OSC\} alone (2.9 g/day). Sheep had similar rates of \{LWG\} (g/day) on sesbania leaves (57) and \{OSC\} alone (62) which were inferior to the acacia diets (74). The difference in \{LWG\} between sesbania and acacia groups was small using the mixture strategy (10 g/day; P&gt;0.05) and substantial using the sequence strategy (23 g/day; P&lt;0.01). Similarly, the \{LWG\} differences between strategies were small (2 g/day; P&gt;0.05) for the sesbania and large (15 g/day; P&lt;0.05) for the acacia diets. A comparison between the OSC–acacia mixture and acacia–sesbania mixture suggested that sesbania leaves could replace \{OSC\} with rather marginal increases in LWG. The discussion was structured to explain why the sequence strategy could offer a greater chance of interaction between tannin and OSC–protein than the mixture strategy and why such interaction was most probable with A. albida pods than with S. sesban. It was concluded that it is beneficial to feed sheep on \{OSC\} following the intake of tanniferous feeds as this could support superior LWG. "

A total of 278 ram lambs with substantial pedigree information were involved in the study. There was improvement in all semen and spermatozoa traits with age, the means at 12 months being consistently superior to values at 6 and 9 months of age. There were no significant breed differences in any of the traits studied, except semen volume at 9 months (0.67, S.E. 0.07 for Horro versus 0.39, S.E. 0.05 ml for Menz) and proportion of dead spermatozoa at 12 months (0.18, S.E. 0.03 versus 0.23, S.E. 0.02, respectively). Season was significant (p&lt;0.05) for most of the traits studied, and differences were attributed primarily to nutrition. Semen collected in the wet season had higher spermatozoa concentration while samples collected in the dry season had higher proportion of abnormalities. After correcting for differences in total spermatozoa abnormalities, the wet season (of collection) had the highest spermatozoa output (volume×concentration) in 12-month old ram lambs. Heritability estimates varied substantially in magnitude, ranging from zero to over 0.4. Traits with non-trivial heritability estimates were mass motility at 9 months (0.32, S.E. 0.11), individual motility at 9 months (0.32, S.E. 0.12) and at 12 months (0.16, S.E. 0.12) and proportion of abnormal spermatozoa at 9 months (0.35, S.E. 0.13). Genetic correlations among semen and spermatozoa characteristics, as well as correlations with testicular measurements, were medium to high and generally favourable, but were associated with large standard errors.

The data included a total of 4890 mating records of which 2516 were Menz ewes and 2374 Horro ewes, with 2360 matings in the wet season and 2530 in the dry season. Menz sheep had a significantly higher (P&lt;0.001) weaning rate (lambs weaned per ewe mated) than the Horro ewes (0.73 versus 0.57, respectively) and ewes which lambed in the wet season had a significantly higher (P&lt;0.001) weaning rate than those that lambed in the dry season (0.76 versus 0.53, respectively). Menz ewes showed their superiority in weaning rate over the Horro ewes more clearly when lambing in the wet season (0.85 versus 0.67, respectively) than when lambing in the dry season (0.59 versus 0.47, respectively). Overall flock productivity was expressed in terms of potential offtake of yearling sheep from flocks of Menz or Horro ewes lambing in either the wet or dry seasons. Both in terms of number of yearling sheep for sale and total live weight for sale, the offtake of a flock of Menz sheep in this environment was approximately three-fold greater than a flock of Horro sheep when they lambed in the wet season and approximately two-fold greater when they lambed in the dry season. Season had no effect on offtake in Horro ewes, but the Menz ewes lambing in the wet season had about a 1.5-fold greater offtake than Menz ewes lambing in the dry season. In the first 3 years of the study (1992–1995), oestrous synchronisation was used at each mating. Oestrus was synchronised with intravaginal sponges containing 40 mg flugestone acetate (FGA). Most of the ewes (83%) came in oestrus after hormonal treatment and out of these 81% were synchronised and mated within 5 days after sponge removal. The percentage of ewes synchronised was 10% higher after treatment in the wet season than in the dry season (P&lt;0.01) and 7% higher for Menz sheep than for Horro sheep (P&lt;0.01). Of the ewes that eventually lambed, 73, 17 and 10%, respectively, conceived at the first, second and third or subsequent oestrus with an average 1.5 services per pregnancy. "

Several breeds of West African shorthorn cattle (Bos taurus brachyceros) are now at high risk of extinction due to interbreeding. The West African shorthorn breeds are particularly important resources because of their superior abilities to resist diseases, particularly trypanosomosis, and be productive under high humidity, heat stress, water restriction and with poor quality feed. An analysis of farmers' breeding practices and breed preferences in a sample area in southwest Nigeria confirmed a strong trend away from trypanotolerant breeds, especially Muturu, and identified the traits farmers find least desirable in these breeds relative to zebu (Bos indicus) breeds. An analysis of cattle market prices found that buyers have preferences for specific breeds for specific purposes and that though in general price differences due to breed are small, in some cases, buyers pay significantly different prices for certain breeds consistent with their preferences. The best hopes for increased utilization of breeds at risk such as Muturu is likely in other areas of West Africa, for example in southeast Nigeria, where the Muturu is better suited to the farming systems and there is a large market for this breed to provide incentives.

At the first peak of parasitaemia, different groups of 120 teneral G. m. centralis were fed on one occasion on each animal, 1 h before treatment with diminazene aceturate at a dose of 3.5 mg kg−1 body weight. Thereafter, on Days 1, 2, 3, 7, `4 and 21 after treatment, six different groups of 120 teneral G. m. centralis were similarly fed on each animal. After 28 days maintenance on uninfected goats, all the flies were probed onto slides at 37°C to identify those extruding metacyclic trypanosomes. Flies with mature infections from each group were then fed on one occasion on individual mice to determine the transmissibility index. After dissection of flies on Day 30 after their feed on the cattle, the mean mature (± SE) infection rates in the seven groups of flies were 32.1 ± 2.2, 1.0 ± 0.7, 0.4 ± 0.4, 0.5 ± 0.3, 20.0 ± 1.7, 33.3 ± 2.2 and 23.4 ± 2.0% for flies fed on Days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14 and 21 after treatment with diminazene, respectively. The transmissibility rates for the seven groups ranged from 94 to 100%. Thus, when cattle were infected with a diminazene-resistant T. congolense, treatment with diminazene aceturate caused a substantial reduction in the ability of the trypanosomes to establish mature infections in tsetse for at least the first 7 days after treatment. In contrast, no significant effect on the transmissibility of the parasites to mice was observed at different intervals after treatment. "

The authors argue that this approach severely limits the opportunity for economic assessments to aid decisions in disease control and research. The paper then reviews the literature on studies of avoidable costs, before discussing ways in which economic impact assessments can be enhanced. These issues include greater emphasis on incorporating the lost productivity potential caused by parasitic diseases, greater emphasis on valuing actual rather than intended control measures, and greater emphasis on quantifying the productivity effects at the societal level, particularly in the developing world.

Two fat-tailed sheep breeds, the Horro and Menz, indigenous to the Ethiopian highlands were studied. Experimental lambs were produced by mating 250 oestrus-synchronized ewes of each breed to 10 sires in a single-sire mating system over three mating periods which produced, for this study, a total of 361 ram lambs and 148 ewe lambs, with substantial pedigree information, in two dry seasons (October/November 1992 and 1993) and one wet season (June/July 1993). Mean \{AP\} was 322.7 days. Breed was not significant (P &gt; 0.05) for all testicular measurements, except \{ED\} at 9 months for which the Horro had a higher (P &lt; 0.01) value (20.6, s.e. 0.38 versus 19.3 s.e. 0.30). Horro ewe lambs had their first oestrus 28 days earlier (P &lt; 0.05) than the Menz. Heritability estimates were obtained from a sire model (M1) and from an individual animal model with additive direct and maternal effects (M2). The maternal effect was not fitted in \{M2\} for AP. Repeatability and heritability estimates were also obtained by analysing records at the three ages in a repeated measures model (M3). \{M1\} and \{M2\} heritability estimates were generally low to moderate but were associated with large standard errors. Heritability estimates for testicular measurements were generally similar to those for WT. Among the testicular measurements, \{SC\} had the highest heritability estimates at 6 (0.45, s.e. 0.24 for M1) and at 12 months (0.41, s.e. 0.21 and 0.41, s.e. 0.20 for \{M1\} and M2, respectively). Model 3 heritability estimates were 0.29 (s.e. 0.14), 0.24 (s.e. 0.12), 0.09 (s.e. 0.07), 0.11 (s.e. 0.08) and 0.12 (s.e. 0.08) for WT, SC, TD, \{TL\} and ED, respectively. Only repeatability estimates for \{WT\} (0.34, s.e. 0.02) and \{SC\} (0.25, s.e. 0.03) were significant. Heritability of \{AP\} was estimated at 0.16 (s.e. 0.21) by \{M1\} and 0.14 (s.e. 0.19) by M2. Genetic correlations of \{AP\} with testicular measurements, especially with \{SC\} (−0.57, s.e. 0.38 and −0.78, s.e. 0.33, at 9 and 12 months, respectively) and \{TD\} (−0.72, s.e. 0.33 and −0.83, s.e. 0.48), were desirable and generally high. Adjustment of testicular measurements for liveweight consistently resulted in a reduction in estimates of heritability and genetic correlations. \{SC\} was suggested as the most appropriate selection candidate for the genetic improvement of both male and female reproductive performance in these breeds.

The impact of these control strategies and the potential use of vaccines, should they be developed, on trypanosomosis transmission were compared using a mathematical model. The relative trypanosomosis prevalence compared with no control was estimated across a range of control coverages (from none to complete control coverage) by varying the change in specific model parameters influenced by individual control measures. Based on this comparison, the relative rankings of the effect of control strategies on reducing disease prevalence were: vector control, vaccination, and drug use, in that order. In this model, trypanotolerance was assumed to decrease disease prevalence, but not to influence transmission. Differences in the predicted impact of control measures on the transmission of human sleeping sickness are discussed. Finally, the role of transmission model outputs as inputs for economic models to guide investment decisions for trypanosomosis control is emphasised. "

The 334-amino-acid sequence of \{RIM36\} has a high content of glycine, serine and proline. The protein contains a predicted N-terminal signal peptide and two classes of glycine-rich amino acid repeats, a GL[G/Y/S/F/L] tripeptide and a \{GSPLSGF\} septapeptide. Comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences reveals a 597 bp intron within the 3′ end of the \{RIM36\} gene. Immuno-electron microscopy demonstrates that \{RIM36\} is predominantly located in the e cell granules of the type \{III\} salivary gland acini. An Escherichia coli recombinant form of the proline-rich C-terminal domain of \{RIM36\} reacts with antisera from Bos indicus cattle, either experimentally infested with R. appendiculatus, or exposed to ticks in the field. The 36 kDa protein is strongly recognised on Western blots of salivary gland lysates and soluble extracts of purified R. appendiculatus cement cones by polyclonal antibodies generated against recombinant RIM36, and by antisera from cattle experimentally infested with ticks. The data indicate that this tick cement component is a target of strong antibody responses in cattle exposed to feeding ticks. "

The diets comprised \{TS\} fed alone ad libitum (TSA) or \{TSA\} supplemented with either of the above \{FLs\} (175 g/day) with or without 47 g/day of either \{MG\} or WB. The 10 diets were fed to 20 ruminally cannulated sheep in two periods during which each of the degradabilities of \{TS\} and of the \{FL\} corresponding to that which the sheep were consuming were determined in sacco. The particulate rate of passage was also determined using chromium mordanted TS. Forty castrated male Ethiopian Menz sheep were used in a randomised complete block design to determine the effects of the above diets on intake, digestibility, urinary PD, microbial N synthesis and N retention. Both the potential and the effective degradabilities indicated that sesbania was the most degradable, and lablab the least. Supplementation with \{FLs\} alone increased the rate of degradation of \{TS\} by 50 to 142%, the rate of passage of particles (kp), the intake of TS, dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), nitrogen (N) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF); had no effect on the digestibility of DM, OM, teff and NDF; increased faecal N, urinary N, N retention, urinary allantoin, total and microbial PD, microbial N and the efficiency of microbial N synthesis. Forages were similar in the degradation rate of \{TS\} but differed in the intake of TS, \{DM\} and \{OM\} in the order: sesbania&gt;tagasaste&gt;lablab. Lablab diets sustained higher kp than either the sesbania or tagasaste diets. Sesbania diets, compared to lablab or tagasaste diets, depressed the digestibilities of DM, OM, NDF, \{ADF\} and TS; increased faecal, urinary and retained N, urinary allantoin, total and microbial PD, microbial N and efficiency of microbial N synthesis. Further supplementation with high \{ES\} depressed kp, tended to depress (P&gt;0.05) the degradation rate of \{TS\} by 14–45%, and that of \{FLs\} by 21–47%; increased faecal N, retained N, urinary allantoin, total and microbial PD, microbial N and the efficiency of microbial N synthesis; had no effect on digestibility and urinary N. Maize depressed the digestibility of \{ADF\} and urinary N, but increased urinae allantoin relative to wheat bran while both energy substrates elicited similar N retention and microbial N synthesis. Supplementing straw diets with \{FLs\} is beneficial in terms of intake, microbial N synthesis and yield. These benefits correlate positively with the degradability of \{FLs\} and are further improved by a complementary high energy substrate. "

There were significant differences between species/breeds purchased for various purposes. A hedonic price model was fitted to determine factors influencing price. After adjustments were made for age, weight, sex, time of transaction and market, \{WAD\} sheep commanded higher prices than \{WAD\} goats and Red Sokoto goats for all purposes except for butchering/catering; Red Sokoto goats commanded similar or lower prices than \{WAD\} goats depending on the purpose for purchase; and Y'ankasa sheep, principally purchased for the Eid-el-Kabir festival, commanded marginally higher prices than \{WAD\} sheep. The market share of \{WAD\} sheep is currently small and is under competition from northern sheep and goats, so increased production of \{WAD\} sheep in the south will benefit both producers and consumers in the area. In general, the results indicate that buyers have preferences for specific breeds and species for specific purposes, so producers and sellers may benefit by targeting specific buyer categories and times of the year.

abstract = "The effect of grazing pressure on infiltration, runoff, and soil loss was studied on a natural pasture during the 1995 rainy season in the Ethiopian highlands. The study was conducted on 0.01 ha plots established on sites with 0–4% and 4–8% slopes at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) Debre Zeit research station, 50 km south of Addis Ababa. The grazing regimes were: light grazing stocked at 0.6 animal-unit-months (AUM) ha−1; moderate grazing stocked at 1.8 \{AUM\} ha−1; heavy grazing stocked at 3.0 \{AUM\} ha−1; very heavy grazing stocked at 4.2 \{AUM\} ha−1; very heavy grazing on ploughed soil stocked at 4.2 \{AUM\} ha−1; and a control with no grazing. Heavy to very heavy grazing pressure significantly increased surface runoff and soil loss and reduced infiltrability of the soil. It was observed that fine textured soils were more susceptible to trampling effects than coarse textured soils, and that reduction in infiltration rates was greater on soils which had been tilled and exposed to very heavy trampling. The problems of high runoff and erosion rates on the upper slopes is likely to be exacerbated by the fact that during the rainy season higher grazing pressure is exerted on the upper than lower slopes. Sediments produced from the highlands, which form headwaters of major rivers in the region, are likely to pollute streams and lakes and pile up on bottom-lands, in stream channels, and in reservoirs. With some modifications, the plot design presented here can be used for assessing livestock impacts on natural resources on different landforms at large scales such as watersheds. How the same amount of livestock mass dispersed by different livestock species impacts on the grazing lands needs to be studied further. "

The T. parva homologue of Rab1 (TpRab1), a protein which regulates vesicular transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and cis golgi in other organisms, was unusual in that it contained a unique 17 amino acid C-terminal extension. The C-terminal motif sequence \{KCT\} (XCX) contrasted with the \{CXC\} or \{XCC\} motifs which act as as signals for isoprenylation by geranylgeranyl in most Rab proteins, including all known Rab1 homologues, in containing only a single cysteine. [C14]mevalonic acid lactone and [H3]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate were specifically incorporated into recombinant TpRab1 in vitro, demonstrating that the novel motif was functional for isoprenylation. Recombinant TpRab1 bound radiolabeled GTP, and this binding was inhibited by excess unlabeled \{GTP\} and \{GDP\} and also partially by ATP. The TpRab1 gene contained four short (34–67 bp) introns with a distinct pattern of occurrence within the protein sequence as compared to the introns of other lower eukaryote Rab1 genes. Immunofluorescence microscopy using antiserum specific for the novel C-terminal peptide in combination with labelling of cells using the nucleic acid-staining dye DAPI, indicated that TpRab1 was located in the vicinity of the schizont nucleus within the infected lymphocyte.

These six double backcross resource families are being analysed to identify quantitative trait loci that may be controlling resistance to gastro-intestinal (GI) nematode parasites, mainly Haemonchus contortus. After assessing the phenotypic performance of the lambs following exposure to natural infections, the surviving lambs were drenched and moved indoors for an artificial challenge with H. contortus along with straightbred D and R lambs. A total of 1317 lambs were included in the analyses consisting of 523 3/4D, 580 3/4R, 87 D and 127 R. The D lambs were significantly and consistently heavier than R lambs and 3/4D were significantly heavier than the 3/4R lambs. The difference between the backcrosses was about half of that between the straightbreds. Resistance was assessed in terms of faecal egg counts (FEC) and total worm counts (TWC) at necropsy while packed cell volume (PCV) was used to assess resilience to weekly oral doses of 2500 infective larvae of H. contortus. No significant breed differences were observed for log transformed \{FEC\} (LFEC). A significant breed difference in \{PCV\} was recorded. The backcrosses had the higher values and while no differences were observed between the straightbreds, 3/4D had significantly higher \{PCV\} than the 3/4R. Despite the absence of breed differences in \{FEC\} the R and the 3/4R had significantly fewer worms than the D and the 3/4D. The D had significantly longer worms than the R and the 3/4D had significantly longer worms than the 3/4R. Worms recovered from D had more eggs than those recovered from R. Similarly worms from 3/4D contained more eggs than those from 3/4R. Thus, on a breed basis the breed with more worms had longer worms. In contrast, when, in a small part of the experiment two doses of larvae were used to check for any breed by dose interactions, worms from the low dose (and hence fewer worms) animals were longer. We postulate that in fast growing hosts like the D, worms also have a better potential for growth and reproduction than in hosts that have less potential for growth. The overall correlation coefficient between \{PCV\} and \{LFEC\} was −0.67 while that between \{LFEC\} and \{LTWC\} was 0.72. From these results it is clear that the R do not respond to the artificial challenge the way they do to natural infection suggesting that phenotyping of R and R cross lambs for purposes of selecting those that are resistant or susceptible is best done under natural challenge.

With proper drainage, early sowing of crops becomes feasible, and this study compared the local wheat system with eight other land-use types (LUTs). Replacing local wheat with genetically superior wheat, cv. \{ET\} 13, significantly increased grain and fodder and also the metabolizable energy from a land unit. When \{ET\} 13 was followed by grasspea, and intercropped with clover and/or sown between sesbania alleys, the feed, protein and energy outputs from the same land unit were further enhanced many fold compared to the traditional landuse.

The antigens used were whole trypanosome lysate, variable surface glycoprotein, a 33-kDa cysteine protease (congopain) and a 70-kDa heat-shock protein. As parameters of T-cell-mediated immunity, we measured T-cell proliferation and IFN-γ production. Lymph node cells, spleen cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells all proliferated to a mitogenic stimulus (concanavalin A) but only lymph node cells responded to trypanosome antigens. Similarly, IFN-γ was produced by both lymph node and spleen cells stimulated with concanavalin A but only by lymph node cells stimulated with variable surface glycoprotein and whole trypanosome lysate. T. congolense-specific antibodies were detected in sera and in supernatants of cultured lymph node and spleen cells after in vitro stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and recombinant bovine interleukin-2. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that memory T- and B-cell responses are detectable in various lymphoid organs in cattle 3 years following infection and treatment with T. congolense. "

Diets comprised teff (Eragrotis tef) straw, fresh and dried napier grass and fresh napier grass supplemented with 1.5 (as fed) of dry alfalfa hay. Variation in dry matter intake (DMI) was further amplified by using calves ranging between 65 and 207 kg live weight (W). \{DMI\} and digestible organic matter (OM) ranged from 1.36 to 7.34 and from 0.67 to 3.88 (kg per day), respectively. The only differences (in intake, digestibility, microbial \{PD\} and N supply) among the diets which were significant at least at P=0.05 were due to supplementation with alfalfa. The excretion of allantoin and total \{PD\} were within the ranges 3.33–47.37 and 3.60–47.37 (mmol per day), respectively. The sampling period had no influence on the concentration of \{PD\} or creatinine (CR) nor on the PD:CR ratio in urine. Diets influenced (P&lt;0.01) \{PD\} concentration such that the poorest quality diet (teff straw) exhibited the highest concentration, but diets had no effect on the PD:CR ratio. The PD:CR ratio or the \{PD\} concentrations had poor correlations with the intake and had no predictive power on their own. Further discussion was structured to develop ideas used to model intake based on \{PD\} concentrations and predicted urine output (UOP (g per day)=exp(2.480+3.41 NDS)×W0.942, where \{NDS\} (g/g DM) is neutral detergent solubles). The equation of intake on \{PD\} and \{UOP\} achieved 89% accuracy (OMI (g per day)=−0.15+0.556 UOP+0.038 PD8, where \{PD8\} is the uncorrected \{PD\} concentration within 8:00–9:30 hours period). The slope and the intercept of the relationship between the predicted and observed intake were equal to 1 and 0, respectively, as in the equationOMI=0.001(S.E.=0.2099)+1.00(S.E.=0.072)OMIP, (RSD=0.422; Adj−R2=0.89; n=24; P&lt;0.0001);where the subscript ‘P’ denotes the predicted value. It is, thus, suggested that information on urinary spot \{PD\} concentration should be integrated with that on rumen osmolality modulators when developing intake models of free ranging livestock. The problem, however, is that though the approach is simple and may have general application, the ensuing models are likely to be region-specific because the pattern of \{UOP\} might be influenced by climatic factors and the animal’s adaptation strategy to its environment. Further development should integrate the knowledge of the digestion kinetics and dilution rate in the rumen to determine an appropriate lag period that should intervene between the time feed is consumed and the time of spot-sampling such that the latter coincides with the peak concentration of \{PD\} in the urine.

In many places in the tropics and subtropics, livestock systems are changing rapidly, and the spatial heterogeneity of household response to change may be very large. While opportunities may exist for some households to take advantage of more conducive rangeland and cropping conditions, for example, the changes projected will pose serious problems for many other households. We briefly review the literature on climate change impacts on livestock and livestock systems in developing countries, and identify some key knowledge and data gaps. We also list some of the broad researchable issues associated with how smallholders and pastoralists might respond to climate change.

Transcripts from the schizont stage of T. parva, containing domains with significant amino acid similarity to a 3529 codon \{ORF\} located 6900 bp upstream of the telomeric repeats, were mapped to a subtelomeric locus at a fourth telomere.

We used an ecosystem services approach where only final benefits are valued to avoid double counting. The final benefits are ecosystem services or commodities which have an economic value. The supply of ecosystem services depends on the functioning of ecosystems, but rarely ecological and institutional boundaries coincide and often stakeholders in ecosystem services cut across a range of institutional zones and scales. Land use and management influence the system processes, properties and components that are the basis of services provision. Although much has been written about the need to quantify and value ecosystem services, there are fewer spatially explicit studies that delineate the supply and demand areas for ecosystem services and assess the trade-offs between ecosystem services over space and time especially on drylands. Based on the spatial distribution of resources and the existing competition over these resources, this paper assesses the current values attributed to the selected ecosystem services. Then, by mapping existing supporting infrastructure and drivers of land use change such as demographic pressure, we highlight trade-offs and synergies among alternative uses and opportunities for sustainable development. In particular, the paper identifies services that will be lost if a particular part of landscape is modified: e.g. benefits for livestock and wildlife can be affected by the lack of conservation of corridors and rangelands, while water supply and irrigated crops can be compromised by increased water demand as result of human population pressure mainly at the upstream sub-catchments. We demonstrate the value of spatial analysis to land use investments and management and highlight how conservation and management of ecosystem services require the understanding of the spatial links between ecosystems and human well-being.

Four rice varieties (Wuyujing 3, Nanjing 44, Nanjing 46 and Liangyoupeijiu) were used in the experiment, with one \{GA\} spraying time in 2013 (the 15th day after anthesis) and three \{GA\} spraying times in 2014 (the 7th, 15th and 21st day after anthesis) being set, and the rice was harvested on two occasions in 2013 and 2014 (harvest time 1 when the grains of the control group plants had reached 80% maturity, and harvest time 2 occurring 6 days after harvest time 1). \{GA\} concentration was 45 g hm−2 in both years. The results indicated that at normal harvest time (harvest time 1), the optimum \{GA\} treatment for Liangyoupeijiu was an application on the 7th day after anthesis, but for Nanjing 44 and Nanjing 46, the optimum \{GA\} treatment was an application on the 21st day after anthesis. However, when harvest time was delayed (harvest time 2), \{GA\} applied on the 21st day after anthesis for Liangyoupeijiu, Wuyujing 3 and Nanjing 44 was the optimum \{GA\} treatment for both grain production and straw feed quality; while for Nanjing 46, \{GA\} applied on the 21st day after anthesis was the best \{GA\} treatment for grain yield, and \{GA\} applied on the 15th day after anthesis was the best treatment for straw feed quality. In conclusion, the optimum \{GA\} treatment for double-purpose rice changed when harvesting took place at different times, and it also changed for different rice varieties. Moreover, the \{GA\} effects on grain production and straw feed quality were sometimes different. "

Using data on agro-pastoral households from northern Kenya, we explore whether migration of household members enhances adoption of agricultural innovations that aim to provide protection against weather shocks. Specifically, we seek to test whether migration and adaptation are complementary mechanisms to protect the household against adverse shocks, or whether they are substitutes. Do remittances relax capital constraints and facilitate the uptake of adaptive measures, or do they render adaptation superfluous? Our data provide suggestive evidence that remittances from migrant household members may relax capital constraints, and that remittances are an important mechanism linking migration to adoption, enabling the uptake of new technologies that involve change in activities or high costs. Specifically, migrant households adopt more adaptive measures (promoting self-protection), and we document some support for the hypothesis that this is especially the case for high-cost adaptations such as the purchasing of drought tolerant livestock. These findings suggest that migration and local innovation are complementary rather than substitutive mechanisms of self-protection for pastoral households in the semi-arid lands of northern Kenya. Households who have at least one member who has migrated are able to overcome barriers to employ high-cost agricultural innovations–through using remittances received—thus enhancing their self-protection against climate change related shocks.

The estimated worldwide area under cowpea is about 14 million ha of which West Africa alone accounts for about 9.3 million ha with annual production of about 2.9 Mt. Cowpea grains are consumed as food and the haulms are fed to livestock as a nutritious fodder. Farmers often grow a short-duration spreading variety for grain and a long-duration spreading variety for fodder, but the grain and fodder yields are poor due to low yield potential of the spreading varieties and also due to early cessation of rains. Therefore, \{IITA\} in collaboration with \{ILRI\} has initiated a systematic programme to develop medium-maturing, semi-erect, dual-purpose varieties with higher grain and fodder yields and with enhanced fodder quality. By crossing the late, traditional spreading varieties with improved early, semi-erect varieties, a semi-erect group of medium-maturing, dual-purpose varieties has been developed which yield over 1.5 t ha−1 grain and 2.5 t ha−1 haulms. Despite the high grain and fodder yields, the haulms of improved dual-purpose varieties have similar crude protein content (17–18%) and dry matter digestibility (64–71%) compared to the local varieties. Controlled sheep feeding experiments have shown an average live weight gain of about 80 g per animal per day with 200–400 g per day of cowpea haulms as a supplement to a basal diet of sorghum stover. This was 100% higher than the average live weight gain of animals fed sorghum fodder alone. These results indicate that improved dual-purpose varieties can play an important role in enhancing crop–livestock integration in West Africa. "

The buffalo, eland, waterbuck and N'Dama controlled T. congolense parasitaemias and were able to prevent anaemia. By contrast, one Boran became severely anaemic whilst the other controlled parasitaemia and anaemia. When the above five species of Bovidae were rechallenged with T. brucei brucei they showed persistent parasitaemias but did not develop anaemia. The buffalo died of other causes. When the remaining four bovids were rechallenged with T. vivax they became infected with mixed T. vivax/T. b. brucei parasites. Eland, waterbuck and N'Dama controlled parasitaemias and anaemia whereas the Boran became anaemic. Cyclical development of T. congolense occurred in G. moristans centralis when fed on the bovid hosts, with buffalo being infective for tsetse flies for a much longer period. There was no relationship between the levels of T. congolense parasitaemia in the bovid hosts and the resultant infection rates in tsetse flies. Glossina m. centralis was more susceptible than G. pallidipes to T. brucei brucei whilst G. austeni the least; G. brevipalpis and G. longipennis were refractory to the mature infection. Again there was no relationship between T. brucei brucei parasitaemia levels in the hosts and infection rates in the flies. Glossina m. centralis and G. pallidipes showed mixed T. brucei brucei/T. vivax infections whilst G. austeni, G. brevipalpis and G. longipennis became infected with T. vivax alone. Tsetse flies showed higher T. vivax infection rates when fed on the hosts with high parasitaemias than those with low parasitaemias. Thus trypanotolerant African buffalo, eland, waterbuck, N'Dama as well as some trypanosusceptible Boran cattle can serve as reservoirs of single or mixed trypanosome infections for tsetse flies. This study has also shown that the Ag-ELISA on the sera from the five bovid hosts had low sensitivity and species-specificity. Examinations of thin wet blood films and buffy coats with a phase-contrast microscope were not sensitive enough to detect the parasites on all occasions. Xenodiagnosis using mice for T. brucei brucei and T. congolense infections, and tsetse flies for all the three trypanosome species were most sensitive for the detection of trypanosome infections in the bovid hosts.

Results indicate that farmers who are more educated, have higher income, and have access to credit are more likely to adopt the dual-purpose forages.

Fifty female yearlings each of Horro, Sheko and Abigar and 31 of the Gurage were purchased from their natural habitats and introduced in to medium to high tsetse–trypanosomosis challenge area of the Ghibe valley. While the natural habitats of first three breeds are naturally infested with tsetse flies and trypanosomosis, that of the Gurage is known to be very minimal, if any, and hence the Gurage breed was used in this study as the known susceptible breed. During the study animal health, production performance and tsetse fly situation were monitored monthly. The Sheko breed has manifested very significantly (p &lt; 0.001) high overall average packed cell volume (PCV) values (25%) compared to that of Abigar (24%), Horro (23%) and Gurage (22%). It also had the lowest mean trypanosome prevalence rate of 9% against 23% of Horro, 26% of Abigar and 27% of Gurage, and the least number of Berenil® treatments (1.36) compared to Abigar (4.0), Horro (4.6) and Gurage (6.7). While the Abigar manifested high sensitivity and frequent death to \{PCV\} depression, the Horro showed strong resilience to \{PCV\} depression and better response to Berenil® treatment assistance. At this stage the Sheko breed was also found to be equal to the other breeds in its reproductive performance. These results need to be substantiated with further in-depth investigation including immune response, animal behavior and environmental influences. "

The Muguga and Serengeti-transformed stocks exhibited no obvious differences in their reactivity with the panel of MAbs, whereas Kiambu 5 differed with several MAbs. Kiambu 5 \{DNA\} was very distinct from the Muguga and Serengeti-transformed isolates in the hybridisation pattern with all four nucleic acid probes, whereas Muguga and Serengeti-transformed isolates exhibited minor differences and could not be discriminated with one of the probes. \{PCR\} amplification in combination with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis indicated that Kiambu 5 was also markedly divergent from the Muguga and Serengeti-transformed stocks within two of the four antigen coding genes. The T. parva Serengeti-transformed stock did not contain a 130 base pair insert within the p67 sporozoite antigen gene, which has been observed previously in most T. parva parasites isolated from buffalo, and could not be discriminated from T. parva Muguga at any of the four single copy loci. Collectively the data indicate that two of the cocktail components T. parva Serengeti-transformed and Muguga are genetically closely related, while the third component Kiambu 5 is quite distinct. Based on the findings, there may be a need to include only one of the T. parva Muguga and Serengeti-transformed components in the immunising cocktail. The study demonstrates the value of molecular characterisation data for monitoring of live vaccines. "

A novel biological method could reduce the health risks of aflatoxins through inhibiting mold growth and binding aflatoxins. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are commonly used in fermented food production. \{LAB\} are known to inhibit mold growth and, to some extent, to bind aflatoxins in different matrices. Reduced mold growth and aflatoxin production may be caused by competition for nutrients between bacterial cells and fungi. Most likely, binding of aflatoxins depends on environmental conditions and is strain-specific. Killed bacteria cells possess consistently better binding abilities for aflatoxin \{B1\} (AFB1) than viable cells. Lactobacilli especially are relatively well studied and provide noticeable possibilities in binding of aflatoxin \{B1\} and \{M1\} in food. It seems that binding is reversible and that bound aflatoxins are released later on (Haskard et al., 2001; Peltonen et al., 2001). This literature review suggests that novel biological methods, such as lactic acid bacteria, show potential in mitigating toxic effects of aflatoxins in food and feed. "

Pastoral systems in Africa are facing demographic, economic, socio-political and climatic pressures which are driving many pastoralists into non-livestock based livelihood strategies. The changing contexts in which pastoralists operate raise the issue of the sustainability of pastoral systems in dryland Africa. The specific objectives of this paper are: (i) to identify the challenges of assessing the sustainability of pastoral systems with focus on East and West Africa; (ii) to propose criteria and indicators for sustainability assessment of pastoral systems; and (iii) to demonstrate the diversity of pastoral systems by elaborating on features in East and West Africa with case studies from pastoral communities in both regions, namely Samburu in Kenya and Fakara in Niger. All these objectives are to contribute to the debates on the sustainability of pastoralism. Assessing sustainability of pastoral systems is challenging and complex in view of different aspects that should be addressed over time and at different scales. The main challenges addressed in this paper include purpose and interpretation of sustainability, time dimension and scale, diversity of pastoral systems, inter-relatedness of assessment criteria, comprehensiveness and measurability of indicators. To illustrate the challenges, we proposed a number of criteria based on key systems' components of production, stability, efficiency and resilience. For each criterion, a number of indicators were proposed. The criteria we suggested are inter-related and should not be considered in isolation bearing in mind that sustainability is a composite attribute that integrates several variables. In terms of sustainability of pastoral systems in East and West Africa, the key issues are mobility, livestock diversity, livelihood diversification options, and preservation of pastoral tradition and indigenous knowledge. The degree with which these issues are constraining pastoral production and economy will largely shape the trajectory of sustainability of different pastoral systems in both regions. "

A significantly lower proportion of Menz lambs died before 1 year of age (28%) than the Horro lambs (59%). Least squares means for pre- and post-weaning mortality were 8.8 and 19.3%, respectively in Menz, and 25.3 and 34.2% for Horro sheep. Major causes of death were similar in Horro versus Menz lambs and were pneumonia (53 vs. 54%, respectively), digestive problems (14 vs. 12%), endoparasite infections (9 vs. 13%), starvation–mismothering–exposure (SME) complex (10 vs. 7%) and septicemia (3 vs. 2%). Relationships among causes of mortality with breed, birth weight (BWT), season of birth, parity, litter size and lamb health category (number of times a lamb was sick between birth and 1 year of age) were determined. The impact of these factors on mortality varied with lamb age. Lambs that were born with &lt;2 kg \{BWT\} had a greater risk of dying from any cause except pneumonia. But, even though Horro lambs were heavier than Menz at birth (2.4 vs. 2.1 kg, respectively), twice as many died before 1 year of age. The cause of mortality was further influenced by season of birth, lamb sex and health category. In addition, sires were a significant source of variation for progeny survival at 6, 9 and 12 months of age, but not at the younger ages. The best and worst Horro ram sired progeny groups that had mortality rates up to 1 year of age of 22 vs. 80%, respectively. The same estimates in Menz rams were 11 and 48%, respectively. Reduced mortality rate would significantly increase lamb output. However, isolated efforts to solve this problem are likely to have limited impact. Instead, an integrated approach to minimise the impact of underlying factors is advocated. Farm (animal) management routines that could be introduced in the short or longer term are discussed. "

The results indicate that potential benefits to research — historically field-based but increasingly biotechnology-driven — range from two to nine times potential costs and that the internal rate of return on investments can be six times the real interest rate. Field-based research, while exhibiting lower potential benefits on aggregate than does biotechnology research, is also less costly and, because of its more immediate payback, has higher internal rates of return. Returns to biotechnology research hinge on close links with field-based research and on strategic but relatively small incremental human and capital investments. The results also suggest that further research is needed to consistently identify and track the impacts of alternative intellectual property rights (IPRs) options on the levels and distributions of biotechnology research benefits.

Livestock keeping, an important livelihood strategy for smallholder farmers in Africa, is a major consumer of water, and its water consumption is increasing with increasing demands for livestock products. At the same time, current low returns from livestock keeping limit its contribution to livelihoods, threaten environmental health and aggravate local conflicts. The objectives of this review are to: (1) synthesize available knowledge in the various components of the livestock and water sectors in sub-Saharan Africa, (2) analyze livestock–water interactions and (3) identify promising strategies and technological interventions for improved livestock water productivity (LWP) using a framework for mixed crop–livestock systems. The interventions are grouped in three categories related to feed, water, and animal management. Feed related strategies for improving \{LWP\} include choosing feed types carefully, improving feed quality, increasing feed water productivity, and implementing grazing management practices. Water management for higher \{LWP\} comprises water conservation, watering point management, and integration of livestock production in irrigation schemes. Animal management strategies include improving animal health and careful animal husbandry. Evidence indicates that successful uptake of interventions can be achieved if institutions, policies, and gender are considered. Critical research and development gaps are identified in terms of methodologies for quantifying water productivity at different scales and improving integration between agricultural sectors. "

Species composition and physical structure of the herbaceous layer as well as woody plant population were recorded at all sites together with data on soils and natural resource management. Herbage yield was measured whereas foliage yield and wood mass were calculated using allometry equation calibrated for each species. `Brousse tigrée' is characterized by the regularly alternating bare-soil stripes with dense linear thickets arranged perpendicularly to the slope. There was no clear superiority in total plant production of `brousse tigrée' when compared to neighbouring site with diffuse vegetation. However, the pattern of `brousse tigrée' tended to favour woody plant yield to the detriment of herbage yield. The number of herbaceous species recorded per site (22–26) was slightly above Sahelian vegetation average despite low number of species per 1-m2 quadrat (6–9), bare soil excluded. This species richness reflects the diversity in edaphic niches resulting from the redistribution and local concentration of water resources and shade. The high spatial heterogeneity and species richness of the herbaceous layer in `brousse tigrée' did not attenuate the interannual variation in herbage yield despite low yields. Except for the herb layer, little evidence was found of grazing influence on the vegetation structure and yield a few hundred metres away from livestock concentration points. On the other hand, the clearing of thickets for cropping led to severe soil erosion which threaten the resilience of `brousse tigrée'. These observations and the well-defined climatic, soiland topographic situations under which the `brousse tigrée' occurs invalidate the hypothesis of an anthropic origin of that vegetationpattern. "

Sixteen pearl millet cultivars available to farmers in India were selected to represent three cultivar types: (1) traditional landrace germplasm from the arid/semi-arid millet production zones, (2) improved dual-purpose (grain and stover) open-pollinated varieties incorporating differing amounts of traditional landrace germplasm and (3) commercial, grain-type \{F1\} hybrids, bred for use in the arid/semi-arid zone. The cultivars were grown for 2 years (2000 and 2001) at high fertility (HF: 65 kg N ha−1 and 18 kg P ha−1) and low fertility (LF: 21 kg N ha−1 and 9 kg P ha−1). Within each fertility level high (HP) and low (LP) plant population densities were established by varying sowing rate and then thinning to the target populations (HP: 11 plants m−2 and LP: 5 plants m−2). Stover fodder quality traits (nitrogen concentration, sugar content, in vitro digestibility and metabolizable energy content) were analyzed using a combination of conventional laboratory analysis and near infrared spectroscopy. In general, fertility level and cultivar type had strong effects on grain and stover yields, and on a range of stover nutritional quality traits, but with significant year interactions. In contrast, the effect of population density on these variables was largely insignificant. Higher fertilizer application significantly increased grain and stover yields and stover nitrogen concentration, in vitro digestibility and metabolizable energy content. As a result, fertilization resulted in significant increases in the yields of both digestible and metabolizable stover. Landrace cultivars as a group produced higher quality fodder than modern hybrids, but at a significant cost in grain yield. Dual-purpose, open-pollinated cultivars were generally intermediate between the landraces and hybrids, in terms of both stover quality and grain yield, but produced the highest yields of both digestible and metabolizable stover. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for Indian pearl millet farmers with various resource levels and farming objectives. "

Crop residues (fodder/stover) are important feed resources for ruminants. This review was undertaken with the objective of improving understanding of the role of various crop management factors in affecting the productivity and quality of crop residues. Variability in productivity and quality of residues can be of both genetic and non-genetic origin. Recommended agronomic practices vary according to crop and cultivar and can release the maximum genetic potential determining quantity and quality of residues. Planting method and planting rate recommendations should be followed to maximise productivity. Although low density planting improved fodder quality, fodder yield declined. Time of sowing affected fodder yield in most of the crops, but fodder quality was not generally affected. It was common to observe that application of nitrogen (up to 120 kg ha−1) in cereals and application of phosphorus (up to 60 kg ha−1) in legumes improved the green and dry fodder yields, as well as crude protein (CP), crude fibre (CF) and other quality parameters. Inoculation of cereal seed with nitrogen fixing bacteria such as Azotobacter and seed of pulses with phosphate solubilising bacteria has been reported to decrease fertiliser needs and improve the \{CP\} and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of fodder. Irrigating at more frequent intervals by splitting the same quantity of irrigation water into smaller irrigations and at critical stages improved dry matter and \{CP\} yields. Hand weeding resulted in better weed control efficiency and stover yield than application of herbicides. However, application of herbicides resulted in the greatest benefit:cost ratio. Manual harvesting resulted in lower losses than mechanical harvesting, and may affect quality depending on the extent of loss of different fodder components. Drought stress yielded more digestible organic matter due to increases in the proportion of leaves compared to stems. Saline conditions affected seed germination and crop yields. Several methods are suggested to counteract the effects of salinity. Intercropping of cereals with legumes improved fodder nutritional quality (mostly protein content). In almost all crops, a positive association was found between fodder and grain yield indicating simultaneous improvement in both characters. In most cases, fodder yield and digestibility were positively correlated and showed positive association with plant height, leaf number and the number of tillers per plant, but there were limits and variation among crops. The ICRISAT–ILRI partnership experiments were conducted with a diverse set of sorghum and pearl millet cultivars at ICRISAT, India. Planting density levels in both crops did not influence forage quality although some fodder yield traits were affected. A significant interaction of genotype with planting density was observed for grain and fodder yield in sorghum and grain yield and harvest index in pearl millet. Adherence to recommended crop management practices can potentially facilitate the release of the maximum genetic potential determining quality and yield parameters for improved animal production. "

This study investigated the variability in chemical characteristics and digestibility of stovers among 10 `best-bet' sorghum cultivars selected for grain yield with the view to study the merits of selecting among cultivars for feed attributes. Cluster analysis of N, \{ADF\} and \{NDF\} obtained from chemical analyses, and in sacco dry matter digestibility of stovers showed that wide intercultivar variations existed at the three-cluster solution (designated cluster groups III, IV, V). Cultivar BES, the only member of group IV, had a relatively high N content (90 g kg−1 DM), a high 48 h dry matter loss (637 g kg−1 DM) and relatively low \{ADF\} and \{NDF\} values (386 and 598 g kg−1 DM). Members of group V (KSV 8 and Gaya Early) contained the lowest N (67 g kg−1 DM), lowest digestibility coefficient (511 g kg−1 DM) and highest \{ADF\} and \{NDF\} values (466 and 665 g kg−1 DM). Values for members of group \{III\} (ICSV 111, \{ICSV\} 210, \{ICSV\} 247, \{ICSV\} 400, \{ICSH\} 89009NG and \{ICSH\} 89002NG) were intermediate. There were no significant correlations between indicators of nutritive values, grain yield and grain mass. The results suggest existence of variation in indicators of nutritive values within the cultivars to warrant consideration for selection among these for detailed nutritional studies, and that improving the nutritive value in stovers through breeding may not necessarily impair grain yield and grain mass.

Poverty alleviation is a process that needs to be understood before impact can be measured. Workshops such as those we describe can help researchers to identify farmers' different ways of managing and using a technology and likely effects, unanticipated impacts, major impacts to pursue in more quantitative studies, the primary links between agricultural technology and poverty, and key conditioning factors affecting adoption and impact that can be used to stratify samples in more formal analyses.

The objectives of the studies were to investigate the soil nitrogen dynamics and response of maize after different periods of legume growth and in a separate experiment to investigate the effect of inorganic N fertiliser on the maize grown after the selected legumes. In one experiment, the two herbaceous legumes were grown using two rotations—short (12 months) with a single forage harvest and followed by early maize; or long (15 months) with two forage harvests followed by late maize. More N was removed in the S. guianensis forage (140 kg N ha−1) compared to C. macrocarpum (90 kg N ha−1) although more N accumulated in the regrowth after harvest of C. macrocarpum (about 100 kg N ha−1—almost twice that of S. guianensis). Subsequently, the N status of maize plants (estimated using chlorophyll readings) in the first 37 days after sowing was higher for C. macrocarpum. Soil Nmin also tended to be higher after C. macrocarpum (maximum of 70 μg N g−1) compared to S. guianensis (maximum of 50 μg N g−1). This was not consistently reflected in maize grain yields. Under the experimental conditions, nitrogen appeared to be immobilised in the soil during the initial stage of legume decomposition, although this was less pronounced after S. guianensis. In a second experiment, first wet season (early) maize was grown after the same two legume species, and the interaction of preceding legumes with three levels of fertiliser N (0–30–60 kg N ha−1) applied to maize was assessed. Increasing fertiliser N levels had no clear impact on Nmin dynamics. Increased grain yield of maize in response to N addition was measured only after S. guianensis which may have been related to site characteristics. With respect to their potential to contribute to crop-livestock production, the two species differed in that S. guianensis was better with respect to year-round forage production, but C. macrocarpum had a greater effect on the subsequent maize yield. In order to improve the legume N contribution to maize at similar sites, the role of delayed N release during leguminous residue decomposition is emphasised. "

The effects of two interventions, namely exclosures and water harvesting structures, were assessed based on data from farmers’ interviews, measurements of feed biomass production, and estimates of energy production and requirements. Water used for livestock feed production was obtained through simple soil water balance modelling. By protecting 40% of the rangelands, the water productivity of the feed increased by about 20%. This indicated that exclosure establishment could lead to similar improvements in livestock water productivity (LWP, defined as the ratio of livestock benefits over the water used in producing these). Water harvesting structures ensured year-round water availability in the homestead, which resulted in less energy used for walking to drinking points. A considerable amount of energy was thus saved, which could be used for livestock production and improved animal health without additional water use. Besides restoring regulating and supporting ecosystem services, both interventions led to a more efficient use of the scarce water resources for biomass and livestock production. "

This participatory initiative clearly demonstrated that incorporating farmers’ knowledge, ideas and preferences could improve the wheat production package. A traditional practice of Chefe Donsa farmers—applying ash from their homesteads to their fields to enable early-sown crops to withstand frost—led to the verification of the yield-enhancing effect of inorganic potassium fertilizer on wheat. Farmer adoption of a minimum tillage production system increased the gross margin of wheat production by US$ 132 per hectare—based on 1999 prices—relative to the traditional flat seedbed system. The minimum tillage system was characterized by a much lower level of soil manipulation relative to the traditional flat seedbed system, and, as a consequence, markedly reduced the total human labor and draft oxen requirements for wheat production. Thus, the minimum tillage system could be an effective intervention for soil conservation due to early-season vegetative cover of the soil surface. Also, the early crop harvest associated with the minimum tillage system was highly beneficial for small-holder farmers—since the early harvest coincided with the cyclical period of severe household food deficits and high grain prices in local markets.

With P application, herbage yields reached as high as 14 t ha−1. Significant (P&lt;0.05) effects of P on clover \{DM\} and P uptake were observed at least up to crop 3. Over all the four crops, \{PR\} was 114%, \{PAPR25\} was 113% and \{PAPR50\} was 107% as effective as \{TSP\} in increasing clover herbage yields. The corresponding relative responses in P uptake were: 128, 121 and 112% for PR, \{PAPR25\} and PAPR50, respectively. The substitution rates in herbage yields were: 130% for PR, 128% for \{PAPR25\} and 114% for \{PAPR50\} while those for P uptake were 164% for PR, 146% for \{PAPR25\} and 125% for PAPR50. In the Chilembwe phosphate rock experiment, clover \{DM\} yields without applied P were below 1.3 t \{DM\} ha−1 in the five years of the study.

Crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), in sacco degradation of dry matter (DM), and nitrogen (N) were also estimated. Average yield of forage (4547 ± 1087.9 kg ha−1) and seed (1247 ± 266.6 kg ha−1), leaf : stem ratio (34 ± 9.4%), CP, NDF, and \{DM\} degradation of leaf and stem varied (P &lt; 0.05) among cultivars.

abstract = "Abstract The present study argues that there are heterogeneous farm systems within the drylands and each farm system is unique in terms of its livelihood asset and agricultural practice, and therefore in sustainability. Our method is based on household survey data collected from 500 farmers in Anantapur and Kurnool Districts, in Andhra Pradesh State of India, in 2013. We carried out principal component analysis (PCA) with subsequent hierarchical clustering methods to build farm typologies. To evaluate sustainability across these farm typologies, we adopted a framework consisting of economic, social and environmental sustainability pillars and associated indicators. We normalized values of target indicators and employed normative approach to assign different weights to these indicators. Composite sustainability indices (CSI) were then estimated by means of weighted sum of indicators, aggregated and integrated into farm typologies. The results suggested that there were five distinct farm typologies representing farming systems in the study area. The majority of farms (&gt;70%) in the study area are small and extensive (typology 1); marginal and off farm based (typology 2). About 20% of the farms are irrigation based and intensive (typology 3); small and medium and off farm based (typology 4) and irrigation based semi-intensive (typology 5). There was apparent variability among farm typologies in terms of farm structure and functions and composite sustainability indices. Farm typologies 3 and 5 showed significantly higher performances for the social and economic indices, while typologies 2 and 4 had relatively stronger values for environment. These discrepancies support the relevance of integrated farm typology- and \{CSI\} approaches in assessing system sustainability and targeting technologies. Universally, for all farm typologies, composite sustainability indices for economic pillar was significantly lower than the social and environment pillars. More than 90% of farmers were in economically less-sustainable class. The correlations between sustainability indices for economic and environment were typology specific. It was strong and positive when aggregated for the whole study systems [all samples (r = 0.183; P &lt; 0.001)] and for agriculture dependent farm typologies (e.g. typologies 1 and 3). This suggests the need to elevate farms economic performance and capacitate them to invest in the environment. These results provide information for policy makers to plan farm typology–context technological interventions and also create baseline information to evaluate sustainability performance in terms of progress made over time.

Cell-free expression of the cDNA revealed a 26 kDa amino translation product, indicating expression of the N-terminal domain. The protein-coding region contains three short introns, less than 100 base pairs in length and Northern blot analysis demonstrates expression of a single 0.9 kb transcript in the piroplasm and schizont stages. The transcript is present in high abundance in the intra-lymphocytic schizont stage. The recombinant protein binds to immobilized cyclosporin A, a finding consistent with peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerase function in vivo.

Clinical veterinary and artificial insemination (AI) services are no longer publicly supported in many areas. Private sector response to these reforms was expected to be greatest in the high-potential market-oriented dairy zones of Central Province, where the dairy farmers' co-operative societies play a central role in meeting the needs of dairy producers. A survey conducted by the authors measured the changes between 1990 and 1995 in milk marketing and service provision by the dairy co-operatives. Tabular and \{GIS\} analyses were used to evaluate the survey data. Dramatic changes in milk market patterns are apparent, in ways unintended by the policy reforms. Most notable has been a large increase in the role of the unregulated raw milk market. This helped increase real milk prices paid to producers by up to 50%, but also led to a steepening of the price gradient with distance from urban consumption centres. Large increases were observed in the provision of veterinary and \{AI\} services by the dairy farmers' co-operatives societies, whose producer client base and credit facilities may enable them to compete effectively with the independent private sector. Market liberalisation therefore expanded the role of the raw milk market and the participation of the dairy farmers' co-operative societies in milk marketing and the provision of input services. "

In laboratory studies, 133 and 126 tsetse flies were experimentally infected with different stocks of Trypanosoma brucei and T. congolense, respectively. Twenty-five days after infection, the flies were dissected and tested for the presence of trypanosomes using dot-ELISA and PCR. Dot-ELISA detected 98.4% of T. brucei and 94% of T. congolense infections in tsetse midguts, while \{PCR\} detected 97.6% of T. brucei and 96% of T. congolense tsetse midgut samples. For field evaluation of dot-ELISA, 700 tsetse flies were caught and screened for trypanosome infections by dissection. Seven of these (1%) had trypomastigotes in the midgut, 23 (3.3%) in the proboscis and none had trypanosomes in the salivary glands. All the flies with midgut infections also had trypanosomes in their proboscides. Five of the seven flies (71.4%) with midgut infections revealed by dissection, were also positive for T. congolense by the dot-ELISA and \{PCR\} techniques. Dot-ELISA detected T. congolense infections in an additional 86 (12.4%) of the 700 flies dissected. Of the 23 infections in the proboscis, 16 were T. vivax. Dot-ELISA detected 13 of the 16 (81%) while \{PCR\} detected 15 of 16 (94%) T. vivax infections. No T. brucei infection was detected by any of the methods in all the 700 tsetse flies examined. The results obtained from both the laboratory and field studies indicate that the dot-ELISA and \{PCR\} techniques are sensitive and species-specific in revealing trypanosome infections in tsetse flies. While dot-ELISA required a single test to detect T. congolense, several primer pairs were needed for PCR. The potential use of dot-ELISA as a tool for studying the epidemiology of trypanosomosis, while considering its field applicability and relatively lower cost is discussed. "

The experiment started at the onset of reproductive activity, when the Boran and crossbred heifers were 4.4 and 2.2 years old, respectively. The response to feeding level was investigated in three physiological states: (i) puberty and growth (87 days), (ii) work and growth (94 days, 51 days thereof with work), and (iii) pregnancy and recovery from work (115 days). Neither genotype nor feeding level had effects on nutrient digestibility, digesta passage rate and reproductive performance. Daily gains and feed conversion efficiency were higher in well-fed heifers (P&lt;0.001 and P&lt;0.01). Estimated \{MEm\} was 0.54 MJ/kg metabolic weight (W0.75) in both genotypes during puberty and growth. Imposing work required additional 0.20 and 0.10 \{MJ\} ME/kg W0.75 in Boran and crossbreds, respectively. Recovery from work, associated with early pregnancy, apparently reduced \{MEm\} to 0.30 MJ/kg W0.75. This could be explained as a result of compensatory growth. The efficiency of utilisation of metabolisable energy for growth (0.28) did not differ (P&gt;0.1) between genotypes and physiological states. "

Forty eight multiparous crossbred cows arranged in a randomised complete design with eight dietary treatments and six animals per treatment were used in the study. The dietary treatments comprised of either ad libitum \{ML\} stover+0.5% \{BW\} lablab hay or ad libitum \{OV\} hay+0.9% \{BW\} lablab hay, each supplemented with 0, 1.25, 2.50, and 3.75 kg \{DM\} of wheat bran. The combination of wheat bran and lablab hay as supplements to cows fed \{ML\} stover and \{OV\} hay basal diets significantly improved \{DM\} digestibility (P&lt;0.01), which increased (P&lt;0.001) total \{DM\} intake by 21%. \{DM\} and \{OM\} degradation and the rates of degradation of DM, OM, N and \{NDF\} in the rumen were slightly improved by supplementing \{ML\} stover or \{OV\} hay basal diets with a combination of lablab hay and wheat bran. Supplementation with lablab hay and wheat bran combination increased milk yield by 21% (P&lt;0.05). Milk yield response to supplementation with lablab hay and wheat bran for the cows consuming \{ML\} stover diets was a linear increase (P&lt;0.001, R2=0.996) with a mean increment of 1.09 kg milk per kg increase of wheat bran \{DM\} intake. Milk yield increased by 0.95, 1.3 and 0.95 kg/day for the first, second and third levels of wheat bran supplementation of cows fed \{ML\} stover. For \{OV\} hay treatments, the relationship between milk yield and increasing levels of wheat bran supplementation was quadratic (P&lt;0.001; R2=0.990) and the mean response was highest (0.72 kg milk per kg wheat bran intake) at 2.50 kg \{DM\} level of wheat bran supplement. Increasing levels of wheat bran supplementation increased milk fat (P&lt;0.01) and total solids (P&lt;0.05) for crossbred cows fed \{ML\} stover treatments but the increases were not significant for \{OV\} hay-based diets. Milk protein concentration was not affected by wheat bran supplementation for both forages. It was concluded from this study that for optimum milk production, cows fed \{ML\} stover basal forage should be supplemented with 2.5 kg DM/head/day of wheat bran in addition to 0.5% \{BW\} lablab hay while for cows consuming \{OV\} hay forage should be supplemented with a combination of 2.5 kg DM/head/day of wheat bran and 0.9% \{BW\} lablab hay. The optimum levels of supplementation in this trial were associated with a mean milk yield of 10.94 kg/cow/day for the cows on \{ML\} stover basal diet, and 10.84 kg/cow/day milk yield for those on \{OV\} hay basal diet. The improved milk yields obtained in the present trial as compared with the results of our previous trial where lablab hay alone was used as a supplement, were attributed to the additive effects of both lablab hay and wheat bran supplements which resulted in improved intake of DM, \{CP\} and metabolisable energy.

The basal diet, chickpea haulm, was offered ad libitum to all groups. Leucaena supplementation significantly increased total \{DM\} intake without marked effect on intake of the basal diet. Live weight of sheep was found to have increased by 68, 88, 94 and 74% as a result of supplementation of 100, 200 and 300 g/head per day of sun dried leucaena leaves and 300 g/head/day of concentrate mixture, respectively. Epididymal growth was retarded in animals maintained solely on chickpea haulm and improved with supplementation. Similar effects were noted in all the epididymal components of both the left and right testes. The scrotal circumference of non-supplemented sheep has been reduced by about 10% while addition of leucaena to the diet increased testicular size by 20–24%. The diameters of the left and right testes were also affected positive by supplementation. It was concluded that supplementation of up to 300 g/head per day of leucaena leaf hay improved body weight gain of sheep with concurrent increases in testicular and epididymal sizes without resulting in clinical symptoms of toxicity.

Twenty-five Arsi bulls (32±4 months) were blocked by weight and randomly allocated to the following feed restriction treatments: ad libitum feeding for the entire period (control), maintenance feeding level (maintenance), 15% body weight loss (−15%), 20% body weight loss (−20%) and 25% body weight loss (−25%). A 91-day period of feed restriction was followed by a 105-day re-alimentation period. No treatment effects was observed on average daily gain (ADG) or feed conversion efficiency (FCE) during the compensatory period, both between control and maintenance feeding levels, and within the restricted treatment groups. Recovery index differed (P&lt;0.01) both between the control and maintenance groups as well as within restricted treatments. Compensation was not complete, perhaps due to the low energy diet or insufficient time for compensation. No treatment effects on any carcass traits were observed between the ad libitum (control) and maintenance level feeding except ingesta (P&lt;0.01) and among (P&lt;0.05) restricted groups (Table 4). Effects of feeding levels linearly decreased slaughter weight (Wt2) and ingesta weight (P&lt;0.05), as well as carcass and lean meat yield (P&lt;0.01). Proportions of lean meat, fat and bone to total carcass and slaughter weight differed (P&gt;0.05) between control and maintenance groups as well as among restricted treatments. Although statistically not significant, compensatory gains, FCE, and lean meat yield for treatments −15, −20 and −25% had increasing tendencies with increasing levels of feed restriction. Therefore, Arsi bulls need longer than 105 days of compensatory feeding for complete recovery of \{LW\} losses caused by different levels of restriction in a period of 91 days. The appropriate time of feeding and change in the energy density of the diet by manipulating the roughage and concentrate ratios for complete compensation following different levels of retarded growth along with cost–benefit relationship requires further investigation.

Forty eight multiparous (parity 2–4) cows approximately 60 days prepartum and mean live weight 445 S.D.±57 kg at the beginning of the experiment were used in the study. The experiment lasted 200 days each cow, covering 60 days prepartum and 140 days postpartum. Lablab hay supplementation significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased total \{DM\} intake and \{DM\} digestibility as compared with the unsupplemented diets but there was no significant (P&gt;0.05) difference in total \{DM\} intake among the supplemented cows. Cows fed \{ML\} stover or \{OV\} hay supplemented with lablab hay had improved rumen environment as reflected in the rates of DM, OM, N and \{NDF\} degradation greater than 0.03 (i.e. 3%) per h. The degradation parameters; a, b, c and the effective degradability (ED) were higher (P&lt;0.001) for lablab hay supplemented diets than for \{ML\} stover or \{OV\} hay basal forages fed alone. \{ML\} stover fed alone resulted into significantly (P&lt;0.001) higher Ca, P, and Mg intake than \{OV\} hay fed alone while K intake was significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher with \{OV\} hay. Increasing levels of lablab hay supplementation significantly (P&lt;0.001) increased Ca, P and Mg intakes but did not significantly (P&gt;0.05) affect K intake in both \{ML\} stover and \{OV\} hay diets. \{OV\} hay and \{ML\} stover basal forages fed to unsupplemented crossbred cows resulted into average milk yields of 6.82 and 8.25 kg/cow per day, respectively, over a lactation period of 140 days after calving. Supplementation with lablab hay significantly (P&lt;0.001) increased milk yield of crossbred cows fed \{OV\} hay but for \{ML\} stover based diets, supplementation was only significant (P&lt;0.05) at the lowest level (0.4% BW) of lablab offer. For \{ML\} stover based treatments, the highest daily milk yield (9.5 kg/head) was obtained at 0.4% of body weight (BW) lablab hay supplementation, while for \{OV\} hay treatments, the highest milk yield of 9.7 kg/head was obtained at 1.2% \{BW\} lablab hay supplementation. Mean concentrations of milk fat, protein and total solids were similar for both \{ML\} stover and \{OV\} hay diets fed alone but lablab hay supplementation did not significantly affect the concentration of milk components of cows fed both forages. It was concluded that for optimum milk production from crossbred cows fed \{ML\} stover and \{OV\} hay basal diets, supplementation should be at 0.52 and 0.85% of \{BW\} level of lablab hay, respectively. The lack of response to higher levels of lablab hay supplement despite the increased protein intake was interpreted as resulting from a deficit of dietary energy. "

A wide variety of separate crop and livestock models exists, but the nature of crop–livestock interactions, and their importance in smallholder farming systems, makes their integration difficult. Even where there is adequate understanding of the biophysical processes involved, integrated crop–livestock models may be constrained by lack of reliable data for calibration and validation. The construction from scratch of simulation models that meet the needs of one particular case is generally too costly to countenance. As for all modelling activity, the most efficient way to proceed depends on the nature of the systems under study and the precise questions that have to be addressed. We outline a framework for the integration of detailed biophysical crop and livestock simulation models. We highlight the need for minimum calibration and validation data sets, and conclude by listing various research problems that need attention. The application of robust and trustworthy crop–livestock models is critical for furthering the research agenda associated with animal agriculture in the tropics and subtropics. "

Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) was used to compare two isogenic clones of Trypanosoma congolense. The parent clone, sensitive to isometamidium, has a \{CD50\} (the curative dose that gives complete cure in 50% of the animals) in the mouse of 0.018 mg/kg and its derivative exposed to increasing doses of isometamidium, has a \{CD50\} that is 94-fold higher. Sixty-four combinations of eight Eco \{RI\} and eight Mse I primers were used in comparative \{AFLP\} analysis to detect subtle genetic differences between the two clones. Thirty-five polymorphic fragments of \{DNA\} that were observed only in the resistant clone were purified and then sequenced. The nucleotide sequences were used in searching the GeneDB T. congolense database to find surrounding sequences upstream of an open reading frame and downstream to a stop codon. The sequences of the open reading frames were subsequently compared to the sequences in the genomic databases. A predicted gene coding for an 854 amino acids protein was thus identified. The protein contains a putative \{ATP\} binding site, Walker B and \{LSGG\} motifs and eight predicted trans-membrane domains. The gene in the resistant strain of T. congolense has a triplet insertion coding for an extra lysine. Using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, the insertion was sought in the genomes of 35 T. congolense strains isolated from different geographic origins and whose response to isometamidium chloride had been determined through single dose mouse tests. The presence of the insertion, specifying an extra codon was found to always be present in the genomes of T. congolense clones that were resistant to isometamidium chloride. "

A major component of any impact assessment framework that aspires to comprehensiveness is information on the location of different agricultural systems and pertinent characteristics of the resource-poor who operate them. Given the importance of livestock to the diets and incomes of poor farming households, and the predicted increase in demand for livestock products throughout the developing world over the next few decades, understanding how livestock fit into these systems, and how these systems may evolve in the future, is critical. This is especially true in Africa, where approximately 27% (162 million people) of the world's poor livestock keepers live. In this paper, we further develop a global livestock production system classification put forward by Seré and Steinfeld in 1996. These livestock systems fall into four categories: landless systems, livestock only/rangeland-based systems (areas with minimal cropping), mixed rainfed systems (mostly rainfed cropping combined with livestock) and mixed irrigated systems (a significant proportion of cropping uses irrigation and is interspersed with livestock). We then describe a method for mapping the classification, based on agro-climatology (length of growing period), land cover, and human population density. We conclude with a discussion of how the maps could be refined, and indicate their potential use in a range of different policy and research and development applications. "

A large proportion, 768 individual \{ESTs\} (36%, representing 385 different transcripts), had a significant homology with genes described in organisms other than the African trypanosomes; however, 15% of the \{ESTs\} were from genes already described in trypanosomes.

The results show the presence of inefficiency, with about 74% of the variation in actual profit from maximum profit (profit frontier) between farms mainly arising from differences in farmers’ practices rather than random variability. Further the mean profit efficiency level of 0.58 suggests that there is a substantial scope to improve beef profitability in Botswana. Significant profit efficiency drivers include, among others, education, distance to market, herd size, access to information and access to income from crop production. Considering the importance of livestock sector for wealth creation and poverty eradication in the rural areas where poverty is more pronounced, there is a need for appropriate development strategies and policies directed towards addressing these factors. In particular there is need to invest in market infrastructure in order to improve market access, hence profit efficiency of smallholder livestock farmers. "

Evaporative demand (Eo) in the field was determined by measuring evaporation from open water with a recording evaporation balance. Actual evaporation from the field soil was determined by daily measurement of water content in the top 10 and 20cm layers. Drying was best described by a modified version of the square root of time behaviour model of T.A. Black, W.R. Gardener and G.W. Thurtell (The prediction of evaporation drainage and soil water storage for a bare soil. Soil Sci. Am. Proc., 33: 655–660, 1969) and a simple parametric model similar to that proposed by J.J.T.I. Boesten and L. Stroosnijder (Simple model for daily evaporation from fallow tilled soil under spring conditions in a temperate climate. Neth. J. Agric. Sci., 34: 75–80, 1986). The parametric model was incorporated in a model describing water dynamics in a silt loam soil (Typic Hapludalf) on field plots located near Ter Munck, 5 km southwest of Leuven, Belgium. The results show that drying characteristics of tilled soils are influenced by factors such as tillage depth, surface micro-relief, soil type, and the nature of the evaporative demand, and that it is possible to incorporate such effects in evaporation models. However, more research is needed to study the combined effects of tillage type and depth and atmospheric evaporativity on the drying characteristics of different soils, and to compare the relative effect of radiation-dominated evaparativity on the evaporation parameters with that of wind-dominated evaporativity.

The basic nematode seasonal infectivity pattern was expressed in terms of relative numbers of third-stage larvae (L3) available on pasture for different months. Data from faecal nematode egg counts, pasture larval recoveries and worm counts from the tracer lambs were used to investigate the infectivity pattern. Four nematode species of economic importance: Longistrongylus (Pseudomarshallagia) elongata, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Haemonchus contortus, and Dictyocaulus filaria, were recovered from sheep. The largest numbers were recovered during the wet season (i.e. July to November) with peaks in late August and early September. During this 2 year study period, the seasonal pattern of sheep gastrointestinal nematodes was clearly defined. An important finding was that conditions during the short rainy season (i.e. March–May) were not conducive to the development and survival of nematode eggs and the free-living stages, hence little or no transmission occurred. Rainfall and humidity seemed to be the most important factors for the development of eggs and free-living stages. The period of acquisition of third-stage larvae from pasture was found to be relatively short, suggesting that a strategic control programme is feasible with minimal anthelmintic use. Results from the studies are discussed in relation to control strategies. "

In addition, available credit does not reach those who need it the most and with whom it could have the greatest impact due to the application of inappropriate screening procedures and criteria to determine creditworthiness. The analysis of demand based on borrowing and nonborrowing sample households using improved dairy technology, it is shown that not all borrowers borrowed due to liquidity constraint while some borrowers and some nonborrowers had liquidity constraint but did not have access to adequate credit. Logistic regression analysis show that sex and education of the household head, training in dairy, prevalence of outstanding loan and the number of improved cattle on the farm had significant influence on both borrowing and liquidity status of a household, though the degree and direction of influence were not always the same in each study country. Based on the findings it is suggested that combining public and commercial finance could solve the problem of inadequate credit supply while inventory finance to community level input suppliers and service providers might help in getting credit to worthy and needy smallholders at lower cost than providing credit to smallholders directly.

Laboratory traits related to stover structural carbohydrates such as \{NDF\} and \{ADF\} were highly negatively related with digestible organic matter intake (DOMI) accounting for 90% of the variation therein, while \{IVOMD\} and \{ME\} were positively associated with \{DOMI\} accounting for 90 and 94% of the variation therein, respectively. Stover from two hybrids (NK 6240, 30V 92) with the highest and second highest grain yield but with the laboratory and in vivo stover fodder quality traits falling into the statistically highest and lowest category were further investigated for animal responses through supplementation and feed processing. From these two stovers, complete diet in the form of feed block and mash were designed consisting of 60% stover. Stover-based complete diets in the form of feed mash were superior to diets offered as feed blocks. In the feed mash form, animals fed the superior stover-based diet had more than 30% greater average daily gain than those fed the lower quality stover-based feed mash diet. Stover from the popular maize hybrids were found to differ significantly with regard to the stover quality attributes-feed intake, digestibility and animal performance suggesting the possibility of exploiting these attributes by the maize breeders for developing promising dual purpose maize varieties.

Cattle can be vaccinated by injecting live parasites simultaneously with long acting oxytetracycline (the infection and treatment method, ITM). The immunity induced by \{ITM\} is believed to be mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Although effective, the \{ITM\} vaccine has disadvantages such as the need for a liquid nitrogen cold chain and a complex production process, which may be overcome by the development of a subunit vaccine. However, the high level of antigenic polymorphism among different strains of T. parva may hinder the development of a subunit vaccine aimed at induction of a protective \{CTL\} response. In this study, the \{CTL\} cross-reactivity among T. parva strains was examined. The Tp1214–224 epitope has previously been shown to be recognized by cattle of the \{A18\} BoLA type. Three different variants of this epitope have been identified from different T. parva strains. Here, bulk \{CTL\} and \{CTL\} clones were generated from two animals using both the live sporozoite vaccine composed of three different strains and a Muguga strain for immunization. The cross-reactivity of these \{CTL\} with the three variant Tp1 epitopes was examined in interferon gamma \{ELISPOT\} assays and \{CTL\} killing assays. CD8+ cells from both animals cross-reacted with the three variant \{CTL\} epitopes in interferon gamma \{ELISPOT\} assays, although the CD8+ cells from the Muguga-immunized animal showed a more epitope restricted response. Clones from the vaccine immunized animal showed diverse response patterns with clones responding to each variant peptide. Although some variability in the cytotoxic response was observed, overall strong cross-reactivity among the variant Tp1 epitopes was seen in both animals. Such epitope polymorphism does not, in this case, serve as a potential challenge in a putative subunit vaccine as it would be sufficient to only include one of the variant epitopes. "

Parasite-host cell interactions could be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies to bovine \{MHC\} class I and partially by one of two antibodies to BoCD4SR. Proteolysis of the lymphocyte surface removed \{CD45R\} but not \{MHC\} class I determinants, and enhanced sporozoite binding. These observations support the hypothesis that \{CD4SR\} and \{CD45R\} antibodies may nonspecifically prevent close approximation between sporozoites and lymphocytes. Interestingly, under normal conditions, sporozoites of T. parva did not attach to lymphocytes from goats, but did so when the cells were treated with the protease, suggesting that receptor(s) for T. parva sporozoites might be present on caprine cells but are not easily accessible. These and other results indicate that proteases may be involved in binding and entry of T. parva sporozoites. Electron microscopy revealed that the process of binding and entry of sporozoites into protease-treated goat lymphocytes was very similar to that of the bovine cells. However, schizonts did not develop and lymphocyte proliferation was not induced, indicating that cell entry by sporozoites and cellular transformation are separate processes. "

Overall, warming and drying may reduce crop yields by 10–20% to 2050, but there are places where losses are likely to be much more severe. Increasing frequencies of heat stress, drought and flooding events will result in yet further deleterious effects on crop and livestock productivity. There will be places in the coming decades where the livelihood strategies of rural people may need to change, to preserve food security and provide income-generating options. These are likely to include areas of Africa that are already marginal for crop production; as these become increasingly marginal, then livestock may provide an alternative to cropping. We carried out some analysis to identify areas in sub-Saharan Africa where such transitions might occur. For the currently cropped areas (which already include the highland areas where cropping intensity may increase in the future), we estimated probabilities of failed seasons for current climate conditions, and compared these with estimates obtained for future climate conditions in 2050, using downscaled climate model output for a higher and a lower greenhouse-gas emission scenario. Transition zones can be identified where the increased probabilities of failed seasons may induce shifts from cropping to increased dependence on livestock. These zones are characterised in terms of existing agricultural system, current livestock densities, and levels of poverty. The analysis provides further evidence that climate change impacts in the marginal cropping lands may be severe, where poverty rates are already high. Results also suggest that those likely to be more affected are already more poor, on average. We discuss the implications of these results in a research-for-development targeting context that is likely to see the poor disproportionately and negatively affected by climate change. "

Glycerol kinase and α -glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activities were more than 16 times lower than the activities of other enzymes catalysing the oxidation of the triose phosphates to lactate. It was suggested that the catabolism of glycerol is negligible and that glucose is catabolized to lactate via the Embden–Meyerhof pathway. The activities of the enzymes catalysing the section of the citric acid cycle that involves the formation of citrate to succinyl-CoA were consistently very low (less than 2.0 nmol/min/mg protein), indicating that this part of the cycle plays a minor role in this parasite. Enzyme activities of the cycle catalysing the formation of succinate from oxaloacetate were relatively higher than those catalysing other sections of the citric acid cycle, suggesting that this section of the cycle could be important to the parasite. Pyruvate carboxylase activity was more than 10 times that of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. It was suggested that pyruvate could be carboxylated to oxaloacetate. Taken together, these results suggest that the catabolism of glucose in Theileria parva schizonts is mainly via the Embden–Meyerhof pathway and that the citric acid cycle plays a minor role in energy production.

The study used 0.01 ha plots, established on 0–4% and 4–8% slopes located close to each other at Debre Zeit research station, 50 km South of Addis Ababa. The grazing regimes were: light grazing stocked at 0.6 animal-unit-month per hectare (AUM ha−1); moderate grazing stocked at 1.8 \{AUM\} ha−1; heavy grazing stocked at 3.0 \{AUM\} ha−1; very heavy grazing stocked at 4.2 \{AUM\} ha−1; very heavy grazing on ploughed pasture stocked at 4.2 \{AUM\} ha−1; and a control of ‘no grazing’. Heavy grazing significantly reduced vegetative cover and biomass yields, especially on steeper slopes. Light to heavy grazing did not affect the botanical composition of the vegetation at both sites, but very heavy grazing resulted in species normally less preferred by animals dominating the botanical composition. Grazing did not have significant effect on ground vegetative cover on the 0–4% slope except at very heavy grazing pressure, but on the 4–8% slope even moderate grazing significantly reduced vegetative cover. Light to moderate grazing at the beginning of the dry period enhanced plant biomass productivity, while any grazing reduced plant productivity during the periods of reduced growth. Species richness increased with increasing grazing pressure compared with no grazing, but decreased sharply at very heavy grazing pressure. We concluded that there is need for developing ‘slope and time specific’ grazing management practices, and to assess short and long term effects of grazing and trampling on vegetation. "

The data on species composition and life-form of the plants germinating in pots receiving air dried manure were compared with species composition of experimental plots in natural grassland subjected to varying grazing intensity. There was significant difference among the species composition of grazed and non-grazed grasslands and the manure seed bank (p = 0.01). The life-forms of the species also showed variation. There were more families and species in the natural grassland vegetation than indicated in the manure seed bank. The manure seed bank had more annuals than the natural grassland vegetation. The species composition and life-forms in the manure seed bank showed variation with time and this corresponded with the seasonal variation in the grassland, which had a direct relationship with the rainfall pattern. The study showed that livestock play a major role in maintaining the biodiversity of grassland vegetation by spatial and temporal dispersion of readily germinating seeds in their manure. The use of manure to improve soil fertility should be weighed cautiously against the introduction of weeds into crop fields, although weeds are important feed resource for livestock in land-constrained areas. There is therefore the need for developing manure management practices so that the benefits can be optimised and the undesirable effects can be minimised. "

Stovers were investigated for nitrogen (N), neutral (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF), acid detergent lignin (ADL), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) and ME. Quality traits were investigated using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) applied to whole and ground maize grain and to ground stover. Application of \{NIRS\} to whole maize grain was unsuccessful but CP, fat and \{ME\} contents in ground maize grain were well predicted with \{R2\} = 0.81, 0.83 and 0.94, respectively, and predictions of lysine and tryptophan were acceptable (R2 = 0.70). Maize stover quality traits were generally well predicted by \{NIRS\} (R2 = 0.81–0.96). Genotype and environment effect was significant on the quality traits of grain, whereas G × E effect was not significant. Trade-offs between grain and stover quality traits were generally absent or weak and inconsistent but several grain quality traits were incompatible. Thus grain \{CP\} was negatively correlated with grain yield. Lysine and tryptophan were consistently significantly negatively correlated with CP. Line and cultivars-dependent variation in grain and stover quality traits were high enough to be of nutritional significance to monogastrics and ruminants. "

Up to 100 μg/ml pure Ov-47 recombinant protein could be isolated from E. coli cultures by Ni–agarose affinity chromatography. The 47-kDa protein was recognized by sera from both infected and endemic normal subjects. The parent protein was found to have a molecular weight of 60 kDa.

The anchor of the variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) was labeled with 3H-myristic acid and \{VSG\} purified in its membrane-associated form. The dimyristylglycerol moiety of the anchor was released by phospholipase C cleavage. Integrity of the anchor and efficiency of cleavage was verified by autoradiography and methanol:hexane extraction. For analysis of biological function, bovine monocytes were used which had been incubated with bovine interferon γ (primed) or with culture medium (unprimed). The \{VSG\} purified in its membrane-associated form was found to stimulate both primed and unprimed cells to secrete TNFα. The same preparation from which the dimyristylglycerol moiety had been cleaved was no longer able to stimulate unprimed cells but could still stimulate primed cells. Our data indicate that the presence of the dimyristylglycerol is not an absolute requirement for induction of TNFα production but can substitute for the interferon γ priming. Therefore, we favor the hypothesis that stimulation of macrophages to secrete TNFα by the mfVSG is mediated by an as yet unknown trigger moiety and is facilitated by the dimyristylglycerol anchor. "

abstract = "The recent increased emphasis on impact assessment is due in part to the rapidly changing nature of funding for agricultural research and the shifts that have occurred in what is expected of the agricultural research community. The reasons for doing impact assessment are relatively clear: ex post studies can determine the impact of past investment in research on target beneficiaries and are a way to learn some of the lessons of the past. Ex ante studies can provide information to assist in the allocation of scarce research resources to activities that best match donors’ development objectives. In practice, impact assessment is often contentious and almost always difficult, particularly when livestock are involved. In this paper, we outline methods that can be used in ex ante impact assessment, and illustrate some of these in relation to three recent studies on improved food-feed crops in different places: improving the quality of millet and sorghum stover in India, using dual-purpose cowpea in West Africa, and alternatives for utilizing maize stover in the mixed systems of East and Southern Africa. Such impact assessments are neither cheap nor quick, and the methods that are most appropriate in any situation will depend not only on the resources and expertise available but most importantly on the exact nature of the questions being asked and the end-users of the results. Much remains to be done to maximize the utility of such assessments, particularly in the areas of quantitative model development, rapid qualitative method development, more effective integration of biophysical and socio-cultural indicators and approaches, and provision of baseline data against which to measure progress. Research resource allocation may well retain its somewhat haphazard nature in the future, but given the challenges facing agriculture in developing countries, a mechanism for attempting to ensure that research and extension really do contribute to widely held development goals has to be based on more than trial and error.

This central role is largely the result of the possibilities to map and characterize land cover based on observations and remote sensing. This paper argues that more attention should be given to land use and land functions and linkages between these. Consideration of land functions that provide a wide range of goods and services makes more integrated assessments of land change possible. The increasing attention to multifunctional land use is another incentive to develop methods to assess changes in land functions. A number of methods to quantify and map the spatial extent of land use and land functions are discussed and the implications for modeling are identified based on recent model approaches in land change science. The mixed use of land cover, land use and land function in maps and models leads to inconsistencies in land change assessments. Explicit attention to the non-linear relations between land cover, land use and land function is essential to consistently address land change. New methods to map and quantify land function dynamics will enhance our ability to understand and model land system change and adequately inform policies and planning. "

While previous studies have analyzed farm productivity and income effects, possible employment effects have received much less attention. Special supermarket requirements may entail intensified farm production and post-harvest handling, thus potentially increasing demand for hired labor. This could also have important gender implications, because female and male workers are often hired for distinct farm operations. Building on data from a recent survey of vegetable farmers in Kenya, a double-hurdle model of hired labor use is developed and estimated. Farmer participation in supermarket channels increases the likelihood of hiring labor by 20%, and demand for hired labor by 61%. A gender disaggregation shows that positive employment effects are especially pronounced for female laborers, who often belong to the most vulnerable population groups. Rural employment generation can be an important vehicle for poverty reduction. "

Sequencing of 19 Ra86 sequences defined two alleles differentiated by indels, encoding 693 amino acids (aa) and 654 aa respectively, from the Muguga laboratory reference strain. Ra86 sequences were also determined from gut cDNA from four field populations of R. appendiculatus collected in different livestock production systems in Kenya. Analysis of approximately 20 Ra86 sequences from each of the four field sites in central and Western Kenya; Makuyu, Kiambu, Kakamega and Uasin Gishu, revealed three additional size types differentiated by 39–49 amino acid indels resulting in a total of 5 indel-defined genotypes. The 693 aa type 5 was isolated only from the laboratory tick stock; genotypes 1, 2 and 3 were identified in ticks from the four Kenyan field sites and appeared to be derivatives of the shorter \{RA86\} genotype found in Muguga laboratory stock genotype 4. By contrast no large indels have yet been observed between R. microplus sequences from Australia, South America or Africa. Evidence that selection contributes to the observed sequence variation was provided by analysis of ratio of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions and application of the selective neutrality and neutral evolution tests to the primary data. Phylogenetic analysis clustered sequences from all Ra86 size types and Bm86, into four major clades based on amino acid substitutions, but there was no evidence that these groupings correlated with geographical separation of R. appendiculatus populations "

Farmers in the test group received an information leaflet designed to address gaps in farmer knowledge likely to lead to inadequate treatment; their knowledge was assessed before the intervention, and at 2 weeks and 5 months after the intervention. We assessed the quality of farmer treatments by measuring clinical outcomes in cattle 2 weeks after selection and treatment. As an indicator of herd health, we assessed the mean hematocrit of the village herd before, and 5 months after, the intervention. To account for clustering, we analysed data using generalised estimating equations. Improvements in farmer knowledge of trypanosomosis diagnosis and treatment at 2 weeks and 5 months in the group receiving information were 23% and 14% greater at 2 weeks and 5 months, respectively. In the test group, 84% of farmer treatments were successful, compared to 73% in the control group.

Farmers reported that trypanosomosis was the most important cattle disease and estimated that 25% of their herd fall sick each year and 18% of the sick animals die. Nearly all sick animals (90%) were treated with trypanocides and most treatments were administered by untrained farmers. Giving drugs was the strategy most used as primary means of protection (50% of farmers) followed by avoiding high risk areas (32% of farmers) and keeping trypanotolerant cattle (7% of farmers). Few farmers knew about communal tsetse control methods and those who did, rarely practiced them. Farmer diagnosis of trypanosomosis in cattle presented at clinics (n = 113) was in most cases (84%) supported by laboratory tests. However, the signs that most farmers considered indicative of trypanosomosis (staring coat and emaciation) were poor predictors of trypanosomosis. We tested farmer knowledge of injection sites and trypanocide dilutions (n = 423 cattle), and while few (15%) farmers gave under-dosages or over-dosage (2% of farmers), injection techniques were poor with injection-related side effects in 24% of cattle treated by farmers. Despite this, therapeutic outcomes were both objectively (clinical parameters) and subjectively (carer assessment) satisfactory in 89% of cattle treated by farmers. This study found that farmers play a major role in successfully managing trypanosomosis and recommends the recognition and support for community based treatment. "

The factorial design involved two breeds, two infection treatments (infected vs non-infected) and three dietary protein treatments (hay and wheat bran (basal diet), hay plus molasses urea block (MUB), hay plus cotton seed cake (CSC)). At the start of the study, 152 weaner lambs (103 Menz and 49 Horro) were assigned to the 12 treatment combinations each in a separate pen. Endoparasite challenge involved three infection periods (primary, secondary and tertiary) each separated by an anthelmintic treatment. The first two infections were with Haemonchus contortus, while the third infection was a mixed infection of H. contortus, Longistrongylus elongata and Trichostrongylus colubriformis. During the entire study, infected lambs gained significantly less weight and had a lower blood packed cell volume (PCV) than the non-infected lambs. Protein supplementation of lambs with \{CSC\} resulted in lower faecal egg counts (FEC) and higher \{PCV\} and growth rates than lambs fed the basal diet. In the first two infection periods there was no significant effect of infections in lambs supplemented with MUB, probably due to low intake of MUB. In the tertiary infection period \{MUB\} was fed ad libitum which resulted in MUB-supplemented lambs having significantly higher \{PCV\} than lambs on the basal diet, with CSC-supplemented lambs intermediate. During the primary infection, naive Horro lambs had a significantly lower \{FEC\} than Menz lambs, but there was no significant breed difference for PCV. In the secondary infection period there was no significant breed difference for \{FEC\} or \{PCV\} in infected lambs. However, during the tertiary infection, while there was no significant breed difference for FEC, the Menz had a significantly higher \{PCV\} than Horro irrespective of infection status. At the end of the tertiary infection, the Menz lambs (n=26) had significantly lower adult worm burdens for H. contortus and L. elongata than Horro lambs (n=18), but there was no significant difference between the breeds for T. colubriformis worm burdens. Both the worm count and \{PCV\} data suggest that Menz lambs acquire the ability to resist and tolerate endoparasite infections better than the Horro lambs. "

The treatments were based on different frequencies: twice-a-week dipping, once-a-month dipping and no tick control. The objective was to evaluate the economic justification for intensive acaricide application for tick and tick-borne disease control in Uganda. Data were collected by monitoring cattle performance over a period of 34 months. Biological data collected included the number of cows at the beginning and end of the study, net starting liveweight, number of calves born, number of animals dying due to tick-borne diseases and other causes, number of animals sold or slaughtered and milk yield. Records of variable costs (acaricides, drugs, labour, etc.) and output prices were assembled and calculated by treatment group. Gross margin and marginal analysis were used in the financial analysis. The exchange rate in 1990–1993 was one US$ to 1200 Uganda shillings. The gross benefits obtained from animal sales, herd value and milk yield were Uganda shillings 1175, 1389 and 1311 per kg of net starting liveweight for animals dipped twice-a-week, once-a-month and not dipped, respectively. The variable costs were Ug. shs. 424, 390 and 360 per kg of net starting liveweight, respectively. Consequently, the gross margins were Ug. shs. 751, 999 and 951 per kg of net starting liveweight. Furthermore, the marginal rate of return (MRR) in changing from no tick control to once-a-month dipping was 160%, while changing from no tick control to twice-a-week dipping was negative (− 313%). The above results showed that the value of increased gains in production obtained from twice-a-week dipping strategy does not offset the costs of inputs for intensive dipping. Once-a-month dipping (strategic) therefore appears to be the most-profitable tick-control strategy for the farmer. The need to conduct further studies in different livestock- production systems and to rationalise future tick control policies is discussed. "

A mechanistic model to predict risk of pre-harvest contamination could assist in management of this very harmful mycotoxin. In this study we describe an aflatoxin risk prediction model which is integrated with the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) modelling framework. The model computes a temperature function for A. flavus growth and aflatoxin production using a set of three cardinal temperatures determined in the laboratory using culture medium and intact grains. These cardinal temperatures were 11.5 °C as base, 32.5 °C as optimum and 42.5 °C as maximum. The model used a low (≤0.2) crop water supply to demand ratio—an index of drought during the grain filling stage to simulate maize crop's susceptibility to A. flavus growth and aflatoxin production. When this low threshold of the index was reached the model converted the temperature function into an aflatoxin risk index (ARI) to represent the risk of aflatoxin contamination. The model was applied to simulate \{ARI\} for two commercial maize hybrids, \{H513\} and H614D, grown in five multi-location field trials in Kenya using site specific agronomy, weather and soil parameters. The observed mean aflatoxin contamination in these trials varied from &lt;1 to 7143 ppb. \{ARI\} simulated by the model explained 99% of the variation (p ≤ 0.001) in a linear relationship with the mean observed aflatoxin contamination. The strong relationship between \{ARI\} and aflatoxin contamination suggests that the model could be applied to map risk prone areas and to monitor in-season risk for genotypes and soils parameterized for APSIM.

Characterization by restriction fragment length polymorphism of the 16S rRNA–PCR product was performed withAlu 1, Dde 1, Msp 1, and Taq 1. Amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis was performed only on the isolates that were curved rods. The nucleotide sequence of \{PCR\} products derived from the 16S rRNA genes of the isolates was determined. The classical characterization suggested that, with one exception all the curved rods isolates wereSelenomonas and the coccus was a Streptococcus. Only Selenomonas -like isolates had tannin acylhydrolase activities. One isolate lost the ability to completely hydrolyze tannins after prolonged storage at −70°C. The restriction fragment length polymorphism profiles suggested that the Selenomonas -like isolates exhibited heterogeneity in the ribosomal \{RNA\} locus. The coccus had the same profiles as Streptococcus caprinus, while the straight rods appeared to be similar to each other. Amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis suggested that the Selenomonas -like isolates clustered into two major groups. The 16S rRNA sequences of the coccus clustered with that ofStreptococcus species and the Selenomonas -like isolates exhibited a high level of similarity withSelenomonas ruminantium , while the straight rods clustered with Klebsiella species accessions in the databases.

abstract = "Abstract Western Kenya is one of Africa’s most densely populated rural areas, characterised by intensive smallholder crop–livestock systems on degraded lands managed with small inputs of mineral fertiliser and animal manure. Competing uses for crop residues and other organic resources often results in poor nutrient cycling efficiencies at farm scale. Modifying livestock feeding, retaining more crop residues in the field, and improving manure management can help conserving considerable amount of nutrients on-farm. To examine to what extent such strategies would be feasible, we analysed whole-farm nutrient cycling efficiencies (NCE) of a range of farms differing in resource-endowment and production orientation, identifying the most efficient farmer strategies considering labour and financial constraints. Nutrient concentration in excreted cattle manure was relatively small (i.e., N &lt; 1.7%; P &lt; 0.6%). Current manure management practices led to low NCE’s (average 27%) due to nutrient losses from excretion through storage and application. Farmers have few incentives to improve manure management given the small amounts of excreta and nutrients to be recycled. Yet, manure, both composted and fresh, represented the greatest N (16 kg ha−1 season−1) and C returns to the soil (312 kg C ha−1 season−1). Retention of crop residues was the cheapest source of nutrient inputs for the next crop, especially when compared with manure, but farmers prioritised its use for cattle feeding. Our findings highlight the critical lack of nutrients and organic residues on smallholder farms in the densely-populated highlands of East Africa, as well as low \{NCE\} when it comes to manure. In these conditions, efficient nutrient cycling for manure and improved cattle feeding are essential to increase use efficiencies of any possible external nutrient added in these farms. "

This paper addresses the effect of important diseases of groundnut and sorghum on pod and grain yield and crop residue yield and quality. In four genotypes of groundnut, late leaf spot (Phaeoisasariopsis personata) and rust (Puccinia arachidis) are the two major foliar diseases that together could reduce pod and haulm yield by 70% and in vitro digestibility of haulms by 22%. Two genotypes (ICGV 9202 and 92093) were highly resistant to these foliar diseases maintaining high pod and haulm yield as well as high in vitro digestibility of haulms (&gt;62.3%) even under highest disease pressure. Important diseases in sorghum investigated were a viral disease caused by maize stripe virus (MStV) and anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum graminicola. \{MStV\} reduced grain yield by 30%, stover yield by 42% and digestible stover yield by 45%. Effects of \{MStV\} were highly genotype-dependent and grain and stover were affected in different ways in different varieties. The choice of appropriate genotype for a given farming situation will depend on trade-off scenarios for benefits from grain and stover. Similarly, anthracnose could reduce grain yield by 47% and stover yield by 23% but effects on stover quality were variable. As observed for MStV, effects of anthracnose were highly genotype-dependent and genotypes were identified that maintained high grain and stover yield under high disease pressure. "

None of these studies have explicitly addressed the reasons behind the decision to seek off-farm employment. Neither have they been able to examine in-depth the important issue of how this major component of the farm sector responds to alternative policies, since most studies have used cross-sectional data for a given region. A comparison between countries would permit the analysis of how multiple job holding responds to differing government policies. The purpose of this paper is to examine the reasons for and factors affecting multiple job holdings of dairy farm families in neighboring regions of two counties, United States and Canada. The bordering regions of New York and Ontario have similar geographic conditions but significantly different farm support and social service policies. The results indicate the importance of farm income on why people work off the farm and provide evidence of multiple job holding as a flexible mechanism for coping with changes in the economic environment facing the household. For operators, the driving characteristics influencing off-farm labor participation is the farm's financial position. The supply-managed milk marketing system ensures higher and more stable returns for Ontario dairy farm labor. In contrast, it is family demographics, educational level and social support policy that appears to largely influence spousal off-farm employment decisions. Free medical care in Ontario lowers the reservation wage for household members. The effect of these farm and social support policies on the relative returns to labor in agriculture and non-farm employment explains the lower participation rate and hours supplied in off-farm work by both operators, and hours supplied in off-farm work by both operators and spouses in Ontario dairy farm household.

Highly significant (P &lt; 0.0001) cultivars-dependent variations were found for a range of laboratory haulm fodder quality traits. Haulm nitrogen contents ranged from 1.94 to 2.88% and from 1.81 to 2.66% while in vitro digestibility ranged from 57.3 to 64.3% and from 59.5 to 64.2% under water restriction and fully irrigated conditions, respectively. Under fully irrigated conditions haulm nitrogen content and in vitro digestibility were mildly, but significantly inversely, related to pod yields with the two haulms traits accounting for 5 and 4% of the variations in pod yields. However, potential trade-offs between haulm traits and pod yields became more pronounced under water stress where variations in haulm nitrogen content and in vitro digestibility accounted for 40 and 28% of the variations in pod yields, respectively. For haulm nitrogen content and in vitro digestibility no significant interactions were observed between cultivar and treatment suggesting stability of haulm fodder traits across poorer and better water management practices. These results demonstrate that breeding for fodder traits in groundnut can be parallel to breeding for productivity traits, although careful choice of cultivars with high fodder trait value would be needed under water stress conditions.

It is also recognized that livestock are an essential asset of poor farmers in the mixed crop-livestock systems in this region. One of the major constraints to their productivity is, however, feed availability. A significant proportion of this feed is sourced from maize stover. We engaged in a multi-disciplinary research of dual-purpose maize cultivars with the purpose of contributing to smallholder food security. The specific objective of our endeavor is to better match new maize cultivars to farmers’ needs by including fodder traits in maize improvement programs in Ethiopia, Tanzania and Kenya. We explored a novel approach for targeting maize breeding research. Agricultural development strategies must recognize heterogeneity in bio-physical, economic, socio-cultural, institutional and environmental factors when devising interventions and investments. The research effort into maize as a food and feed resource was, therefore, carried out in a cross-section of bio-physically and socio-economically contrasting areas across the three study countries. To this effect the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre's traditional targeting framework, maize mega-environments (MMEs), was combined with recommendation domains for dual-purpose maize using a Geographical Information System (GIS). The GIS-based approach provided a spatial framework for the structured exploration of opportunities to transfer knowledge and technologies. Results show that maize is potentially an important feed resource in areas with high feed demand. Throughout the different MMEs, a range of different incentives for dual-purpose varieties can be found. The maps with recommendation domains for dual-purpose maize will facilitate better targeting of new maize cultivars. Cultivars with good quality stover can now be preferentially promoted in areas with high demand for stover as feed, while at the same time matched to the bio-physically most suitable mega-environment. This integrated approach is widely applicable and will help increase the impacts from agricultural research. "

Stover from 12 genotypes of sorghum and six genotypes of pearl millet grown under high and low fertilizer application was investigated for nitrogen, cell wall constituents, sugar, plant height, stem diameter, leaf number per plant and extent and rate of in vitro gas production of whole stover and of stover cell walls. Organic matter digestibility, organic matter intake, digestible organic matter intake (DOMI) and cell wall digestibility were measured in bulls. Significant genotypic variation was found for chemical, morphological and in vitro fermentation characteristics of stover but their relationship with digestibility and intake measurements was generally poor. While no single chemical, morphological or in vitro measurement described stover quality adequately, some combinations of these measurements resulted in good overall relationships with stover quality measurements. Across sorghum and pearl millet, 71% (P&lt;0.0001) of the variation in stover cell wall digestibility in bulls was accounted by the lag phase of in vitro gas production from cell wall preparations and by acid detergent lignin and acid detergent fiber content of stover. In pearl millet, 98% (P&lt;0.0001) of the variation in \{DOMI\} in bulls was accounted for nitrogen, lag phase and maximum rate of gas production and neutral detergent fiber content. The paper further discusses relationships between indirect animal performance measurements such as digestibility and voluntary feed intake (VFI) and animal productivity, e.g. live weight gain. \{VFI\} is shown to be a more crucial quality assessment in crop residues than digestibility and the relationship between both measurements was shown to be poor. It is argued that crop improvement programs should validate laboratory techniques as well as indirect animal performance measurements with direct animal performance measurements such as milk or meat production before deciding on laboratory selection criteria.

These relationships were investigated in India in 12 genotypes of sorghum and six genotypes of pearl millet grown under high fertilizer (HF) and low fertilizer (LF) application. Fodder quality of stover was assessed by digestibility and intake measurements in bulls. In sorghum, highly significant genotype-dependent variation was found for GY, \{SY\} and fodder value of stover regardless of level of fertilizer application. \{GY\} and fodder quality of stover were not inversely related and the genotype with the highest GY, for example, had also the best fodder quality in the stover. High \{GY\} and high fodder quality in sorghum stover seem to be compatible traits. In pearl millet, genotypic variation in \{GY\} and \{SY\} and quality was expressed under \{HF\} but not under \{LF\} application. No consistent significant genotypic differences were found for fodder quality measurements in pearl millet except for cell wall digestibility. Digestible organic matter intake (DOMI) when bulls were fed to appetite was considered the crucial determinant of stover quality in sorghum and pearl millet. Live weight changes in bulls estimated by \{DOMI\} varied genotype-dependently from −140 to +100 g per day in 300 kg bulls. However, this paper argues that genotypes promoting high \{DOMI\} are only suitable for farmers with sufficient amounts of stover to allow the feeding of animals to appetite. Farmers with restricted amounts of stover are better served by genotypes that promote high digestibility under restricted feed intake. "

We carried out fieldwork in 12 sites in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda to understand changes in farming systems in the recent past, and to test the hypothesis that sedentary farmers in zones that may become warmer and drier in the future may be forced to increase their reliance on livestock vis-à-vis cropping in the future. We estimated the contribution of crop and livestock activities to incomes, food security and poverty. Householders were asked how to adapt farming in the future. We found no direct evidence for the hypothesised extensification of production across study sites. Human diets have changed considerably in the last 40 years, as cropping has been taken up by increasing numbers of pastoral households, even in marginal places. Maize and legumes predominate, but some householders are increasing their crop and diet diversity, particularly in locations with annual rainfall higher than 800 mm. At all sites people want more livestock. Food insecurity is common at all sites with an annual rainfall of 800 mm or less, and critical levels are seen at sites with &lt;700 mm. Households are self-sufficient in securing adequate dietary energy from food production in 7 of the 12 sites, all with rainfall higher than 800 mm. Although many householders have some knowledge about drought-tolerant crops, few cultivate millet, sorghum and cassava. Policies aimed at increasing the consumption of cassava, sorghum, millet and pigeon pea could be highly beneficial for future food security in the region. Vulnerability in the drier locations is already high, and policies should support safety nets and market and infrastructural development. Households in the wetter areas need to manage risk and to increase crop productivity. A critical requirement is knowledge transfer concerning the growing and utilisation of unfamiliar and untraditional crops. "

abstract = "Demographic parameters are useful for assessing productivity and dynamics of tropical livestock populations. Common parameters are the annual instantaneous hazard rates, which can be estimated by m/T (where m represents the number of the considered demographic events occurred during the year and T the cumulated animal-time at risk). Different approaches are encountered in the literature for computing T from on-farm survey data. One crude approach (“the 12-month interval approach”) only uses estimations of herds’ sizes at beginning and end of the year and aggregated counts of demographic events over the year. I evaluated the potential biases in using four 12-month interval methods (M1–M4) to estimate T. Biases were evaluated by comparing the 12-month estimates to gold-standard values of T. Data came from long-term herd monitoring on cattle and small ruminants in extensive agro-pastoral systems. Animal-times at risks were correctly estimated in average by methods M1, \{M2\} and \{M4\} (average relative biases &lt;=6% in absolute values), except for adult-male small ruminants. For young animals, \{M2\} and \{M4\} showed equivalent biases. \{M2\} is simple to implement and has the advantage of being applicable for any age-group, although \{M4\} is only applicable for young animals. \{M3\} was highly biased and I do not recommend it. Although accurate in average, 12-month interval methods showed highly variable biases. This variability results from interactions between the dates delimiting the 12-month interval and the distributions of the demographic events over time. This phenomenon is particularly important for the adult-male small ruminants. Based on the bias variability observed in the study, the user of 12-month interval methods has to remember that they only provide approximate results and that they cannot completely replace the gold-standard approaches.

However, research on the basic realities and the viability status of enterprises within this sector remain largely unproved in many developing countries. This study focuses on the characteristic of smallholder milk producers in The Gambia. Data were collected from 90 smallholder farm households to characterise milk producers and evaluate the profitability and viability status of this activity. Based on current typology of farms and gross margin analyses at farm level, the study identified two resource-based types of smallholder farms. The current milk production system is surely viable. Constraints to increased productivity include lack of improved technology at farm level and weak institutional support. Despite the low viability status, it is shown that milk production generates reliable incomes, which could be a departure for most farmers to intensify farming systems, particularly in areas where no loan schemes exist for purchasing agricultural inputs.

abstract = "Agricultural production in the semi-arid agro-ecosystems of the Sahel centres on cereal staple crops and pastoralism with increasing crop–livestock integration. Animals mobilize soil fertility through manure production, graze crop by-products, and transfer nutrients from distant pastures to cropped areas. Yet in these systems various interacting factors, i.e. climate variability, poor soil fertility, poverty, and institutional constraints limit the capacity of agriculture to keep pace with the growing needs of an increasing human population. The major trends associated with population growth are (1) increasing area cropped at the expense of rangelands; (2) reduced availability of and access to good quality grazing resources, and (3) seasonal migration of labourers and transhumance of herds. These trends lead to co-evolution of farming systems towards increased privatisation of resource use. This study examines the implications of the development processes where farming systems co-evolve with their surroundings. It explores the impact of integrated management of livestock and crops in rural communities on both the livelihoods of differently endowed farms, and on the agro-ecosystem. Different scenarios explored the co-evolution of three sites situated in Western Niger with their environment. The sites differ in relative area cropped. The scenarios simulate the different future outcomes for varying socio-economic and biophysical criteria with either current or more intensive management. Explorative bio-economic models are used to compare a range of farm, livelihood and ecological indicators, and to reveal social and ecological trade-offs. If current agro-ecosystems and their environments co-evolve towards increased privatisation of grazing resources, then soil fertility is likely to deteriorate on the lands managed by the agro-pastoral groups. Soil fertility may improve on lands managed by the livestock-scarce farmers settled in villages, at the cost of declining farm incomes. The agro-pastoral groups are likely to resort to more distant pastures for feed. The village-based, livestock-endowed farms will resort to feeding on on-farm crop residues. Intensification, though associated with relative decreases in real incomes, will enhance food security in these new systems, except for the poorer settled farmers. "

The effect of storage root age on carotenoid content was significant. Twelve weeks after planting, the yield and amount of pro-vitamin A present in roots of orange-fleshed cultivars evaluated were high enough to provide adequate dietary pro-vitamin A and suggest the start of piecemeal harvesting. The effect of farming site on total carotenoids was significant; however, the amount of β-carotene was not different over three testing sites.

In this study, we modeled the response of herbaceous species of grasslands within the Arsi Mountains in Ethiopia under no-migration and with migration scenarios to the projected 4.2 °C increase of temperature by 2090 (under the \{A2\} emission scenario). For 67 species of grasses and legumes, we determined the current and predicted altitudinal limits and calculated current and projected area coverage using a Digital Elevation Model. The results indicated that the projected warming significantly reduced altitudinal ranges and habitat areas of all the species studied. All the studied species faced range contraction and habitat loss with range shift gaps among forty two species under the no-migration scenario. With the migration scenario, however, the forty two species with range shift gaps are predicted to benefit from at least some habitat area retention. Between growth forms, legumes are predicted to lose significantly more habitat area than grasses under the no-migration scenario while no significant difference in habitat area loss is predicted under the migration scenario. It can be concluded that management options are required to facilitate upslope species migration to survive under the warming climate. This could involve leaving suitable dispersal corridors and assisted colonization depending on species behavior and level of extinction risk predicted under the projected warming. "

The present study investigated the trend in variability and association between food and fodder traits in inbred parents and the hybrids derived from them and assessed the general combining ability (GCA) of inbred lines for both food and fodder traits. Sixteen inbred lines and sixty single cross hybrids generated by a 10 × 6 factorial mating design were evaluated for grain and stover yield and a range of laboratory stover fodder quality traits across three environments in Ethiopia. The hybrid and inbred line trials were planted in adjacent blocks in the same fields using an alpha lattice experimental design. Genotypes in both hybrids and inbred trials showed highly significant differences for all the traits studied. Generally, hybrids had higher grain and stover yields and lower stover fodder quality traits than the inbred lines. Both the magnitude and direction of relationship for almost all traits were similar among genotypes in the inbred and hybrid trials. General combining abilities of both lines and testers and specific combining ability (SCA) of line by tester interactions were significant for most traits studied. The highly significant \{GCA\} effects observed for most traits and the greater relative importance of \{GCA\} (lines and testers) as compared to \{SCA\} for grain yield and most stover fodder quality traits suggest the importance of additive gene effects in controlling grain and stover yield as well as stover fodder quality. Important stover fodder quality traits such as digestibility and metabolizable energy were highly heritable (h2 = 0.79–0.81) and the genotypic variations among hybrids in these traits will have implications for productivity of maize stover fed to livestock or for the income of farmers selling maize stover to fodder value chains. Significant positive relationships observed between inbred lines per se and hybrid performances for these fodder quality traits suggest the feasibility of predicting hybrid performance from the performance of the inbred lines.

Using time-series aerial photograph interpretation, social survey methods, and a review of human population trends over five decades, a three-fold expansion in cultivation in the settled areas over a 50-year period, with a consequent decrease in woody vegetation cover was identified. In the Ruma National Park, occupying a third of the valley floor, shrublands and thickets have expanded while open grasslands have decreased. The sudden increase of land under cultivation adjacent to prime agricultural land designated for wildlife conservation, exacerbated by bush encroachment and dwindling resources for tsetse control could provide a situation suitable for land-use conflicts. Sustainability of this unique rangeland is dependent on how judiciously the resources are shared among all stakeholders in the valley.

This paper integrates information from field trials, studying the effect of varying maize planting density, with modelling approaches to compare this with supplementation of maize stover, genetic improvement of stover digestibility and replacement of the maize crop with planted forage in east and southern Africa. Aggregate analyses for small-scale intensive (SSI) systems producing milk were carried out using a suite of models including CERES, CROPGRO, \{DRASTIC\} and ANORAC, scaling-up to regional level using \{GIS\} information. Increasing planting density increased the yield of thinnings, but decreased grain and stover yields. Model predictions of milk production from the thinnings and stover produced from one hectare of maize indicated that economic benefits to increased planting density could be achieved when the grain:milk price ratio was low, despite the negative effect on grain yield. Supplementation showed the greatest economic returns with small positive impacts on soil fertility and maize production. Replacing maize with planted forage inevitably increased milk at the expense of maize production. Again, for this intervention, grain:milk price ratios ranging from 0.19 to 2.88 across sub-Saharan Africa are likely to influence the decision of the farmer whether or not to trade milk for grain. Genetic enhancement of the digestibility of maize stover was found to have little impact on milk production because diets based on stover were deficient in nitrogen, preventing animals from benefiting from the increased energy supply resulting from digestibility increases. Other factors such as market access and stability, as well as individual objectives such as cash flow, food security and risk minimisation, were not explored in the present study but will influence household decisions. More complex analyses, accounting for these factors, may be required to predict adoption behaviour, however, the results of the study can be used to evaluate the potential returns to investment in research in the different areas using an economic surplus model.

The animals were then treated intramuscularly with homidium bromide at a dose rate of 1.0 mg kg−1 bodyweight 7 days after trypanosomes were detected in the peripheral blood of all the five animals in each group. Following treatment of cattle infected with drug-sensitive trypanosomes, parasites could no longer be detected in the bloodstream of four out of five cattle after 24 h, and after 48 h for the fifth animal. The animals remained aparasitaemic up to the end of the observation period of 90 days and serum drug concentrations determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) remained above the detection limit of 0.1 ng ml−1 for the entire period. Following treatment of cattle infected with drug-resistant trypanosomes, parasites did not disappear from the bloodstream in any of the five animals. The rate of drug elimination was greater in cattle infected with drug-resistant trypanosomes and the drug was no longer detectable approximately 3 weeks after treatment. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the values for t12β of 75.5±16.9 h, the area under the curve (AUC0−∞) of 1.33±0.156 μg h ml−1 and the MRT0−∞ of 32.8±4.45 h obtained in cattle infected with the drug-resistant trypanosome population were significantly lower than the values of 424±146 h for t12β, 1.67±0.233 μg h ml−1 for AUC0−∞ and 297±159 h for MRT0−∞ obtained in cattle infected with the drug-sensitive population. The persistence of drug-resistant infections in cattle following homidium treatment was associated with more rapid drug elimination than in those in which infections with drug-sensitive parasites were cleared by the drug.

Twenty-four intact steers weighing 259 kg (SD=62) were randomly allotted to four treatments to study the effect of the combination of grazing method (tethering and close herding) and grazing duration (6 and 9 h per day) on diet selection, faecal output, forage intake, grazing behaviour and weight changes in the wet season. Three esophageally fistulated steers were used in a cross-over design to sample diet selected by tethered and herded animals. Extrusa samples from esophageally fistulated steers and faecal output from intact steers were collected in weeks 6 and 9 of the experiment and grazing behaviour of the intact steers was observed in week 6. Tethered animals selected diets of lower organic matter digestibility (OMD) but tethering had no significant effect on crude protein. Close herded steers consistently consumed more forage than those tethered in both periods. Both grazing method and duration had significant effect on ingestion rate by the steers. Tethered steers had lower average daily gain than those herded. The results demonstrate that the common practice of tethering sedentary cattle in the wet season in the southern Sahel in West Africa reduces forage intake and consequently average daily gain. "

These six double backcross resource families are being used to identify quantitative trait loci controlling resistance to gastro-intestinal (GI) nematode parasites (particularly Haemonchus contortus). This paper reports the phenotypic performance of the double backcross progeny relative to the performance of straight bred Red Maasai (158 born) and Dorper (131 born) lambs evaluated at pasture from birth to 6 months of age. Resistance to \{GI\} nematode parasites was assessed in terms of faecal egg counts (FEC), while resilience (tolerance) was assessed in terms of blood packed red cell volume (PCV). The R and 3/4 R lambs were consistently more resistant (lower FEC) and resilient (higher PCV) than the D and 3/4 D lambs and these differences were significant for lambs from 3 to 6 months of age. The difference between the backcrosses for both \{FEC\} and \{PCV\} was about a half of the difference between the straightbred R and D lambs indicating additive gene action. The D lambs were consistently significantly heavier than the R lambs at all sampling times from birth to 6 months with the difference increasing from a 52% advantage at birth (3.72 versus 2.44 kg, respectively) to a 86% advantage for 6-month-old lambs (23.1 versus 12.4 kg, respectively). The 3/4 D lambs were also significantly heavier than the 3/4 R at all sampling times and this difference was about a half that between the D and R lambs (5.1 ± 0.2 versus 10.7 ± 0.5 kg, respectively for 6-month-old lambs). For pre-weaning mortality there was a significant (P &lt; 0.05) breed by birth type interaction due to significantly higher mortality rates in D and 3/4 D lambs than in R and 3/4 R in multiple-born lambs, but no significant breed effect for single-born lambs. There was a significant (P &lt; 0.05) breed effect for post-weaning mortality (3.5–6 months of age) with the D lambs (15.0%) and 3/4 D lambs (7.3%) having higher mortality rates than the 3/4 R and R lambs (0.8 and 1.4%, respectively). Mortality was attributed mainly to starvation/miss-mothering followed by pneumonia during the pre-weaning period and to haemonchosis and pneumonia from weaning to 6 months of age. "

Ten non-conventional feed types commonly used by urban and peri-urban livestock farmers were obtained from the farming system and evaluated in vitro following standard procedures. Following in vitro studies, five non-conventional feed types were selected for in vivo studies based on the in vitro result, availability, and wide use by farmers. Thirty indigenous rams weighing 22.6±0.97 (mean±SD) kg initially were stratified into weight groups and assigned randomly to treatments. Treatments included Tela atella (traditional brewery residue), Katicala atella (traditional liquor residue), lentil (Lens culinaris) hull, rough pea (Lathyrus sativa) hull, and field peas (Pisum sativum) hull based on the basal diet of native grass hay (control). In vitro study indicated that Tela and K. atella had higher organic matter (97–98%), crude protein (CP) (21%), and gross energy (GE) (21–22 MJ/kg DM) and lower fiber fractions (neutral detergent fiber, NDF=41–60%; acid detergent fiber, ADF=11–21%). Pulse hulls (lentil, rough pea and field pea hulls) had medium to high \{CP\} (8–16%), lower \{GE\} (17–19.5 MJ/kg DM), and higher fiber fractions (NDF=49–71%; ADF=49–62%). Among the pulse hulls considered, lentil hull had the highest \{CP\} (16%), and lowest \{NDF\} (49.4%) and \{ADF\} (48.6%). Poultry litter and orange peel had the highest \{CP\} (30%) and \{GE\} (28 MJ/kg DM), respectively. Results of the in vivo study indicated that both atella and pulse hulls improved total dry matter, organic matter, nitrogen, energy and \{NDF\} intakes. The improvement was higher for atella compared to pulse hull groups. Basal diet intake was reduced when pulse hulls were fed. T. atella, K. atella and lentil hull had higher nitrogen and energy digestibility compared to pulse hulls and the control. Supplementation improved nitrogen retention, with T. atella, K. atella and lentil hull. Therefore, given the increasing competition with monogastric animals and increasing price of conventional by-products coupled with the deteriorating quality of tropical forages, T. atella, K. atella, and lentil hull have potentials to be used as a protein and energy (except lentil hull) supplements on low quality based diet under small holder livestock production systems. Further research is warranted to lower the concentration of tannins and fiber in pulse hulls and improve the feeding system to enhance the utilization of atella. "

Traditionally, the disease has been controlled by the use of chemical acaricides to control the vector tick. The University of Florida/USAID-supported heartwater research project (based in Zimbabwe) is developing a new inactivated vaccine to control the disease. In order that the vaccine is used effectively, the project has been studying the epidemiology of the disease in different livestock production systems of Zimbabwe, and evaluating the economic impact of the disease and of its future control using a vaccine such as the one under development. Initially, field studies were conducted to characterise the communal and commercial livestock-productions systems at risk from heartwater and to understand the epidemiology of the disease. The data from these studies were then applied to an infection-dynamics model of heartwater, which was used to provide estimates of disease incidence and impact under various scenarios over a period of 10 yr. Two principal outputs of the epidemiological model (cumulative annual heartwater incidence and infection-fatality proportion) were key inputs into an economics model. The estimated total annual national losses amount to Z$ 61.3 million (US$ 5.6 million) in discounted value terms over 10 yr. Annual economic losses per animal in the commercial production system (Z$ 56 discounted values) are 25 times greater than the losses in the communal system (Z$ 2.2). The greatest component of economic loss is acaricide cost (76%), followed by milk loss (18%) and treatment cost (5%). Losses in outputs other than milk (beef, traction and manure) appear to be minimal. A new vaccine has the promise of a benefit : cost ratio of about 2.4 : 1 in the communal and 7.6 : 1 in the commercial system. A control strategy based on a new vaccine would yield additional non-financial benefits to farmers and the government resulting from reductions in the use of chemical acaricides. "

Informal and formal study tools of focused group discussion, key informant interview, household survey and rapid market appraisal were employed to gather information from development partners, smallholder farmers, traders, transporters and consumers. Smallholder farmers sale sheep and goats to fulfill immediate household cash needs, particularly to acquire food items. Smallholder producers, small and large traders, brokers, transporters and consumers are the major market participant across the market channels. Mode of marketing is mainly on ‘eye-ball’ basis with one-on-one price negotiation. Farmers market animals of different age, sex and weight either at farm gate or local markets, while a range of traders are involved at various stages of markets until the animals reach final consumers. Supply, demand and price of animals have clear seasonal variations. Abuse by brokers, lack of price information, access to incentive markets, poor market infrastructure and seasonality of markets are the major challenges in improving benefit and livelihood of smallholder sheep and goat producers. Commercialization of smallholder systems, standardizing marketing with marketing information and infrastructures, integrated intervention of the market channels along the value chains and market actors, formation of marketing groups and co-operatives could improve marketing efficacy and profitability of smallholder sheep and goat system.

We also assess their potential to increase food production and reduce the \{GHG\} emission intensity of their products, as a result of closing these yield gaps. We use stochastic frontier analysis to construct separate production frontiers for each site, based on 2012 survey data prepared by the International Livestock Research Institute for the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security program. Instead of relying on theoretically optimal yields—a common approach in yield gap assessments—our yield gaps are based on observed differences in technical efficiency among farms within each site. Sizeable yield gaps were estimated to be present in all of the sites. Expressed as potential percentage increases in outputs, the average site-based yield gaps ranged from 28 to 167% for livestock products and from 16 to 209% for crop products. The emission intensities of both livestock and crop products registered substantial falls as a consequence of closing yield gaps. The relationships between farm attributes and technical efficiency were also assessed to help inform policy makers about where best to target capacity building efforts. We found a strong and statistically significant relationship between market participation and performance across most sites. We also identified an efficiency dividend associated with the closer integration of crop and livestock enterprises. Overall, this study reveals that there are large yield gaps and that substantial benefits for food production and environmental performance are possible through closing these gaps, without the need for new technology.

Direct losses due to disease were investigated through lowered prices as a result of the emergency sale of disease-infected animals. Overall, Maasai in Isinya Division perceived east coast fever (ECF) to be the most important cattle disease and to have the highest incidence. Anthrax was considered to have the largest impact. In areas within or adjacent to the wildebeest calving zone, \{MCF\} was perceived to be the most important cattle disease and also to have the largest impact. Outside the calving zone, \{MCF\} was considered the fourth-most important disease with the fourth largest impact, and these were areas where wildebeest were less common. \{MCF\} was also the fourth-most common disease, and across the Division incidence was estimated at 5% in calves and 10% in adults. However, \{MCF\} incidence varied greatly throughout the study area, from 3% to 12%, and the highest incidence risks were found in areas where wildebeest came to calve. The percent drop in sale price per animal infected with \{MCF\} was estimated at 50% for \{MCF\} for the year 2003–2004. Forced avoidance movements away from wildebeest calves were reported to decrease livestock production due to loss of access to prime grazing sites. As suggested by pastoralists in this study, the development of compensation schemes or incentives from wildlife would reduce the conflict between livestock keeping and wildlife conservation. "

Cattle were fed a range of diets to investigate the effects on partitioning of nitrogen between urine and faeces and on the chemical composition of the manures produced. The trade-offs in efficiency between using the feed resources as a direct soil amendment for crop production compared with feeding to livestock and use of the manure as a fertiliser are discussed. Increased dry matter (DM) and nitrogen intake of a poor quality basal diet (barley straw) was achieved by supplementation with 15 and 30% of \{DM\} offered as Calliandra calothyrsus, Macrotyloma axillare or poultry manure. Urinary-N excretion for the basal diet (0.5 mg kg−1 liveweight (W) per day) was similar to C. calothyrsus at 15 and 30% supplementation (1.3 and 0.8 mg kg−1 W per day, respectively) and M. axillare at 15 and 30% supplementation (0.4 and 0.6 mg kg−1 W per day, respectively). In contrast, feeding poultry manure, a supplement containing highly degradable N, resulted in larger excretions of excess rumen ammonia as N in the urine, 17.5 and 23.2 mg kg−1 W per day for 15 and 30% supplementation, respectively. Diets containing the largest rate of C. calothyrsus supplementation had the lowest digestibility of N in the acid detergent fibre (ADF) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) fractions. This was reflected in faeces from cattle fed diets supplemented with C. calothyrsus, which had substantially greater amounts of N bound to fibre (ADF and NDF) fractions than faeces from the other diets. When incubated in leaching tubes prunings of C. calothyrsus showed net N mineralisation from week 2, whereas barley straw, M. axillare and poultry manure immobilised N for &gt;28, 24 and &gt;28 weeks, respectively. Faeces derived from supplementation with C. calothyrsus and M. axillare resulted in shorter nitrogen immobilisation in leaching tubes (16 weeks) than supplementation with poultry manure (24 weeks) when compared with faeces derived from animals fed straw only (28 weeks). Similarly, reduced N uptake from 10-week-old maize plants was observed in pots to which faeces had been added compared with the control treatment. A second crop of maize had increased N uptake. Feeding poor quality crop residues like barley straw to animals produces manures with a decreased capacity to immobilise mineral N in the soil. This was shown with faeces derived from feeding ruminants a diet of only barley straw, which had a faster N mineralisation rate than fresh barley straw, a shorter and smaller N immobilisation stage in leaching tubes and gave greater N uptake in maize grown in pots. These results indicate that N losses in urine from livestock may be less important than previously thought. Most of the N is excreted in the faeces, which must be conserved and managed to maximise nutrient cycling. "

Individual and maternal additive genetic effects for A and S were not significant (P &gt; 0.05) for any of the traits. Similarly, the individual heterotic effect of Bos taurus-B. indicus heterozygosity was not significant (P &gt; 0.05) for calf performance. A small effect of \{AS\} individual heterosis on preweaning average daily gain (DG) was found. It was estimated that \{F1\} \{AS\} calves gained 26 g/day faster (P &lt; 0.1) than the mean of the purebred A and S. The maternal heterotic effect of B. taurus-B. indicus heterozygosity for birth weight (BW) was −3.19 ± 1.25 kg (P &lt; 0.05) and of opposite sign to estimates reported in the literature. The absence of any major variation among calf genetic groups showed that the individual and maternal breed and heterotic effects of the sire breeds and dam genotypes summed to give very similar aggregate preweaning performance for all traits except BW. Therefore no emphasis should be given to preweaning performance when selecting among these breeds and mating systems. Instead, breeding decisions aiming to increase herd productivity will be determined by relative lactation and reproductive performances of cows. "

A number of medicinal plants, that may provide possible alternatives, and are used by pastoralists and smallholder farmers in Kenya as deworming agents for their livestock and equines, namely Aframomum sanguineum, Dodonea angustifolia, Hildebrandtia sepalosa, Myrsine africana, Rapanea melanophloeos from Kenya, and Azadirachta indica from Kenya and Malaysia, together with the chemicals embelin and santonin that occur in some of these plants, were evaluated against Heligmosomoides polygyrus in mice. Commercial anthelmintics, namely ivermectin, pyrantel and piperazine, were also investigated, both to validate the mouse model system and to assess efficacy of these drugs against H. polygyrus. Pyrantel and ivermectin were highly effective in reducing the numbers of H. polygyrus worms as well as eggs in faeces of the mice, but piperazine had a lower activity. Application of santonin and M. africana significantly reduced the number of total worm counts (TWC) but not faecal egg counts (FEC). The use of embelin, R. melanophloeos and A. indica reduced \{FEC\} but not TWC. In all cases, however, reductions were well below the a priori level of 70% required for biological significance. A. sanguineum, D. angustifolia and H. sepalosa had no effect on either \{TWC\} or FEC.

Significant reductions in faecal egg counts were observed in lambs treated with A. anthelmintica in two of the three experiments undertaken, but the efficacy levels achieved were well below the 70% reduction required.

In vivo estimates were based on renal allantoin excretion in steers and in vitro estimates were based on a combination of gas volume and true substrate degradability (TSDOM) measures conducted at substrate-specific times. After an initial test to evaluate 96 h gas production profiles of diets incubated in both N-low and N-rich media, the time to half maximal gas production (t1/2) was calculated and a second incubation conducted in both media with fermentation stopped at t1/2 for each substrate. True substrate degradability was measured from incubation residues and combined with gas volumes to estimate EMP. Additionally, microbial N (MN) production estimates were made using two equations from information on dietary N, N content of residues and NH3–N content of media before and after incubation. In vitro estimates of \{EMP\} were related to in vivo \{EMP\} in both N-low (R2 = 0.94, P=0.03) and N-rich (R2 = 0.91, P=0.04) incubation media. No relationships occurred between in vitro efficiency of microbial N production and in vivo \{EMP\} when microbial N production was calculated from direct N determinations using N content of the apparently degraded residue after centrifugation and \{NDFN\} of the incubation residue. When in vitro microbial N production was estimated indirectly by accounting for dietary N, changes in NH3–N concentrations in the incubation medium and \{NDFN\} in the incubation residue, efficiency of microbial N production relative to 100 mg \{TSDOM\} tended (R2 = 0.83, P=0.09) to be positively related to in vivo EMP. Silage fermentation acids appeared to interfere with relationships between gas production and in vitro substrate degradability measures because they were removed from the incubation residue without having contributed to fermentation. Therefore, silage acids should be accounted for when using combined in vitro gas production and true substrate degradability estimates to evaluate \{EMP\} of silage-based diets. N supplementation of incubation medium can influence substrate use for microbial growth, and attempts should be made to simulate in vivo N availability. It may be possible to rank silage-based diets for microbial efficiency using combined gas volume and true substrate degradability measures conducted at substrate-specific times (t1/2). "

Mixed cultures of the samples were screened for their tannin-hydrolysing capacities by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Twelve bacterial isolates with the ability to hydrolyse tannin were characterized morphologically, physiologically and by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the 16S rRNA genes of the isolates. Isolate Eden Ephraim 9 (EE9) completely degraded tannic acid, gallic acid and chestnut tannin. The other isolates could hydrolyse tannin to pyrogallol. Characterization of \{EE9\} shows that the isolate is different from previously isolated tannin-tolerant bacteria. The bacteria isolated from some Ethiopian ruminants could partially or completely hydrolyse tannins and \{EE9\} is possibly a new isolate, which may warrant further taxonomic studies. This study has shown the presence of bacteria in faecal materials of ruminants that can completely degrade tannin and which may be used to alleviate tannin toxicity problems in ruminants feeding on tannin-rich but nutritious fodder tree leaves.

Diets were formulated to be isocaloric but with varying protein and/or nitrogen sources. At the start of the study, 152 lambs (103 Menz and 49 Horro) were assigned to the 12 treatment combinations each in a separate pen, with an average of about 13 animals per pen. Challenge with endoparasites involved three infection periods each separated by an anthelmintic treatment. The first two infections were with Haemonchus contortus while the third infection was with a mixed infection of H. contortus, Longistrongylus elongata and Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Infected lambs had lower total DMI, \{EFU\} (not significant in third infection), \{AD\} (significant only in third infection) and total \{PPC\} and \{AC\} than noninfected lambs. Horro lambs had higher \{DMI\} and \{EFU\} but lower \{AD\} than Menz lambs. \{PPC\} was significantly higher in lambs supplemented with \{CSC\} compared to those on the basal diet or supplemented with \{MUB\} in the primary and secondary infections; but during the tertiary infection, no significant differences were found. \{AC\} was significantly greater in CSC-supplemented lambs than those on the basal diet or supplemented with MUB. It was concluded that subclinical nematode infection had an adverse effect on feed intake, efficiency of feed utilisation and apparent digestibility. Infection was also found to cause hypoproteinaemia and hypoalbuminaemia.

Addressing adaptation in the context of small-scale, semi-subsistence agriculture raises special challenges. High data demands including site-specific bio-physical and economic data are an important constraint. This paper applies a new approach to impact assessment, the Tradeoff Analysis model for Multi-Dimensional Impact Assessment (TOA-MD), which simulates technology adoption and associated economic, environmental and social outcomes in a heterogeneous farm population for a regional impact assessment. The methodology uses the kinds of survey, experimental and modeled data that are typically available in countries where semi-subsistence systems are important, combined with future socio-economic scenarios based on new scenario pathway concepts being developed by the climate change and impact assessment modeling communities. Characteristics of current and future agricultural systems, including land use, output, output price, cost of production, and farm and household size are analyzed and compared for both current and projected future climate (2030), with and without adaptation, and for different socio-economic scenarios. The methodology is applied to two study areas in Kenya. These case studies show the potential of this approach to provide a flexible, generic framework that can use available and modeled data to evaluate climate impact and adaptation strategies under a range of socio-economic scenarios.

In this study, we test the impacts of different interventions in two contrasting mixed farms in Northern Burkina Faso against the background of plausible current and future climate scenarios. For this purpose, we developed a dynamic farm-household modeling framework around existing tools: crop and animal production models \{APSIM\} and LivSim, the household model \{IAT\} and the climate generator Marksim. The two farms (a small and a larger) were selected and parameterized based on information collected in a household survey. Tested interventions included different crop fertilization and animal supplementation levels, mulching with crop residues and an alternative livestock feeding strategy. Baseline (2013) and a 2050 projection based on \{IPCC\} \{RCP\} 8.5 describe two climate scenarios (90 years) for comparison. The maximum level of inputs increases farm energy production by + 90% and + 76% compared to the baseline for the small and the larger farm, respectively. Input levels maximizing net incomes are moderate, though higher than those currently used in both farms. The inter-annual distributions of net income show that the use of external inputs increases both upside and downside risks, i.e. the probability of getting both very high and very low results. This is because the interventions are more effective at increasing the highest yields in good years than at preventing the low production levels of some years. The 2050 climate scenario has a negative impact on energy production and potential income, especially for the scenarios with high input levels. Downside risks could partly explain why farmers do not currently use optimal input levels, and the results suggest that these constraints could intensify with climate change. "

The only dispersed repetitive sequences identified to date are minisatellites, but these are found on a subset of SfiI fragments. There are clusters of distinct multicopy sequences which contain ORFs. However, the majority of parasite protein coding genes are present in a single copy. They have a compact structure, exhibit a bias in codon usage and non-translated regions are small. Introns, if present, are unusually short. Overall, the genome contains remarkably little repetitive, non-coding DNA.

An important research and development goal is the systematic evaluation of breeds in production systems where they arc typically found, quantitative assessment of the genetic diversity they possess, the definition of relationships amongst breeds and the implementation of programmes for their effective management, including development of policies and strategies for conservation and sustainable utilisation. The key issues of threats to livestock genetic resources, justification for conservation, conservation strategies, priority-setting for conservation are summarised. The potential contribution of economic valuation in ensuring equitable sharing of benefits derived from domestic animal genetic resources (AnGR) is also discussed.

An assessment of the role of livestock in mixed farming systems in 14 countries has identified priority systems, technical constraints and weaknesses in the national organisations. Future research needs to focus on the rain-fed production systems, where most of the livestock are found. There is an overriding need for a farming systems perspective to the research agendas that involves inter-disciplinarity and community-based participation. Such an approach will be more complex, require concentrated effort and more efficient resource use, but will be associated with considerable benefits due to a greater integration of effort. "

The concluding paper provides some considered predictions on the future for crop-animal systems in Asia, as a consequence of this trend. Although meat and eggs from non-ruminants in industrial systems will continue to be the main source of animal proteins, it is unlikely that these systems will meet all of the projected demands. The consumption of ruminant meat and milk is increasing in most of Asia, and 95% of ruminants are found in the mixed farming systems. Whilst involution of mixed farming systems is one possible scenario, particularly in the highly populated tropical highlands, it is the opinion of the authors that crop-animal systems will see important growth and remain the dominant system in Asia. Mixed farming systems will continue to be the main avenue for intensification of food production, with some specialisation in crop or animal activities. In addition to providing products such as meat, milk and eggs, domestic animals will continue to enhance the natural resources base. Nevertheless, there are some environmental concerns related to land quality, in terms of erosion and soil fertility, and animal biodiversity. "

The reduction in severe East Coast fever was similar to that observed in laboratory experiments with p67635 and p67C. The p67 coding sequence from thirteen T. parva field isolates including seven from vaccinated cattle that were not protected, was 100% identical to the gene on which the recombinant vaccine is based, suggesting a predominantly homologous p67 antigenic challenge.

Serological analysis of antibody prevalence has also become more straightforward as a result of the availability of recombinant pathogen proteins. However, greatest advances arising from biotechnological development relate to the detection and characterisation of pathogens in infected hosts. Probably the most significant development in this regard, which impacts both vaccine and diagnostic development, is the polymerase chain reaction.

The curvilinear model is appropriate for trend analysis, a major manifestation of which is persistency. Data fitted to the model were obtained from a total of 194 lactations of 169 cows in 5 mixed-breed herds under conditions varying from a small holding herd in the tropics to research herds in Italy. A negative association between persistency and total lactation yield was observed. The proposed lactation persistency model could result in more accurate estimates and better insight into this trait.

While most poverty analyses focus on the household, we employ quantitative spatial data analysis methods to examine the spatial correlates of meso-, or community-level poverty incidence. The results suggest that variables influencing poverty levels in this district include pasture potential, livestock density, distance to a major town, road density, access to education, access to security, soil fertility and agricultural potential. Because of the participatory research process taken, these results are already feeding into both local- and national-level policy processes aimed at reducing poverty in Kenya. "

A comparison of the amino acids deduced from the nucleotide sequences of the four \{VSGs\} and those of other \{VSGs\} published previously reveals a strong conservation of several structural domains, particularly cysteine residues located throughout most of the molecules. The majority ofT. congolenseVSGs analyzed in this study resemble most the N-terminal cysteine residue domain type B ofT. brucei,characterized by a cysteine residue located toward the N-terminal end, a cluster of cysteine residues in the central region, and at least three cysteine residues between positions 250 and 300 of the molecules. One of the \{VSGs\} analyzed, ILNat3.3, did not fit into any of the classification schemes proposed for the \{VSGs\} so far studied, and thus may represent a different class of these surface molecules. Unlike \{VSGs\} ofT. brucei,theT. congolenseVSGs have no cysteine residues at the carboxy-terminal end.

Young calves were also reported to be more resistant to trypanosomiasis than adult cattle. To explore the basis for this resistance, the erythropoietic response was evaluated in four naive yearling N'Dama calves and four age-matched Boran calves which developed anemia over a 140-day primary infection withTrypanosoma congolenseclone \{IL\} 13E3. Similar levels of parasites were detected in the two breeds until 42 days postinfection (dpi). During the same period, a rapid and greater colony-forming units-erythroid response in the bone marrow of yearling Boran calves, compared with N'Dama calves, may explain the unusual absence of breed differences in mean packed cell volumes (PCV). However, this early erythropoietic response was transient and did not result in any rise in \{PCV\} in the Boran calves. Moreover, despite the persistent severe anemia, the erythroid response subsided from 70 dpi onward. In contrast, in the N'Dama calves, following the erythroid response, the mean \{PCV\} was gradually compensated from 56 dpi onward and reached 30% by 126 dpi. This period of \{PCV\} recovery coincided with low and intermittent parasitemia and a return of the erythroid progenitor levels to near preinfection values. Elevated levels of erythroid progenitors in the N'Dama calves, occurring 1 week after trypanocidal treatment, returned the \{PCV\} to preinfection values. These results suggest that the age of theBos indicuscattle has an important impact on the early bone marrow response in primaryT. congolenseinfection and confirmed previous suggestions of a high erythropoietic potential in trypanosome-infected young calves.

Statistical significance of the error-correction terms for cocoa and coffee validates the existence of an equilibrium relationship among the variables in each of these co-integrating vectors.

This has significant policy implications for the countries in the region in terms of self-sufficiency goals in these commodities and the associated inter- and intra-regional trade opportunities in the future. Forecasts of ruminant meat, non-ruminant meat and milk production and consumption for selected Asian countries between the years 2000 and 2010 revealed the following: China, Pakistan and Viet Nam are likely to be self-sufficient with respect to ruminant meat; Malaysia is likely to continue to be a net importer of ruminant meat; India and Malaysia will be more than self-sufficient with respect to non-ruminant meat with the converse being true for Pakistan; and India, Laos and Pakistan will be self-sufficient with respect to milk production with the possibility of Indonesia, Thailand and Cambodia becoming self-sufficient if the current trends continue. Structural changes in the early 1980s generally resulted in higher average annual growth rates of production—particularly in non-ruminant meat production. Thus forecasts of ruminant meat production and consumption by 2000 using the medium-term average annual growth rates for production present a more favourable outcome in terms of self-sufficiency for countries such as Bangladesh, the Philippines and Viet Nam but a less favourable outcome for countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Laos and India. Similar forecasts for non-ruminant meat indicated an improvement in the long-term non-ruminant self-sufficiency estimates for most cases—particularly for Bangladesh, China and Cambodia. Intensification and commercialisation of meat production systems have increased meat self-sufficiency in a number of countries but often at the expense of grain self-sufficiency. Given these trends, the impact of trade liberalisation measures on livestock production in the region and inter- and intra-regional trade of livestock commodities and grain is likely to be significant.

The total amount of stover refused (DMR) by the sheep did not differ significantly (P = 0.67) among the stovers, however when \{DMR\} was expressed relative to \{DMI\} significant differences (P = 0.0007) were observed. Laboratory fodder quality traits most closely correlated to the in vivo measurements were \{ADF\} with r = −0.83, r = −0.92 and r = −0.93 for DMD, \{DMI\} and DDMI, respectively, and \{ME\} with r = 0.77, r = 0.94 and r = 0.94 for DMD, \{DMI\} and DDMI, respectively. Applying statistical cross-validation procedures where the predicted values were not used for the development of the regression equations (“blind-predictions”), DMD, \{DMI\} and \{DDMI\} could be predicted by \{ADF\} with resulting \{R2\} for good-of-fitness between observed and predicted values of 0.46, 0.76 and 0.79, respectively. Similarly DMD, \{DMI\} and \{DDMI\} could be predicted by \{ME\} with resulting \{R2\} for good-of-fitness between observed and predicted values of 0.40, 0.83 and 0.83, respectively. "

This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first investigation on sheep traders by the use of Best-Worst technique. A face-to-face questionnaire was undertaken in three livestock markets (Kiserian, Bissil and Mile 46) involving 108 traders. The results indicated that sheep traders are also involved in other types of animal trading, essentially cattle and goats. Income from sheep trading represents slightly less of the half of total incomes, with some differences between livestock traders’ groups (markets). Traders are generally involved in other business activities among the value chain essentially such as livestock production, fattening and slaughtering. Four attributes with different levels have been utilized to describe the Best-Worst experiment: sheep age, sex, breed and price. All sheep traders assign higher importance to the sheep breed. This is essentially the case of Dorper pure breed and Dorper x Red Maasai cross breed. Price attribute was the second most important factor for sheep traders with higher preferences for the two extreme price levels. Sheep age and sex were found of least importance for traders. Providing sheep smallholders with the appropriate animal breed characteristics will enable them match market demand and increase their incomes.

The approach, applicable to many livestock production constraints and technologies, uses geographic information systems (GIS) to spatially link a biophysical herd simulation model with an economic surplus model. The particular problem examined is trypanosomosis in cattle in Africa, and the potential research product is a multi-component vaccine. The results indicate that the potential benefits of improved trypanosomosis control, in terms of meat and milk productivity alone, are $700 million per year in Africa. The disease now costs livestock producers and consumers an estimated $1340 million annually, without including indirect livestock benefits such as manure and traction. Given an adoption period of 12 years, a maximum adoption rate of 30%, a discount rate of 5%, and a 30% probability of the research being successful within 10 years, the net present value of the vaccine research is estimated to be at least $288 million, with an internal rate of return of 33%, and a benefit/cost ratio of 34:1. © "

Adverse reactions were avoided by injecting small quantities of antibody, until target cells had disappeared from blood. Two different mechanisms appeared to be responsible for elimination of the target cells. Rapid depletion of T cells was associated with complement-binding antibody isotypes (IgG2a, IgM), suggesting a complement-mediated mechanism. Clearance of T cells after several days was observed with a non complement-binding isotype (IgG1), suggesting phagocytosis or induction of apoptosis as possible mechanisms. Clearance of the cells in peripheral blood and spleen was obtained with 10–20 mg of anti-CD4 or anti-CD8, but almost ten times as much was needed to obtain depletion of the cells in lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. Depletion lasted for 12 days for \{CD4\} T cells and 3 weeks for \{CD8\} T cells. Successful and lasting depletion (at least 2 weeks) was also obtained with other T cell reagents, such as anti-CD2 and anti-WC1 (γ/δ T cells). Although B lymphocytes could be removed by a complement-binding antibody, complete depletion of these cells only lasted for a few hours, probably because B cells regenerate faster than T cells. T cell function was severely inhibited when CD4+ T cells were depleted. Stimulation of T cells with foot and mouth disease viral antigen (FMDV) in vaccinated calves was non-existent after depletion. Even 2 months after restoration of normal CD4+ T cell levels in blood, activity to \{FMDV\} was low. This suggested that the depleted T cells were replaced by naive cells. "

Accuracy of selection was defined as the correlation between the breeding objective and various selection indices. Accuracy was evaluated assuming availability of information on a range of traits (those in objective plus scrotal circumference) from individuals, parents, grand-parents, half-sibs, progeny and genetic markers. Various scenarios that represent what could occur at the village level were tested. Just selecting on weight alone had an accuracy of 0.538. Additional measurements on the individual (including repeated measures) had a large effect on accuracy. Records on relatives were less helpful than expected. Genetic markers for traits which are difficult to measure (days to calving and trypanotolerance) were helpful for improving accuracy. However, they are unlikely to be used in the near future because of cost and availability. An additional output from this study is simple selection indices that could be implemented immediately at the village level. "

Current methods of control are inadequate to prevent the enormous annual socio-economic losses resulting from this disease. Hope for a vaccine based on the variant surface glycoprotein coat was abandoned several years ago when the complexity of the parasite's antigenic repertoire was appreciated. As a result, research is now focused on identifying invariant trypanosome components as potential targets for interrupting infection or infection-mediated disease. The identification of immune mechanisms involved in parasite and disease control, or conversely those responses that are associated with a poor clinical outcome, should facilitate the search for vaccine candidates and subsequent vaccine design strategies. To this end, comparative studies on the immune responses of trypanotolerant and trypanosusceptible breeds of cattle can be exploited. These studies have revealed that trypanotolerant and trypanosusceptible breeds of cattle have distinct antibody responses. Trypanosusceptible cattle produce high titres of polyspecific IgM but fail to produce IgG to specific trypanosome antigens. In contrast, although T cell and macrophage/monocyte responses of infected cattle are depressed, significant differences have not been described between tolerant and susceptible breeds of cattle. In this review, isotype-dependent effector mechanisms, such as complement activation, binding to Fc receptors, activation of phagocytic cells, neutralisation of parasite components, clearance of immune complexes and autoimmune responses, are discussed in the context of their potential impact on either susceptibility or tolerance of cattle to trypanosomosis. In addition, the links between specific cytokine patterns, macrophage/monocyte activation and depressed T cell responses that occur during trypanosome infection are presented. The identification of mechanisms that mediate depressed immune responses might suggest novel disease intervention strategies. "

Rapid urban appraisals were combined with conventional interviews to identify and quantify formal and informal milk value chains and to collect information on consumers' food preparation and consumption behavior. Milk was sampled in 170 dairy farms and 5 milk collection centers and microbiological tests were conducted. Published data on milk fermentation in Ethiopia was combined with a growth model of Staphylococcus aureus to develop a stochastic risk model. The annual incidence rate of staphylococcal poisoning was estimated to be 20.0 (90% CI: 13.9–26.9) per 1000 people. When the effect of fermentation was removed from the model, the annual incidence rate increased to 315.8 (90% CI: 224.3–422.9) per 1000 people, showing the importance of traditional food preparation methods in risk mitigation; traditional milk fermentation reduced the risk by 93.7%. Improving the safety of milk and dairy products could be achieved through supporting appropriate traditional food preparation and consumption where an industrial risk mitigation system is not feasible.

Analysis of smallholder Eucalyptus globulus Labill. production reveals that converting uneroded over eroded croplands leads to significantly higher financial returns. Returns were also significantly higher for rotation intervals closer to the optimal economic rotation and for higher planting densities. Most woodlots had positive financial returns. The presence of negative financial returns for some households demonstrates that positive ecological externalities, a lack of economies of scale and/or myopic behavior are potentially important factors in land use decision-making. Wood utilization decisions were shown to impact the potential financial returns of households. Smallholders’ activities demonstrate that eucalyptus is an imperfect substitute for agricultural production on surplus cropland. A third of respondents indicated they had intentionally chosen to convert uneroded croplands to achieve higher returns. Smallholders faced constraints in bargaining over price and access to markets. Future land use policies should address marketing constraints and unsustainable land use activities. Harvesting soil from natural forests and the conversion of productive surplus cropland to woodlot production both present long-term sustainability challenges. This study demonstrates the importance of considering economic and social incentives when creating land use policies for smallholder's woodlot production. "

abstract = "The effect of urea-molasses feed-supplement blocks (MUB) on feed utilisation and the inclusion of anthelmintic medication into the blocks at strategic times to control nematode parasites was studied in lambs grazed on low quality tropical pasture. 120 Menz ram lambs of 5–7 months of age were divided into six groups for methods of treatment against internal parasites and urea molasses supplementation. The benzimidazole anthelmintic fenbendazole was administered at the rate of 10 mg kg−1 liveweight as a drench or via medicated MUB. Animals grazed in two lots during the day and had access to grass hay in night pens ad libitum. Groups 1–3 comprised a non-supplemented (NOSUP) lot that only grazed while groups 4–6 consumed, in addition, an average of 80 g per head per day of molasses-urea-block (SUPP) supplement. The \{MUB\} supplement was provided daily for nine months but medicated \{MUB\} was used only for strategic prophylactic treatment against nematodes. \{SUPP\} animals had higher daily \{DM\} intakes (568 ±11 versus 532 ± 11 g \{DM\} per head per day, P &lt; 0.05), the advantage being greatest in the wet season when there was also a concomitant increase in herbage digestibility (P &lt; 0.001). \{SUPP\} animals were 4kg heavier (25.7 ± 0.5 versus 21.7 ± 0.5 kg, P &lt; 0.05) and had deposited more body reserves as judged by condition score (3.2 ± 0.1 versus 2.4 ± 0.1) after 6 months. The level of infection with endoparasites was lower in the dry than in the wet season. Medicated \{MUB\} was as efficient in treating against endoparasites as drenching. Similarly, the \{MUB\} supplement mitigated the effect of endoparasitism. Anthelmintic treatment did not improve testicular size or semen quality (P&gt; 0.05). Testicular growth increased faster during the first 3 months to highest values of 26.9 ± 0.3 and 25.3 ± 0.3 cm, respectively in \{SUPP\} and \{NOSUP\} animals (P &lt; 0.001) at 6 months. Semen quality improved with age and was better in \{SUPP\} than \{NOSUP\} males (P &lt; 0.05–P &lt; 0.001). It is concluded that \{MUB\} supplementation is a suitable method for supplementing the nutrition of grazing sheep in Ethiopia, and that \{MUB\} feeding can help alleviate the effect of endoparasitism.

Increasing human population, urbanization and incomes, coupled with changing consumer preferences are creating more demand for these animals and their products. This demand can effectively be met by substantially increasing the productivity of these animals. Integrated effort in terms of management, health, genetic improvement and product technology to enhance production and decrease wastage is, therefore, desirable. Efficient genetic improvement programs can boost output and profitability for the smallholders. However, there is a lack of information on sustainable conventional genetic improvement programs under smallholder production circumstances. Consequently, methods for implementing and the factors influencing the success of genetic improvement programs should be studied. This review focuses on the technical and infrastructural issues affecting the genetic improvement of small ruminants in low-input, smallholder production systems. It is concluded that a key step is to identify existing structures, institutions, and indigenous breeding practices, and, to build upon these foundation programs where there are opportunities for sustainable genetic improvement.

The total demand for livestock products might almost double by 2050, mostly in the developing world owing to increases in population density, urbanization and increased incomes. Multiple existing trade-offs and competing demands for natural resources will intensify, but reducing livestock product demand in places and capitalizing on the positive aspects of livestock systems such as the potential for sustainable intensification of mixed systems, the potential of ecosystems services payments in rangeland systems and well-regulated industrial livestock production might help achieve the goals of balancing livestock production, livelihoods and environmental protection.

One hundred and fifty farms were studied from three administrative sublocations in each of the five AEZs. Prevalence of serum antibodies to three tick-borne parasites, that is T. parva, T. mutans and B. bigemina, were determined using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. Antibody prevalence values differed across the AEZs. The ranges of means for the prevalences were: T. parva (18–72%), T. mutans (1.5–28%) and B. bigemina (12–49%).

We use high-resolution methods to generate characteristic daily weather data for a combination of different future emission scenarios and climate models to drive detailed simulation models of the maize and bean crops. For the East African region, there is considerable spatial and temporal variation in this crop response. We evaluate the response of maize and beans to a changing climate, as a prelude to detailed targeting of options that can help smallholder households adapt. The results argue strongly against the idea of large, spatially contiguous development domains for identifying and implementing adaptation options, particularly in regions with large variations in topography and current average temperatures. Rather, they underline the importance of localised, community-based efforts to increase local adaptive capacity, take advantage of changes that may lead to increased crop and livestock productivity where this is possible, and to buffer the situations where increased stresses are likely.

Phytomedicine has been used for eons by farmers and traditional healers to treat parasitism and improve performance of livestock, and many modern commercial medicines are derived from plants. However, scientific evidence on the anti-parasitic efficacy of most plant products is limited, regardless of their wide ethnoveterinary usage. Scientific validation of the anti-parasitic effects and possible side-effects of plant products in ruminants is necessary prior to their adoption as a novel method for parasite control. A variety of methods has been explored to validate the anthelmintic properties of such plant remedies, both in vivo and in vitro. In vitro assays are useful as pre-screens of activity and are mainly performed with the free-living rather than parasitic stages of nematodes. Concentrations of potentially active substances used in vitro do not always correspond to in vivo bioavailability. Therefore, in vitro assays should always be accompanied by in vivo studies when used to validate the anthelmintic properties of plant remedies. In vivo controlled studies have shown that plant remedies have in most instances resulted in reductions in the level of parasitism much lower than those observed with anthelmintic drugs. Whether it is necessary or not to achieve very high efficacy in order for plant remedies to have a role in the control of parasitism depends on the determination of biologically important levels of reduction of parasitism and it will be required prior to the wide-scale use of plant products for parasite control. Similarly, standardisation of validation studies in reference to the numbers of animals required for in vivo studies to measure direct anthelmintic effects of a plant needs to be established. Although in many cases the active compounds in the herbal remedies have not been fully identified, plant enzymes, such as cysteine proteinases, or secondary metabolites, such as alkaloids, glycosides and tannins have shown dose-dependent anti-parasitic properties. However, as some of the active compounds may also have anti-nutritional effects, such as reduced food intake and performance, it is essential to validate the anti-parasitic effects of plant products in relation to their potential anti-nutritional and other side effects. A concerted effort on isolation, development, and validation of the effects of these herbal remedies will have to be undertaken before their wider acceptance. "

The feed samples consisted of tef straw, wheat bran, dried Lablab purpureus, and dried foliage of the multipurpose trees (MPT), namely Sesbania sesban 1198, Sesbania sesban 15019, Acacia angustissima 15132, Leucaena pallida 14203, and mixtures of S. sesban 1198+L. pallida 14203; S. sesban 15019+L. pallida 14203; S. sesban 1198+A. angustissima 15132; S. sesban 15019+L. pallida 14203 at a ratio of 2:1. The objectives of the study were to assess the nutritive value of the feed samples and to also consider their potential as supplements to tef straw. The \{MPTs\} contained higher crude protein (CP) (216–278 g kg−1 dry matter (DM)), and lower neutral detergent fiber (NDF) (204–338 g kg−1 DM) than wheat bran and L. purpureus. Anti-nutritive factors such as soluble phenolics and fiber bound condensed tannins were high in A. angustissima 15132 and L. pallida 14203, respectively. Wheat bran produced significantly more gas (P&lt;0.001) than either sole or mixtures of MPTs, but the rate of gas production was significantly greater (P&lt;0.001) for the \{MPTs\} than for wheat bran. Significantly lower (P&lt;0.05) extent and rate of gas production were observed in sole A. angustissima 15132 than in its mixtures with both accessions of S. sesban. L. pallida 14203 yielded significantly lower (P&lt;0.05) in vitro ammonia than its mixtures with both accessions of S. sesban. Sole L. pallida 14203 and A. angustissima 15132 had significantly lower (P&lt;0.05) in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), in situ potential and effective degradability of \{DM\} and nitrogen (N) than their respective mixtures with both accessions of S. sesban. Acid detergent fiber (ADF) and \{NDF\} had a strong negative impact on the rapidly degradable and potential degradability of \{DM\} (P&lt;0.001), whereas neutral detergent fiber bound N (NDF-N) significantly limited (P&lt;0.05) the rate and effective degradability of DM, as well as the extent and rate of in vitro gas production. \{IVDMD\} was also negatively influenced by contents of \{NDF\} (P&lt;0.01), \{ADF\} and acid detergent lignin (ADL) (P&lt;0.05). In situ extent of \{DM\} degradability, potential and effective degradability of \{DM\} were positively correlated (P&lt;0.01) with IVDMD, and the rate of in vitro gas production was also positively correlated (P&lt;0.05) with the rate of in situ \{DM\} degradability. It is concluded that all the \{MPTs\} and their mixtures have desirable characteristics as potential feed supplements to tef straw compared with wheat bran or L. purpureus. Within the MPTs, A. angustissima 15132 and L. pallida 14203 could be inferior supplements to tef straw compared to S. sesban 1198 or S. sesban 15019. However, mixing both accessions of S. Sesban with either A. angustissima 15132 or L. pallida 14203 has the potential of improving the utilization of the latter MPTs. Moreover, it is concluded that in vitro gas production, in situ \{DM\} degradation and \{IVDMD\} methods could be alternatively used to evaluate the nutritive value of feeds similar to those used in this study.

abstract = "The East African region exhibits considerable climatic and topographic variability. Much spatial and temporal variation in the response of different crops to climate change can thus be anticipated. In previous work we showed that a large part of this variation can be explained in terms of temperature and, to a lesser extent, water effects. Here, we summarise simulated yield response in two crops that are widely grown in the region, maize and beans, and investigate how the impacts of climate change might be addressed at two levels: the agricultural system and the household. Regionally, there are substantial between-country and within-system differences in maize and bean production responses projected to 2050. The arid-semiarid mixed crop-livestock systems are projected to see reductions in maize and bean production throughout most of the region to 2050. Yields of these crops in the tropical highland mixed systems are projected to increase, sometimes substantially. The humid–subhumid mixed systems show more varied yield responses through time and across space. Some within-country shifts in cropping away from the arid–semiarid systems to cooler, higher-elevation locations may be possible, but increased regional trade should be able to overcome the country-level production deficits in maize and beans caused by climate change to 2050, all other things being equal. For some places in the tropical highlands, maize and bean yield increases could have beneficial effects on household food security and income levels. In the other mixed systems, moderate yield losses can be expected to be offset by crop breeding and agronomic approaches in the coming decades, while more severe yield losses may necessitate changes in crop types, movement to more livestock-orientated production, or abandonment of cropping altogether. These production responses are indicative only, and their effects will be under-estimated because the methods used here have not accounted for increasing weather variability in the future or changes in the distribution and impacts of biotic and other abiotic stresses. These system-level shifts will take place in a context characterised by high population growth rates; the demand for food is projected to nearly triple by the middle of this century. Systems will have to intensify substantially in response, particularly in the better-endowed mixed systems in the region. For the more marginal areas, the variability in yield response, and the variability in households’ ability to adapt, suggest that, even given the limitations of this analysis, adaptation options need to be assessed at the level of the household and the local community, if research for development is to meet its poverty alleviation and food security targets in the face of global change.

Potential risk factors examined were breed, gender, age, month, and air temperatures. Fifty-four per cent of total deaths in the flock could be attributed to respiratory disease and the annual \{MARD\} rate ranged between 6.3 and 19.0%. There was significant breed (P&lt;0.0001) and gender (P&lt;0.0001) difference in MARD. The Horro breed had a higher (P&lt;0.0001) annual \{MARD\} than the Menz breed (16.5±0.18 vs. 12.4±0.15%). A higher (P&lt;0.0001) proportion of males suffered than females (15.1±0.23% vs. 13.8±0.13%). Age was also an important risk factor for MARD: there was a strong polynomial relationship (R2=0.91, P&lt;0.0001) between \{MARD\} and age; the risk of being young if a sheep was a \{MARD\} case was high. \{MARD\} was high between October and March but relatively low between the months of April and September. There was a significant (P&lt;0.05) negative cubic relationship (R2=0.49) between monthly \{MARD\} and monthly average minimum air temperatures. There was also a significant (P&lt;0.01) positive exponential relationship (R2=0.61) between monthly \{MARD\} and average monthly daily deviation between maximum and minimum air temperatures. Timely health and management interventions focusing on these factors are necessary to alleviate losses from MARD. Understanding variations in \{MARD\} risk within a population can enhance early response to potential outbreaks, reducing losses. "

Birth of a cattle × buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) hybrid has reportedly occurred in Russia and in China, but these reports were not authenticated. Such hybrids could be important in improving livestock production and management of diseases that impede production in tropical Africa. This study investigated hybridization between cattle and its closest African wild bovid relative, the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer). In an attempt to produce cattle × buffalo hybrid embryos in vitro, matured cattle oocytes were subjected to a standard in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure with either homologous cattle (n = 1166 oocytes) or heterologous African buffalo (n = 1202 oocytes) frozen-thawed epididymal sperm. After IVF, 67.2% of the oocytes inseminated with the homologous cattle sperm cleaved. In contrast, fertilization with buffalo sperm resulted in only a 4.6% cleavage rate. The cleavage intervals were also slower in hybrid embryos than in the IVF-derived cattle embryos. Of the cleaved homologous cattle embryos 52.2% progressed to the morula stage compared with 12.7% for the buffalo hybrid embryos. No hybrid embryos developed beyond the early morula stage, while 40.1% of the cleaved cattle × cattle embryos developed to the blastocyst stage. Transfer of buffalo hybrid \{IVF\} embryos to domestic cattle surrogates resulted in no pregnancies at 60 days post-transfer. This study indicates that interspecies fertilization of cattle oocytes with African buffalo epididymal sperm can occur in vitro, and that a barrier to hybridization occurs in the early stages of embryonic development. Chromosomal disparity is likely the cause of the fertilization abnormalities, abnormal development and subsequent arrest impairing the formation of hybrid embryos beyond the early morula stage. Transfer of the buffalo hybrid embryos did not rescue the embryos from development arrest. "

This resulted in the farmers forming their own umbrella organizations to cater for their interests as producers in accessing animal health and breeding services, production inputs, and marketing goats and goat products. In seven years, the population of improved goats in one of the project areas increased from 2100 to 5500, and the livelihoods of the participating farmers improved. Income from sales of milk and improved breeding and slaughter stock increased, while food security improved as a result of daily milk consumption and improved crop yields resulting from use of the rich goat manure. The project has, however, faced challenges arising mainly from the popularity of the improved goats within the Eastern Africa region, which has resulted in sale of a large number of the young animals, leaving few replacements within the project area. Uptake of goat breeding by private commercial farmers to provide breeding stock and replacement animals is currently lacking. Further research and evaluation is required on how to strengthen collective-action based institutions to improve services within smallholder farmer communities. "

The objective of this systematic review was to compute the pooled prevalence estimate and identify factors influencing mange mite prevalence in sheep and goats at national level based on the available research evidence. Articles on mange mite infestation of small ruminants in Ethiopia were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, Google scholar and African journals on-line. The review was based on 18 cross-sectional studies carried out between 2003 and 2015 in four administrative states of Ethiopia. Accordingly, the pooled prevalence estimate in a random effects meta-analysis was estimated to be 4.4% (95% \{CI\} 3.0, 6.3) although there were evidence of a substantial amount of between-study variance (I2 = 98.4%). In subgroup and multivariable meta-regression analyses, animal species, agro-ecology and administrative state were found to have significant effect on the prevalence estimate (P &lt; 0.05) and explained 32.87% of the explainable proportion of the heterogeneity noted between studies The prevalence was found to be higher in goats in lowland agro-ecology. Region wise the highest estimate was calculated for Amhara (6.4%) followed by Oromia (4.7%), Tigray (3.6%) and Southern Nations, Nationalities and People Region (SNNPR) (3.1%). Significant difference was noted between Amhara and SNNPR. The study further revealed that mites of the genus Sarcoptes, Demodex and Psoroptes are the most prevalent mites infesting small ruminants in Ethiopia. Valid studies were lacking from five regional states. As some of these regions are known for their large small ruminant population, further studies are warranted to produce better picture of the infestation at a national level. Meanwhile, the need for monitoring the ongoing control intervention is suggested. "

The accuracy of evaluation ranged from 0.28 to 0.41, depending on the validation population and prediction method used. No significant differences were found in accuracy between the 2 prediction methods. The results suggest that there is potential for implementing genomic selection for young bulls in crossbred small-holder cattle populations, and targeted genotyping and phenotyping should be pursued to facilitate this.

Photodynamic inactivation is a novel light-based approach which offers a promising alternative to conventional methods for the control of mycotoxigenic fungi. This study describes the use of curcumin to inactivate spores of Aspergillus flavus, one of the major aflatoxin producing fungi in foods and feeds. Curcumin is a natural polyphenolic compound from the spice turmeric (Curcuma longa). In this study the plant has shown to be an effective photosensitiser when combined with visible light (420 nm). The experiment was conducted in in vitro and in vivo where A. flavus spores were treated with different photosensitiser concentration and light dose both in buffer solution and on maize kernels. Comparison of fungal load from treated and untreated samples was determined, and reductions of fungal spore counts of up to 3 log \{CFU\} ml−1 in suspension and 2 log \{CFU\} g−1 in maize kernels were obtained using optimal dye concentrations and light dose combinations. The results in this study indicate that curcumin-mediated photosensitization is a potentially effective method to decontaminate A. flavus spores in foods and feeds. "

Production data were collected from 477 plots in a fairly productive, mixed farming system in the Ethiopian highlands. Interspatial measures of total factor productivity, based on the Divisia index, were used to measure the relative production efficiency of three informal and less secure land contracts (rented, share-cropped and borrowed) relative to lands held under formal contract with the Ethiopian government. Although the informally-contracted lands are farmed 10–16% less efficiently, the analysis indicates that farmers of such lands actually apply inputs more, rather than less, intensively (i.e., more inputs per unit of land). The gap in total factor productivity thus results from the inferior quality of inputs (or lack of skills in applying them) rather than a lack of incentive to allocate inputs to mixed crop-livestock farming. For this reason we find no empirical basis to support the hypothesis that land tenure is a constraint to agricultural productivity. "

It integrates results from different sources of data and analysis: 1. Spatial stratification using secondary data for \{GIS\} layers: Maize mega-environments combined with recommendation domains for dual-purpose maize were constructed for Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, stratifying the countries by demand factors (livestock densities and human population densities) and feed availability. Relative biomass contributions to feed resources from rangelands were compared to those from croplands to explore the usefulness of global datasets for feed supply estimations. 2. Verification through farming systems analysis: the potential demand for maize residues as feed (maize cropping patterns, maize yields and uses, feed deficits) was compared at contrasting sites, based on household survey data collected on 480 households in 2010. 3. Maize cultivar analysis: Genotypic variability of maize cultivars was compared to evaluate the potential contribution (stover quantity and quality) of dual-purpose maize to reduce feed deficits. The study results illustrate high spatial variability in the demand for and supply of maize residues. Northern Malawi is characterized by high livestock density, high human population density and high feed availability. Farmers achieve maize yields of more than 2 t/ha resulting in surplus of residues. Although livestock is important, southwest Zimbabwe has low livestock densities, low human populations and low feed availability; farming systems are more integrated and farmers make greater use of maize residues to address feed shortages. Central Mozambique also has low cattle densities, low human populations and low feed availability. More rangelands are available but maize yields are very low and livestock face severe feed shortages. The investigation of 14 advanced \{CIMMYT\} maize landraces cultivars and 15 advanced hybrids revealed significant variations in grain and stover yield and fodder quality traits. Where livestock densities are high and alternative feed resources are insufficient, maize cultivars with superior residue yield and fodder quality can have substantial impact on livestock productivity. Cultivars at the higher end of the quality range can provide sufficient energy for providing livestock maintenance requirements and support about 200 g of live weight gain daily. Maize cultivars can be targeted according to primary constraints of demand domains for either stover quantity or stover fodder quality and the paper proposes an approach for this based on voluntary feed intake estimates for maize stover.

Here, we describe the development and evaluation of a panel of \{EST\} micro- and minisatellite markers to characterize the genetic diversity within and between populations of R. appendiculatus and other rhipicephaline species. Sixty-six micro- and minisatellite markers were identified through analysis of the R. appendiculatus Gene Index (RaGI) \{EST\} database and selected bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequences. These were used to genotype 979 individual ticks from 10 field populations, 10 laboratory-bred stocks, and 5 additional Rhipicephalus species. Twenty-nine markers were polymorphic and therefore informative for genetic studies while 6 were monomorphic. Primers designed from the remaining 31 loci did not reliably generate amplicons. The 29 polymorphic markers discriminated populations of R. appendiculatus and also 4 other Rhipicephalus species, but not R. zambeziensis. The percentage Principal Component Analysis (PCA) implemented using Multiple Co-inertia Analysis (MCoA) clustered populations of R. appendiculatus into 2 groups. Individual markers however differed in their ability to generate the reference typology using the \{MCoA\} approach.

Genetic relationships and other diversity parameters were inferred from 39 randomly selected mtDNA D-loop partial sequences, characterized by 29 polymorphic sites defining 19 distinct haplotypes. Moreover, haplotype and nucleotide diversity in Ethiopian donkey populations were 0.903±0.032 and 0.020±0.003, respectively. A network analysis produced moderate star-like patterns suggesting past population demographic and spatial expansion. Population subdivision estimates demonstrated that Sinnar donkeys were considerably divergent from the other donkey populations. To trace the matrilineal genetic origin of Ethiopian donkeys, we retrieved 221 previously published domestic donkeys’ mtDNA D-loop sequences from the GenBank (146 from Chinese and 75 from worldwide domestic donkeys). The haplogroup derived from the Ethiopian sources formed the center of the network from which most of the worldwide domestic donkey populations emerged. This suggests that Ethiopia could be one of the centers of diversities for domestic donkeys in the Horn of Africa. The present study also overrides some previous reports that claimed donkeys were solely an Egyptian domesticate. "

The results reflect the production practices of the region, suggesting that important traits in developing breed improvement programs should include disease resistance, fitness for traction and reproductive performance. Beef and milk production are less important traits. The study shows the potential usefulness of conjoint analysis for quantifying preferences in less developed countries for livestock and for the wide variety of other multiple-attribute goods. One implication is that conjoint analysis provides a quantitative methodology that helps make diverse livelihood strategies more operational. Distinguishing differences in preferences between groups of respondents in connection with specific agro-ecological zones and production systems can be used to promote conservation-through-use of breeds at risk of extinction.

Reverse vaccinology approaches were used and identified 66 candidate Mycoplasma proteins using available Mmm genome data. These proteins were ranked by their ability to be recognized by serum from CBPP-positive cattle and thereafter used to inoculate naïve cattle. We report here the inoculation of cattle with recombinant proteins and the subsequent humoral and T-cell-mediated immune responses to these proteins and conclude that a subset of these proteins are candidate molecules for recombinant protein-based subunit vaccines for \{CBPP\} control.

We found that land use/land cover changes are proceeding in all eco-environments and that transitions are from grasslands, and forest lands to bush/shrub lands and crop lands in the pastoral site (Liben), from bush/shrub lands and grasslands to crop lands in agro-pastoral site (Mieso) and from bush/shrub lands, forest lands and grasslands to crop lands in the mixed crop-livestock site (Tiyo). The changes significantly affected livestock feed resources and feed deficit management strategies available to households. Over the last 30–40 years, grazing resources available to livestock keepers have been declining with resultant increase in the contribution of crop residues and other feeds from crop lands (weeds and crop thinnings) as compared to feeds from grasslands. The feed deficit management strategies of households are also changing significantly from mobility to herd management and feed conservation in the pastoral areas; from mobility to feed conservation and purchasing of feed in the agro-pastoral areas and from transhumance to feed conservation and purchase of feed in the mixed crop-livestock areas. Hence feed resources and their availability vary with time and eco-environments indicating the need for the development of eco-environment/site specific feed management strategies in order to support productive stock in the study areas and similar eco-environments.

Our sample pooling technique collects a composite gas sample from several chambers instead of the conventional practise of analyzing samples from chambers individually, thus reducing numbers of gas samples. The method was verified to be reasonably accurate in forest, grassland and agricultural fields over a four week measurement campaign. Pooling technique results differed by 2–8% for \{CO2\} and by 3–4% for \{N2O\} when compared to individual chamber means. That shows pooling of gas samples across individual static chambers is an acceptable approach to integrate spatial heterogeneity. "

To the best of our knowledge this is the first published data on the complete mitochondrial D-Loop sequence of Aceh cattle. Results show that Aceh cattle have the closest relationship to Bos indicus and have been influenced by Bos taurus. The closest genetic ranges among Aceh cattle, Bhutanese, Chinese, Indian and Zebu were Aceh–Zebu (0.0138), Aceh–Bhutanese (0.0156), Aceh–Chinese (0.0190) and Aceh–Indian (0.0193). D-Loop mtDNA analyses showed that there were 27 haplotypes in which twenty-one samples spread in haplotype 1, two samples were in haplotype 2, and the other four haplotypes had various samples in the range of three to seventeen samples. One sample of Aceh cattle from Saree has a closest maternal genetic with B. taurus. One of the four mutations among the star-shaped clusters on median joining network was a new specific haploid-group in Aceh cattle. From this finding it could be assumed that Aceh cattle form a specific haplotype and it can be conclude that Aceh cattle are animal genetic resources from Aceh in Sumatera Island that have to be preserved.

The extent of proneness, epidemiology, and genetics of the disease is not, however, known in Ethiopia where a large proportion of the area is at altitudes above 2700 m. To learn about adaptive characteristics of cattle towards altitude, a study of physiological adaptation, measured via pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) score from 218, hematological parameters from 672, and arterial oxygen saturation predicted by pulse oximeter from 241 animals was conducted in North Western Ethiopia. Local breeds and their crosses with Holstein Friesian and Jersey were investigated. Results showed that all \{PAP\} scores (21 to 47 mm Hg) fall under low to moderate risks. No sign of pulmonary hypertension was observed among all the cattle genotypes. Crosses of the local cattle with Holstein Friesian and Jersey were not more prone to the disease than local cattle. A statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) decrease in the percent arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (% SaO2) to approximately 82% was present in the high altitude animals. Crosses and locals at high altitude, ≥ 2700 m, did not exhibit significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) in % SaO2. We report a new clinically relevant range of oxygen saturation, ≥ 68%, for the high altitude cattle which is far below the threshold value usually assumed for temperate cattle, &gt; 80%. Hematological values of the studied genotypes lie within normal ranges set for temperate breeds despite suffering from heavy parasitic infestation. The significantly greater (P &lt; 0.001) red blood cell counts, hemoglobin and hematocrit values of Simien cattle measured at 3500 m compared to the other genotypes in this study were not different when compared to other breeds studied elsewhere at lower altitudes and around sea level. Simien cattle probably have unique adaptations of oxygen uptake and delivery that result in the absence of hypoxemic stimulus to increase red blood cell production and hemoglobin concentration. We concluded that indigenous cattle of the Simien Plateau of Ethiopia are adapted genetically to high altitude by largely eliminating the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstrictor response. The good adaptation is most likely due to natural selection. Understanding this adaptation model requires investigation of the biological mechanisms and the underlying genetics. "

Twelve focal animals in each of four groups (two groups per genotype) were observed regarding their grazing, social and comfort behaviour on pasture. No significant differences in grazing behaviour patterns (eating, walking, standing) were found between the genotypes. Resting occurred only very rarely in both genotypes. Walking distances of Ankole and Ankole × Holstein crosses were also similar. There was no difference in the occurrence of agonistic interactions between the two genotypes. However, Ankole cattle engaged in more non-agonistic social interactions than their crossbred counterparts. Individual distances were lower in Ankole heifers and more herd mates were found within a radius of 5 m around the Ankole animals. The most important comfort behaviour pattern in both genotypes was self-licking, which occurred to similar frequency in Ankole and crossbred heifer groups. Crossbred animals scratched themselves and rubbed on objects more often than Ankole heifers. Although Ankole cattle and their Holstein crosses did not differ in grazing, distances walked and agonistic behaviours, the significant differences between the two genotypes in herd cohesion and comfort behaviour may pose challenges on the management of crossbred animals under extensive open grazing conditions as present in south western Uganda. Thus, apart from (re)productive performance traits, behavioural traits of both genotypes may also be taken into account for breeding decisions and management under current production conditions. "

abstract = "Abstract Paddy rice is the main cropping system in Southeast Asia. However, water scarcity arising from competition from other sectors, rainfall variability and climate change increasingly challenges global rice production. One option to adapt to lower water availability is switching from paddy rice to less irrigation intensive upland cropping systems. Such land management change (LMC) is likely to significantly affect ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycling and its greenhouse gas (GHG) balance. This study evaluates how well the ecosystem model LandscapeDNDC is able to simulate observed emissions of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from different tropical cropping rotations, i.e., double- and triple-cropped paddy rice, aerobic rice–paddy rice and maize–paddy rice (rice: O. sativa, maize: Zea mays) and how management changes to rice dominated lowland systems will affect the \{GHG\} balance on short (a few years) and long (several decades) time scales. LandscapeDNDC predicts seasonal emissions of \{CH4\} and \{N2O\} across different cropping rotations (including LMC) with \{R2\} values of 0.85 and 0.78 and average underestimations of 15 and 14%, respectively. In addition to emissions of \{CH4\} and N2O, LandscapeDNDC also captures the long-term development of soil organic carbon (SOC). Soil oxygen status, growth of photosynthetic active aquatic biomass as well as decomposability of harvest residues significantly influence \{SOC\} development. Simulation results demonstrate that short-term \{GHG\} balances after \{LMC\} considerably differ from long-term balances. Simulated total \{GHG\} emissions three years after \{LMC\} are highest for upland crop − paddy rice rotations due to pronounced decomposition of soil organic carbon. In contrast, the total \{GHG\} emissions are highest for double cropping of paddy rice and are clearly dominated by \{CH4\} emissions over a longer period of several decades. Simulation results suggest that approx. 2.8–3.4 t C ha−1 yr−1 residue incorporation after harvest is needed to achieve stable \{SOC\} stocks in mixed upland crop–paddy rice systems after \{LMC\} from double-cropped paddy rice systems.

Reliable indicators of farm performance are needed in order to model these links, and to therefore be able to design interventions which meet the differing needs of specific user groups. However, the lack of standardization of performance indicators has led to a wide array of tools and ad-hoc indicators which limit our ability to compare across studies and to draw general conclusions on relationships and trade-offs whereby performance indicators are shaped by farm management and the wider social-environmental context. \{RHoMIS\} is a household survey tool designed to rapidly characterise a series of standardised indicators across the spectrum of agricultural production and market integration, nutrition, food security, poverty and \{GHG\} emissions. The survey tool takes 40–60 min to administer per household using a digital implementation platform. This is linked to a set of automated analysis procedures that enable immediate cross-site bench-marking and intra-site characterisation. We trialled the survey in two contrasting agro-ecosystems, in Lushoto district of Tanzania (n = 150) and in the Trifinio border region of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras (n = 285). The tool rapidly characterised variability between farming systems at landscape scales in both locations identifying key differences across the population of farm households that would be critical for targeting \{CSA\} interventions. Our results suggest that at both sites the climate smartness of different farm strategies is clearly determined by an interaction between the characteristics of the farm household and the farm strategy. In general strategies that enabled production intensification contributed more towards the goals of climate smart agriculture on smaller farms, whereas increased market orientation was more successful on larger farms. On small farms off-farm income needs to be in place before interventions can be promoted successfully, whereas on the larger farms a choice is made between investing labour in off-farm incomes, or investing that labour into the farm, resulting in a negative association between off-farm labour and intensification, market orientation and crop diversity on the larger farms, which is in complete opposition to the associations found for the smaller farms. The balance of indicators selected gave an adequate snap shot picture of the two sites, and allowed us to appraise the ‘CSA-ness’ of different existing farm strategies, within the context of other major development objectives.

Contingent valuation (CV) techniques were used to generate estimates of farmers’ willingness to pay for tsetse control in money, labour, or both forms of payment. Of the 261 households that participated in the \{CV\} survey, these proportions were 23, 37 and 40%, respectively, indicating differentiation among the population and an overall preference for labour contribution. A comparison of predicted versus actual contribution of labour indicated that only 56% of households that said they would contribute actually contributed; 3% of households that said they would not contribute actually contributed. Major factors affecting contingent contributions of labour in discrete choice models were identified as well as those to account for in any successful scheme for actual labour contribution. These factors include the age of household head, offtake of cattle, involvement in secondary activities, membership in rural organizations, current expenditure on drug therapy, and cash-on-hand. The results also indicate that full cost-recovery of the investment in targets—about US$8000—could not be achieved in the short run with the proposed contribution of US$0.90–1.00 per month per household. Contingent contributions of money were interpreted as maximum donations to expect of beneficiaries as part of the total cost of providing tsetse control. "

There is a pressing need for wide-scale innovation leading to development that improves the livelihoods and food security of the world's population while at the same time addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation. A variety of promising climate-smart interventions have been identified. However, what remains is the prioritization of interventions for investment and broad dissemination. The suitability and adoption of interventions depends on a variety of bio-physical and socio-economic factors. Also their impacts, when adopted and out-scaled, are likely to be highly heterogeneous. This heterogeneity expresses itself not only spatially and temporally but also in terms of the stakeholders affected, some might win and some might lose. A mechanism that can facilitate a systematic, holistic assessment of the likely spread and consequential impact of potential interventions is one way of improving the selection and targeting of such options. In this paper we provide climate smart agriculture (CSA) planners and implementers at all levels with a generic framework for evaluating and prioritising potential interventions. This entails an iterative process of mapping out recommendation domains, assessing adoption potential and estimating impacts. Through examples, related to livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa, we demonstrate each of the steps and how they are interlinked. The framework is applicable in many different forms, scales and settings. It has a wide applicability beyond the examples presented and we hope to stimulate readers to integrate the concepts in the planning process for climate-smart agriculture, which invariably involves multi-stakeholder, multi-scale and multi-objective decision-making.

These impacts are multidimensional and not always well understood, complicating effective policy response. In the developing world, livestock diseases have broader, more nuanced effects on markets, poverty, and livelihoods, given the diversity of uses of livestock and complexity of livestock value chains. In both settings, disease control strategies, particularly those informed by ex ante modeling platforms, often fail to recognize the constraints inherent among farmers, veterinary services, and other value chain actors. In short, context matters. Correspondingly, an important gap in the animal health economics literature is the explicit incorporation of behavior and incentives in impact analyses that highlight the interactions of disease with its socio-economic and institutional setting. In this paper, we examine new approaches and frameworks for the analysis of economic and poverty impacts of animal diseases. We propose greater utilization of “bottom-up” analyses, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of value chain and information economics approaches in impact analyses and stressing the importance of improved integration between the epidemiology of disease and its relationships with economic behavior.

The review used 50 animal level datasets retrieved from 24 manuscripts. The studies used data collected from 9407 sheep and 3478 goats. A meta-analytical approach was employed to analyze Effect size (ES). The reported \{GI\} nematodes represented eleven genera affecting sheep and goats including: Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus, Teladorsagia/Ostertagia, Strongyloides, Bunostomum, Nematodirus, Chabertia, Trichuris, Cooperia, Skrjabinema and Oesophagostomum. The \{GI\} nematodes pooled prevalence estimate in the random effect model was 75.8% (95% CI: 69.6, 80.8). The subgroup analysis revealed significant (p &lt; 0.05) differences in the prevalence between different regions and type of diagnostic methods used. ‘Postmortem technique’ and ‘eastern part of the country’ were associated with higher \{GI\} nematode prevalence and accounted for 68.1% of the between studies heterogeneity.

To investigate whether mammalian host species, geographic separation and resulting reproductive isolation, or a combination of these, define the genetic structure of R. appendiculatus, we analyzed multi-locus genotype data from 392 individuals from 10 geographic locations in Kenya generated in an earlier study. These ticks were associated with three types of mammalian host situations; (1) cattle grazing systems, (2) cattle and wildlife co-grazing systems (3) wildlife grazing systems without livestock. We also analyzed data from 460 individuals from 10 populations maintained as closed laboratory stocks and 117 individuals from five other species in the genus Rhipicephalus. The pattern of genotypes observed indicated low levels of genetic differentiation between the ten field populations (FST = 0.014 ± 0.002) and a lack of genetic divergence corresponding to the degree of separation of the geographic sampling locations. There was also no clear association of particular tick genotypes with specific host species. This is consistent with tick dispersal over large geographic ranges and lack of host specificity. In contrast, the 10 laboratory populations (FST = 0.248 ± 0.015) and the five other species of Rhipicephalus (FST = 0.368 ± 0.032) were strongly differentiated into distinct genetic groups. Some laboratory bred populations diverged markedly from their field counterparts in spite of originally being sampled from the same geographic locations. Our results demonstrate a lack of defined population genetic differentiation in field populations of the generalist R. appendiculatus in Kenya, which may be a result of the frequent anthropogenic movement of livestock and mobility of its several wildlife hosts between different locations.

Stakeholder involvement, consensus building and the integration of comprehensive and reliable information represent crucial, yet challenging, pillars for successful outcomes. The spatially-explicit multi-criteria decision support framework “targetCSA” presented here aims to aid the targeting of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) at the national level. This framework integrates quantitative, spatially-explicit information such as vulnerability indicators (e.g. soil organic matter, literacy rate and market access) and proxies for \{CSA\} practices (e.g. soil fertility improvement, water harvesting and agroforestry) as well as qualitative opinions on these targeting criteria from a broad range of stakeholders. The analytic hierarchy process and a goal optimization approach are utilized to quantify collective, consensus-oriented stakeholder preferences on vulnerability indicators and \{CSA\} practices. Spatially-explicit vulnerability and \{CSA\} data are aggregated and coupled with stakeholder preferences deriving vulnerability and \{CSA\} suitability indices. Based on these indices, relevant regions with the potential to implement \{CSA\} practices are identified. “targetCSA” was exemplarily applied in Kenya exploring group-specific and overall consensus-based solutions of stakeholder opinions on vulnerability and \{CSA\} under different consensus scenarios. In this example, 32 experts from four stakeholder groups who participated in two surveys were included. The subsequent analyses not only revealed consistently regions with high \{CSA\} potential but also highlighted different high potential areas depending on the applied consensus scenario. Thus, this framework allows stakeholders to explore the consequences of scenarios that reflect opinions of the majority and minority or are based on a balance between them. “targetCSA” and the application example contribute valuable insights to the development of policy and planning tools to consensually target and implement CSA.

The present research in south-west Niger was undertaken to examine the role of micro-organisms and meso-fauna on in situ release rates of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) from cattle and sheep–goat manure collected from village corrals during the rainy season. The results show that (1) macro-organisms played a dominant role in the initial phase of manure decomposition; (2) manure decomposition was faster on crusted than on sandy soils; (3) throughout the study N and P release rates closely followed the dry matter decomposition; (4) during the first 6 weeks after application the K concentration in the manure declined much faster than N or P. At the applied dry matter rate of 18.8 Mg ha−1, the quantities of N, P and K released from the manure during the rainy season were up to 10-fold larger than the annual nutrient uptake of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.), the dominant crop in the traditional agro-pastoral systems. The results indicate considerable nutrient losses with the scarce but heavy rainfalls which could be alleviated by smaller rates of manure application. Those, however, would require a more labour intensive system of corralling or manure distribution. "

The exercise is liked by farmers for improving the availability of natural pasture during the long dry season when other feed sources get depleted. However, large portions of the communal grazing lands are still managed under free grazing throughout the year. This study was undertaken in Maynet village in the upper Blue Nile basin, northwestern Ethiopia, to assess the impacts of three different types of grazing land management (GLM) and two slope gradients (&lt;10%; 15–25%) on aboveground herbaceous biomass yield, ground cover, species richness, runoff, soil loss and soil bulk density of grazing lands. The \{GLMs\} include (a) freely open communal GLM, (b) restricted communal \{GLM\} – collective management of communal grazing land locally named as ‘yebere sar’ and (c) private holding GLM. Stocking density was more than carrying capacity of grazing lands across all GLMs. However, the extent of overstocking problem was exceptionally severe in freely open communal GLM. The interaction between \{GLM\} and slope was significant (P&lt;0.05) for runoff, soil loss and runoff coefficient. The average runoff coefficient was close to 50% in freely open communal \{GLM\} on steeper slopes (15–25%). Freely open communal \{GLM\} on steeper slopes resulted in consistently highest cumulative runoff and soil loss amounting to 491 mm and 32 t/ha per year, respectively. Polynomial regression analysis showed that quadratic relationship (r2=0.87) existed between soil loss and runoff. But, soil loss was close to nil when runoff did not exceed 2 mm per rainfall event. As expected, restricted communal \{GLM\} appeared to reduce surface runoff by more than 40% and curb the rate of soil erosion by more than 50% compared to freely open communal GLM. Its vegetation cover persisted above 70% throughout the year, meeting the threshold level recommended to keep surface runoff and soil loss to minimum. Reducing the problem of overstocking and pasture resting in August–November are important components to improve ground cover and aboveground herbaceous biomass yield, which in turn reduce land degradation on grazing lands.

Given the economic, social and environmental vulnerability due to high water scarcity and variability in the basin, improvements in agricultural water management (AWM) are needed to ensure sustainable benefits. A survey was conducted among 326 crop-livestock households in four water scarce sites of the basin in Burkina Faso and Ghana to characterize households in terms of access to water, services and information, \{AWM\} intensity and livelihoods, and to explore the linkages between these characteristics. The sources of water were more diverse for study sites in Ghana than in Burkina, allowing different types of \{AWM\} strategies. Most of the farmers perceived a strong positive impact of \{AWM\} strategies on their livelihoods. Almost 70% of the variation in livelihood assets was explained by variation in \{AWM\} intensity, affecting mainly food consumption, sources of income and housing index. With increasing access to water, services and information, \{AWM\} intensity significantly increased, as well as labour for water-related activities and food consumption. This increase in \{AWM\} was significantly related to an increase in livelihood assets (R2 = 52%). Policies should be developed to improve access to information and services as well as access to market in rural areas of the Volta Basin, to enhance positive impact of \{AWM\} strategies on livelihoods of the rural households.

We used twelve selected morphometric variables that recorded on a total of 569 adult donkeys (289 jacks and 280 jennets) spanning over wide arrays of ecologies in Ethiopia. Mean pairwise multiple comparisons (MPMC) between traits and multivariate analysis were carried out separately for jacks, jennets and aggregated gender. The \{MPMC\} showed significant differences between donkey populations for most of the traits studied. Principal component analysis showed that three body heights (height at wither, back and rump) and body length alone account for about 87.5% the total variations (eigenvalue = 10.49) of the 12 measured morphometric variables. Mahalanobis as well as Euclidean distances were also found to be highly significant (P &lt; 0.01) for pairwise comparisons of all populations. Stepwise discriminant analysis showed that, except in the order of their occurrence, the first two traits that separate between jennets and jacks were similar showing that there are no explicit anatomical dissimilarities or sexual dimorphism between genders in donkeys. Percent assignment of discriminant function analysis showed that, on average 64.83% of individuals were classified within their respective populations implying that populations were distinct. This study also explicitly showed that morphological character system (body size and coat color patterns) varies according to ecological patterns and altitudinal gradients. Such morphological divergences in contrasting ecologies may reflect response and adaptation of a given population to the prevailing ecological variables and biophysical resources. "

The alkaloidal fraction exhibited strong activity against \{NF54\} and \{ENT30\} with \{IC\} 50 of 0.16 ± 0.05 and 0.99 ± 0.06 μg/ml, respectively. Five known spermine alkaloids were isolated from the alkaloidal fraction. These alkaloids exhibited activities against \{NF54\} and \{ENT30\} with \{IC\} 50 ranging from 0.09 ± 0.02 to 0.91 ± 0.10 μg/ml. Four of the alkaloids were further evaluated for in vivo activity against rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei. The alkaloids showed percentage chemosuppression of parasitaemia in mice ranging from 43 to 72%. The use of the extracts A. gummifera for treatment of malaria in traditional medicine seems to have a scientific basis. "

Protected areas were established decades ago in order to preserve the forest's unique biodiversity from being converted into agricultural land by the regions large number of small-scale farmers. Nonetheless, recent research shows that degradation continues at alarming rates. In this paper we address an important challenge faced by protected area management, namely, the design of a cost-effective incentive scheme that balances local demand for subsistence non-timber forest products against conservation interests. Using primary data collected from 369 randomly selected farm-households we combine a farm-household classification with mathematical programming in order to estimate the opportunity costs of conserving the Kakamega Forest and restricting access to non-timber forest product resources. We validate our model and analyze the impact of changes in major economic frame conditions on our results before we derive recommendations for an improved protected area management in the study region. Our findings suggest that a more flexible approach to determining the price of recently established forest product extraction permits would greatly enhance management efficiency without significantly compromising local wellbeing.

One of CA's key principles is the maintenance of soil cover often by retaining a proportion of crop residues on the field as mulch. Yet smallholder crop–livestock systems across Africa and Asia face trade-offs among various options for crop residue use. Knowledge of the potential trade-offs of leaving more residues as mulch is only partial and the objective of this research is to address some of these knowledge gaps by assessing the trade-offs in contrasting settings with mixed crop–livestock systems. The paper draws from village surveys in 12 sites in 9 different countries across Sub-Sahara Africa and South Asia. Sites were clustered into 3 groups along the combined population and livestock density gradients to assess current crop residue management practices and explore potential challenges to adopting mulching practices in different circumstances. Results show that although high-density sites face higher potential pressure on resources on an area basis, biomass production tends to be more substantial in these sites covering demands for livestock feed and allowing part of the residues to be used as mulch. In medium-density sites, although population and livestock densities are relatively lower, biomass is scarce and pressure on land and feed are high, increasing the pressure on crop residues and their opportunity cost as mulch. In low-density areas, population and livestock densities are relatively low and communal feed and fuel resources exist, resulting in lower potential pressure on residues on an area basis. Yet, biomass production is low and farmers largely rely on crop residues to feed livestock during the long dry season, implying substantial opportunity costs to their use as mulch. Despite its potential benefit for smallholder farmers across the density gradient, the introduction of CA-based mulching practices appears potentially easier in sites where biomass production is high enough to fulfil existing demands for feed and fuel. In sites with relatively high feed and fuel pressure, the eventual introduction of \{CA\} needs complementary research and development efforts to increase biomass production and/or develop alternative sources to alleviate the opportunity costs of leaving some crop residues as mulch.

In a cross sectional study carried out in May 2011 aimed at evaluating the level of awareness about \{OMT\} based \{HIV\} tests, questionnaires were administered to participants who consented to take part in the study. Eighty-five percent (n = 1520) of participants reported a lack of awareness of \{HIV\} oral screening before the study, and surprisingly, no association was found between the awareness of participants and their educational level (p = 0.768). There was also no association (p = 0.743) found between having had previous screening tests and awareness of oral testing. The percentage of participants who accepted the oral test before being informed about it was 31.3% (n = 1520). After sensitization, 76.3% (n = 1520) preferred oral screening for future tests (p = 0). These results reveal that if the \{OMT\} based test is affordable, its implementation as a screening tool in the general population could greatly increase participation in screening campaigns and is welcomed by those who want to self-test in a non-invasive way.

Information linked to milk and cattle production such as activities, inputs (labour, means of production, capital) and outputs (milk, cheese, animals) were recorded using a closed-ended questionnaire. The communities were divided into two groups with low (LC) and high (HC) level of dependence on income from milk and animal sales. The survey results showed that cattle production on the \{LC\} farms was based on less land and a smaller herd (3.32 ha/farm, 1.06 lactating cows) than on \{HC\} farms (10.28 ha/farm, 4.19 lactating cows). The data from the survey and the results of the nutritional analyses of 74 feed samples were introduced into a model that applied linear programming techniques in order to estimate the farm household income under the current production systems and evaluate the economic impact of improved forage varieties for hay production. Furthermore, the economic viability of other changes in fodder and herd management was tested. Both groups were characterised by a dual-purpose system generating a gross income from the sale of both, milk and live animals in the amount of -21 (LC) and +1057 US$/farm and year (HC). Due to higher production costs for forages and better access to markets, \{LC\} communities were characterised by an integrated crop–livestock system whereas in the \{HC\} group income was mainly based on livestock. Introduction of improved and fertilized barley for hay production, was estimated to increase the annual farm income to 127 and 1257 US$ for \{LC\} and HC, respectively. This increase was accompanied by an increment of the animal number. Maintaining the animal number but increasing the milk production/cow by feeding additional forage was a less profitable option generating 50 and 1221 US$ of income per farm and year for \{LC\} and HC, respectively. The production of hay was limited by high costs (external labour) in \{LC\} communities and the restricted availability of family labour in the \{HC\} group. A scenario based on the use of improved cow genotypes led to the highest estimated annual farm income for \{HC\} communities (1280 US$) but was less favourable for LC. The modelling results showed that the best development strategy depends on various factors such as production costs, access to the markets and to irrigation and availability of different feed resources.

Farmers’ decisions on levels of inorganic and organic fertilizer use are hypothesized to be similarly mutually dependent, and to be further influenced by various farmer-specific socioeconomic factors. Econometric estimations indicate that once the effects of cropping patterns, farm-to-market transport costs, and labor availability are taken into account, smallholder applications of inorganic and organic fertilizers appear to be substitutes.

The paper mainly aims at identifying the main drivers of household behavior regarding collection of main forest products in the context of dry forest environment. A multivariate probit analysis was used to explain variation in household participation in collection of different forest products. The results show that households' participation in collection of different forest products is significantly determined by a combination of household demographic characteristics, ownership of oxen and of cows, proximity to forest, access to health and school infrastructure, resettlement history and self-reported change in standard of living. The estimation results also suggest households most likely to engage in collection of forest honey, gum, and wood for fuel and other purposes are those located farther from the forest.

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of data derived from cluster analysis showed that number of animals, number of breeding sows and number of weaner pigs were a significant factor in classifying farms in Nhiwa and Kiambu. Analysis of blood and serum samples using a \{PCR\} assay demonstrated an average animal level positivity to \{ASFV\} of 28% in two independent samplings in South-western Kenya and 0% \{PCR\} positivity in Central Kenya. No animals were sero-positive in either study site using the \{OIE\} indirect-ELISA and none of the animals sampled exhibited clinical symptoms of ASF. The farms that contained \{ASFV\} positive pigs in Ndhiwa District were located in divisions bordering the Ruma National Park from which bushpig (Potamochoerus larvatus) incursions into farms had been reported. \{ASFV\} prevalence (P &lt; 0.05) was significantly higher at distances between 6 and 16 km from the National Park than at distances closer or further away.

Recommendations are made regarding the manner in which uncertainty is analysed and reported, and the way in which models and data are used to make inferences regarding the future.

A field study in West Africa investigated the usefulness of anemia in the diagnosis of trypanosomosis. A total of 20,772 cattle blood samples were taken from 121 villages in 3 countries. The average packed cell volume (PCV) of trypanosomosis positive cattle was 23%, versus 28% for negative cattle. In a sub-set of animals, other causes of anemia were investigated showing most of the anemia burden was attributable to trypanosomosis. Anemia was a reasonably accurate indicator of trypanosomosis in the study area, with a sensitivity of 56% and a specificity of 80% and a diagnostic odds ratio of 4.2, the highest of all the signs evaluated (anemia, emaciation, staring coat, lymphadenopathy, fever, lacrimation and salivary or nasal discharge). Having confirmed the usefulness of anemia as a predictor of trypanosomosis, two potential pen-side tests for anemia were evaluated (the first reported trial of their use in cattle), firstly a color chart developed for anemia detection in sheep through visual inspection of conjunctival membranes (FAMACHA©) and secondly the Hemoglobin Color Scale (HbCS) developed for assessing hemoglobin levels in human patients by comparing blood drops on filter paper with color standards. In a population of cattle suspected by their owners to be sick with trypanosomosis (n = 898) the sensitivity of the HbCS test was 56% and the specificity was 77%, while the sensitivity of the FAMACHA© test was 95% and the specificity was 22%. The higher sensitivity but lower specificity suggests the FAMACHA© may be useful as a screening test and the HbCS as a confirmatory test. The two tests were also evaluated in cattle randomly selected from the village herd. Using cut-off points to optimize test performance, the HbCS test had a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 62% (n = 505 cattle), while the FAMACHA© had a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 30% (n = 298 cattle).

Bio-economic evaluation of farmers’ perceptions of viable farms in western Kenya. Agric. Syst. 90, 243–271]: one in which high productivity is achieved through optimising crop-livestock interactions. We selected four case study crop-livestock farms of different resource endowment (Type 1–4 – excluding the poorest farmers, Type 5, who do not own livestock) and quantified all relevant physical flows through and within them. With this information we parameterised a dynamic, farm-scale simulation model to investigate (i) current differences in resource use efficiencies and degree of crop-livestock interactions across farm types; and (ii) the impact of different interventions in farm Types 3 and 4 on producing the desired shifts in productivity towards the ideal farm. Assuming no resource constraints, changes in the current farm systems were introduced stepwise, as both intensification of external input use (fertilisers and fodder) and qualitative changes in the configuration of the farms (i.e. changing land use towards fodder production, improving manure handling and/or changing cattle breeds). In 10-year simulations of the baseline, current scenario using historical weather data the wealthiest farms Type 2 achieved food self-sufficiency (FSS) in 20% of the seasons due to rainfall variability, whereas the poorer Type 4 only achieved \{FSS\} in 0 to 30% of the seasons; soil organic C decreased during the simulations at annual rates of −0.54, −0.73, −0.85 and −0.84 t C ha−1 on farms of Type 1–4, respectively; large differences in productivity and recycling efficiency between farm types indicated that there is ample room to improve the physical performance of the poorer farms (e.g. light and water use efficiency was 2–3 times larger on wealthier farms). Simulating different intensification scenarios indicated that household \{FSS\} can be achieved in all farm types through input intensification, e.g. using P fertilisers at rates as small as 15 kg farm−1 season−1 (i.e. from 7 to 28 kg ha−1). Increasing the area under Napier grass from c. 20 to 40% and reducing the area of maize, beans and sweet potato in farms of Type 3 and 4 increased their primary productivity by c. 1 t ha−1 season−1, their milk production by 156 and 45 L season−1, respectively, but decreased the production of edible energy (by 2000 and 250 \{MJ\} ha−1 season−1) and protein (by 20 and 3 kg ha−1 season−1). By bringing in a more productive cow the primary productivity increased even further in Farm Type 3 (up to 5 t ha−1 season−1), as did milk production (up to c. 1000 L season−1), edible energy (up to c. 10,000 \{MJ\} ha−1 season−1) and protein (up to c. 100 kg ha−1 season−1). The impact of livestock management on the recycling of nutrients and on the efficiency of nutrient use at farm scale can be large, provided that enough nutrients are present in or enter the system to be redistributed. An increase in N cycling efficiency through improved manure handling from 25 to 50% would increase the amount of N cycled in the case study farms of Type 1 and 2 by only ca. 10 kg season−1, and only 1–2 kg season−1 in Type 3 and 4. The various alternatives simulated when disregarding resource constraints contributed to narrow the productivity and efficiency gaps between poorer and wealthier farms. However, the feasibility of implementing such interventions on a large number of farms is questionable. Implications for system (re-)design and intensification strategies are discussed. "

The models were evaluated on their predictive ability to describe short term (3–10 years) food security of smallholder farm households under climate variability and under different scenarios of climate change. The review of 126, mainly production-oriented, farm household models, showed that integrated analyses of food security at the farm household level are scarce. Some models deal with elements of food security, but the models covered in this review are weak on decision-making theory and risk analyses. These aspects need urgent attention for dealing with more complex adaptation and mitigation questions, in the face of climatic change. Approaches that make use of decision making theory and combine the strengths of (dynamic) mathematical programming and expert systems decision models seem promising in this respect. They could support the robust evaluation of climate change impacts and adaptive management options on smallholder systems. "

We estimate the total amounts of (cattle, buffalo, pig and chicken) livestock input required to effect entry and compare and contrast the alternative input requirements. To the extent that our smallholder sample may be representative of a wide and broader set of circumstances, our findings shed light on offsetting impacts of conflicting factors that complicate the roles for policy in the context of expanding the density of participation.

In the second part, the effects of harvesting stage and growing season on the contents of HT, \{CT\} and alkaloids in different plant parts of the widely grown tagasaste variety ‘MOA’ was studied in a randomized complete block design. Regrowths of tagasaste was harvested in one experiment at 4, 6, 8 and 10 months, separated into growing buds, leaves, barks, branches and stems and in another trial at 6 months regrowth during the main rainy, dry and short rainy seasons. The leaves of different tagasaste accessions contained on average 115 g/kg dry matter (DM) \{HT\} in a range of 16–197 and 12.5 abs/g \{NDF\} \{CT\} in a range of 6.9–35.0 abs/g NDF. The edible fractions (growing buds and leaves) were higher in \{HT\} and \{CT\} contents compared to the structural parts (stems and barks). The leaf fraction contained higher \{HT\} and \{CT\} (177.2 g/kg \{DM\} and 20.1 abs/g NDF) and the \{HT\} tended to decline with progressing harvesting stages. High concentration of alkaloids was found in the non-edible fractions, with the highest content in the bark (235 mg/kg) and the lowest in the leaf (40 mg/kg DM) fractions. These levels increased in the fractions from the 4th to the 8th month of harvesting stage and then declined at the 10th month. About 90% of the alkaloids found in tagasaste were sparteine. Higher concentration of \{HT\} was found in tagasaste leaves, harvested during the rainy season compared to the dry season. The concentration of \{CT\} was low during the main rainy season, while the highest was during the short rainy and dry seasons. Contents of \{HT\} and \{CT\} were positively correlated (r = 0.25, P&lt;0.01). However, both the \{HT\} and \{CT\} contents had negative correlation coefficient of r = −0.43 (P&lt;0.001) and r = −0.73 (P&lt;0.001) with alkaloids, respectively. The results of this study showed that varietal selection, and harvesting management could be used as a means to modulate the level of tannins and alkaloids in tagasaste. "

The current vaccines are based on live-attenuated Mmm strains and present problems with temperature stability, duration of immunity and adverse reactions, thus new vaccines are needed to overcome these issues. We used a reverse vaccinology approach to identify 66 Mmm potential vaccine candidates. The selection and grouping of the antigens was based on the presence of specific antibodies in sera from CBPP-positive animals. The antigens were used to immunize male Boran cattle (Bos indicus) followed by a challenge with the Mmm strain Afadé. Two of the groups immunized with five proteins each showed protection after the Mmm challenge (Groups A and C; P &lt; 0.05) and in one group (Group C) Mmm could not be cultured from lung specimens. A third group (Group N) showed a reduced number of animals with lesions and the cultures for Mmm were also negative. While immunization with some of the antigens conferred protection, others may have increased immune-related pathology. This is the first report that Mmm recombinant proteins have been successfully used to formulate a prototype vaccine and these results pave the way for the development of a novel commercial vaccine.

No suppression of protozoal numbers occurred in response to S. sesban supplementation (200 g/day). When rumen fluid removed from sheep on the supplemented diet was tested in vitro, protozoal activity appeared to be inhibited less by S. sesban in the mixed population than in either washed protozoa from the same rumen fluid or than had occurred in Scottish sheep.

Its goals were to: (1) describe the patterns of mortality of female Guinean goats by age, season and year; (2) assess preventive measures against respiratory diseases and gastrointestinal parasitism in reducing mortality; and (3) estimate the overall impact of these measures on survival to 1 year of age. Preventive measures for respiratory disease included vaccination against peste des petits ruminants (PPR) and pneumonic pasteurellosis (Pasteurella multocida types A and D). Control of gastrointestinal parasites was by deworming does with morantel (7.5 mg kg−1, three times during the rainy season). The effects of vaccines and deworming were tested in a randomised factorial field experiment with villages being the experimental units. A total of 19 villages, 113 goat herds and 1458 goats were included in the study. Generalised linear models of survival for five cohorts of goats (defined by five different birth seasons) used a binomial assumption for the response distribution and a complementary log–log link. Explanatory variables included age, season, year, vaccination, deworming and their interactions. A complex a priori model was built on the basis of previous epidemiological knowledge; a purposively selected set of simpler models was compared to this full model by the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and derived statistics. Inference on 1-year survival and treatment effects accounted for model-selection uncertainty. It was carried out with a bootstrap procedure and used information from the whole set of selected models. Large variations in mortality by year and season were observed but no regular seasonal pattern was apparent. Mortality probabilities of kids in dewormed groups decreased quickly after birth, but remained elevated up to 9 months of age in the non-dewormed groups. Deworming lowered the risk of mortality. Vaccination alone was not protective (except during an observed outbreak of PPR). "

This study highlighted the usefulness of graphical methods in their analysis through: (1) the choice of the fixed and random effects and their structure, (2) the assessment of goodness-of-fit and (3) distributional assumptions for random effects and residuals. An \{LMM\} was developed to study the effect of ewe deworming with morantel on lamb pre-weaning growth in a field experiment involving 182 lambs in 45 herds and 10 villages in Kolda, Senegal. Growth was described as a quadratic polynomial of age. Other covariates were sex, litter-size and treatment. The choice of fixed and random effects relied on three graphs: (1) a trellis display of mean live-weight vs. age, to select main effects and interactions (fixed effects); (2) a trellis display of individual growth curves, to decide which growth-curve terms should be included as random effects and (3) a scatter plot of parameters of lamb-specific regressions (live-weight vs. quadratic polynomial of age) to choose the random-effects covariance structure. Age, litter-size, age×litter-size, litter-size×treatment and age×litter-size×treatment were selected graphically as fixed effects and were significant (p&lt;0.05) in subsequent statistical models. The selection of random-effect structures was guided by graphical assessment and comparison of the Akaike’s information criterion for different models. The final random-effects selected included no random effect at the village level but intercept, age and squared-age at the herd and lamb levels. The structure of the random-effects variance–covariance matrices were blocked-diagonal at the herd level and unstructured at the lamb level. An order-1 autoregressive structure was retained to account for serial correlations of residuals. Smaller residual variance at 90 days than at younger ages was modeled with a dummy variable taking a value of 1 at 90 days and 0 elsewhere. Ewe-deworming with morantel during the rainy season lead to higher lamb live-weights (probably related to a better ewe-nutrition and -health status). A positive correlation was demonstrated between early weight and growth rate at the population level (with important lamb and herd-level random deviations). The persistence of this correlation at older ages should be checked to determine whether early weights are good predictors of mature weights and ewe-reproductive lifetime performance. "

We use a general equilibrium model which permits us to explore the sensitivity of our projections to macro-economic uncertainty as well as uncertainty in livestock productivity growth rates. Our analysis shows that China’s net trade position is very sensitive to both of these factors. With high livestock productivity growth and a slow-down in the rest of the economy, China could be a substantial competitor in export markets by 2010. On the other hand, slow productivity growth in livestock production, coupled with a rapidly growing macro-economy could transform China into a major market for future meat exports. "

Data were collected on transfers of materials to obtain N balances on basis of the farm as an entity (“Farm” balances) and for areas under a specific crop or crop mixture (“Cropping Area” balances). Nitrogen balances were mainly negative with positive “Farm” balances featuring only for Zero grazing (16–35 kg ha− 1 season− 1) and Tethering (12 kg ha− 1 season− 1) and positive “Cropping Area” balances only within the Tethering category (1 kg ha− 1 season− 1). Most inefficient utilization of N was within the Zero grazing category where the difference between the “Farm” and “Cropping Area” balances was 55 kg ha− 1 season− 1.

Our data combined with information on biogeography support the hypothesis that the strong genetic structure in Kenyan schistosomes is as a result of limited gene flow and large population sizes.

We selected catchments in the Dega (cool highlands and Woina Dega (warm-to-cool mid-highlands) of the Central Highlands of Ethiopia, to get more insight on how individual land use strategies and access to resources affect the magnitude of nutrient flows and resulting balances and to explore some of reasons of the variability within and between farming systems at different altitudes. Our results show that environmental condition, farming system (e.g. choice of crop), access to resources (e.g. land, livestock and fertilizer) and smallholders’ source of off farm income influence the magnitude of nutrient fluxes and the degree to which nutrient fluxes may be imbalanced. In some respects our results differ from studies carried out at larger (i.e. more aggregated) spatial scales, which consistently show that homestead fields are zones of accumulation and distant fields as zone of depletion. Our results indicate that this is not always the case, and highlight the need for studies at the field and farm scales to include detailed biophysical and socioeconomic information to help explain major nutrient fluxes and to evaluate the system with respect to sustainable production.

The Charm-AIM screening kit used detected antimicrobial residues in up to 16% of marketed milk samples, suggesting an average risk of exposure by consumers of up to five times every month. Higher prevalence levels of the residues were mainly associated with samples obtained lower in the market chain before bulking. Agreement between the Charm-AIM and Charm-SL test, that was used to specifically confirm the presence of β-lactams and tetracyclines, was poor beyond 72 h following drug administration due to differences in detectable limits of the tests.

In recent years increasing offer rates of crop residues (excess feeding) to promote selective feeding by confined animals has been shown to improve utilization of the residues, but no studies have been conducted with dairy animals offered maize stover. This study was conducted to determine the effects of increasing the ad libitum amounts of maize stover offered, on intake, selection and milk production by dairy cattle, when supplemented with cottonseed cake. The effects of post harvest handling on the quality of maize stover were also studied. Hybrid 511 maize was grown under similar agronomic conditions in 2 consecutive years, 1994 and 1995. Maize harvested under dry weather conditions in 1994 produced stover with a higher leaf+sheath+husk:stem ratio (1.48), than maize harvested in 1995 under rainy weather conditions (0.99). In both years, leaves recorded the highest crude protein (CP) contents among the botanical components. Acid detergent lignin (ADL) levels were highest in stem (85 g/kg DM) and lowest in husk (29 g/kg DM). Stem had the lowest digestible organic matter (DOMD) values (405 g/kg DM) while husk had the highest (707 g/kg DM). Stover intake by dairy cows increased significantly from 19 to 26 and then to 30 g DM/kg live weight per day, as the amount of stover offered increased from 31 to 59 and then to 86 g DM/kg live weight per day, respectively. The cows selected for more leaves and husks as the amount of stover offered increased. All animals were supplemented with 3.2 kg DM/day of cottonseed cake. Milk yields increased significantly (P&lt;0.05) from 10.0 to 11.2 and then to 12.2 kg/cow/day. It was concluded that offering excess can be an effective strategy to improve the intake of maize stover and increase milk production although adoption of the technology would depend on other factors such as availability of large amounts of stover and an economical use of the refusals.

In this study, molecular detection of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in mosquito samples from the 2006 to 2007 East African outbreaks was performed using quantitative real-time \{PCR\} assay (qRT-PCR). Specific \{RVFV\} sequence-based primer/fluorogenic (TaqMan) probe sets were derived from the L and S \{RNA\} segments of the virus. Both primer-probe L and S segment-based combinations detected genomic \{RVFV\} sequences, with generally comparable levels of sensitivity. Viral loads from three mosquito species, Aedes mcintoshi, Aedes ochraceus and Mansonia uniformis were estimated and significant differences of between 5- and 1000-fold were detected between Ae. mcintoshi and M. uniformis using both the L and S primer-probe-based assays. The genetic relationships of the viral sequences in mosquito samples were established by partial M segment sequencing and assigned to the two previously described viral lineages defined by analysis of livestock isolates obtained during the 2006–2007 outbreak, confirming that similar viruses were present in both the vector and mammalian host. The data confirms the utility of qRT-PCR for identification and initial quantification of virus in mosquito samples during \{RVFV\} outbreaks. "

Also, T. brucei was detected in the salivary glands, and T. congolense and T. vivax were detected in the mouthparts, however, in dot-ELISA without modification. In all the assays, T. brucei and T. congolense parasites were detected directly using MoAbs specific to each of them, whereas T. simiae parasites were detected by exclusion using a T. congolense specific and Nannomonas subgenus-specific MoAbs. The sensitivity of the assay for detecting midgut infections was 90.5%, 84.6% and 94.4% in detecting T. brucei, T. congolense and T. simiae, respectively. Sample dots stored at room temperature (19–26°C) under desiccated conditions did not show any loss in activity in 90 days. However, after 7 days of storage, a ring-pattern reaction appeared on some sample dots that were tested with T. brucei specific MoAb, irrespective of whether T. brucei antigens were present or not. These ring reactions, however, did not interfere with correct interpretation of the assay results. The specificity of the assay for detection of T. brucei in the salivary glands was 100% and the sensitivity was 90%. Also, T. vivax and T. congolense organisms were each detected in the mouthparts of infected tsetse flies, with 100% specificity.

The prevalence of antibodies to B. abortus varied considerably ranging from none in milk sold in small units and originating from intensive production systems to over 10% in samples that were bulked or originating from extensive production systems. E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from two samples (0.8%), one of which produced VT1.

A second visit was made 1 year later, to obtain follow-up data on births, deaths, dog movements and other events since the first visit. Dog ownership was common, with a range of 53–81% (mean=63%) of households owning dogs in the six sublocations. Dog density for the five more rural sublocations ranged from 6 to 21 dogs km−2 and for the peri-urban sublocation was 110 dogs km−2. The dog population was estimated to be growing at 9% p.a. (95% C.I. 4–14%). This growth was a function of very high fecundity (1.3 females per female per year) more than compensating for high mortality, particularly among females. Life expectancy from birth was 3.5 years for males and 2.4 years for females. Half the dogs at any one time were less than 1 year of age. All dogs, by design of the study, were owned. Of these, 69% were never restricted and roamed freely to forage for food and mix with other dogs. Only a small proportion of dogs (5%) were fed commercial dog food. Most households reported observing dogs scavenging their garbage, including: their own dogs (81%), their neighbours’ dogs (75%) and unknown dogs (45%). Only 29% of dogs at least 3 months of age were reported to be vaccinated against rabies. The proportion vaccinated varied widely between sublocations (5–68%); 48% of dogs reportedly vaccinated had detectable antibodies, 31% at or above levels considered to indicate seroconversion. The proportion of dogs with detectable antibodies declined according to the time since last vaccination (55% if vaccinated ≤1 year, 47% ≤2 years and 36% &gt;2 years); 20% of dogs reported not to have been vaccinated had detectable rabies antibody. Compared to other dog populations in rural eastern and southern Africa, Machakos District has a high density of dogs. The Machakos dog population is growing, highly dynamic, poorly supervised and inadequately vaccinated against rabies. The main implication for rabies control is that adequate vaccination coverage is unlikely to be achieved, even under optimal delivery, using the current strategy of annual vaccination of dogs older than 3 months.

We also examine the alternative hypothesis that rangeland ecosystems and the people they support are highly vulnerable to climate change. Past climate is likely to become an increasingly poor predictor of the future, so there is a risk in relying on adaptation approaches developed solely in response to existing variability. We find incremental, autonomous adaptation will be sufficient to deal with most of the challenges provided by the gradual expression of climate change in the next decade or two. However, projections of greater climate change in the future means that the responses required are qualitatively as well as quantitatively different and are beyond the existing suite of adaptation strategies and coping range. The proactive adaptation responses required go well beyond incremental on-farm or local actions. New policies will be needed to deal with transformational changes associated with land tenure issues and challenges of some displacement and migration of people in vulnerable parts of rangelands. Even where appropriate adaptation actions can be framed, issues of when to act and how much to act in a proactive way remain a challenge for research, management, and policy. Whether incremental or transformational involving system changes, a diversity of adaptation options will be required in different rangeland regions to enhance social and ecological resilience. "

The diversity across populations was determined by the mean number of different alleles, mean number of effective alleles, mean number of private allele and expected heterozygosity. The mean number of allele unique to populations for Cattle close to buffalo, Muguga, Njombe, Kibaha, Lushoto and Buffalo populations were 0.18, 0.24, 0.63, 0.71, 1.63 and 3.37, respectively.

The important characteristics of the vaccine were (1) a delay in development of full protection, (2) prevention of clinical disease but not of infection and (3) a waning period of protection in the absence of challenge. We considered three different scenarios in which the vaccine might be used: prophylactically in susceptible cattle prior to the introduction of infection into a herd; in susceptible cattle in the face of an epidemic (i.e., when the infection is introduced and disease is first noticed); and at equilibrium (i.e., when parasite, vector and host have been co-existing for some time). The epidemic rise in infection was modelled assuming two different patterns (i.e., resulting from slow and fast increases in tick challenge). Vaccination (administered both in the face of an epidemic and prophylactically) reduced and delayed the peak of the epidemic. With insufficiently frequent revaccination, this can result in the epidemic occurring during a period of susceptibility, so that the benefit derived from a more-efficacious vaccine is lower than that from a less-efficacious vaccine. A vaccine of only 30% or 50% efficacy (if given to the whole herd) can have important effects on both morbidity and mortality if administered with sufficient frequency. However, a highly efficacious vaccine (e.g., 90%) can have only minimal effect if revaccination occurs too infrequently – especially if the epidemic of disease occurs when tick challenge is high and vaccination-related immunity has waned. There was a fairly consistent pattern of decreasing returns on increasing protection, although this was reversed in the situation of annual vaccination undertaken prophylactically combined with an epidemic of infection that occurred when the tick challenge was relatively low. Vaccination in equilibrium situations was most beneficial at low and intermediate tick challenges. There was very little effect of vaccination in high-transmission areas regardless of vaccine efficacy and/or frequency of revaccination because most animals were infected during periods of innate or maternally derived immunity (i.e., under endemic stability). Our results suggest that where relatively high tick challenge can be achieved and consistently maintained, vaccination may be used in susceptible herds to minimise losses in a policy of transition to endemic stability.

Ten strains of T. evansi and 11 strains of T. equiperdum originating from Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America were tested. Rabbit pre-infection sera and sera of days 7, 14, 25, 35 post-infection (p.i.) were analyzed for the presence of antibodies reactive with RoTat 1.2 in immune trypanolysis, ELISA/T. evansi and CATT/T. evansi. Within the duration of the infection (maximum 35 days), all T. evansi as well as 9 out of 11 T. equiperdum infected rabbits became positive in all these tests. The rabbits infected with T. equiperdum \{OVI\} (South Africa) and BoTat 1.1 (Morocco) remained negative in the immune trypanolysis test although the latter rabbit became positive in the CATT/T. evansi and ELISA/T. evansi. On the contrary, both rabbits were positive in immune trypanolysis when tested against their respective infecting population. From these data, we conclude that most T. equiperdum strains express isoVATs of RoTat 1.2. This explains, in part, why antibody tests based on T. evansi RoTat 1.2 cannot reliably distinguish between infections caused by T. evansi and those caused by T. equiperdum unless it can be proven that most described T. equiperdum are actually misclassified T. evansi.

abstract = "Summary This paper explores local empowerment, income generation opportunities, and environmental sustainability under varying scales of woodlot management in Ethiopia. We find that more devolved woodlot management empowers resource users, providing greater decision-making autonomy regarding harvesting and management. Our economic analysis indicates that there has been limited harvesting of high value products such as poles and fuelwood. Labor inputs declined, tree survival rates increased, and average annual net benefits improved as woodlot management was devolved, indicating improved efficiency with more localized management. Environmental sustainability was associated with less devolved woodlot management. This study highlights the trade-offs inherent in devolution reforms. "

In this case, the ability to cooperate in the management of common access resources determines the relative profitability of the two resource bundles, hence, affecting the allocation of resources held by households to one or the other. The Mexican social sector is of this type, with land under individual jurisdiction allocated to either crops or pastures: the product of land in crops is privately appropriated, while land in pastures is collectively grazed. We develop a model that shows that, when cooperation fails in the management of collectively grazed pastures, more land is allocated to crops than under successful cooperation and less to pastures, while the stocking rate on pastures is increased. This results in too much land in extensive crops and too many animals per hectare of pasture—a well-known observation for Mexico. This prediction is confirmed by analysis of data from a sample of Mexican social sector households. "

The absence of surveillance programs and diagnostic laboratory facilities have resulted in a lack of data on rotavirus associated diarrheas in pigs in East Africa. Here we describe the incidence of group A rotavirus (RVA) infections in asymptomatic young pigs in East Africa. Of the 446 samples examined, 26.2% (117/446) were positive for RVA. More nursing piglets (78.7%) shed \{RVA\} than weaned (32.9%) and grower (5.8%) pigs. \{RVA\} incidence was higher in pigs that were either housed_free-range (77.8%) or tethered_free-range (29.0%) than those that were free-range or housed or housed-tethered pigs. The farms with larger herd size (&gt;10 pigs) had higher \{RVA\} prevalence (56.5%) than farms with smaller herd size (24.1–29.7%). This study revealed that age, management system and pig density significantly (p &lt; 0.01) influenced the incidence of \{RVA\} infections, with housed_free-range management system and larger herd size showing higher risks for \{RVA\} infection. Partial (811–1604 nt region) sequence of the \{VP4\} gene of selected positive samples revealed that different genotypes (P[6], P[8] and P[13]) are circulating in the study area with P[8] being predominant. The P[6] strain shared nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) sequence identity of 84.4–91.3% and 95.1–96.9%, respectively, with known porcine and human P[6] strains. The P[8] strains shared high nt and aa sequence identity with known human P[8] strains ranging from 95.6–100% to 92–100%, respectively. The P[13] strains shared nt and aa sequence identity of 83.6–91.7% and 89.3–96.4%, respectively, only with known porcine P[13] strains. No P[8] strains yielded \{RNA\} of sufficient quality/quantity for full genome sequencing. However analysis of the full genome constellation of the P[6], two P[13] and one untypeable strains revealed that the P[6] strain (Ke-003-5) genome constellation was G26-P[6]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1, P[13] strains (Ug-049 and Ug-453) had G5-P[13]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T7-E1-H1 while the untypeable strain (Ug-218) had G5-P[?]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H? In conclusion, P[6] and P[8] genotypes detected were genetically closely related to human strains suggesting the possibility of interspecies transmission. Further studies are required to determine the role of \{RVA\} in swine enteric disease burden and to determine the genetic/antigenic heterogeneity of the circulating strains for development of accurate diagnostic tools and to implement appropriate prophylaxis programs.

Computer-driven algorithms that facilitate the discovery of T cell epitopes from protein and genome sequences are now being used to accelerate preclinical studies of human vaccines. Similar tools are not yet available for predicting T cell epitopes for animal vaccines, but there may be sufficient data available to begin the process of compiling the algorithms. We describe the construction of a novel mathematical ‘matrix’ that describes the properties of bovine major histocompatibility complex (BoLA) system antigen (BoLA) A-11 peptide ligands, developed for use with EpiMatrix, an existing T cell epitope-mapping algorithm. An alternative means of developing BoLA matrices, using the pocket profile method, is also discussed. Matrices such as the one described here may be used to develop T cell epitope-mapping tools for cattle and other ruminants. Epitope-mapping algorithms offer a significant advantage over other methods of epitope selection, such as the screening of synthetic overlapping peptides, because high throughput screening can be performed in silico, followed by ex vivo confirmatory studies. Furthermore, using epitope-mapping algorithms, putative T cell epitopes can be derived directly from genomic sequences, allowing researchers to circumvent labor-intensive cloning steps in the genome-to-vaccine discovery pathway.

In each zone, a cross-sectional study was performed in the main farming systems (smallholder (SH) and large-scale commercial (LSC) beef and dairy), followed by longitudinal studies in the same sectors to improve data accuracy for some parameters. Suspected heartwater-specific mortality in cattle was similar in all \{LSC\} sectors (p = 0.72) accounting for a median 1% mortality risk. Heartwater-specific mortality in \{SH\} areas was not assessed due to poor diagnostic ability of the farmers. Few \{LSC\} farms and \{SH\} households kept sheep; suspected heartwater-specific mortality in \{LSC\} sheep was 0.8% in the lowveld and 2.4% in the highveld. Goats were a major enterprise in \{SH\} areas but not on \{LSC\} farms. Suspected heartwater mortality in \{LSC\} goats was 0.8% at one site in the highveld and 17.5% on a farm in the lowveld. Application of acaricides was the major control method for heartwater and other tick-borne diseases on both \{SH\} and \{LSC\} farms. On \{LSC\} farms, plunge dipping was used most frequently and the number of acaricide applications ranged widely between 3 and 52 per year. The total cost of acaricides per head per annum was higher in highveld dairies than in highveld and lowveld beef enterprises (p = 0.03). In \{SH\} areas, cattle plunge dipping was conducted by the government with an average frequency of 8 ± 2 (sd) immersions per annum in both the lowveld and highveld. The type of tick control on sheep and goats in all production systems was highly variable (ranging from none to hand removal or intensive acaricide treatment). Suspected heartwater cases on \{LSC\} farms were treated with tetracyclines; treatment was not reported in \{SH\} areas. Reported treatment costs were high (median Z$120) and highly variable (range Z$4–833). Vaccination against heartwater with the live, blood-based vaccine was reported on only one \{LSC\} farm. \{LSC\} farms applying acaricide 30 or more times per year reported higher morbidity (p &lt; 0.0001) and mortality (p &lt; 0.0001) than farms applying acaricides less than 30 times a year. This finding supports the use of reduced tick control in the management of heartwater in Zimbabwe. "

The traits considered were litter size, lambing frequency, pre-weaning, and post-weaning lamb survival to 12 months, ewe survival, lamb live weight at 12-month, mature ewe live weight, consumable meat, kg of manure \{DM\} sold per ewe per year and residual \{DM\} feed intake. Three evaluation situations were considered: (i) base with constant number of ewes, (ii) fixed feed resource and (iii) setting feed costs to zero. Sensitivity analysis of economic values to price levels of inputs and meat production was carried out. The fixed feed resource situation appropriately describes smallholder production circumstances. In the base situation, meat production accounted for about 88% of revenue and manure the remaining 12%. Variable costs represented about 95% of the total cost. For the fixed feed resource situation, economic values (US$ per ewe per year) were 12.94 for litter size, 10.18 for lambing frequency, 0.19 for pre-weaning lamb survival, 0.24 for post-weaning lamb survival, 0.36 for ewe survival, 1.02 for 12-month lamb live weight, 0.14 for mature ewe live weight, 0.51 for consumable meat, 0.08 for kg of manure \{DM\} sold (per ewe per year) and −0.04 for residual \{DM\} feed intake. Litter size and lambing frequency were the most important traits in a breeding objective for smallholder production. Relative to the base situation, setting feed costs to zero had similar results as the situation with restricted feed resource but resulted in larger differences. Sensitivity analysis of economic weights to changes in prices and production circumstances indicated that future economic values for traits might change dependent on levels of output and prices. The exceptions, with regard to changes in meat price are kg of manure \{DM\} sold per ewe per year and residual \{DM\} feed intake, and with regard to feed costs are consumable meat and kg of manure \{DM\} sold per ewe per year. Economic values for 12-month lamb live weight, mature ewe live weight, consumable meat, kg of manure \{DM\} sold per ewe per year and residual \{DM\} feed intake were not sensitive to changes in management and marketing circumstances. Caution is recommended when the breeding objectives presented here are applied not to disadvantage smallholders in poor climatic years, when farmers are at their most vulnerable situation. "

Over the last 30 years, livestock-to-human ratios have generally declined to levels that will no longer support pure pastoralism. Many Maasai have thus diversified into cultivation, wage labour, and small businesses. Livelihood expectations are rising, with concomitant increases in the need for cash. We describe the modification of PHEWS, a simple rule-based model that tracks cash flow and calories in agro-pastoral households. We use it, coupled to Savanna, a sophisticated ecosystem model, to quantify some of the effects of subdivision and land fragmentation on household livestock numbers and on food security. For the group ranches simulated, model outputs indicate that subdivision results in substantial reductions in livestock numbers, partially because households have to sell more animals to generate the cash needed, with serious long-term consequences on herd sizes and food security. If subdivision occurs, even to parcels as large as 196 km2, livelihood strategies may need to be modified to maintain current levels of household well-being. Model results have been discussed in community meetings in southern Kajiado, but more work is needed on communication mechanisms to utilise more effectively the results of imperfect but useful integrated assessments of complex problems concerning land use and human well-being.

Soil data are often unavailable, particularly for many locations in the tropical and subtropical regions. If little or nothing is known about the soil profile for a particular location, a soil database can be used to estimate some of its parameters, based on a comparison with other soils from the same region. The \{WISE\} database is one of the most comprehensive soil databases, with samples well distributed in the World. The resulting soil profile can then be used as input parameters for a model to simulate growth, development and yield for one or more crops for this location. With multiple profiles available for many soil classes, it is possible to obtain an indication about the range of values for each soil parameter and then conduct an uncertainty analysis with respect to the model's response to this range. All soil profiles have been geo-referenced, and can thus be linked to the digital version of the FAO-UNESCO soil map of the world. We describe the methods used to convert the soil profile database, discuss the variability of key soil variables by soil class, illustrate how the database can be used, and conclude with recommendations for further work to improve the database for biophysical modeling applications.

Here, we analyze the changes associated with direct and indirect use of freshwater and land for meat and milk production in three production systems in Kenya between the 1980s and 2000s. We use two resource use indicators, the water footprint (m3/year) and land footprint (ha), to assess changes in freshwater and land use for cattle, goats, sheep and camels in arid, semi-arid and humid production systems. We estimate actual water and land use using Kenya-wide data for yields, feed composition and feed conversion efficiencies. Our results show that the amounts of freshwater and land resources used for production are determined mainly by production volumes and feed conversion efficiencies. Total water and land footprints of milk production increased for goats, sheep and camels but decreased by half for cattle in arid and semi-arid production systems, in correspondence with similar changes in the total numbers of each livestock species. Green water and grazing land footprints dominated in all production systems due to the predominance of indirect use of water to support forage production. The per unit meat footprint for cattle increased significantly between the 1980s and 2000s in all production systems, due to adverse trends in feed conversion efficiency, while changes in the water and land footprints of other animal products were small, due to modest changes in all influencing factors. In contrast, national average footprints per unit of beef and milk show a modest decrease due to a relative shift of production to the more resource-efficient humid production system. Given the potential increase in demand for livestock products and limited freshwater and land availability, feed conversion efficiencies should be improved by rehabilitating degraded rangelands, adopting improved breeds and using appropriate feed composition.

Erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) was cloned and sequenced from the two breeds of cattle. A single position mutation of Tyr in the Boran to His in the N’Dama predicted amino acid sequence was revealed. The mRNA transcription of erythropoietin (Epo) in kidneys and EpoR in the bone marrow of infected cattle was determined by competitive reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Though Epo mRNA transcription increased in the kidneys during infection, the increase was not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05) between the two breeds of infected cattle. The level of EpoR transcripts in the bone marrow of infected N’Damas was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) than that detected in the marrows from infected Boran cattle. While infection seem to increase levels of transcription of IL-1α and β, and TNFα in kidneys from both Boran and N’Dama cattle, no significant difference was detected in the level of mRNAs of these cytokines in the kidney from the two breed of cattle. The amount of IFNγ mRNA transcripts were not changed with infection in N’Dama cattle, while on the contrary a significant higher levels of IFNγ was found in kidneys from infected Boran cattle as compared to the other groups. A significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in the levels of IL-1α and β, and IFNγ mRNA transcripts were detected in the marrows of infected Borans as compared to the infected N’Dama cattle. In this study the increase in the level of TNFα mRNA in the marrows of the two infected breeds was not different. This implies there is no negative effect of TNFα on hematopoiesis during acute infection. These findings suggest that the levels of Epo and EpoR in the infected Boran cattle were inadequate for their degree of anemia, which might be due in part to high expression of IFNγ during acute infection with T. congolense.

As such, it is home to a large number of endemic fauna and flora species. Yet the remaining natural forest is under imminent threat of degradation due to a rapidly growing population in its vicinity and a poverty rate far above the national average. The growing demand for forest resources and ecosystem services will continue to exert great pressure on the remaining forest fragments. In this paper, we predict future hotspots of forest clearing of the remaining natural and old-growth secondary forest in Kakamega Forest. We parameterized an artificial neural network model using resilient backpropagation to simulate the likelihood of forest clearing for each location. Input variables into the network included historic information on forest clearings together with variables capturing the status of forest protection, accessibility to roads and markets, as well as topography and forest density. Simulation results were used to predict future clearings based on observed rates of change. Hotspots of forest clearing were derived by assessing the neighborhood density of predicted clearings. Our results indicate that forest clearings occurred across all forest fragments. Hotspots of future forest clearing tended to occur near roads and market centers. Most future hotspots were found in areas with a lower protection status, where some forest use is allowed. But our model also predicted considerable pressure on remaining old-growth forest resources in the strictly protected National Reserve. Our predictions of deforestation hotspots contribute to a better geographic targeting of nature protection activities and forest management investments in Kakamega Forest. Thus, it will hopefully help policy makers and land managers to strike a balance between satisfying the needs of local livelihoods and preserving the unique ecological values of Kakamega Forest for future generations.

Methodologies were compared to determine which was best able to describe the physical strength of the samples. Both the grinding resistance and the shear strength technique were able to detect differences between Brachiaria species and ages of re-growth. However, the shear strength technique was more sensitive for identifying physical strength differences at the species level. Both techniques identified the same species (Brachiaria ruziziensis) as the softest, but subsequent ranking of species by the shear strength technique depended on the leaf morphological characteristic used to express the results. Shear strength measurements were correlated to the cell wall components and \{IVDMD\} of the samples. The highest correlations were obtained for acid detergent fibre (ADF), cellulose and lignin with shear strength measurements expressed per unit of leaf width (kg/cm), per unit of linear density (kg/g cm) and for the raw shear strength data (kg). Grinding resistance was not correlated to the chemical composition and \{IVDMD\} of the samples. Preferential use of the shear strength technique is suggested since it provides a sensitive measure of the physical strength of forage leaf tissue and is a suitable indicator for identifying nutritive quality differences between Brachiaria species.

Combined gas volume and true degradability measurements in vitro were used to calculate a partitioning factor (PF), being the ratio of mg substrate degraded to ml of gas produced. In the automated test, kinetics of gas production were described by a three phase model: y = a 1 / ( 1 + ( b 1 / t ) c 1 ) + ⋯ + a 3 / ( 1 + ( b 3 / t ) c 3 ) , where y is the gas volume at time t and a1–a3 are the volumes of gas in the pools, b1–b3, the time when half of the gas volume of a given pool is produced and c1–c3 describe the switching characteristics of the curves by pool. The model fitted gas production profiles, but there was no relationship between curve parameters and \{DMI\} in multiple regressions (R2 = 0.24, P=0.06).

A parasite, which has not yet been formally named, known as Theileria sp. (buffalo) has been recognized as a potentially distinct species based on rDNA sequence, since 1993. We demonstrate using reverse line blot (RLB) and sequencing of 18S rDNA genes, that in an area where buffalo and cattle co-graze and there is a heavy tick challenge, T. sp. (buffalo) can frequently be isolated in culture from cattle leukocytes. We also show that T. sp. (buffalo), which is genetically very closely related to T. parva, according to 18s rDNA sequence, has a conserved orthologue of the polymorphic immunodominant molecule (PIM) that forms the basis of the diagnostic \{ELISA\} used for T. parva serological detection. Closely related orthologues of several \{CD8\} T cell target antigen genes are also shared with T. parva. By contrast, orthologues of the T. parva p104 and the p67 sporozoite surface antigens could not be amplified by \{PCR\} from T. sp. (buffalo), using conserved primers designed from the corresponding T. parva sequences. Collectively the data re-emphasise doubts regarding the value of rDNA sequence data alone for defining apicomplexan species in the absence of additional data. ‘Deep 454 pyrosequencing’ of \{DNA\} from two Theileria sporozoite stabilates prepared from Rhipicephalus appendiculatus ticks fed on buffalo failed to detect T. sp.

While considerable attention has been directed at improving crop yields to alleviate the pressure on land, there has been far less attention on the implications of the expected intensification of livestock production. Here, we present and analyse the land availability and land footprints of livestock intensification for five scenarios representing various degrees of intensification of meat and milk production by cattle, sheep, goats and camels in arid, semi-arid and humid production systems in Kenya. The first three scenarios are defined by increasing levels of input and management, ranging from low (scenario S1), intermediate (S2) to high (S3) input feed crop cultivation and livestock production. Reference scenario \{S1\} has production practices and output of meat and milk similar to current production practices. In scenarios \{S2\} and S3, the total land used for livestock production remains the same as in S1. Two additional scenarios, \{S4\} and S5, explore opportunities for lessening environmental pressure through reduction of the land footprint of meat and milk production. For each scenario, we quantify the potential availability of grassland and cropland for meat and milk production by cattle, sheep, goats and camel in the arid, semi-arid and humid production systems. A resource use indicator, land footprint (ha), is used to assess changes in land use associated with livestock production. We estimate that the potential increase in production due to intensification from scenario \{S1\} to \{S2\} is 51% for milk and 71% for meat. The potential increase due to improving production from scenario \{S1\} to \{S3\} is 80% for milk and 113% for meat. The area of grazing land, as a percentage of the total potentially available grazing land, decreases from 10% to 6% as productivity increases from scenario \{S1\} to S5. Cropland usage increases from 4% in scenario \{S1\} to 11% in scenario S5. Reduced land demand in scenarios \{S4\} and \{S5\} indicates the possibility that intensification may help reduce the pressure on land and hence promote environmental conservation. Overall, the results suggest that it is possible to increase production to meet increasing demands for meat and milk while also gaining land for environmental conservation through intensification. Realizing the potential presented by the intensification scenarios will be contingent upon successfully establishing and operationalizing enabling policies, institutional arrangements and markets and ensuring that relevant information, services, inputs, and other essential requirements are available, accessible and affordable to herders and farmers.

Such data are generally difficult to obtain from the literature, field surveys and focused group discussions, or from biophysical experiments. This article describes a spreadsheet-based methodology that generates this information based on a region specific production function and ‘target yield’ approach in current and future climate scenarios. Target yields are identified for homogeneous agroecological spatial units using published crop yield datasets, crop models, expert judgement, biophysical land characterisations, assessment of yield gaps and future development strategies. Validated production/transfer functions are used to establish relationships between inputs (water, seed, fertilizer, machinery, energy, labour, costs) and outputs (crop yields, residues, water and fertiliser use efficiencies, greenhouse gas emissions, financial returns). The process is repeated for all spatial units of the region, identified through detailed mapping of critical biophysical factors, and for all suitable current and potential agronomic production technologies and practices. The application of this approach is illustrated for prioritizing agronomic interventions that can enhance productivity and incomes, help farmers adapt to current risk, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions in current and future climates for the flood- and drought-prone state of Bihar in north-eastern India. In general, climate smartness increases with advanced technologies. Yield is the least limiting while emission is the most limiting factor across the entire crop-technology portfolio for climate smartness. Finally, we present a robust climate smart land use plan at district level in Bihar under current and future climate scenarios. "

abstract = "Trypanotolerance is the capacity of certain West-African, taurine breeds of cattle to remain productive and gain weight after trypanosome infection. Laboratory studies, comparing Trypanosoma congolense infections in trypanotolerant N'Dama cattle (Bos taurus) and in more susceptible Boran cattle (Bos indicus), confirmed the field observations. Experiments using haemopoietic chimeric twins, composed of a tolerant and a susceptible co-twin, and T cell depletion studies suggested that trypanotolerance is composed of two independent traits. The first is a better capacity to control parasitaemia and is not mediated by haemopoietic cells, T lymphocytes or antibodies. The second is a better capacity to limit anaemia development and is mediated by haemopoietic cells, but not by T lymphocytes or antibodies. Weight gain was linked to the latter mechanism, implying that anaemia control is more important for survival and productivity than parasite control. Anemia is a marker for a more complex pathology which resembles human haemophagocytic syndrome: hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia and a large number of hyperactivated phagocytosing macrophages in bone marrow, liver and other tissues. Thus, mortality and morbidity in trypanosome-infected cattle are primarily due to self-inflicted damage by disproportionate immune and/or innate responses. These features of bovine trypanotolerance differ greatly from those in murine models. In mice, resistance is a matter of trypanosome control dependent on acquired immunity. However, a model of anaemia development can be established using C57BL/6J mice. As in cattle, the induction of anaemia was independent of T cells but its development differed with different trypanosome strains. Identification of the molecular pathways that lead to anaemia and haemophagocytosis should allow us to design new strategies to control disease. "

Substantial experience and information generated from a large number of household-level studies is not being utilised by macro- and aggregate models which fail to recognise heterogeneity, dynamics and fundamental drivers of change in livestock systems. Household-level studies are not standardised and rarely identify and characterise key drivers and mechanisms for exploiting heterogeneity in policy analysis. The paper provides an overview of a set of six papers contained in a special edition which define and address this gap in analytical approaches and identify aspects of the way forward. Evidence is presented of inconsistencies and practicalities which emphasise the gap, but all papers present evidence of integrative progress and list opportunities for accelerating it. Constraints on the subject matter are outlined and a challenge to livestock policy analysts is made. "

This study was carried out to evaluate the performance of smallholder dairy farms by analysing available data and by simulation modelling. Eighteen case farms were selected non-randomly on the basis of differences in reported milk production, based on the amount of milk delivered to a dairy society. Data of these smallholder dairy farms were collected by means of a questionnaire and included all farm resources and enterprises. The Technology Impact Evaluation Simulator (TIES), a Monte Carlo computer simulation model, provides a method for evaluating the financial and economic impacts of technology changes on a whole-farm basis, and explicitly incorporates risk. The simulation of each case farm in the Murang'a District with \{TIES\} gave an indication of the variation in economic performance of these farms. A sensitivity analysis on the economic terms pointed out the key indicators for successful farm performance. The smallholder dairy farms investigated differed in farm performance—itself strongly influenced by the performance of the dairy enterprise of the farm. Milk production and calving interval were the main indicators describing the performance of the dairy enterprise and, through that, overall farm performance. Both milk production and calving interval were influenced by the amount of concentrates fed—suggesting that feeding concentrates is an important indicator of high farm performance. The influence of health-services costs on farm performance was not significant. Off-farm income also influenced overall farm performance; farms heavily dependent on off-farm income were often inefficient in their dairy enterprise. "

One group (three animals) was directly supplemented with 300 g per head day−1 of sun-dried A. angustissima. These animals died after 9 and 21 days and consumed only 75-100 g day−1 of the supplement at any time. The second group (three animals) was gradually adapted by offering incremental levels of 50, 75, 100, 150 and 200 g per head day−1 of A. angustissima for 21 days per level. The gradually adapted animals did not develop toxicity symptoms suggesting adaptation of microflora in the rumen or ability to modify the toxic principle in the plant. Transfer of rumen contents from the adapted animals to other unadapted sheep provided protection from A. angustissima toxicity when the animals were suddenly challenged with 200 g per head day−1 of A. angustissima after the transfer. Numbers of ciliate protozoa and fungal sporangia were estimated. The protozoal numbers fluctuated with the level of the supplement and numbers decreased in sheep consuming 100, 150 and 200 g of the supplement. The fungal sporangia numbers were inversely related to protozoal numbers. Effect on in sacco fibre (native hay) degradation was also investigated. There was no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05) in fibre degradation in sheep supplemented with A. angustissima compared with those fed maize stover alone. The effect of level of supplement was, however, significant (P &lt; 0.01). In vitro effect of A. angustissima on mixed ruminal bacteria was investigated using gas and volatile fatty acid (VFA) production as indices of fermentation. Gas and \{VFA\} production from A. angustissima were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) lower than those from Sesbania sesban (used as control) at 12 h. Acetone (70%) extracts of A. angustissima inhibited the growth of Ruminococcus albus 8, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, Prevotella ruminicola \{D31D\} and Streptococcus bovis \{JB1\} while Selenomonas ruminantium D was not affected at the levels used.

Supplements of Sesbania and Chamaecytisus sp. promoted higher N retention compared with unsupplemented roughage. The ILRI's work on evaluation of \{MPTs\} demonstrated that type, form and quantity affect microbe-MPT interactions and, consequently, the utilization of the basal diet. Using gas production as an index of fermentation, it was shown that Chamaecytisus palmensis (Tagasaste) is fermented rapidly while Acacia angustissima is fermented slowly by mixed ruminal microbes. Volatile fatty acid (VFA) analysis showed that mixed ruminal microbes produced most (63.9 μmol/ml) \{VFAs\} from Sesbania sesban while A. angustissima fermentation produced the least (15 μmol/ml) amount at 12 h.

This study compared the plant-available water in the soil layer and the water use efficiency of local wheat and eight other cropping options and also assessed the grain and fodder productivities. Replacing late-sown local wheat with an early-sown improved wheat variety (ET-13) improved the utilization of the plant-available water during the rainy season and significantly increased grain and straw yields with a high rate of water use efficiency. The variations of the available moisture in the soil layer between the different cropping options tested were small during the rainy months of July and August due to the continuing replenishment of the used water. Differences of plant-available water in both upper and lower soil layers for the various cropping options became distinct at the onset of the dry season. Even though results showed that growing of a sequential crop, such as grass pea, following wheat is possible with a starter irrigation in the dry season, yields were generally depressed. "

Observed and expected increases in future demand for livestock products in developing countries provide unique opportunities for improving livelihoods and linked to that, improving stewardship of the environment. This cannot be a passive process and needs to be supported by enabling policies and pro-poor investments in institutional capacities and technologies. Sustaining intensification of smallholder livestock systems must take into account both social and environmental welfare and be targeted to sectors and areas of most probable positive social welfare returns and where natural resource conditions allow for intensification. Smallholders are competitive in ruminant systems, particularly dairy, because of the availability of family labour and the ability of ruminants to exploit lower quality available roughage. Smallholders compete well in local markets which are important in agriculturally-based or transforming developing countries. However, as production and marketing systems evolve, support to smallholders to provide efficient input services, links to output markets and risk mitigation measures will be important if they are to provide higher value products. Innovative public support and links to the private sector will be required for the poor to adapt and benefit as systems evolve. Likewise targeting is critical to choosing which systems with livestock can be intensified. Some intensive river basin systems have little scope for intensification. More extensive rain-fed systems, particularly in Africa, could intensify with enabling policies and appropriate investments. In more fragile environments, de-intensification is required to avoid irreversible damage to ecosystems. Attention to both social and environmental sustainability are critical to understanding trade-offs and incentives and to bridging important gaps in the perspectives on livestock production between rich and poor countries and peoples. Two specific examples in which important elements of sustainable intensification can be illustrated, smallholder dairy systems in East Africa and South Asia and small ruminant meat systems in Sub-Saharan Africa, are discussed.

abstract = "Resistance to nematode parasites can be improved by selection, but efforts to include appropriate traits in commercial livestock breeding programs are only a recent development. Procedures for including resistance in breeding programs are similar to those involving other traits. The steps are described with special reference to sheep, and areas are highlighted where particular considerations exist. Three approaches are described and contrasted: breeding for resistance (reduced parasite numbers, as determined by faecal worm egg count); resilience (production during parasitism); or number of treatments required during parasitism. It is necessary, but difficult, to assess the economic benefits of improving resistance relative to other traits. Disease costs vary widely depending on the prevalence of the disease and on the availability, effectiveness and sustainability of alternative control measures. Costs of treatment and control are relatively simple to estimate for a given situation, but production losses are more difficult. Methods of dealing with this problem are discussed. Breeding for disease resistance usually requires that either selection candidates, or their relatives, are exposed to the pathogen so that resistance levels can be compared. Parasitic diseases generally create no special ethical problems in a breeding program unless natural challenge levels are insufficient to enable discrimination between hosts in their susceptibility. In the longer term, it is desirable that selection criteria for all major diseases be developed that will be informative in healthy animals. Molecular genetic markers offer promise, but simple genetic markers have so far been as elusive as physiological traits to predict resistance in undiseased animals. In the longer term, useful genetic markers will be found and techniques for combining these with phenotypic information need to be developed. Commercial breeding programs for sheep which include resistance to gastrointestinal roundworms are now operating in Australia and New Zealand, and issues related to breeding in the tropics are discussed.

These \{MHC\} class I allelic variants differ by a single amino acid polymorphism (Glu97 to Leu97) in the peptide-binding groove. We have previously mapped an 11-mer peptide epitope from the Theileria parva antigen Tp1 (Tp1214–224) that is presented by BoLA-6*01301. Crystal structure data indicates that Glu97 in the \{MHC\} molecule plays a role in epitope binding through electro-static interaction with a lysine residue in position 5 of the epitope, which also functions as an additional anchor residue. In contrast to expectations, we demonstrate that the amino acid substitution in BoLA-6*01302 does not divert the \{CTL\} response away from Tp1214–224. The two \{MHC\} molecules exhibit similar affinity for the Tp1 epitope and can present the epitope to parasite-specific \{CTLs\} derived from either BoLA allelic variants. These data confirm that this BoLA polymorphism does not alter Tp1 epitope specificity and that both allelic variants can be used for Tp1 vaccine studies. "

Fodder trees are easy to grow, require little land, labor or capital, have numerous by-products and often supply feed within a year after planting. Key challenges constraining the uptake of fodder trees include limited species appropriate to different agroecological zones, shortages of seed and that many farmers lack knowledge and skills needed to grow them.

The mechanisms by which this cytokine can influence parasitemia and survival are unknown. Therefore, the levels of acute phase proteins and other inflammatory cytokines were monitored in trypano-tolerant wild-type and TNF-α-deficient mice during a T. congolense infection. The titres of ceruloplasmin (CP), α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and serum amyloid P (SAP) increased and reached their peaks at 11 days post-infection, when the first peak of parasitemia was observed. No significant differences were observed in the acute phase protein profiles between the two mouse strains. Also the profiles of serum titres of IFN-γ, IL-1α, IL-6 and IL-10 were not significantly different. Our present results indicate that acute phase protein and cytokine responses can be induced in the absence of TNF-α during a T. congolense infection in mice, and that the susceptibility of the TNF-α-deficient mice is not due to modulation of expression of these molecules.

Dismal performance of programmes involving breed substitution of exotics for indigenous breeds and crossbreeding with temperate breeds have stimulated a recent re-orientation of breeding programmes in tropical countries to utilize indigenous breeds, and most programmes are incipient. The success rate of some breeding programmes involving native breeds is encouraging. Definition of comprehensive breeding objectives incorporating the specific, immediate, and long-term social and economic circumstances of the target group as well as ecological constraints was found lacking in some projects that failed.

Low Ki values, in the 10 pM range, were found for the interaction of both proteinases with natural cystatin inhibitors. The kinetic constants for the hydrolysis of cystatin-derived substrates, and the inhibition by related diazomethanes were essentially identical. Unlike cathepsins B and L, the related mammal papain family proteinases, congopain and cruzipain accomodate a prolyl residue in P2′. Substrates having the sequence \{VGGP\} from \{P2\} to P2′ were hydrolysed by both congopain and cruzipain with a kcat/Km greater than 4.103 mM−1 s−1. Irreversible diazomethane inhibitors, deduced from the unprime sequence of cystatin-derived substrates, inhibited the two parasite proteinases. N-terminal labelling of diazomethanes with a biotin group did not alter the rate of inhibition significantly, which provides a useful tool for examining the distribution of these enzymes in the parasite and in the host. Despite their similar activities on cystatin-derived substrates, congopain and cruzipain had significantly different pH-activity profiles when assayed with a cystatin-derived substrate. They were correlated with structural differences, especially at the presumed \{S2\} subsites. "

This paper presents information on performance of Toggenburg dairy goats under smallholder production systems in a medium to high agricultural potential environment in Kenya under a community-based set-up as part of the characterization of its adaptive and productive attributes. Environmental factors affecting growth of 646 goats born in the environment, and fertility and milk production of 160 does from 1997 to 2005 were evaluated. Genetic parameters were also estimated for early growth traits. The average birth weight (BW) for 607 kids was 3.27 kg. Corrected weaning weights (CW), and average daily gain to weaning (ADG) for 646 kids were 19.12 kg and 136 g/day, respectively. The results indicated that the smallholder farmers were able to maintain comparably high levels of milk production in the first three parities (LMY), with yields of 475 ± 9 l in 201 days for 160 does in the first parity, 507 ± 9 l in 264 days from 130 does in the second parity and 513 ± 13 l in 296 days for 82 does in the third parity. Kidding intervals though initially long decreased with time to reasonable levels (302 ± 117 days). The heritability estimates obtained were low (0.23 ± 0.13 for BW, 0.18 ± 0.11 for \{CW\} and 0.14 ± 0.11 for ADG). Genetic correlations between the traits were also low. Genetic and phenotypic trends indicated little change in BW, \{CW\} and \{LMY\} over the years. The phenotypic trend in the kidding interval showed a reducing interval over time. The results demonstrated that the Toggenburg goats were able to perform and thrive reasonably well under the low-input farming conditions. "

The study aimed to provide a better understanding of smallholder and pastoral/extensive sheep and goat farming systems in the tropics, by taking Kenya as an example. The results showed that 58% of the pastoral/extensive farmers and 46% of the smallholders indicated livestock as their main activity. Small ruminants ranked closely behind cattle in their importance. Thirty-four percent of the households kept only sheep, 18% only goats and 48% both species. The survey demonstrated the relative importance to the farmers of tangible benefits of farming sheep and goats (e.g., regular cash income, meat, manure and, in the case of goats, milk) versus intangible benefits (e.g., the role of small ruminants as an insurance against emergencies). Regular cash income and an insurance against emergencies were the highest priorities. Seventy-eight percent of the farmers reported animal sales over the previous 12 months of the survey date. Of these sales, the income was spent on school fees (32%), purchase of food (22%), farm investment (18%), medical expenses (10%), off-farm investment (9%), social activities (5%) and re-stocking (4%). Indigenous genotypes were predominant among the pastoralists and mixed crosses predominant among the smallholders. A range of traits: growth rate, body size, body shape, drought tolerance, meat quality, fertility, disease and heat tolerance, prolificacy and temperament were all considered important for both sheep and goats in both farming systems and across the different genotypes. Compared with other pure breeds, the Red Maasai sheep and the Small East African goats were rated poorly in terms of body size, body shape, growth and fertility, but highly in terms of drought and (for the Red Maasai) heat tolerance by both smallholder and pastoralist farmers. In general, crosses were perceived less favourably than indigenous pure breeds. Body size and performance ranked as the most important traits in the choice of breeding males. Approximately half the farmers inherited their males, reared them on the farm and kept them for an average of 2–3 years. Uncontrolled mating within the household's flock was predominant in both farming systems. Over 98% of the farmers reported incidence of disease, especially pneumonia (in pastoral/extensive areas), helminthosis, tick-borne diseases, diarrhoea and foot-rot. Over 95% of the farmers fed supplements in both dry and wet seasons. Pure exotic and indigenous × exotic genotypes fetched higher prices than indigenous genotypes due to their heavier body weight. In conclusion, the foregoing issues need attention in genetic improvement programmes, with more emphasis on the conservation and utilisation of indigenous small ruminant genotypes. "

As part of this, we assessed the risk of a common food poisoning (staphylococcal) through consumption of \{RTE\} chicken sold by informal vendors. We used participatory risk assessment, a novel approach to understanding food safety in data scarce environments to collect information. Structured interviews and focus group discussions with informal vendors (n = 237) were conducted to understand poultry value chains for informal \{RTE\} chicken, business operation and hygiene practices. Samples (n = 100) of \{RTE\} were collected from informal vendors in six major taxi ranks. Staphylococcus aureus counts were determined using 3M™ Petrifilm™ plates. Data collected in this present study plus information obtained from reviewing of literature, were used to develop a stochastic risk model. The number of colonies which were too numerous to count (TNTC) was artificially modeled. A mapping of the informal food value chain revealed that there are four possible value chains and that chicken spilled over from formal to informal markets. The prevalence of S. aureus in \{RTE\} chicken samples (44%; 90% CI: 36.1%–52.2%) was high. The mean S. aureus counts in the ready to eat chicken was 103.6 (90%CI: 103.3–103.9), and the risk of purchasing chicken of unsatisfactory quality (&gt;103 cfu/g) was 32.9% (90%CI: 25.5%–40.4%). The probability of food poisoning due to consumption of \{RTE\} chicken contaminated with staphylococcal enterotoxin was estimated to be 1.3% (90% CI: 0%–2.7%). Sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of S. aureus having the enterotoxin gene was the most sensitive parameter for food poisoning. This was followed by S. aureus concentration in \{RTE\} chicken and lastly the prevalence of S. aureus in ready-to-eat chicken. This study demonstrates the existence of a strong link between formal and the informal market. In view of the low risk observed, the relevant authorities in Tshwane should continue to support the informal sale of \{RTE\} chicken. However, there is still a need for provision of hygiene training to reduce the concentration levels of S. aureus on the \{RTE\} chicken, and to promote the sale of safer affordable source of protein for the large urban poor population in South Africa. This will also help secure the opportunities for employment associated with the trade. "

In this study we combined field experimentation and long-term rainfall analyses in Makoni and Hwedza districts in eastern Zimbabwe to evaluate cropping adaptation options to climate variability. Analyses of long-term rainfall data closely supports farmers’ perceptions that the mean annual total rainfall has not changed, but the pattern of rainfall within-season has changed: the number of rainfall days has decreased, and the frequency of dry spells has increased at the critical flowering stage of maize. On-farm experiments were conducted over two cropping seasons, 2009/10 and 2010/11 to assess the effects of planting date, fertilization and cultivar on maize production. Three maize cultivars were sown in each of the early, normal and late planting windows defined by farmers. Each of the nine cultivar-planting date combinations received N, P, K and manure combinations at either zero, low or high fertilization rates. Overall, there were no significant differences in maize development or grain yield among cultivars. Maize grain yield was increased by increasing the amount of nutrients applied. Average yield was 2.5 t ha−1 for the low rate and 5.0 t ha−1 for the high rate on early planted cultivars on relatively fertile soils in Makoni in 2009/10 season. Yields on poorer soils in Hwedza were small, averaging 1.5 t ha−1 for the low rate and 2.5 t ha−1 for the high rate. Maize grain yields for the early and normal planted cultivars were similar for each fertilization rate, suggesting there is a wide planting window for successful establishment of crops in response to increased rainfall variability. Yield reduction of &gt;50% was observed when planting was delayed by 4 weeks (late planting) regardless of the amount of fertilizer applied. Soil nutrient management had an overriding effect on crop production, suggesting that although the quality of within-season rainfall is decreasing, nutrient management is the priority option for adaptation in rain-fed smallholder cropping systems.

The \{SOM\} gradient used here stretched from 21 to 106 g C kg−1 soil and was a result of different periods of continuous cultivation of 5, 20, 35 and 105 years in comparison to a forest soil. The rate of organic C mineralization was found to be dependent on the status of pre-existing soil organic C (SOC). Highly degraded soil which had been under continuous cultivation for 35 years and more showed the highest rate of C mineralization per unit \{SOC\} (117.9 mg C g−1 C) while forest soil had the lowest amount of C mineralized per unit \{SOC\} (73.5 mg C g−1 C). Forest soil had the highest amount of increased C mineralization as a result of organic matter (OM) additions (8.0 mg C g−1 soil) followed by the highly degraded soil that had been under cultivation for 105 years (5.5 mg C g−1 soil). Additional mineralized C as a function of time after forest conversion declined progressively within the first 20 years of continuous soil use. Soil which had been under continuous cultivation for 20 years had the lowest amount of additional mineralized C (4.0 mg C g−1 soil). \{SOM\} stabilization efficiency in the studied soils appears to be highest with intermediate cultivation history of about 20 years. These soils that have been recently converted to cultivation also appear to have a greater ability to stabilize added \{OM\} than the most degraded soils investigated in this study. It is thus advisable to provide intervention strategies to reverse \{SOM\} decline for farming communities at an intermediate stage before the soils are highly depleted of SOC. "

In this study, blood samples from 13 giraffes in Kenya were investigated microscopically and genomic \{DNA\} extracted. \{PCR\} amplicons of the hyper-variable region 4 (V4) of Theileria spp. small subunit ribosomal \{RNA\} (18S rRNA) gene were hybridized to a panel of genus- and species-specific oligonucleotide probes by reverse line blot (RLB). Two newly designed oligonucleotide probes specific for previously identified Theileria spp. of giraffes found single infections in eight of the specimens and mixed infections in the remaining five samples. Partial 18S rRNA genes were successfully amplified from 9 samples and the \{PCR\} amplicons were cloned. A total of 28 plasmid clones representing the Kenyan isolates were analyzed in the present study and compared with those of closely-related organisms retrieved from GenBank. In agreement with \{RLB\} results, the nucleotide sequence alignment indicated the presence of mixed infections in the giraffes. In addition, sequence alignment with the obtained 18S rRNA gene sequences revealed extensive microheterogeneities within and between isolates, characterized by indels in the \{V4\} regions and point mutations outside this region. Phylogeny with 18S rRNA gene sequences from the detected parasites and those of related organisms places Theileria of giraffes into two major groups, within which are numerous clades that include the isolates reported in South Africa. Collectively, these data suggest the existence of at least two distinct Theileria species among giraffes, and extensive genetic diversity within the two parasite groups. "

Crop losses caused by \{BCMV\} and \{BCMNV\} impact severely not only on commercial scale cultivation of this high-value crop but also on production by smallholder farmers in the developing world, where bean serves as a key source of dietary protein and mineral nutrition. In many parts of the world, progress has been made in combating \{BCMV\} through breeding bean varieties possessing the I gene, a dominant gene conferring resistance to most \{BCMV\} strains. However, in Africa, and in particular in Central and East Africa, \{BCMNV\} is endemic and this presents a serious problem for deployment of the I gene because this virus triggers systemic necrosis (black root disease) in plants possessing this resistance gene. Information on these two important viruses is scattered throughout the literature from 1917 onward, and although reviews on resistance to \{BCMV\} and \{BCMNV\} exist, there is currently no comprehensive review on the biology and taxonomy of \{BCMV\} and BCMNV. In this chapter, we discuss the current state of our knowledge of these two potyviruses including fundamental aspects of classification and phylogeny, molecular biology, host interactions, transmission through seed and by aphid vectors, geographic distribution, as well as current and future prospects for the control of these important viruses.

In this study, breeding objectives were derived for an indigenous tropical sheep breed under pastoral production. Economic values were calculated for five situations: (i) base accounting for both tangible and intangible roles of sheep; (ii) accounting for manure, skins and intangible roles; (iii) accounting for 20% of animals sold, insurance, manure and skins; (iv) accounting for intangible roles only; and (v) accounting for tangible roles only. Sensitivity analysis to different levels of financing and insurance benefit factors, reproduction, survival and live weight traits was performed for the situation accounting for both tangible and intangible roles, and with a constant number of ewes. The economic value for a trait considered in a particular situation was calculated from the difference between the average performance level of the trait before and after incrementing it by one unit. The traits considered were litter size, lambing frequency, pre-weaning and post-weaning lamb survival to 12 months, ewe survival, 12-month lamb live weight, mature ewe live weight, consumable meat and kg manure dry matter sold ewe−1 year−1. Generally, in descending order of the profits and economic values, the situations studied ranked as follows: (i), (v), (iii), (ii) and (iv). For the base situation, financing and insurance benefits accounted for 13% and 6% of the total revenues, respectively. Situation (v) had a profit that was about 35% lower relative to situation (i). In terms of genetic standard deviations, the economic values (US$ ewe−1 year−1) for the base situation were: 2.81 for litter size, 6.40 for lambing frequency, 0.02 for pre-weaning survival, 0.03 for post-weaning survival, 0.05 for ewe survival, 1.81 for 12-month lamb live weight, 0.43 for mature ewe live weight, 0.09 for consumable meat and 0.01 for kg manure dry matter sold (ewe−1 year−1). The economic values indicate that litter size, lambing frequency and 12-month lamb live weight are likely to be important traits in pastoral production. Sensitivity analysis showed that future economic values for all the traits considered, except kg manure dry matter sold ewe−1 year−1, might change depending on levels of intangible benefit factors. Ewe survival and mature ewe live weight were not responsive to changes in reproductive traits, and pre- and post-weaning traits, and vice versa. It is concluded that it is necessary to include the intangible roles of sheep in tropical breeding programmes. "

Major projects to improve the dairy goat sector were not realized until the late 1970s under United Nations Development Programmes (UNDP) funded and \{FAO\} executed projects, which lasted until the mid 1980s. The initial projects were mainly government station-based, and aimed at multiplying improved stock for distribution to farmers. Due to several technical, logistical and financial constraints the station-based projects failed to meet their objectives, and by 1996, despite huge financial investments in this endeavour, only a total of approximately 40,000 improved goats were available in Kenya. The farmers were not directly involved and genotype-by-environment interaction issues were not duly taken into account in designing and executing the projects. In early to mid 1990s, the German Development Corporation (GTZ) and \{FARM\} Africa initiated new approaches that were community-based and farmer-led in two regions of Kenya. Genetic improvement activities were now based on-farm, as opposed to government stations. Farmers and farmer-group members were rigorously trained on breeding programme designs and management, husbandry, including primary healthcare and were facilitated to run their show with frontline technical support from the NGO's and government officers. In just 7 years, the dairy goat population has risen to more than 90,000 head, hence doubled over the 7-year period. In addition, the improved goat technology is alive with many \{NGOs\} replicating the new approach. The community participation in the crucial areas of service provision, animal health delivery, marketing and quality control has strongly influenced this development. The challenges, successes and other experiences of these two Kenyan projects are presented and illustrated by way of a case study as to how simple participatory approaches can actually lead to significant improvement in the livelihoods of the rural resource poor families.

The plough was developed on the basis of laboratory experiments reported earlier to determine optimum parameters for a curved implement. The basic design principles of conventional mouldboard ploughs and an ard were taken into consideration. A safety mechanism was developed which was a shear bolt. Apart from the share point, all components of the plough were made from wood, and the total mass was about 10 kg. The orientational parameters of the developed implement such as the tail angle, rake angle and the side-rake angle can be varied to suit the required soil operations and the pulling capability of the draught animals. The developed plough can also be used as a ridger by mounting an extra wing on the plough. Comparative field experiments were conducted in cooperation with the International Livestock Research Institute, ILRI, using the developed and traditional ard-type plough in Ethiopia. Tests were carried out in fields under various soil conditions using oxen and cows. The results showed that the draught required by the developed plough was about 30% less than the draught of the traditional Ethiopian ard. A frequency analysis was made to determine the dominant frequencies of the reversible plough under working conditions. The identified frequencies were 0·5, 1·3 and 3·3 Hz. Preliminary assessments were made to compare the performances of a pair of cows with a pair of oxen in relation to speed and forces when pulling the developed plough. A pair of cows moved faster (an average of 0·84 m/s) than the pair of oxen (an average of 0·63 m/s) and exerted proportionally greater pulling forces when operating in the same field. The difference in speed is explained by the greater body weight of the cows and the correspondingly greater pull that could be exerted. "

We find weak evidence that households accumulate livestock wealth in response to living in a drier environment, and no evidence that households invest in either structural or cognitive social capital as insurance against climate risks. However, coping strategies vary across social groups. For example, while rainfall does not robustly affect cognitive social capital (trust)—we find that the “poor” and “financially-integrated” households (i.e., those who have relatively good access to credit and capacity to save money) show greater mutual trust in drier environments. The results from this study can be used for priority setting by policy makers and development agencies for programs aimed at safeguarding household livelihoods in arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs). "

The life cycle of T. solium includes human beings as definitive hosts and pigs as intermediate hosts. Cysticercosis is acquired by the ingestion of eggs released by human tapeworm carriers, who become infected after ingesting pork meat contaminated with cysticerci. Taenia solium transmission has been associated with poverty, lack of sanitary services and practices of rearing backyard pigs with free access to the areas that villagers use as toilets, as well as cultural behaviour. Nonetheless, due to the recent increase of migration and tourism, industrial countries are also reporting cases of human cysticercosis. There are many epidemiological studies that have been conducted mainly in Latin American countries that have evaluated intervention measures for control of cysticercosis including the development and testing of vaccines. Furthermore, the involvement of international agencies and institutions, such as the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Livestock Research Institute, as well as the commitment of policymakers, scientists and field workers, are key means for the sustainable control and, hopefully, eradication of T. solium infections.

This study analyses long-term trends in climate variability at N’Tarla and Sikasso in southern Mali using a weather dataset from 1965 to 2005. Climatic variables and crop productivity were analysed using data from an experiment conducted from 1965 to 1993 at N’Tarla and from a crop yield database from ten cotton growing districts of southern Mali. Minimum daily air temperature increased on average by 0.05 °C per year during the period from 1965 to 2005 while maximum daily air temperature remained constant. Seasonal rainfall showed large inter-annual variability with no significant change over the 1965–2005 period. However, the total number of dry days within the growing season increased significantly at N’Tarla, indicating a change in rainfall distribution. Yields of cotton, sorghum and groundnut at the N’Tarla experiment varied (30%) without any clear trend over the years. There was a negative effect of maximum temperature, number of dry days and total seasonal rainfall on cotton yield. The variation in cotton yields was related to the rainfall distribution within the rainfall season, with dry spells and seasonal dry days being key determinants of crop yield. In the driest districts, maize yields were positively correlated with rainfall. Our study shows that cotton production in southern Mali is affected by climate change, in particular through changes in the rainfall distribution. "

The analyses were based on a representative sample of 80 traditional smallholder mixed farms. The farms were selected by first stratifying the population administratively and implementing a multistage random sampling in Mbeere district in Kenya. The \{PAFs\} were estimated using the stratified, Bruzzi, and sequential partitioned \{PAF\} approaches. A secondary objective was, thus, to evaluate the impact of the approaches on the \{PAF\} estimates. The stratified and Bruzzi approaches estimated proportion of T. parva infection cases directly attributable to the exposure after controlling for confounding by agro-ecological zone (AEZ). The sequential partitioned \{PAF\} approach estimated a \{PAF\} associated with exposure after adjusting for any effect that the \{AEZ\} may have had by influencing the prevalence of the exposure. All analyses were carried out at the farm level where a farm was classified as infested if the tick was found on cattle on a farm, and infected if at least one animal on a farm was positive for T. parva antibodies. Variance estimation for \{PAFs\} was implemented using ‘delete-a-group’ jackknife re-sampling method. The stratified \{PAF\} (26.7% [95% CI: 9.0%, 44.4%]) and Bruzzi \{PAF\} (26.4% [95% CI: 9.6%, 43.2%]) were consistent in estimating a relatively low impact of farm vector tick presence with a relatively high level of uncertainty. The partitioned \{PAF\} (15.5% [95% CI: 1.5%, 29.6%]) suggested that part of the impacts estimated using the stratified \{PAF\} and Bruzzi approaches was driven by \{AEZ\} effects. Overall, the results suggested that under endemic instability in Mbeere district, (1) presence of R. appendiculatus was not a good indicator of T. parva infection occurrence on a farm; (2) ecological variation could play a role in determining infection impacts. This study provides a preliminary basis for evaluating the potential value and utility of estimating \{PAFs\} for variables amenable to control in tick-borne diseases (TBDs) epidemiological studies.

The objective was to estimate the infections’ seroprevalence and variation and identify associated risk factors. A total of 440 cattle in 80 farms, selected by stratified random sampling from the four divisions in the district, were surveyed. Information on animal and on each farm's management practices, particularly on tick control practices, was obtained by personal interview using a standardized questionnaire. Prevalences of serum antibodies were determined using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. The relationship between \{TBDs\} seroprevalence and the risk factors was assessed by multivariable analysis using standard logistic regression models and mixed models using the farm as a random effect. Overall estimation of seroprevalences and their 95% confidence limits were: T. parva (19% [14%, 25%]), T. mutans (25% [20%, 29%]), A. marginale (58% [52%, 64%]) and B. bigemina (19% [15%, 23%]). Analysis in presence of extra-binomial variation under Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) yielded relatively larger intra-farm correlation coefficient (ICC) (0.3) and variance-inflation factor (VIF) (2.35) values for T. parva than for the other parasites [range, 0.05–0.07 (for ICC) and 1.02–1.32 (for VIF)]. Both farm- and area-level variables had variably significant and large effects on all infections, but these were more pronounced on T. parva seroprevalence. Inclusion of farm random effect resulted in substantially higher estimate of farm variance component for T. parva infection (1.73) compared to other infections [range, 0.29–0.56], comparable \{ICC\} values with those under \{ANOVA\} analysis [range, 0.08–0.35] and a substantially better fit than the standard multivariable logistic regressions. The above results serve as possible indicators of existence of endemic instability for the studied \{TBD\} infections in the district. A probable differential ecological and climatic variability in vector suitability habitats, particularly for T. parva vector, was likely in Mbeere District and this was suggested to influence farm tick control management across the area.

abstract = "Cereal crop residues (straw, chaff, etc.) are important components of maintenance rations for ruminant livestock in many parts of the world. They are especially important in small-holder crop-livestock production systems in the sub-humid, semi-arid, and arid tropics and subtropics where most of the world’s poorest livestock producers and consumers are found. Taking as examples tropically adapted cereals in the crop improvement mandate of the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), namely pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], this paper explores opportunities for using marker-assisted crop breeding methods to improve the quality and quantity of cereal crop residues for use as ruminant livestock feedstuffs. In the case of pearl millet, \{ICRISAT\} has been heavily involved with several UK-based collaborating research institutes, in development and initial application of the molecular genetic tools for marker-assisted breeding. We have obtained some useful experience in quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and marker-assisted selection (MAS) for stover yield, foliar disease resistance, and in vitro estimates of the nutritive value of various stover fractions for ruminants. In sorghum, \{ICRISAT\} has focused on initiating a large-scale high-throughput marker-assisted backcrossing program for the stay-green component of terminal drought tolerance—a trait that is likely to be associated not only with more stable grain and stover yield, but which is also expected to contribute to maintenance of ruminant nutritional value of stover produced under drought stress conditions. Conventional and marker-assisted breeding for foliar disease resistance is recommended for dual-purpose cereal improvement, or indeed for improvement of the nutritional value of residues for any crop in which these are used as feedstuffs for ruminant livestock. Practical problems faced and proposed ways of dealing with these are discussed. "

To investigate the nature and sources of vulnerability of smallholder farmers to climate variability and change, we analysed long term climate data and interviewed farmers individually and in groups in Makoni and Hwedza districts in eastern Zimbabwe. Farmers’ perceptions of changes in climate characteristics matched the recorded data. Total seasonal rainfall has not changed, but variability in the rainfall distribution within seasons has increased. The mean daily minimum temperature increased by 0.2 °C per decade in both Makoni and Hwedza. The mean daily maximum temperature increased by 0.5 °C per decade in Hwedza. The number of days with temperatures &gt;30 °C also increased in Hwedza. Farmers indicated that livestock production was sensitive to drought due to lack of feed, affecting resource-endowed farmers, who own relatively large herds of cattle. Crop production was more sensitive to increased rainfall variability, largely affecting farmers with intermediate resource endowment. Availability of wild fruits and social safety nets were affected directly and indirectly by extreme temperatures and increased rainfall variability, impacting on the livelihoods of resource-constrained farmers. There was no evidence of a simple one-to-one relationship between vulnerability and farmer resource endowment, suggesting that vulnerability to climate variability and change is complex and not simply related to assets. Alongside climate variability and change, farmers were also faced with biophysical and socioeconomic challenges such as lack of fertilizers, and these problems had strong interactions with adaptation options to climate change. Diversifying crops and cultivars, staggering planting date and managing soil fertility were identified as the major adaptation options to stabilize yields against increased rainfall variability. There is need to evaluate the identified adaptation options on farm and with the participation of farmers to provide empirical evidence on the best options for different households. "

The objective of this study was to evaluate emergence, yield and financial benefits of maize, finger millet and sorghum, planted at different dates and managed with variable soil nutrient inputs in order to develop adaptation options for stabilizing food production and income for smallholder households in the face of climate change and variability. Field experiments with maize, finger millet and sorghum were conducted in farmers’ fields in Makoni and Hwedza districts in eastern Zimbabwe for three seasons: 2009/10, 2010/11 and 2011/12. Three fertilization rates: high (90 kg N ha−1, 26 kg P ha−1, 7 t ha−1 manure), low (35 kg N ha−1, 14 kg P ha−1, 3 t ha−1 manure) and a control (zero fertilization); and three planting dates: early, normal and late, were compared. Crop emergence for the unfertilized finger millet and sorghum was &lt;15% compared with &gt;70% for the fertilized treatments. In contrast, the emergence for maize (a medium-maturity hybrid cultivar, SC635), was &gt;80% regardless of the amount of fertilizer applied. Maize yield was greater than that of finger millet and sorghum, also in the season (2010/11) which had poor rainfall distribution. Maize yielded 5.4 t ha−1 compared with 3.1 t ha−1 for finger millet and 3.3 t ha−1 for sorghum for the early plantings in the 2009/10 rainfall season in Makoni, a site with relatively fertile soils. In the poorer 2010/11 season, early planted maize yielded 2.4 t ha−1, against 1.6 t ha−1 for finger millet and 0.4 t ha−1 for sorghum in Makoni. Similar yield trends were observed on the nutrient-depleted soils in Hwedza, although yields were less than those observed in Makoni. All crops yielded significantly more with increasing rates of fertilization when planting was done early or in what farmers considered the ‘normal window’. Crops planted early or during the normal planting window gave comparable yields that were greater than yields of late-planted crops. Water productivity for each crop planted early or during the normal window increased with increase in the amount of fertilizer applied, but differed between crop type. Maize had the highest water productivity (8.0 kg dry matter mm−1 ha−1) followed by sorghum (4.9 kg mm−1 ha−1) and then finger millet (4.6 kg mm−1 ha−1) when a high fertilizer rate was applied to the early-planted crop. Marginal rates of return for maize production were greater for the high fertilization rate (&gt;50%) than for the low rate (&lt;50%). However, the financial returns for finger millet were more attractive for the low fertilization rate (&gt;100%) than for the high rate (&lt;100%). Although maize yield was greater compared with finger millet, the latter had a higher content of calcium and can be stored for up to five years. The superiority of maize, in terms of yields, over finger millet and sorghum, suggests that the recommendation to substitute maize with small grains may not be a robust option for adaptation to increased temperatures and more frequent droughts likely to be experienced in Zimbabwe and other parts of southern Africa.

We utilized multiple methods, including Stages-of-Progress and household surveys, which gave us a combination of qualitative and quantitative results. We examined how over the last 10 and 25 years households have moved into and out of poverty in 40 rural communities in two different highland regions of Peru. We also examined the role played in these movements by different livestock assets and strategies. We found a significant number of households had escaped poverty, while at the same time many households have fallen into poverty. The reasons for movements up versus down are not the same, with different strategies and policies needed to address escapes versus descents. Diversification of income through livestock and intensification of livestock activities through improved breeds has helped many households escape poverty and this method allowed us to explore what exactly this means in the diverse areas studied. These findings can contribute to better targeted livestock-related research and development strategies and policies, not only in Peru, but in other regions where similar livelihood strategies are being pursued.

However, it is still rare to find reports on the total N budgets of agricultural systems including all N fluxes in the literature. Here, we conducted a comprehensive study on the effects of different N fertilizers (control, synthetic fertilizer, 60% synthetic fertilizer N plus 40% pig manure N, pig manure N applied at the same rate of 280 kg N ha−1 yr−1) on N pools, cycling processes, fluxes and total N balances in a subtropical wheat-maize rotation system in China by monitoring in situ N fluxes combined with field 15N-tracer and 15N isotope-dilution techniques. The warm and wet maize season was associated with significantly larger N losses via gaseous and hydrological pathways than the cooler and drier wheat season. Nitrate leaching and \{NH3\} volatilization were the main N loss pathways, accounting for 78% and 93% of the annual hydrological and gaseous N losses, respectively. The field 15N tracing experiment showed that the wheat system had a high N retention capacity (∼50% of 15N application), although the N residence time was short. In the subsequent maize season, 90% of the residual 15N-labeled fertilizer in the soil that had been applied to the wheat system was utilized by plants or lost to the environment. The combined application of synthetic and organic fertilizers (pig manure) or application of pig manure resulted in significantly higher soil N retention and lower NO3− leaching, while yields remained unaffected. However, the application of manure resulted in larger \{NH3\} volatilization losses compared with the application of synthetic fertilizer alone. Thus, our study suggests that a combination of synthetic and organic N fertilizers is suitable for sustaining agricultural productivity while reducing environmental N losses by fostering interactions between the soil C and N cycles.

Land managers currently lack a coordinated climate change adaptation approach with which to prepare the region's globally outstanding biodiversity for accelerating change. We provided analyses intended to inform coordinated adaptation for eight focal rainforest tree species of commercial importance and broad rainforest communities. By using two different approaches to determine vulnerability, including climate envelope modeling (Maxent) and the \{MC1\} dynamic vegetation model, we were able to assess where Pacific coastal rainforests might be more stable over time. We examined vegetation stability based on climate projections and used protected areas and intact late-seral forest data to determine priority areas and current level of protections. Based on model outputs, focal rainforest conifers and general rainforest communities are more likely to persist and to expand their ranges along northern range margins while southern margins exhibited lower persistence and potential loss of suitable climate. Robust reserve design for temperate rainforests should include current and future late-seral forests as potential climate refugia to accommodate projected shifts in species of commercial and ecological importance.

However, they have made few inroads into the literature on technology adoption in developing countries, which continues to rely mainly on survey-derived information. Location, with all its dimensions of market access, demographics and agro-climate, nevertheless remains key to understanding potential for technology use. The measures of location typically used in the adoption literature, such as locational dummy variables that proxy a range of locational factors, now appear relatively crude given the increased availability of more explicit GIS-derived measures. This paper attempts to demonstrate the usefulness of integrating GIS-measures into analysis of technology uptake, for better differentiating and understanding locational effects. A set of GIS-derived measures of market access and agro-climate are included in a standard household model of technology uptake, applied to smallholder dairy farms in Kenya, using a sample of 3330 geo-referenced farm households. The three technologies examined are keeping of dairy cattle, planting of specialised fodder, and use of concentrate feed. Logit estimations are conducted that significantly differentiate effects of individual household characteristics from those related to location. The predicted values of the locational variables are then used to make spatial predictions of technology potential. Comparisons are made with estimations based only on survey data, which demonstrate that while overall explanatory power may not improve with GIS-derived variables, the latter yield more practical interpretations, which is further demonstrated through predictions of technology uptake change with a shift in infrastructure policy. Although requiring large geo-referenced data sets and high resolution \{GIS\} layers, the methodology demonstrates the potential to better unravel the multiple effects of location on farmer decisions on technology and land use.

The \{MPT\} all had a nutrient content, particularly in terms of N (up to 39.5 g available N per kg dry matter (DM)) similar to alfalfa hay, which would be suitable for supplementing teff straw, which had a high fibre, but low N (4.0 g available N per kg DM) content. In situ nylon bag digestion and in vitro gas production analyses were carried out to assess microbial degradation characteristics. The \{MPT\} were highly degradable in situ, however gas production in vitro decreased as the MPT:teff straw ratio increased in A. angustissima, indicating that antimicrobial components were present in this species. None of the chemical estimations were correlated with antimicrobial properties. It is concluded that some of the \{MPT\} tested may prove to be useful dietary supplements for ruminants receiving poor quality forages like teff straw, as has been found in other studies. However, chemical analysis alone will be of limited value in predicting the nutritive value of a new \{MPT\} which contains antimicrobial components or material toxic to the animal itself. "

Observed live weight gain in sheep fed mash and pellets were 133 g/d and 130 g/d, respectively, compared to 90 g/d and 81 g/d observed in the feed block and control group, respectively. Organic matter digestibility was 0.59 and 0.58 in the mash and pellet group compared to 0.62 and 0.61 in the feed block and control group, respectively. All comparisons in mash and pellet versus feed block and control group were different (P&lt;0.05). \{SSBLR\} can be utilized as major ration component thereby mitigating fodder shortages likely to arise from using sweet sorghum stalks for juice extraction for bio-ethanol production. Use of \{SSBLR\} as ration component for will also add to the economic viability of sweet sorghum ethanol value chains. In decentralized systems where juice is extracted from sweet sorghum stalks in the villages and options of processing \{SSBLR\} are limited, \{SSBLR\} can be used in chopped form with similar efficiency than as component of processed feed block. In centralized system, generating large quantities of SSBLR, processing feed into mash and pellets would be advantageous for supporting higher livestock productivity and lower feed transport costs.

Measurements revealed three periods of peak \{NO\} emissions (fertigation, re-wetting of soils, and to a lower extend during winter), with a pulse emission peak during soil re-wetting in summer of 88.4 μg N m−2 h−1. The mean annual \{NO\} flux was 5.1 ± 8.9 μg N m−2 h−1 and total annual \{NO\} emissions were 0.44 ± 0.78 kg N ha−1 yr−1. The fertilizer induced emission factor for \{NO\} was 0.63% under beetroot. The combined effect of soil temperature, soil moisture and soil \{DIN\} (NH4+ and NO3−) concentrations were identified as drivers of the temporal and spatial variability of soil \{NO\} fluxes. This work shows that long-term measurements are needed for estimating annual fluxes and the importance of soils as a source for tropospheric \{NOx\} as the contribution of different seasons and crop growing periods to the annual budget differed markedly.

It is a complex process that operates at different temporal and spatial scales through the interactions between diverse drivers. Main drivers of wetland conversion for agricultural production in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and those influencing its land use change have been explored in the past. But often the factors have not been explicitly considered in these studies. Tools and concepts that consider the decision-making processes of farmers have become common approaches used in studies to understand and explore changes in land use. This paper describes an empirical model framework to analyse land development and use processes as a result of individual farmer’s decision-making in small wetlands in SSA. The model framework uses information on the drivers of land use change, landscape classification, and household typologies. Processes of land conversion, as well as of probabilistic and heuristic decision-making were integrated in the framework. The model framework was applied to a case study on a sub-humid lowland floodplain in Tanzania, where land conversion, fallow, and use change processes are shaping the structure of the wetland. The scenario of increasing land scarcity on upland was simulated to explore how defined processes will respond to the rising pressure exerted on the wetland. Land conversion increased by 10 percent, fallow practices decreased by one-third to half. Wetland fields were defragmented due to increasing demand for crop production in the wetland. Shifts in relative distributions of farm types were simulated within and between wetland cluster groups, where all upland dependent crop-based farmers disappeared. The application revealed the potential of including individual decision-making in understanding the heterogeneity and functioning of such systems. The application possibilities and limitations of the model as well as challenges to model complex interactions in land use systems are discussed. The study raised the need to improve the means by which socio-environmental systems are anticipated and managed in the face of likely or projected changes in demography, economics, and resources at different scales.

However, despite the potential to alleviate poverty and improve food security through livestock development interventions, the lack of smallholders' participation in the planning and design of breeding programs has often been a major cause of the failure of such programs. Particularly in developing countries where livestock production is still mostly subsistence-oriented and livestock fulfil manifold functions a considerable number of livestock breeding programs have failed. The development of adequate tools to characterise these functions, bearing in mind that these are expressed only rarely in properly functioning markets, is therefore important. This paper seeks to advance the application of such methodologies to the smallholder pig sector in Vietnam. A choice experiment was applied across 140 households involved in pig breeding in order to assess farmers' preferences and the trade-offs for a list of adaptive and productive traits. These included growth, reproduction, disease resistance, feed requirements and appearance. The findings indicate that smallholders highly value both adaptive and performance traits, particularly in resource-driven (i.e. subsistence) production systems. Performance traits were more highly valued in the demand-driven (i.e. market-oriented) systems. These findings have implications for breeding program breed choice and breeding objectives. "

The correct assignment percentage were always higher in \{YC\} and Boer than other three goat breeds, implying assignment efficiency was positively relative to populations with greater uniformity and low population genetic variability.

The \{SINE\} was also identified in expressed sequence tag (EST) databases derived from several tissues in four species of ixodid ticks, namely R. appendiculatus, B. (R.) microplus, Amblyomma variegatum and also the more distantly related Ixodes scapularis. Secondary structure predictions indicated that Ruka could adopt a tRNA structure that was, atypically, most similar to a serine tRNA. By extrapolation the frequency of occurrence in the randomly selected \{BAC\} clone sequences is consistent with approximately 65,000 copies of Ruka in the R. appendiculatus genome. Real time \{PCR\} analyses on genomic \{DNA\} indicate copy numbers for specific Ruka subsets between 5800 and 38,000. Several putative conserved Ruka insertion sites were identified in \{EST\} sequences of three ixodid tick species based on the flanking sequences associated with the SINEs, indicating that some Ruka transpositions probably occurred prior to speciation within the metastriate division of the Ixodidae. The data strongly suggest that Class I transposable elements form a significant component of tick genomes and may partially account for the large genome sizes observed. "

In particular, their effect on the endemic status of the parasite in targeted areas will be crucial to their sustainability. Ideally, challenge should be maintained so that immunity is boosted in the absence of repeat vaccination. In the event that efficacy of the p67 vaccine in the field reflects that observed in extensive laboratory trials, it is possible that some reduction in the heterogeneity of the indigenous parasite population will occur, and this may be accompanied by selection for more highly infective strains. In contrast, available information suggests that schizont-specific components of a second-generation subunit vaccine are unlikely to affect the endemic status of parasite populations. However, endemic stability will inevitably decline as management systems become more intensive and necessitate frequent vaccination to maintain protective cover. "

A major constraint for crop production is the amount of rainfall and its intra and inter-annual variability. We evaluated the effects of planting date on the yield of different varieties of four major crops (maize, millet, sorghum and cotton) over three contrasting growing seasons in 2009–2011 (with 842 mm, 1248 mm and 685 mm of rainfall respectively) with the aim of identifying climate adaptation options in the Sudano-Sahelian region. Three planting dates (early, medium, and late) and three varieties of long, medium, and short duration of each crop were compared. For fertilized cereal crops, maize out yielded millet and sorghum by respectively 57% and 45% across the three seasons. Analysis of 40 years of weather data indicates that this finding holds for the longer time periods than the length of this trial. Late planting resulted in significant yield decreases for maize, sorghum and cotton, but not for millet. However, a short duration variety of millet was better adapted for late planting. When the rainy season starts late, sorghum planting can be delayed from the beginning of June to early July without substantial reductions in grain yield. Cotton yield at early planting was 28% larger than yield at medium planting and late planting gave the lowest yield with all three varieties. For all four crops the largest stover yields were obtained with early planting and the longer planting was delayed, the less stover was produced. There was an interaction between planting date and variety for millet and sorghum, while for maize and cotton the best planting date was more affected by the weather conditions. The findings of this study can support simple adaptation decisions: priority should be given to planting cotton early; maize is the best option if fertilizer is available; planting of maize and sorghum can be delayed by up to a month without strong yield penalties; and millet should be planted last.

A combination of models was used to analyse land use and labour allocation strategies for optimizing income for wealthy (2.5 ha with eight cattle) and poor (0.9 ha without cattle) farms in Murewa, Zimbabwe. Trade-offs between profitability, labour use and partial nutrient balances were also evaluated for alternative resource management strategies. Farm data were captured using the Integrated Modelling Platform for Mixed Animal-Crop Systems (IMPACT), which was directly linked to the Household Resource use Optimization Model (HROM). \{HROM\} was applied to optimize net cash income within the constraints specific to the households. Effects of alternative nutrient resource management strategies in crop and milk production were simulated using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and \{RUMINANT\} models, respectively, and the output evaluated using HROM. The poor farm had a net income of US$ 1 yr−1 and the farmer relied on selling unskilled labour to supplement her income. The poor farm’s income was marginally increased by US$18 yr−1 and the soil nitrogen (N) balance was increased from 6 to 9 kg ha−1 yr−1 by expanding groundnut production from the previous 5–25% of the land area. Further increases in area allocated to groundnut production were constrained by lack of labour. On the poor farm, maize production was most profitable when cultivated on a reduced land area with optimal weeding. The wealthy farm had a maize-dominated cropping system that yielded a net cash balance of US$290 yr−1, mainly from the sale of crop produce. Net income could be increased to US$1175 yr−1, by re-allocating the 240 hired labour-days more efficiently, although this reallocation substantially reduced partial soil N and phosphorus (P) balances by 74 kg N ha−1 and 11 kg P ha−1, respectively, resulting in negative nutrient balances. Few opportunities existed to increase productivity and income of the smallholder farms without inducing negative nutrient balances. On the wealthy farm, groundnut was the least profitable crop; shifting its production to the most fertile field did not improve income unless the groundnut residues were fed to lactating cows. The analysis carried out in this paper highlights the need to develop practical technological recommendations and development interventions that consider farm resource endowment (land, fertilizers, manure and labour), variability in soil fertility within farms and competing resource use options.

We identify human population growth, commercialization of the economy, and natural resource use policies, in addition to weather, as key drivers of change. We compare the agricultural and livelihood systems of male and female respondents, as well as their productive resources, organization and access to services. Women have less access than men to common property resources, as well as to cash to obtain goods or services. Women control less land than men, the land they control is often of poorer quality, and their tenure is insecure. Women engage in mutual insurance and risk-sharing networks, and benefit from non-agricultural services provided by social support institutions external to the village. Formally registered, public and private external organizations that foster agriculture and livestock production have tremendous anti-women biases, and tend to provide support primarily to men.

The increase in demand for meat in developing countries offers large market opportunities for livestock producers. If the productivity of beef farmers can be improved to commercial levels, it may have the potential to address poverty in these agriculturally based economies. Climate change is predicted to be highly dynamic and can have adverse effects on crop and livestock productivity. The cattle breed to be used and the production strategy to be followed in developing countries of the southern hemisphere will depend primarily on the environment and level of management. The availability of diverse cattle breed resources with adaptive and productive differences will allow breed types to be matched to different environments, management capabilities and markets. In the harsh and undeveloped areas or pastoralist systems, pure breeding with e.g. Sanga, Zebu or naturalized breeds may be the only production strategy that can be followed. In the more developed areas, crossbreeding with small indigenous cows may succeed in improving the output of beef cattle farming. It is believed that crossbreeding will gain importance in many developing counties in the southern hemisphere. It is therefore essential that crossbreeding studies be conducted where necessary, to supply information regarding heterosis and for the development of multi-breed genetic evaluations, breeding objectives and decision making. By describing production environments it may be possible to identify genotypes that are adapted to a specific environment. However, tools are needed to overlay geo-referenced data sets onto the different environments. Statistical science continues to support animal breeding and improvement, especially with respect to production traits. Traits linked to fertility and/or survival are still problematic and the appropriate quantitative breeding technology to properly handle these traits still needs to be developed. Gene or marker assisted selection may play an important role in selection for disease and parasite resistance or tolerance, since it is generally difficult to measure these traits directly. Strategies that utilize \{EBVs\} derived from genomic analyses (genomic EBVs), together with conventional mixed model methodology, may speed up the process of breeding animals with subsequent higher and more efficient production. The application of a landscape genetics approach offers the potential to greatly enhance the knowledge of how landscape heterogeneity influences the genetic population structure, gene flow, and adaptation. Results from these studies can be used to address questions related to species management and conservation. "

The study area was stratified into the three livestock grazing regions of Oropoi to the south, Lokichoggio–Mogilla centrally and Kibish in the north for the purposes of the serological and questionnaire (n = 53 herd owners) data. Five adakaars (grazing units) were selected and 34, 63, 49, 75 and 571 cattle serum samples obtained from these. The slaughter slabs of Lokichoggio and Kakuma were visited and 188 serum samples were obtained from slaughter cattle and compared to results of meat inspection. Human stool samples were collected in each of the three grazing areas and 66, 97 and 78 samples were obtained. The seroprevalence of cysticercosis in cattle was estimated at 16.7% (95% \{CI\} 13–20.9%) using a secretory–excretory antigen detection ELISA. There was poor agreement between meat inspection and serology (k = 0.025; p = 0.2797). The prevalence of taeniosis was estimated as 2.5% (95% \{CI\} 0.8–5.6%) by microscopy. A backwards elimination logistic regression analysis indicated that the grazing unit (Adakaar), the deworming history of household members and the distance (&gt;2 km) of grazing fields from the homestead were significant explanatory variables for cattle being found to be positive on serology. An intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.07 (0.02–0.12); p &lt; 0.0001 was calculated for bovine cysticercosis in this area. "

The study presented here investigates the uptake of colostrum by 548 calves in western Kenya maintained under smallholder farming, an important agricultural system in eastern Africa. Serum samples collected from the calves and dams at recruitment (within the first week of life) were analysed for the presence of antibodies to four tick-borne haemoparasites: Anaplasma marginale, Babesia bigemina, Theileria mutans and Theileria parva. The analysis showed that at least 89.33% of dams were seropositive for at least one of the parasites, and that 93.08% of calves for which unequivocal results were available showed evidence of having received colostrum. The maternal antibody was detected up until 21 weeks of age in the calves. Surprisingly, there was no discernible difference in mortality or growth rate between calves that had taken colostrum and those that had not. The results are also important for interpretation of serosurveys of young calves following natural infection or vaccination. "

In preference tests, both sheep and goats could distinguish between provenances, and displayed a clear preference for local material (to which they had previous exposure). In seven trials where each animal received a single provenance, there was a significant effect of provenance on total intake in only one case, but this was not reflected in any significant variation in live weight gain or in vivo digestibility at any of the sites. Provenance differences in sacco dry matter disappearance were apparent at 24 and 48 h, but the differences were not consistent across sites. The findings of the study suggest that superior genetic material of G. sepium can be selected for fodder on the basis of growth and yield only, since there appears to be much greater within-species variation in yield than in nutritive value.

The objectives of the review were thus to provide a pooled prevalence estimate of \{CCPP\} in the country and asses the level of in between study variance among the available reports. Manual and electronic search was conducted between 8th of January and 25th of June 2015. A total of twelve published articles and one \{MSc\} thesis was retrieved from19 initially identified studies. Twenty five animal level datasets were extracted at regional level considering some hypothesized predictors. The retrieved data were summarized in a meta-analytical approach. Accordingly, the pooled prevalence estimate of \{CCPP\} was 25.7% (95% CI:20.9,31.0). The inverse variance square (I2) that explains the variation in effect size attributed to reports true heterogeneity was 95.7%.The sub-group analysis was also computed for assumed predictors including, age, sex, type of study population, production systems and regional states. Among these predictors, study population type revealed statistically significant difference (P &lt; 0.05). Accordingly, the prevalence estimate for samples collected at abattoir was 39.2%, while that of samples collected at field level was 22.4%. In the final model, type of study population fitted the multivariable meta-regression model accounting for 22.87% of the explainable proportion of heterogeneity among the presumed predictors. Evidence on isolation and confirmation of Mycoplasma capricolum subspp. capripneumonie in the country was obtained from five regional states. In conclusion, it is recommended to further investigate facilities related with transportation and collection premises along with potential role of sheep in the epidemiology of CCPP. Finally, the review emphasizes the need for monitoring the ongoing \{CCPP\} control intervention and introduces amendments based on the findings. Besides more surveys are needed in some of the regions where no or few valid data was available. "

Each month cattle with a packed cell volume (PCV)&lt;26% and detected as parasitaemic, or cattle showing clinical signs of trypanosomosis, were treated with diminazene aceturate at 3.5 mg/kg body weight. An infection was defined as a new infection if it was preceded by 2 previous months in which both samples had a PCV≥26% and were not detected with trypanosomes. Using this definition the average monthly incidence of infections of Trypanosoma congolense in cattle over 36 months of age was 13.3%, and the prevalence of recurrent infections 13.0%. Assuming that an animal had recovered from infection when \{PCV\} again returned to 26% without parasites being detected, mean persistence of infection was 3.8 months (median between 2 and 3 months). In contrast, T. vivax infections were susceptible to diminazene. The incidence of T. vivax infections in adults was lower than for T. congolense (2.8%), and they were less pathogenic (mean reduction of 3.1% units of \{PCV\} due to T. vivax infection compared with 4.6% units for T. congolense). Also, fewer cases were treated. Calves were first detected parasitaemic at an average age of 8.8 months and their infections persisted longer than those in adults. The effect of age on incidence of infection was not significant beyond 15 months of age. Adult male cattle appeared to be more susceptible to T. congolense infection than adult female cattle. "

Trends in cooperative organization in east-African dairy are evaluated. Empirical work focuses on alternative techniques for effecting participation among a representative sample of peri-urban milk producers in the Ethiopian highlands. The variables considered are a modern production practice (cross-bred cow use), a traditional production practice (indigenous-cow use), three intellectual-capital-forming variables (experience, education, and extension), and the provision of infrastructure (as measured by time to transport milk to market). A Tobit analysis of marketable surplus generates precise estimates of non-participants’ ‘distances’ to market and their reservation levels of the covariates — measures of the inputs necessary to sustain and enhance the market. Policy implications focus on the availability of cross-bred stock and the level of market infrastructure, both of which have marked effects on participation, the velocity of transactions in the local community and, inevitably, the social returns to agroindustrialization.

abstract = "Abstract Crop residues (CR) have become a limited resource in mixed crop-livestock farms. As a result of the increasing demand and low availability of alternative resources, \{CR\} became an essential resource for household activities, especially for livestock keeping; a major livelihood element of smallholder farmers in the developing world. Farmers’ decisions on \{CR\} use are determined by farmers’ preferences, total crop production, availability of alternative resources and demand for CR. Interaction of these determinants can result in pressures and trade-offs of \{CR\} use. Determinants, pressures and trade-offs are shaped by the specific socio-economic and agro-ecological context of these mixed farms. The objective of this paper is to provide a comparative analysis of the determinants of \{CR\} use and to examine some options to cope with pressures and trade-offs in 12 study sites across Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Drawing on socio-economic data at household and village level, we describe how cereal intensification and livestock feed demand influence use, pressures and trade-offs of \{CR\} use across study sites, specifically cereal residue. Our results show that in low cereal production and livestock feed demand sites, despite a low demand for \{CR\} and availability of alternative biomass, pressures and trade-offs of \{CR\} use are common particularly in the dry season. In sites with moderate cereal production, and low–moderate and moderate livestock feed demand, alternative biomass resources are scarce and most residues are fed to livestock or used to cover household needs. Subsequently, pressures and potential trade-offs are stronger. In sites with low cereal production and high livestock feed demand, pressures and trade-offs depend on the availability of better feed resources. Finally, sites with high cereal production and high livestock feed demand have been able to fulfil most of the demand for CR, limiting pressures and trade-offs. These patterns show that agricultural intensification, better management of communal resources and off-farm activities are plausible development pathways to overcome pressures and trade-offs of \{CR\} use. Although technologies can largely improve these trends, research and development should revisit past initiatives so as to develop innovative approaches to tackle the well-known problem of low agricultural production in many smallholder mixed systems, creating more sustainable futures.

This paper presents different combinations of scenarios for global feedstock supply for the production of bioenergy under specified social and environmental safeguard provisions. The objectives of this study were threefold: a) to present a global perspective using an integrated modeling approach; b) to frame the boundaries for lower scale assessments; and c) to identify potential trade-offs to be considered in future research. The aggregate results, achieved through the application of an integrated global modeling cluster, indicate that under a high global demand for bioenergy by mid-century, biomass will to a large extent be sourced from the conversion of unmanaged forest into managed forest, from new fast-growing short-rotation plantations, intensification, and optimization of land use. Depending on the underlying scenario, zero net deforestation by 2020 could be reached and maintained with only a minor conversion of managed forests into other land cover types. Results further indicate that with rising populations and projected consumption levels, there will not be enough land to simultaneously conserve natural areas completely, halt forest loss, and switch to 100% renewable energy. Especially in the tropical regions of the southern hemisphere, it will be important to achieve a controlled conversion from unmanaged to sustainably managed forest as well as increased protection of areas for ecosystems services such as biodiversity. The study concludes with the recommendation to focus on targeted regional policy design and its implementation based on integrated global assessment modeling. "

Analysis of the scenarios relies on GLOBIOM, a global, multi-sectoral economic model based on a detailed representation of land use. Our results reveal that \{RFS2\} would substantially increase the portion of agricultural land needed for biofuel feedstock production. U.S. exports of most agricultural products would decrease as long as the biofuel target would increase leading to higher land conversion and nitrogen use globally. In fact, higher levels of the mandate mean lower net emissions within the U.S. but when the emissions from the rest of the world are considered, the \{US\} biofuel policy results in almost no change on \{GHG\} emissions for the \{RFS2\} level and higher global \{GHG\} emissions for higher levels of the mandate or higher share of conventional corn-ethanol in the mandate. Finally, we show that if the projected crop productivity would be lower globally, the imbalance between domestic U.S. \{GHG\} savings and additional \{GHG\} emissions in the rest of the world would increase, thus deteriorating the net global impact of U.S. biofuel policies.

Proteins, secreted by the schizont, or expressed on its surface, are of interest as they can interact with host cell molecules that regulate host cell proliferation and/or survival. The major schizont surface protein is the polymorphic immunodominant molecule, PIM, which contains a large glutamine- and proline-rich domain (QP-rd) that protrudes into the host cell cytoplasm. Analyzing QP-rd generated by in vitro transcription/translation, we found that the signal peptide was efficiently cleaved post-translationally upon addition of T cell lysate or canine pancreatic microsomes, whereas signal peptide cleavage of a control protein only occurred cotranslationally and in the presence of microsomal membranes. The QP-rd of \{PIM\} migrated anomalously in SDS–PAGE and removal of the 19 amino acids corresponding to the predicted signal peptide caused a decrease in apparent molecular mass of 24 kDa. The molecule was analyzed using monoclonal antibodies that recognize a set of previously defined \{PIM\} epitopes. Depending on the presence or the absence of the signal peptide, two conformational states could be demonstrated that are differentially recognized, with N-terminal epitopes becoming readily accessible upon signal peptide removal, and C-terminal epitopes becoming masked. Similar observations were made when the QP-rd of \{PIM\} was expressed in bacteria. Our observations could also be of relevance to other schizont proteins. A recent analysis of the proteomes of T. parva and T. annulata revealed the presence of a large family of potentially secreted proteins, characterized by the presence of large stretches of amino acids that are also particularly rich in QP-residues.

Cottonseed cake and sesbania seem to combine better with maize in terms of roughage intake and nitrogen utilization, respectively than with leucaena.

The major parasites affecting cattle include Theileria parva, T. annulata, Babesia bigemina, B. bovis, Anaplasma marginale and Cowdria ruminantium. The control of these infections is dependent on the use of acaricides to decrease transmission by the tick vectors, and immunization of susceptible animals with live vaccines. The use of acaricide is hampered by the development of resistance, and live vaccines require cold chain facilities, which are generally unreliable in developing countries. There is therefore a need for improved vaccines that can circumvent these problems. There is a subunit vaccine being developed for T. parva based on the major surface antigen of the sporozoite (p67). A similar antigen, \{SPAG\} 1, has been identified as a candidate for T. annulata. Although several candidate antigens have been identified for Babesia spp., progress towards development of a subunit vaccine based on these antigens has been hampered by polymorphism among isolates and between species, and lack of knowledge of the immune effector mechanisms responsible for protection. The search for protective antigens of A. marginale has focused on outer membrane proteins; immunization with a variety of these antigens alone or in combination, has yielded promising results. As with Babesia, further definition of immune effector mechanisms is needed to optimize immunization strategies. The work on identifying the protective antigens of C. ruminantium is in its embryonic stages; however, two antigens have been identified and are currently being evaluated. There is high expectancy for subunit vaccines for all these diseases; however there is need for further work to elucidate the immune mechanisms in order to select appropriate antigen delivery systems.

During infection, low titers of anti-VSG IgM were detected transiently in the serum of all animals. However, N'Dama had significantly more VSG-specific IgG in blood than Boran during infection. The peripheral blood mononuclear cell population of N'Dama cattle contained a higher percentage of surface IgM-positive B-cells prior to and throughout infection than were found in the blood of Boran.

abstract = "Summary A bioassay was used to measure erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations in calves with haemorrhagic anaemia due to blood loss and in calves with anaemia due to Trypanosoma congolense infection. The bioactivity of \{EPO\} was measured in the assay by its stimulatory effect on 125I-deoxyuridine incorporation in spleen cells from phenylhydrazine-treated mice. Erythropoietin concentrations in blood-volume-depleted calves were elevated 6h after blood loss, maximal (1225 mU/ml) at 33 h and below detection limits at 72 h. Reticulocytes (0·05±0·1%) appeared in blood by 72 h, peaked at 120 h and disappeared from the circulation by 7 days after bleeding. The packed cell volume (PCV) started increasing at 120 h and reached near prebleeding values by 14 days. In T. congolense-infected calves, parasites were first detected in the peripheral blood 12 days post-infection (dpi). Parasitaemia peaked (5×105 trypanosomes/ml of blood) at 15–18 dpi and, thereafter, several waves of parasitaemia were observed, but the peaks gradually diminished. Undiluted plasma from T. congolense-infected calves suppressed 125I-deoxyuridine incorporation into spleen cells from 13 dpi onwards. The suppressive effect of plasma was partly negated by five-fold dilution, which made possible the detection of increased \{EPO\} concentrations during the acute and chronic stages of the anaemia. The highest \{EPO\} peaks, reaching 2300 mU/ml in one calf, were detected during the chronic stage of the infection. At 15–39 dpi, there was a transient bone-marrow erythropoietic response characterized by an increase in mean corpuscular volume and a decrease in mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration but with few reticulocytes (0·4%). However, from 76 dpi onwards, this response waned despite low \{PCV\} and elevated \{EPO\} concentrations. These results suggest that there is an ineffective erythroid response in the face of elevated \{EPO\} concentrations during bovine trypanosomiasis. The negative effect of plasma and serum from trypanosome-infected calves on the in-vitro bioactivity of \{EPO\} suggests the presence of inhibitory factors. "

A total of 188 smallholder dairy farms with 225 female calves were selected purposively by five AEZ-grazing strata. All recruited calves were visited within the first two weeks of life and thereafter at biweekly intervals up to the age of six months. The mean number of cattle in these smallholder farms was 2.6.

However, we propose a general model of endemic stability that is applicable to a broader range of diseases that are important in public health, including malaria, rubella, and mumps. We postulate that endemic stability requires only that (1) the probability, or severity, of clinical disease after infection increases with age, and (2) after one infection, the probability that subsequent infections result in disease is reduced. We present these criteria in simple mathematical terms. Our hypothesis predicts that partial disease control activities might, under certain circumstances, lead to an increase in disease incidence.

A field study in the derived savanna of southwest Nigeria shows that at the current stage of evolution, as a crop farmer adds livestock to his business, there is a small gain in the beginning, then an increasing rate of substitution between crop and livestock follow. As a livestock rearer engages in crop production, there is a decreasing rate of substitution between livestock and crop. This situation derives from the fact that crop production is more intensive than livestock production, which depends principally on grazing natural pastures. Results indicate that if increased population pressure and cropping intensity severely limit access to grazing land, farm and herd sizes will become smaller, then the degree of integration between crop and livestock will increase significantly.

In the debate over how to target \{FFW\} to the poorest of the poor, the last two program objectives are often overlooked. This research examines \{FFW\} afforestation and erosion-control programs in central Tigray, Ethiopia, during 1992–95 in order to understand how these sometimes conflicting objectives were reconciled. Statistical analyses examined the factors that influenced (1) in which villages \{FFW\} projects were located, (2) which households were deemed eligible to participate in \{FFW\} (in those villages having \{FFW\} projects), and (3) which eligible households elected to participate, and (4) how much time the participating households dedicated to \{FFW\} activities. Project feasibility outweighed the needs for food security or natural resource conservation in influencing whether an \{FFW\} project would be located in one of the 25 villages surveyed. In villages where \{FFW\} was available, anti-poverty targeting appears to be taking place, since smaller households with less land were more likely to be eligible to participate in \{FFW\} projects. But although the poor were likely to be eligible for FFW, some non-poor households were also eligible, which suggests that anti-poverty targeting was not efficient. Among households eligible for FFW, those that were relatively better off (larger families that did not lease out land) tended to participate and supply more days of \{FFW\} labor than the poorest households. The only households eligible for \{FFW\} which did not participate were headed mostly by elderly women and hence unable (rather than unwilling) to participate. Overall, anti-poverty targeting was sub-optimal but reasonable, considering that these resource conservation projects need to be located where labor and materials could be made available. "

In the present study, a total of 86 cattle and 26 waterbuck blood samples were obtained from Marula, a site in Kenya endemic for East Coast fever (ECF) where the primary wildlife reservoir of T. parva the Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is also common. To investigate for the presence of cattle-infective Theileria parasites, \{DNA\} specimens extracted from the blood samples were subjected to two diagnostic assays; a nested \{PCR\} based on the p104 gene that is specific for T. parva, and a reverse line blot (RLB) incorporating 13 oligonucleotide probes including all of the Theileria spp. so far described from livestock and wildlife in Kenya. Neither assay provided evidence of T. parva or Theileria sp. (buffalo) infection in the waterbuck \{DNA\} samples. By contrast, majority of the cattle samples (67.4%) were positive for T. parva using a nested \{PCR\} assay. The \{RLB\} assay, including a generic probe for the genus Theileria, indicated that 25/26 (96%) of the waterbuck samples were positive for Theileria, while none of the 11 Theileria species-specific probes hybridized with the waterbuck-derived \{PCR\} products. Phylogenetic analysis of 18S ribosomal \{RNA\} (18S rRNA) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences within the RLB-positive waterbuck samples revealed the occurrence of three Theileria genotypes of unknown identity designated A, B and C. Group A clustered with Theileria equi, a pathogenic Theileria species and a causative agent of equine piroplasmosis in domestic equids. However, \{DNA\} from this group failed to hybridize with the T. equi oligonucleotide present on the \{RLB\} filter probe, suggesting the occurrence of novel taxa in these animals. This was confirmed by \{DNA\} sequencing that revealed heterogeneity between the waterbuck isolates and previously reported T. equi genotypes. Group B parasites clustered closely with Theileria luwenshuni, a highly pathogenic parasite of sheep and goats reported from China. Group C was closely related to Theileria ovis, an apparently benign parasite of sheep. Together, these findings provided no evidence that waterbuck plays a role in the transmission of T. parva. However, novel Theileria genotypes detected in this bovid species may be of veterinary importance. "

The \{EVs\} were estimated for average daily milk yield (DMY, kg), average post-weaning daily gain (ADG, kg), number of kids weaned (NKW), mature weight (MW, kg) and 12-month live weight (LW, kg). Profitability in Kenyan Shilling (KES) without risk was optimal (KES 6038.02) for the \{B1\} genotype. Economic values without risk for most traits were highest for the \{F1\} genotype, i.e., \{KES\} 64.85 (ADG), 24.02 (NKW), −27.55 (MW) and 84.51 (LW). There was, however, a 23% reduction in profits in the \{F1\} genotype. It was evident that crossbreeding would improve the profitability of the smallholder farms, but not beyond the 75% grade level. A similar trend was observed when risk was incorporated. Differences in profitability with and without risk were less than 0.005% for all the genotypes. However, differences in \{EVs\} were large, ranging from −28% to +19%; \{DMY\} had the largest differences. Therefore, incorporation of risk in estimation of \{EVs\} for traits of importance is necessary. This study has also demonstrated that crossbreeding to a higher grade level is not necessarily compensated for by a high performance in most traits. Therefore, a crossbreeding program targeting \{B1\} (75%) crossbreds would be desirable for implementation in the smallholder production systems. "

abstract = "The effects of subsurface drainage on agriculture are analysed in relation to drain discharge, control of the watertable and salt evacuation. The drain discharge depends mainly on external factors (the water balance), whereas the level of the watertable can be influenced by the design of the drainage system. Agricultural drainage criteria must therefore be sought in the required degree of watertable control, given a certain water balance. To this end, relationships between watertable depth and crop production or production factors need to be determined, and critical depth values need to be derived. As the watertable fluctuates, a suitable indicator has to be found for it from the depth-duration-frequency relationship. The variable that gives the highest degree of statistical explanation is the most suitable. It can be a long-term, average depth, or an extreme, short-term, shallow depth. The corresponding agricultural drainage criteria are called long-term and short-term criteria. The first are associated with steady-state drain-spacing equations, the second with either steady-state or unstead-state equations, depending on the ratio of storage to recharge or discharge. "

This view was further supported by results from a bioinformatic survey that suggested that nearly half of the autophagy‐related proteins existent in yeast are missing in trypanosomatids. On the other hand, these organisms have evolved a highly sophisticated machinery to escape from the different host immune‐response strategies and have learned to cope with extremely variable environmental conditions by morphological and functional reorganization of the cell. For both the stress response and the differentiation processes, autophagy seems to be an indispensable prerequisite. So far autophagy has not been systematically investigated in trypanosomatids. Here we present technical information on how to handle the different parasites belonging to this order and give an overview of the current status of autophagy research in these organisms. "

Farmers were classified as credit constrained or credit non-constrained based on their responses from the farm level surveys. No consistent relationship was found between farmers' credit constraint condition and their borrowing status. Most of the variation in milk output per farm was explained by the number of crossbred milking cows in the dairy herd. As credit is likely to facilitate investment in crossbred dairy cows it will have substantial impacts on smallholder dairy farms especially if it is targeted to credit constrained farms. "

Stover quality traits were nitrogen and sugar content, in vitro digestibility and metabolizable energy content as well as yield of digestible and metabolizable stover. Significant (P &lt; 0.05) cultivar-dependent variations were observed for all these quality traits. Stover nitrogen contents were mostly below the levels (1.2% of dry matter) considered to be the minimum required for efficient feed digestion in the rumen, but choice of cultivar plus nitrogen fertilizer application could raise nitrogen levels to near, equal or above this threshold. Stover sugar contents were below 5% and mostly concentrated in the stems. Across management regimes stover in vitro digestibility varied by about 4% units, and by about 3–5% units within individual management regimes. Stover metabolizable energy contents of cultivars varied such that stover from superior cultivars could provide the energy maintenance requirement of livestock and theoretically moderate levels of live weight gains, while livestock fed on stover from poor cultivars would lose live weight. Yields of digestible and metabolizable stover (yield of stover dry matter times stover in vitro digestibility/metabolizable energy) varied among cultivars by at least 1.7-fold. Stover quality traits and grain yields of cultivars were largely unrelated (P &gt; 0.05) suggesting that high stover quality will not be achieved on the expense of grain yield. Heritabilities for stover quality traits were high (h2 &gt; 0.73) except for stover nitrogen content (h2 &gt; 0.56). "

The ranking of sorghum and millet genotypes by cumulative gas production was consistent throughout the 96-hour fermentation period. However, differences were proportionally greater during the initial 3 and 6 h of fermentation. The multiphase model described by Groot et al. [Groot, J.C.J., Cone, J.W., Williams, B.A., Debersaques, F.M.A., Lantinga, E.A., 1996. Anim. Feed Sci. Technol. 64:77–89] was used to fit the in vitro fermentation gas observations of these substrates, and fermentation kinetics parameters were calculated using the fitted model. The final estimates of the model parameters (A, B, C), tested by varying the initial estimates obtained with the monophasic model by ±50%, were stable, showing no dependence on the starting values of the model parameters. However, in millet stems, the C parameter has shown a tendency to converge near unity. The stability of the final values of the parameters of the model in this study suggests the potential applicability of the multiphase model when only nine gas observations over a period of 96 h were available. However, the indeterminacy in the parameters of phase 1 for some millet stems indicates the need of an intermediate gas value between 0 and 3 h. In both, sorghum and millet the asymptotic gas of the first phase (A1) was negatively correlated with \{NDF\} (r = −0.82, p &lt; 0.05; r = −0.80, p &lt; 0.05, respectively) and lignin (r = −0.86, p &lt; 0.05; r = −0.95, p &lt; 0.01, respectively). The estimated maximum fractional rate of substrate digestion in the second phase (Rm2) showed a strong inverse relationship with lignin (r = −0.93, p &lt; 0.01) in millet but not in sorghum. On the other hand, the time at which the rate of fermentation reached its maximum in phase 1 (tmax1) was negatively correlated with \{ADF\} and lignin (r = −0.88, p &lt; 0.05 and r = −0.87, p &lt; 0.05, respectively) in sorghum, whereas in millet only tmax2 (phase 2) was negatively correlated with lignin (r = −0.88, p &lt; 0.05). Estimated differences in the contribution from the different phases to similar cumulative gas at 48 h in stems of different sorghum genotypes indicate the need to complement measurements of total gas production with selected kinetics parameters. The degree of variability between genotypes observed for kinetics parameters related to both, phases 1 and 2 suggest that these parameters have potential for discriminating feed quality differences between crop residues or plant parts. These results point out the difficulty in finding a single feed quality parameter to be used to rank different crop residues of different genotypes. Additional studies are needed to associate these parameters with voluntary intake and in vivo rumen outflow rates with which these phases could be associated. "

Trials were conducted in the post-rainy seasons 2008–2009 and 2009–2010 at \{ICRISAT\} headquarters using a fully irrigated control and a terminal water stress treatment. Stover fodder quality traits analyzed were nitrogen (N), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), acid detergent fiber (ADF), acid detergent lignin (ADL) and neutral detergent solubles (NDS = 100 − NDF) using a combination of conventional nutritional laboratory analysis with Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). Significant (P &lt; 0.0001) differences were found among lines for grain and stover yield and all stover fodder quality traits under both water treatments. Water treatment had greater effects on grain and stover yields, which decreased between 20 and 32% under water stress, than on stover fodder quality traits which varied at most by 8% between treatments. Year had the greatest effect (F-value) on all traits followed by water treatment and line. Trade-offs between stover quality traits and grain yields were largely absent in both backgrounds. Year and water treatment had larger effects on stover fodder quality traits than QTL's but QTL's were highly significant (P &lt; 0.0001) except for stover N in S-35 background. Significant interactions between QTL, water treatment and year were largely absent. The effect of \{QTL\} on selected stover fodder quality traits was background dependent. In S-35 one staygreen \{QTL\} (StgB) increased stover \{IVOMD\} and grain and stover yield while no concomitant trait improvement was observed in background R-16.

Data were obtained from an on-station closed nucleus breeding program of Menz sheep and an on-farm Awassi×Menz sheep crossbreeding project. A total of 695 ewes and 1890 lambs born from the nucleus population of Menz sheep were used for the analysis of ewe productive life and lamb survival to yearling age respectively. In addition, 5530 lamb records of purebred local and crossbreds with proportions of ~25–50% Awassi, collected from three locations were used for the analysis of lamb survival from birth to weaning age. The effects of year, ewe parity and litter weight at weaning were significant (p&lt;0.05) for ewe productive life. On-station lamb survival to yearling was affected by year and breeding value of yearling weight of the lamb, indicating that faster growing animals had substantially higher survival rates. Animal model heritability estimates for lamb mortality ranged from 0.02 to 0.10. While there was a strong genetic trend for growth rate, as evidenced by estimated breeding values for different birth years, estimated breeding values for lamb survival were variable across years with decreasing trend. These results indicate no antagonism between growth rate and survival under conditions prevailing in the nucleus system. Routine genetic evaluation for survival is suggested. Under farmer conditions, the effects of year, season, sex and location effects were significant (p&lt;0.05) on lamb survival to weaning age whereas breed composition (local versus crossbred) of dam as well as of the lamb were not significant. This seems to indicate that crossbreeding of local animals with Awassi sheep does not have an adverse effect on the survival of lambs under farmer conditions typical for the Ethiopian highland regions included in this study.

The overall trend in land use confirmed the historical increase of the cropped areas since mid 20th century, at an annual rate of 2% from 1994 to 2006. This trend is the result of changes in the relative extent of fields permanently cropped and fields under shifting cultivation, and for the latter, the relative proportion of short (3 years) and long (10 years) duration fallows. Type of land use together with topography and soil type determine the herbaceous production and the resulting yield measured towards the end of the wet season. The variation in site yields between years is of the same order of magnitude as the variation in yields between sites within a year. There is an overall decreasing trend in site yields by 5% annually from 1994 to 2006 that is not explained by variations in rainfall. The decreasing trend is observed on fields under shifting cultivation, fallowed fields and rangelands, although not all sites are equally affected. Causes are likely to be multiple which might include changes in land use, decline of soil fertility and increased grazing pressure. Indeed, the remaining rangelands on marginal land and the fallows still accessible to livestock are subject to such a heavy grazing during the rainy season that the herbaceous standing mass measured at the end of the season reflects poorly the actual production. After the two first years of cropping, the herbaceous yield in fields under shifting cultivation with no fertilisation is negatively affected by the number of successive years of cropping. Moreover, clearing fallow after a decreasing number of years affects the mean herbaceous yield of fallowed fields by reducing the contribution of more productive old fallows. Changes in land use, grazing pressure and soil fertility also triggered changes in species composition with a strong reduction in diversity from rangelands to fallows, and again from fallows to cropland weeds. No correlations was found however between productivity and species composition. Cumulative rainfall does not explain between site or between year deviations in herbaceous yield even when sites are sorted by land use type or by soil type in the case of fallow and rangelands. Simulated production calculated with the \{STEP\} model does not explain herbaceous yields much better even when sites are grouped by land use and soil type. However, relative changes of herbaceous yields are reasonably predicted on sites that remained fallowed and were not heavily grazed for at least four consecutive years. "

abstract = "Abstract The investigation of genetic diversity at molecular level has been proposed as a valuable complement and sometimes proxy to phenotypic diversity of local breeds and is presently considered as one of the \{FAO\} priorities for breed characterization. By recommending a set of selected molecular markers for each of the main livestock species, \{FAO\} has promoted the meta-analysis of local datasets, to achieve a global view of molecular genetic diversity. Analysis within the \{EU\} Globaldiv project of two large goat microsatellite datasets produced by the Econogene Consortium and the \{IAEA\} CRP–Asia Consortium, respectively, has generated a picture of goat diversity across continents. This indicates a gradient of decreasing diversity from the domestication centre towards Europe and Asia, a clear phylogeographic structure at the continental and regional levels, and in Asia a limited genetic differentiation among local breeds. The development of \{SNP\} panels that assay thousands of markers and the whole genome sequencing of livestock permit an affordable use of genomic technologies in all livestock species, goats included. Preliminary data from the Italian Goat Consortium indicate that the \{SNP\} panel developed for this species is highly informative. The existing panel can be improved by integrating additional \{SNPs\} identified from the whole genome sequence alignment of goats adapted to extreme climates. Part of this effort is being achieved by international projects (e.g. \{EU\} \{FP7\} NextGen and 3SR projects), but a fair representation of the global diversity in goats requires a large panel of samples (i.e. as in the recently launched 1000 cattle genomes initiative). Genomic technologies offer new strategies to investigate complex traits difficult to measure. For example, the comparison of patterns of diversity among the genomes in selected groups of animals (e.g. adapted to different environments) and the integration of genome-wide diversity with new GIScience-based methods are able to identify molecular markers associated with genomic regions of putative importance in adaptation and thus pave the way for the identification of causative genes. Goat breeds adapted to different production systems in extreme and harsh environments will play an important role in this process. The new sequencing technologies also permit the analysis of the entire mitochondrial genome at maximum resolution. The complete mtDNA sequence is now the common standard format for the investigation of human maternal lineages. A preliminary analysis of the complete goat mtDNA genome supports a single Neolithic origin of domestic goats rather than multiple domestication events in different geographic areas. "

The results indicate a likely Indian subcontinent origin for the commonest haplogroup (D) and a maritime introduction for the next commonest one (A) from Southeast and/or East Asia. Recent introgression of commercial haplotypes into the gene pool of village chickens might explain the rare presence of two haplogroups (B and C) while the origin of the last haplogroup (E) remains unclear being currently observed only outside the African continent in the inland Yunnan Province of China. Our findings not only support ancient historical maritime and terrestrial contacts between Asia and East Africa, but also indicate the presence of large maternal genetic diversity in the region which could potentially support genetic improvement programmes.

Biophysical scientists in particular struggle with how to integrate “gendered” water uses into models that are necessarily based on prevailing laws and equations that describe the movement of water through the hydrological cycle, independent of social constructs. We explore the challenges faced in developing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research approaches and then present a simple yet innovative socio-hydrological approach using participatory three-dimensional maps. As a case study, we describe undertaking this process in Ethiopia where two three-dimensional maps (men's and women's) were separately generated to represent the same 20 km2 landscape. Mapping results indicated important distinctions in how men and women view landscapes with regard to the number and types of ecosystem services identified. For example, only women identified holy water sites along streams, while men identified twice as many sacred trees on the landscape. There was a clear focus and detailed knowledge about soils among participants in both groups. Maps developed as part of this exercise were successfully used as the principal land use input for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and results indicate that this is a valid strategy that enhances scientific knowledge and understanding of overall landscapes and ultimately adds value to research for development questions.

Data from approximately 3000 households were analyzed and farming systems characterized. Plausible socio-economic scenarios of how Kenya might evolve, and their potential impacts on the agricultural sector, were developed with a range of stakeholders. We study how different types of farming systems might increase or diminish in importance under different scenarios using a land-use model sensitive to prices, opportunity cost of land and labour, and other variables. We then use a household model to determine the types of enterprises in which different types of households might engage under different socio-economic conditions. Trajectories of intensification, diversification, and stagnation for different farming systems are identified. Diversification with cash crops is found to be a key intensification strategy as farm size decreases and labour costs increase. Dairy expansion, while important for some trajectories, is mostly viable when land available is not a constraint, mainly due to the need for planting fodders at the expense of cropland areas. We discuss the results in relation to induced innovation theories of intensification. We outline how the methodology employed could be used for integrating global and regional change assessments with local-level studies on farming options, adaptation to global change, and upscaling of social, environmental and economic impacts of agricultural development investments and interventions.

In order to assess the effect of these exclosures on water balances, a correct assessment of evapotranspiration is needed. A common method for calculating evapotranspiration employs the reference evapotranspiration in combination with a crop coefficient. However, for natural vegetation, these crop coefficients are not readily available. Therefore, the objective of this study was to derive crop coefficients for semiarid natural vegetation using two different approaches. The crop coefficients were assessed with the dual crop coefficient approach as outlined in the \{FAO\} Irrigation and Drainage Paper n°56 and compared with crop coefficients derived from a simple soil water balance. A good agreement between both methods was found. The mid-season crop coefficients ranged from 0.50 to 0.85 for open vegetation with small shrubs and from 0.85 to 0.95 for well developed shrubland. Vegetation with a closed tree canopy was characterized by a mid-season crop coefficient between 0.95 and 1.1. Additionally, a significant logarithmic relation between vegetative soil cover and crop coefficient was found. Using this relation, crop coefficients can be easily derived for semiarid shrub savannahs in similar environments and used for the calculation of evapotranspiration. "

The large number of factors that influence production makes it impractical and expensive to use field trials to explore all the farm system options. A model of a pastoral production system was developed to provide a tool for developing and testing the system; for example, drying off animals early and supplement them for quick return on heat, testing the economic and ecological viability of the different stocking rates. The model links climate information, on a monthly basis, with dynamic, stochastic component-models for pasture growth and animal production, as well as management policies. Some of the component models were developed and published by other authors but are modified to suit the Ankole pastoral conditions. The model outputs were compared with on-farm data collected over 3 years and data collected for other on-farm studies in the region. The relative prediction error (RPE) values for body weight after weaning across both breeds ranged from 3% to 12% which is below the acceptable 20% and means that the model predicts post weaning growth with an average error of 7.5%. The model predicted pasture production and milk yield across seasons with relative prediction errors of 17.6% and 3.33%, respectively. The graph shapes of actual and predicted average daily milk yield as influenced by season (month of the year) were similar. Because pasture growth and milk production predictions were acceptable, economic predictions can be made using the model to test different management options such as seasonal breeding, alterations in lactation length and determination of appropriate off-takes and evaluation of economic viability of various stocking rates.

A three-year field experiment was conducted to simultaneously measure the fluxes of \{CH4\} and \{N2O\} from a subtropical rice–rapeseed rotation system under three N fertilization treatments (control with no N fertilizer addition [CK], optimized N fertilizer management practice in accordance with the recommended N fertilizer application rate of 150 kg N ha−1 season−1 [OP], local farmers common N fertilizer management practice with 250 kg N ha−1 season−1 [CP]) in southwestern China. Results showed great intra- and inter-annual variations in \{CH4\} and \{N2O\} emissions along with the temporal variations of environmental conditions, emphasizing the necessity of multi-year measurements to achieve representative estimates. Nitrogen fertilization tended to increase \{N2O\} emissions and to inhibit \{CH4\} emissions. The direct \{N2O\} emission factors (EFd) for the rice systems (mean: 0.99%) were higher than those for the rapeseed systems (mean: 0.71%). In addition, the rice-growing season dominated annual \{CH4\} emissions (&gt;97%), which on average represented 87% of the annual total global warming potential (GWP) of \{CH4\} and \{N2O\} emissions across experimental treatments and years. Linking total \{GWP\} of \{CH4\} and \{N2O\} emissions with grain yields, the average annual yield-scaled \{GWP\} for the control (1467 kg CO2-eq Mg−1 grain) was significantly higher than for the \{OP\} (700 kg CO2-eq Mg−1 grain) and \{CP\} (682 kg CO2-eq Mg−1 grain) treatments (P &lt; 0.05). Given the comparable area- and yield-scaled \{GWP\} between the \{CP\} and \{OP\} treatments, the \{OP\} treatment reduced local farmers’ common N fertilizer application rate by 40% and tended to maintain crop grain yields, however it also reduced N surplus and off-site N losses in the subtropical rice–rapeseed rotation systems of southwestern China.

A four month-study was conducted in Umurera village (Simbi sector), southern Rwanda with the objectives to (1) quantify the on-farm fodder availability, (2) quantify the amount and quality of fodder on offer to livestock, (3) analyse potential fodder availability under five future scenarios and (4) evaluate the implications and feasibility of the programme. Farmers’ surveys, measurements of field sizes, together with daily measurements of fodder on offer, milk production and fodder refusals were conducted. Feeds used were diverse, comprising grasses (53%), banana plant parts (25%), residues of several crops (9%) and other plants (10%). Herbs collected from valley-bottoms, uncultivated grasses and crop residues were predominant fodder types on poorer (Resource group 1 – RG1) farms while Pennisetum and Calliandra were predominant fodder types for moderate (RG2) and better resource endowed (RG3) farms. The amount of fodder on offer for cattle ranged from 20 to 179 kg fresh weight animal−1 day−1 (9–47 kg DM). The milk yield ranged between 1.3 and 4.6 L day−1. The amount of Pennisetum and Calliandra fodder available decreased in the dry season with a concomitant increase in reliance on banana leaves and pseudo-stems. The poorest farmers (RG1) were not able to feed a local cow under all scenarios. \{RG2\} farmers can sustain a local cow during both seasons when using all possible fodder resources, but can sustain a European cow under just two scenarios during the rainy season. \{RG3\} farmers can feed a European cow during the rainy season under all scenarios and for four scenarios during the dry season. We conclude that the ‘One cow per poor family’ programme needs to be adjusted to increase its effectiveness. Our main recommendations are to shift to livestock that require less fodder, for example local cattle or small ruminants such as goats. "

Waterlogged vertisols, which cover about 2.7 million hectares in the Ethiopian part of the Blue Nile Basin, are among the high potential soils where management interventions could result in positive impacts. This study utilized soil, climate, crop and livestock productivity data and models to demonstrate intensification strategies which can increase crop-livestock system productivity. To understand the effects of alternative land use and water management interventions on water productivity, the areas have been classified into three drainage status depending on slope classes. Accordingly, non-drainable (0–2%), drainable (2–5%) and naturally drained (&gt;5%) respectively, represented areas where artificial drainage is not feasible, where drainage using broad bed and furrows (BBF) is recommended, and areas where waterlogging is not a problem and no intervention is needed. Early planting of wheat (Triticum spp.) on \{BBF\} instead of the traditional late planting on flat beds in drainable areas and rice (Oryza sativa) cultivation instead of the traditional extensive grazing or growing grass-pea (Lathyrus sativus) on the flat areas provide viable alternative cropping options. Yield data of the crops and biomass of the native grass were obtained from research stations in the area while the effective rainfall and crop water requirement were estimated using \{CROPWAT\} Model. The value of the native grass and crop straw as livestock feed was estimated based on previous works. With respect to effective rainfall, the water productivity increase due to \{BBF\} over the control ranged from 5% to 200%, with an average increase of 57%. Despite higher water consumption of rice, feeding its residues to livestock enhanced the overall economic water productivity of the system as compared to the natural grazing or grass-pea cultivation. This can be accounted for by higher rice biomass productivity and the greater demand for its grain. The study demonstrated that draining the excess water when the slope allows, growing suitable high value crops on non-drainable areas, and integration of livestock into improved land and water management enhance overall agricultural system water productivity.

DC. cv.-group utilis) is widely promoted in tropical and sub-tropical regions as a green manure cover crop that can reduce weed growth and soil erosion and enhance soil fertility. To provide these benefits, the crop must attain rapid ground cover and develop substantial aboveground biomass. To assist biophysical targeting of the crop to environments that can provide adequate growth conditions, the \{CROPGRO\} model was adapted to simulate velvet bean growth and development. This paper evaluates the performance of the model for phenology, growth, senescence and N accumulation for multiple locations that represent a range of environmental and agronomic management scenarios. Vegetative development, as described by main stem leaf appearance rate, varied linearly with thermal time. Time to flowering showed departures from the linear photoperiod response used in the model. Additional research is required to determine whether the crop is influenced by factors besides photoperiod and air temperature, especially water and nutrient deficits. The linear response to photoperiod did, however, provide reasonable values for partitioning to vegetative, reproductive and senesced materials. Simulation of nitrogen concentration for various plant components matched observed data. Sensitivity analyses evaluating the ability of the crop to provide ground cover, intercept light and develop adequate growth for soil protection and weed suppression indicated that a mean temperature of over 22 °C and a soil moisture holding capacity of at least 100 mm are required. The \{CROPGRO\} model proved to be a reliable decision support tool for guiding analyses of velvet bean response to crop management and environmental conditions. Further research, however, is warranted to improve its predictive capability, especially for phenology. "

Many technologies and practices have been successfully developed to control the parasite problems of smallholder and emerging farmers. This wide range extends from simple herbal remedies to complex, integrated use of chemicals, feeding and breeding. In many cases widespread adoption has been limited by lack of technical support, poor access to input markets and lack of incentives for poorer farmers to seek out and pay for innovations. A further new approach may be required that encompasses the wider production and market environment. The biological, social and economic context of each ‘emerging farming system’ is different and the matching of technologies to each system requires sound understanding of farmer needs and requirements. Thus, it is essential that farmers, extension workers, and scientists jointly decide what technologies to try, what results mean and, if successful, how to sustain their use. In one Asian example a range of technologies were considered for pig, large ruminant and goat production and parasite control through a participatory process which was also used to agree on what determines sustainability beyond testing. The criteria use to screen technologies and practices were (a) continued availability of inputs including dewormers, (b) dependence on related innovations (e.g. weaning or fencing) and (c) degree of community organisation required (e.g. control of breeding or communal grazing). On this basis deworming with chemicals, especially for Toxacara infection in cattle and buffalo calves following on from supplementary feeding with forages were the most feasible entry points. Further interventions were dependent on changes to the production system, including the introduction of weaning and controlled breeding. Further, the incentives for these production changes could not exist without improved market access and market signals for improved weight and condition. Examples such as this point to the need for stronger multidisciplinary and participatory approaches to parasite control. "

Several families of abundant cDNA sequences that may code for protein components of tick cement and A. variegatum proteins which may contribute to anti-haemostatic and anti-inflammatory responses, and, one with potential immunosuppressive activity, were also identified.

The concentrations of C, N, P, K, Ca, and Mg, and the C:N ratio of manure–composts prepared on-farm were analysed. The P concentration of manure was higher from zero-grazing units than from improved or traditional housing, higher from housing with roofs than from that without, higher when animals were fed concentrates than when not, and higher when manure was stored in a heap or pit rather than in a deep littering system. Use of bedding in the livestock housing resulted in manure with lower mineral N concentration and higher C:N ratio. Turning manure during composting resulted in manure with a higher mineral N concentration and lower C:N ratio. Results suggest that modification of traditional livestock housing (boma) to the zero-grazing system may have beneficial effects on some aspects of manure quality. Data on manure texture, colour, smell and biological activity were collected in an attempt to relate manure nutrient concentration and C:N ratio to easily discernible characteristics of manure–composts on-farm. Significant relationships were found between manure texture and the concentrations of P and mineral N, and C:N ratio. Significant relationships were also found between manure colour and N concentration and between manure age and mineral N concentration. Thus, there is scope for the development of decision tools to predict manure–compost quality from at least some manure characteristics. Dichotomous keys were prepared to determine mean manure C:N ratio and mineral N concentration on the basis of manure age and texture. "

Studies assessing the effects of extensive livestock grazing on vegetation and soils in \{SSA\} are inconsistent in the direction and magnitude of study outcomes. We applied meta-analysis to identify whether studies so far conducted in the rangeland systems of \{SSA\} have detected significant rangeland degradation as approximated by changes in vegetation attributes (reduction in species diversity and richness; decreased biomass and ground cover; increased woody species density and canopy cover) and soil properties (Decreased soil OC, N and P). We quantified results of the included studies using the response ratio, which is the log proportional change in the means of a treatment and a control group. Four moderator variables (elevation (&lt;1500 and ≥1500 m above sea level); plant life form (herbaceous and woody), rainfall amount (&lt;600 mm and ≥600 mm), rainfall modality (mono and bimodal), and soil texture (Loam, sandy, sandy loam)) appeared to affect the response of species diversity and richness patterns to different grazing regimes, i.e., communal grazing systems, exclosures, livestock ranches and game reserves. Species diversity and richness values were generally lower in the communal grazing systems compared to the other grazing regimes. Only three moderator variables (rainfall amount and modality, and soil texture) affected the herbaceous basal cover response. Differences in soil \{OC\} were highest between communal and exclosure areas, visible at high elevations and under high rainfall. Soil N was influenced by rainfall modality and soil texture. We conclude that the effects of grazing regimes onto the environment cannot be generalized but are specific across vegetation and soil variables and differ considerably with rainfall and elevation.

The method is applied to a hillside farming system of southern Honduras where new sorghum cultivars and erosion control techniques are being introduced. The expected direct utility maximization model allows the estimation of the effects of new technology on consumption and marketed surplus in situations where marginal values of products vary by state of nature and are affected by consumption and production choices. The introduction of the new technologies in southern Honduras results in improved nutrition and substantial increases in marketed surplus. These effects are due to simultaneous changes in output and consumption patterns. This work extends the subject of household modeling to problems with risk, and thus complements prior work in both the integrated analysis of production/consumption decisions and stochastic decision analysis.

The study relies on the use of handmade collars holding global positioning system (GPS) units to document the spatially and temporally explicit patterns of cattle mobility, field based herd-follows to document cattle behavior, and key informant interviews to document the role of pastoral herding strategies in explaining these patterns. Data were analyzed as a function of seasonality, distance from household, time of day, and land cover zone. During the dry season, there was an unexpectedly high frequency of grazing/walking cattle behavior. This pattern is attributed to ‘tracking’ strategies of Maasai pastoralists resulting in movement to niche grazing areas. During the wet season a bimodal distribution of grazing behavior can be attributed to milking strategies. The study concludes that simple, low cost \{GPS\} collars are an effective and easily replicable method to help understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of cattle behavior and mobility, and patterns of cattle mobility are related to seasonal constraints. Differences between different cattle behaviors can be partly explained by cultural herding practices of Maasai pastoralists. "

It suggests two pragmatic steps: identifying frames and managing frames. The two steps are applied to a participatory process for natural resource management in Fogera, Ethiopia. Effectiveness of facilitators’ strategies to manage frame diversity in the Fogera case is discussed. Two main elements challenging effectiveness are identified: counter-strategies used by facilitators and most-powerful stakeholders, and the constraining factors knowledge, champions and frame sponsorship. We argue that these elements need to be taken into account by participatory process facilitators when managing frame diversity. "

The associated bias in conventional regression procedures applied to censored data and the construction of robust methods for mitigating bias have been preoccupations of applied economists since Tobin [Econometrica 26 (1958) 24]. This literature assumes that the true point of censoring in the data is zero and, when this is not the case, imparts a bias to parameter estimates of the censored regression model. We conjecture that this bias can be significant; affirm this from experiments; and suggest techniques for mitigating this bias using Bayesian procedures. The bias-mitigating procedures are based on modifications of the key step that facilitates Bayesian estimation of the censored regression model; are easy to implement; work well in both small and large samples; and lead to significantly improved inference in the censored regression model. These findings are important in light of the widespread use of the zero-censored Tobit regression and we investigate their consequences using data on milk-market participation in the Ethiopian highlands.

This study was done to evaluate the prevalence and concentrations of these protozoa in environmental samples in Hanam, Vietnam and to assess potential contamination sources using molecular epidemiological tools. A total of 134 environmental samples were collected between February 2009 and July 2009, including 24 river water, 24 sewage, 32 fishpond water, 23 canal water, 26 vegetable and five composted waste samples. Samples were analyzed microscopically using an immunofluorescence method. Overall Giardia and Cryptosporidium were detected in 25.4% and 35.0% of samples analyzed, respectively. In water, a higher percentage of Cryptosporidium spp. (41.7%; 43/103) contamination was observed compared to that of Giardia spp. 28.2% (29/103). Both Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. were found contaminating vegetables at the same level, at 15.4% (4/26) each. Concentrations of Cryptosporidium in samples ranged from 10 to 1900 oocysts per 100 ml water or 100 g vegetable/composted waste sample with a median number of 100 oocysts per 100 ml/g. The concentration of Giardia cysts ranged from 10 to 1836 per 100 ml/g with a median of 60 cysts per 100 ml/g. Microscopy positive samples were subjected to \{PCR\} targeting the \{SSUrDNA\} gene for both Giardia and Cryptosporidium and the β-giardin gene for Giardia. \{PCR\} amplification and subsequent genetic characterization was successfully performed with 23/34 (67.6%) Giardia-positive samples and 15/47 (31.9%) Cryptosporidium-positive samples. Molecular characterization indicated the presence of Giardia duodenalis assemblages A and B and a high prevalence of Cryptosporidium suis. Although the latter being rare in humans, G. duodenalis assemblages A and B are potentially zoonotic. In conclusion, this study allowed sources of contamination and human health risks posed by Cryptosporidium and Giardia in environmental samples in Vietnam to be ascertained. More detailed studies are needed on the host range of different Giardia and Cryptosporidium species/subspecies, the potential for cross-species transmission, and risk and environmental factors involved in the exposure of the pathogen with the advent of molecular typing tools.

Residuals of the model were used to calculate correlations. The random flock effect was significant for all traits and the fixed sex, age, and color effects were significant for most traits. In spring shearing data, fiber diameter of males was 2.7 μm coarser than females and increased with age: 27.3 μm (1 year old), 31.3 μm (2 years old), 34.6 μm (3–5 years old) and 37.0 μm (6 years and older). Mohair fiber length ranged 137.3–174.7 mm between ages. Six-month-old kid mohair (autumn shearing) was finest (24.4 μm) and shortest (95.1 mm). White mohair was approximately 3 μm coarser than brown and gray mohair. \{CVFD\} was not affected by sex and age but related to color with white mohair having a lower CVFD. Comfort factor and visual Bradford count decreased with age. Average med and kemp percentages were 0.88 and 0.34. Almost 20% of goats had 2% or more medullated fibers. The phenotypic correlation between fiber diameter and med percentage was 0.40 and between fiber diameter and kemp percentage −0.08. On average, visual Bradford count underestimated fiber diameter by about 4.1 μm. The correlation between fiber diameter and Bradford count was −0.28. Thus, visual assessment of fiber diameter is imprecise and reduction of fiber diameter through selection would therefore require analysis of fleece samples. The correlation between staple length and fiber length was 0.78. Thus, ruler determination of staple length measured on the live animals is a good estimator of fiber length measured on the fleece sample. In comparison with South African mohair, Tajik mohair is not only white, has long fibers, is rather coarse and medullated. Given the high variation between and within flocks in fiber diameter and medullation there is room for culling inferior animals and improve current mohair quality. "

Priorities for the use of crop residues in terms of nutrient potential and animal species are indicated. Of the technologies developed to improve the nutritive value of crop residues, more attention has been given to chemical treatment of cereal straws than to supplementation. However, a failure to demonstrate cost-effectiveness has discouraged on-farm adoption. The production of fodder from food crop systems and the establishment of multi-purpose trees and shrubs are potentially important for insuring adequate feed supplies for ruminants and improving soil fertility, but there has been limited adoption on small farms to date. Equally, there is significant potential for the more effective use of locally-produced \{AIBPs\} and NCFRs, all of which are under-utilised currently. "

Out of 12 housekeeping genes chosen and experimentally validated, the 7 genes efp, metG, pgiB, recA, adk, rpoB, and tpiA were finally used to establish the \{MLST\} scheme. Their usefulness was assessed individually and in combination using a set of well-defined field samples and strains of M. hyopneumoniae. A reduction to the three targets showing highest variation (adk, rpoB, and tpiA) was possible resulting in the same number of sequence types as using the seven targets. The established \{MLST\} approach was compared with the recently described typing method using the serine-rich repeat motif-encoding region of the p146 gene. There was coherence between the two methods, but \{MLST\} resulted in a slightly higher resolution. Farms recognized to be affected by enzootic pneumonia were always associated with a single M. hyopneumoniae clone, which in most cases differed from farm to farm. However, farms in close geographic or operational contact showed identical clones as defined by \{MLST\} typing. Population analysis showed that recombination in M. hyopneumoniae occurs and that strains are very diverse with only limited clonality observed. Elaborate classical \{MLST\} schemes using multiple targets for M. hyopneumoniae might therefore be of limited value. In contrast, \{MLST\} typing of M. hyopneumoniae using the three genes adk, rpoB, and tpiA seems to be sufficient for epidemiological investigations by direct amplification of target genes from lysate of clinical material without prior cultivation.

Some of these changes could lead to increased emissions of greenhouse gases. This paper explores the magnitudes of changes in production systems as a function of increased population densities and climate change. This paper also quantifies the methane emissions from African cattle, goats and sheep from 2000 to 2030. The study integrates methodologies from different disciplines to derive spatially explicit distributions of methane emissions from domestic ruminants and their changes as livestock production systems evolve. A livestock systems classification framework was used to differentiate pastoral and crop–livestock systems using agro-ecological thresholds based on temperature and length of growing period (hyper-arid, arid, humid and temperate regions), the extent of irrigation and human population densities. Livestock numbers (tropical livestock units, TLU) were estimated from \{FAO\} data for each country and production system defined. Projections of livestock populations were derived from analysis of demand shifts in livestock products, and livestock systems changes estimated on the basis of potential climate change and population density change to 2030. For the estimation of diets for ruminants, Africa was split into regions (East, West, Southern, Central and North Africa, and The Horn of Africa) and diets for both the rainy and the dry seasons were estimated from literature reviews for each livestock species in each production system in each region. Feed intake, livestock production and the computation of methane emissions were obtained using a previously validated and widely used mechanistic model of digestion and metabolism in ruminants. Results suggest that (1) Africa produced around 7.8 million tonnes of methane/year in 2000. This figure is likely to increase to 11.1 million tonnes/year by 2030. (2) Methane emissions per tropical livestock unit (TLU, 250 kg bodyweight) can vary from 21 to 40 kg/(TLU year), depending on the production system and the region. (3) The highest emissions per animal come, and will continue to come, from ruminants in mixed crop–livestock systems. (4) The regions producing the highest concentrations of methane, now and in the future, are in general terms, The Horn of Africa, West and East Africa. (5) The average emission factors obtained in this study (31.1 kg/(methane (TLU year))) are in close agreement with the emission factors used by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for African ruminants (32 kg methane per animal per year). (6) The methodology employed in this study permits the disaggregation of methane emissions by country and production system, thus allows us to quantify changes in emissions as climate changes and production systems evolve. The results of the study are compared with those obtained in other studies around the world and its implications are discussed in relation to how systems are likely to evolve in Africa. "

abstract = "Livestock provide a wide variety of goods and services that generate income and support the livelihoods of millions of poor people in the developing world. Natural and human selections have shaped existing livestock genotypes throughout the estimated 12,000 year history since the first animal domestication. The result, in many production systems in the developing world, is a livestock genotype adapted to its environment and capable of meeting the needs of smallholder farmers. However, this adaptation is unlikely to be optimal and the rapid changes currently affecting the livestock sector, including policy and market changes, movements of germplasm frequently involving the importation of exotic breeds, and the increasing impacts of climate change are affecting the livestock genotype-environment optimum. This is challenging livestock production systems of smallholder farmers. Current challenges include: high rates of loss of the diversity in livestock populations, rapid transformation in smallholder production systems requiring significant changes in genotypes and their management; increased demand for quality and safe foods; increased market competition in a globalizing economy; increased need for complex partnership arrangements in the ever-changing livestock commodity chain; and lack of adaptive capacity to respond to the rapid system changes. Underlying all these is the general lack of strategies for genetic improvement of livestock in smallholder systems and poor livestock infrastructure in developing countries. Opportunities include increased demand for livestock products — and hence potential market opportunities, and new technologies with potential to leap-frog breeding progress in developing countries. This paper analyses options for pro-poor livestock improvement in developing countries, with particular emphasis on the potential role that science – both old and new – will have, from understanding the social underpinnings to innovative technical solutions. It concludes that one of the highest priority interventions for the smallholder systems is the development of innovative approaches for the strategic use of appropriate genotypes from the available range of global breed resources. The analysis strongly suggests that the highest priority ‘breeding intervention’ should be the provision of appropriate genotypes in a sustainable manner, underpinned by a good understanding of what breed resources exist that have demonstrated potential, where else they could be used, and how they would be delivered to smallholders. Efforts to improve/refine breeding skills of smallholders should proceed in parallel. Institutional arrangements and enabling policies are critical for the success in identifying and applying appropriate genetic technologies, improving access to input services and facilitating access to markets in order to translate productivity gains into incomes.

However, chemical anthelmintics, which were the mainstay of control, have been compromised by a high prevalence of resistance worldwide. Copper oxide wire particles (COWP) have been shown to have anthelmintic effects, but few studies have examined their use under field conditions. The use of \{COWP\} was therefore evaluated as a tactical anthelmintic treatment in indigenous goats raised under communal farming conditions in Bergville, KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. At the beginning of the summer rainfall season (October 2007), the faecal egg counts of 172 female goats belonging to 15 farmers were determined and this sampling continued every four weeks until the second week of January 2008. The goats within each of the 15 herds were ranked according to their faecal egg counts for this week. The goats were sequentially paired off within each ranking starting with those goats with the highest counts. One goat from each pair was randomly allocated to a treated or control group. Two weeks later, a 4 g \{COWP\} bolus was randomly administered to each goat in the treated group. Faecal egg counts were carried out on the goats two weeks following treatment, and the sampling of the goats then proceeded every four weeks until October 2008. Except for the six-week period prior to the administration of the COWP, the goats were examined according to the FAMACHA© system and symptomatically treated with 12 mg/kg levamisole when anaemic. The percentage reduction in faecal egg count due to the \{COWP\} treatment was 89.0%. Mean pre- and post-treatment faecal egg counts for the COWP-treated group (n = 73) were 2347 eggs per gram of faeces (epg) and 264 epg, respectively. The corresponding values for the untreated controls (n = 66) were 2652 epg and 2709 epg. The prevalence of Haemonchus spp. larvae in pre- and post-treatment faecal cultures was 72% and 46%, respectively. Symptomatic anthelmintic treatments in combination with mid-summer tactical treatments with \{COWP\} appear to be useful strategies for the control of Haemonchus contortus in indigenous goats in this farming system and this approach could have application in other similar agro-ecological zones.

There is a growing evidence base for contamination of maize and other crops by fungal toxins in the tropics and sub-tropics. As an initial snapshot of contamination by one of these toxins in Rwanda, Aflatoxin \{B1\} (AFB1) was analyzed in 684 samples of maize flour collected in seven principal retail markets of Kigali and in 21 samples of animal feed from seven feed vendors. Two rounds of sample collections were carried out, the first in September 2014 and the second in January 2015. A questionnaire given to vendors was used to determine if gender and education level of vendors, origin of maize and awareness of aflatoxins had any significant effect on \{AFB1\} level in collected samples. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Immuno-affinity fluorimetery were used to analyze samples. Only markets had a significant effect on \{AFB1\} level; for the two collections, differences were inconsistent among markets. In the first round, market means of \{AFB1\} varied between 8.0 ± 5.57 μg/kg and 24.7 ± 23.74 μg/kg and for the second round, between 10.4 ± 8.4 μg/kg and 25.7 ± 25.85 μg/kg. In most animal feed samples \{AFB1\} was &gt;100 μg/kg. None of the vendors interviewed was aware of the risk of mycotoxin contamination in their maize-based flours and feed. Limits set by the United States Food and Drug Administration (20 μg/kg) for total aflatoxins and European Commission (2 μg/kg) for \{AFB1\} for maize flour imports, were varied between 2–35% and 66–100% of samples, respectively. The implications of this study for human and animal health in Rwanda suggest that expanded surveys are needed to understand the scope of contamination, given the influence of environment and other factors on aflatoxin accumulation. Available options to mitigate and monitor aflatoxin contamination can be further deployed to reduce contamination. "

abstract = "In communal areas of \{NE\} Zimbabwe, feed resources are collectively managed, with herds grazing on grasslands during the rainy season and mainly on crop residues during the dry season, which creates interactions between farmers and competition for organic resources. Addition of crop residues or animal manure is needed to sustain agricultural production on inherently poor soils. Objectives of this study were to assess the effect of village-level interactions on carbon and nutrient flows, and to explore their impact on the long-term productivity of different farm types under climate variability. Crop and cattle management data collected in Murewa Communal area, \{NE\} Zimbabwe was used together with a dynamic farm-scale simulation model (NUANCES-FARMSIM) to simulate village-level interactions. Simulations showed that grasslands support most cattle feed intake (c. 75%), and that crop residues produced by non-cattle farmers sustain about 30% of the dry season feed intake. Removal of crop residues (0.3–0.4 t C ha−1 yr−1) from fields of non-cattle farmers resulted in a long-term decrease in crop yields. No-access to crop residues of non-cattle farmers increased soil C modestly and improved yields in the long-term, but not enough to meet household energy requirements. Harvest of grain and removal of most crop residues by grazing cattle caused a long-term decline in soil C stocks for all farm types. The smallest decrease (−0.5 t C ha−1) was observed for most fertile fields of cattle farmers, who manure their fields. Cattle farmers needed to access 4–10 ha of grassland to apply 3 t of manure ha−1 yr−1. Rainfall variability intensifies crop–livestock interactions increasing competition for biomass to feed livestock (short-term effect) or to rehabilitate soils (long-term effect). Prolonged dry seasons and low availability of crop residues may lead to cattle losses, with negative impact in turn on availability of draught power, affecting area under cultivation in consecutive seasons until farmers re-stock. Increasing mineral fertiliser use concurrently with keeping crop residues in fertile fields and allocating manure to poor fields appears to be a promising strategy to boost crop and cattle productivity at village level. The likelihood of this scenario being implemented depends on availability of fertilisers and decision of farmers to invest in rehabilitating soils to obtain benefits in the long-term. Adaptation options cannot be blind to what occurs beyond field and farm level, because otherwise recommendations from research and development do not fit the local conditions and farmers tend to ignore them.

abstract = "Cultivation of the woody legume Sesbania sesban in agroforestry systems has been widely promoted for soil fertility improvement in Africa. Despite the existence of natural populations in eastern Zambia, considerable seed originating from Kenya has been introduced to the area, while further introductions from Malawi are planned. Large-scale anthropogenic seed dispersal raises concerns regarding genetic management, which were addressed here by random amplified polymorphic \{DNA\} (RAPD) analysis. Eleven populations of Sesbania from southern and East Africa were assessed, including S. sesban populations already or likely to be introduced into eastern Zambia and reference taxa. Seventeen primers revealed a very large number of polymorphisms (538) in surveyed material. Differentiation among S. sesban populations was unusually high for a woody perennial (70% of variation among populations), with all individuals stringently assigned to specific populations in cluster analysis, even for geographically proximate sites. High differentiation, combined with the unusually large number of polymorphisms determined, resulted in the identification of a number of population-diagnostic markers. High differentiation may reflect the restricted ecology of S. sesban, human disturbance and frequent natural fluctuations in niche availability. Hydrochory, posited as a mechanism for gene flow between populations located along the same drainage system, appears to be discounted. Geographic proximity was not always a good guide for genetic similarity among S. sesban populations. In particular, rather proximate populations from Zambia and Malawi appeared highly differentiated genetically, while Zambian populations were relatively similar to a geographically distant population from Namibia. Differentiation was consistent with the presence of two botanic varieties in the southern Africa region, vars. nubica and zambesiaca. Estimates of Nei's genetic diversity suggested that S. sesban populations from East Africa were most diverse. Overall, population diversity estimates were low, possibly due in part to frequent bottlenecks, short longevity and a short juvenile phase. The unusually large number of polymorphisms detected here provided an opportunity to test for data redundancy and primer selection methodologies during \{RAPD\} analysis. Combined data from a subset of eight primers selected according to three different approaches provided a very good overall fit to the complete data set (rM &gt; 0.95). Different primer selection approaches influenced the reliability of clustering and diversity analysis, with a minimum of eight primers required for reliable ranking of diversity estimates. The implications of our data for conservation, cultivation and monitoring of S. sesban in the southern Africa region are discussed. Caution is advised during the introduction of germplasm into eastern Zambia from both distant (Kenya) and relatively proximate (Malawi) sources. "

The kits are based on monoclonal antibodies that recognise internal antigens of tsetse-transmitted trypanosomes. Ten cattle were infected with each trypanosome population for at least 60 days, and in combination with uninfected cohorts (n=16) were used in a double-blind study design. Sensitivity and specificity of the tests depended on the choice of positive–negative thresholds expressed as percent positivity with respect to the median \{OD\} of four replicates of the strong positive reference serum provided with the kit. In general, while overall specificities were high, sensitivities of the antigen-ELISAs were poor. For example, at a cut-off of 5% positivity, the sensitivities of the antigen-ELISAs were 11% for samples (n=1162) from T. congolense infected cattle (n=30), and 24% for samples (n=283) from T. vivax infected cattle (n=10). The corresponding specificity values were 95% and 79%, respectively. At a cut-off of 2.5% positivity, sensitivity for T. congolense was 25%, and for T. vivax 35%; corresponding specificity values were 85% and 63% respectively. There were no values of the positive–negative threshold at which both sensitivity and specificity were satisfactory. Restricting the analyses to samples taken more than 2 weeks after tsetse challenge did little to improve sensitivity estimates. Trypanosome species specificities of the antigen-ELISAs were also poor. Sensitivity and species specificity of the antigen-ELISA for Trypanosoma brucei infections were not investigated. In contrast to the antigen-ELISA, the sensitivity of the buffy-coat technique when applied to the same experimental animals was fairly high at 67% for T. congolense infections and 60% for T. vivax infections. For samples taken more than 2 weeks after tsetse challenge, high sensitivity estimates of 96% for T. congolense and 76% for T. vivax infections were obtained. "

Maternal heritabilty declined from 0.12 at birth to 0.06 at 60 days of age and was negligible thereafter. The maternal permanent environmental component due to the dam contributed 3–15% of the total phenotypic variances for all the traits under consideration. Genetic progress is possible for all the growth, carcass and ewe traits considered in this study. The heritabilty estimates for reproduction traits were low, viz 0.02, 0.06, 0.04, 0.02 and 0.04 for fertility (whether a ewe lamb or not; 0 or 1); reproductive rate (number of lambs born to a ewe mated; 0, 1 or 2); number of lambs weaned to a ewe lambing (0, 1 or 2); number of lambs weaned to a ewe exposed (0, 1 or 2), and lamb survival rate (whether a lamb born alive, was dead or alive at weaning). Though slow genetic progress is possible with all reproduction and survival traits, it would be more efficient to select for prolificacy (number of lambs born to a ewe that lambed; 1 or 2) (h2=0.26) but guarding against a higher lamb mortality.

Immunization with a combination of parasite types has been shown to provide broader protection than inoculation of individual strains. In this study, we used a high-throughput capillary electrophoresis system to determine the genotypic composition of the Muguga Cocktail, a widely used vaccine stabilate derived from three seed stabilates—Muguga, Serengeti-transformed and Kiambu 5. Five satellite markers were used to genotype the vaccine and reference stabilates from two commercial-scale preparations of the vaccine. In addition, 224 cloned cell lines established by infection of bovine lymphocytes with T. parva parasites from the component stabilates were genotyped. The results indicate that, for the recently prepared batch, there are at least eight genotypes in each of the Muguga and the Serengeti-transformed stabilates, while parasites from the Kiambu 5 stabilate showed no diversity at the five loci. The Serengeti-transformed stabilate contained parasites of the Kiambu 5 genotype and of two genotypes present in the Muguga stabilate, whereas there were no genotypes common to the Muguga and Kiambu 5 stabilates. When stabilates from the two vaccine batches were compared, no allelic variations were identified between the Muguga and Kiambu 5 parasites, while lack of sufficient clones prevented a full comparison of the Serengeti-transformed stabilates. The findings will facilitate examination of the extent to which the vaccine strains become resident in areas under vaccination, the identification of ‘breakthrough’ strains and the establishment of the quality assurance protocols to detect variations in the production of the vaccine. The cloned cell lines will be useful for further understanding the antigenic diversity of parasites in the vaccine. "

These cows were allocated to 1 of 4 treatment groups: Group SPNW, supplement-nonworking; Group SPW, supplement-working; Group NSNW, nonsupplement-nonworking; and Group NSW, nonsupplement-working. After calving, working cows pulled sledges with a load of 300 to 450 Newtons(N); 4 hours per day 4 days per week, for a total of 100 days over a 1-year period. All cows were fed natural grass hay ad libitum while the supplemented cows were fed 3 kg of concentrate per head per day. The proportion of cows which showed behavioral estrus by 1 year post partum was 100, 100, 60 and 20% for Group SPNW, SPW, \{NSNW\} and \{NSW\} cows, respectively. Based on plasma progesterone concentrations, ovulation started 62 days earlier than onset of behavioral estrus. A total of 73 ovulations occurred by 1 year post partum. Forty-nine (67.1%) and 26 (32.9%) ovulations occurred in the supplemented and nonsupplemented cows while 33 (45.2%) and 40 (54.8%) ovulations occurred in the working and nonworking cows, respectively. Of the total ovulations, 26 (35.6%) were not associated with behavioral signs of estrus and occurred in 13 (32.5%) cows. The incidence of ovulation without estrus was higher (P&lt;0.05) in working (42.4%) than in nonworking (30%) cows and in nonsupplemented (41.7%) than in supplemented (32.7%) cows. Short luteal phases occurred in 32.5% of the cows before the establishment of normal estrous cycles. In working cows, diet supplementation off-set the negative effect of work on the onset of estrus and conception. However, a relatively higher number of cows in Group \{SPW\} had ovulations without estrus before a normal estrous cycle was established. The incidence of short luteal phases or ovulations without estrus did not influence the pregnancy rate in subsequent normal estrus periods. In conclusion, in the supplemented cows, work did not influence the proportion of cows showing estrus and conceiving, but it significantly delayed the postpartum anestrus interval. In the nonsupplemented cows, reproductive activity was impaired in both working and nonworking cows, but was pronounced in working cows. However, once pregnancy was established there was no effect of work on the maintenance of pregnancy. Our study shows that with appropriate feeding regimens lactating crossbred cows could be used for draught purposes without any detrimental effects on fertility, but calving intervals would be extended. Finally, the physiological mechanisms involved in anestrus and ovulations without estrus and the significance of such phenomena in affecting postpartum reproductive performance and fertility in working cows require further investigation.

This activity appears to be from an acid phosphatase because it was enhanced at low pH values, was inhibited by the acid phosphatase inhibitor sodium fluoride, and was not inhibited by the alkaline phosphatase inhibitor tetramisole. The activity did not appear to be secreted into the surrounding medium by the living parasites although phosphatase activity could be detected in the surrounding medium when dead or dying parasites were present. Studies at various temperatures indicated that at least some of this acid phosphatase activity may be associated with the surface of the parasites, rather than with endocytic or intracellular systems. This was supported by subcellular fractionation of radiolabelled parasites which showed some cosedimentation of acid phosphatase activity with radiolabelled iodine. Histochemical studies of the parasites also supported this conclusion. Electron microscopical examination of trypanosomes incubated with lead nitrate andp-nitrophenyl phosphate showed lead phosphate deposits on the surface of the parasites in addition to the expected localisation in the flagellar pocket. We conclude thatTrypanosoma congolensepossesses a surface-bound acid phosphatase. "

This paper describes a method that is developed to identify the spatial distribution of farming system types without the need to extensively map all farming systems across a large region. Moreover, it explains differences between farming systems based on spatial variation in environmental and socio-economic conditions. In the study area farming systems were characterized and classified based on the criteria area under cultivation of both food and cash crops, milk production and the usage of fertilizers. Logit models were fitted to explain differences in farming system using location factors and household characteristics. A model based on an integrated set of household and location factors best described the diversity of farming systems across the region. However, the location factors alone also described a larger part of the diversity. The spatial variation in location factors and household characteristics were used to determine the likelihood of occurrence of the different farming systems across the study area. By assigning the farming system to a location that best fits the local conditions based on the logit model a regional level farming systems map for the Kenyan Highlands was created. The methodology provides a tool of analyzing spatial variation in farming systems complementary to the analysis of farming systems at the household level and gives insight in the spatial determinants of these systems.

A sub-location was used as the sampling unit. A sub-location is the smallest administrative unit and is occupied by clusters of families (called adakars) that share common grazing patterns. A total of 32 sub-locations were randomly selected for the study. At least one focus group discussion involving more than 10 people was held with each adakar. In addition, key informant interviews involving local leaders and animal health service providers were conducted before or after the group sessions. \{PE\} techniques that were used with the stock owners include participatory mapping, relative incidence scoring, proportional piling, disease impact matrix scoring, seasonal calendars and probing. The methods used were pre-tested in four sub-locations that were excluded from further study. The study revealed that goats, with median score of 33 (10th and 90th percentiles of 25, 44, respectively) and sheep, median score of 20.5 (15, 26) were perceived to be the most abundant livestock species while goats (median score of 32 [21, 56]) and camels (median score of 22.5 [11, 33]) contributed the most to the livelihoods of the pastoralists. For goats, the overall relative incidence scores of peste des petits ruminants (PPR), contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) and mange were 23.5% (15, 34), 25% (21, 45) and 20% (19, 28), respectively. The respective median scores for case fatality rates were 66% (45, 76.5), 62.5% (25, 100) and 73.2% (21.4, 85.7). Disease impact matrix scores indicated that mange was the most important disease of goats. Mange (range: 28–32%) and pox (range: 16–38%) were perceived to be the most prevalent diseases in camels. Livestock movements, limited access to veterinary services and stock theft were identified as key factors that contributed to the high prevalence and persistence of these diseases. This paper discusses strategies that could be used to control these diseases given the challenges associated with nomadic pastoralism and insecurity. "

Comparison of immune responses between trypanotolerant and trypanosusceptible cattle have shown some differences in antibody response, complement level and cytokine expression, but it is not known whether these differences are the cause of resistance. Two experiments were carried out to assess the contribution of the immune and haemopoietic systems to trypanotolerance. The production of haemopoietic chimaeras from trypanotolerant and susceptible twin calves and comparison of their responses after infection with singleton calves, allowed an assessment of the role of the haemopoietic system in trypanotolerance. An in vivo depletion of \{CD4\} cells in the two breeds allowed an appraisal of the role of T and B lymphocytes in trypanotolerance. The results of the two experiments suggest that natural resistance comprises at least two mechanisms, an innate mechanism that controls parasite growth, and another, involving the haemopoietic system, that is able to limit anaemia. This supports the hypothesis that innate mechanisms in trypanotolerant cattle are more efficient in controlling disease, making them less reliant on antibody responses. "

We documented that a group of 6-month-old calves allowed free-range grazing and access to their mothers had a significantly greater proportion of total γδ T cells in their blood, attributable to the WC1+γδ T cell subpopulation, compared to age and breed-matched calves held in conventional housing. When the animals with the greater proportion of γδ T cells were transferred to conventional housing there was a decrease in the WC1+population so that by 3 weeks after transfer there was no longer a significant difference between the two groups. To investigate the biological activities of WC1+γδ T cells, the cells were purified by flow cytometric sorting. In vitro, they responded to stimulation by irradiated monocytes in autologous mixed leukocyte reaction (AMLR) cultures but not to direct stimulation through the T cell receptor (T c R) by anti-δ monoclonal antibody. After stimulation in the AMLR, WC1+γδ T cells had a Th1 cytokine profile characterised by production of \{IFN\} -γ and lack ofIL -4. Thus we propose that higher levels of the WC1+γδ T cells may provide calves with a mechanism to produce Th1 cytokines and that the level of these cells may be modulated according to environment or stress since both groups of calves were apparently disease-free.

As discussed here by Stephen Kemp and Alan Teale, the genetic control of this phenomenon might finally be yielding to gene mapping studies. Genetic regions determining susceptibility to trypanosomiasis in mice have been identified and parallel studies are well advanced in cattle. There is growing evidence that only modest numbers of genes are involved in determining the difference between a susceptible and a resistant animal. These observations raise a new series of important questions concerning the possible exploitation of major trypanotolerance genes and the way that they might function in different genetic and physical environments.

The combined weight of dissected tail and rump fat (DTRF) was similar in the two breeds (P&gt;0.05). However, the Menz deposited significantly (P&lt;0.01) more fat in other depots. \{TV\} explained about 60%, in the Menz, and 58%, in the Horro, of the total variation in DTRF.

Genetic correlation of \{TC\} with \{EFU\} was also favourable. Genetic correlations of \{TV\} with production traits were non-significant due to disproportionately large standard errors. The results suggest that \{TV\} is promising for inclusion in selection indices aimed at improving the ability to deposit tail and rump fat and, hence, adaptation to periodic fluctuation of feed supply, in Menz and Horro sheep. However, it is recommended that genetic associations of \{TV\} with production traits be verified using larger data sets. "

abstract = "This article presents an analysis of ERS-1 wind-scatterometer (WSC) data acquired over a region located in the northern Sahel. The considered period extends from January 1992 to December 1995, that is, covering four vegetation cycles. Experimental observations show that \{WSC\} responses at 45° of incidence angle display a marked seasonality associated with the development and senescence of annual grasses during the successive rainy seasons. The interpretation of the σ° temporal plots is performed with the assistance of a semiempirical backscattering model combined with an ecosystem grassland model. Contributions of the various components of the Sahelian landscape to the total backscattering are identified. Overall, the soil contribution is always large but the σ°(45) temporal plots reflect well the vegetation development. The analysis of the different contributions leads to a simplification of the backscattering model. Finally, this latter is parameterized as a function of two surface parameters, namely, the soil volumetric water content and the vegetation biomass. This simplified model allows the vegetation biomass to be estimated with a 33% error. "

Although it has been recognized that smallholders could benefit from genetic improvement strategies (breeding programmes), the challenges associated with establishing genetic improvement strategies for smallholder systems are considerable, resulting in limited successes to date. This paper considers the potential role of marker-based selection to genetic improvement strategies for smallholder production systems, taking into account the socio-economic, infrastructural and institutional issues. The paper stresses that no genetic improvement strategy, with or without the use of markers, is likely to succeed unless a systems approach is applied and other system constraints are met. The marker-based selection technologies discussed in this paper include marker- and gene-assisted selection, marker-assisted introgression and genomic selection. The issues addressed include the priorities of marker-based selection against other genetic improvement strategies, the potential benefits of these technologies to smallholder producers, and conditions under which marker-based selection will most likely succeed in smallholder production systems. We suggest that, of these marker-based selection technologies, marker-assisted introgression and the emerging technology of genomic selection appear to offer the most promise to smallholders, although this is yet to be clearly demonstrated. In relation to genomic selection, developing countries should maintain a ‘watching brief’ on this technology, but simultaneously act now so that they can capitalize on this technology if and when it becomes applicable in the future.

Mean calf growth rate over the wet season of 1987, prior to tsetse control, was 243 ± 48 (standard deviation among herds) g per day; mean cow body weight in 1987 was 223 ± 15 kg; mean cow PCV, 29.8 + 2.5%; mean conception rate by 6 months postcalving, 28 ± 22%; median monthly trypanosome prevalence was 21.4% (range 3.9–32.0%) in animals under 24 months of age and 12.6% (range 0.0–44.7%) in cows. A tsetse-control campaign using alpha-cypermethrin-impregnated traps was introduced in December 1987 to control trypanosomosis. Regression analyses were used to relate changes in mean PCV, calf growth rate, and cow body weight and conception rate between 1987 and 1988/1989 (the period of tsetse control) to corresponding reductions in trypanosome prevalence. An average 13.6 percentage unit reduction in mean trypanosome prevalence in calves between 1987 and 1988/1989 was associated with an increase of 12.2 ± 3.6 (standard error, SE) kg in calf liveweight gain over the 7-month wet season. In cows, a corresponding 8.7 percentage unit reduction in trypanosome prevalence was associated with a 4.9±2.3 (SE) kg increase in body weight and a 1.3±0.3 percentage unit increase in PCV. An 18.4±8.0 (approximate SE) percentage unit increase in the number of cows conceiving within 6 months of calving resulted from a mean decrease of 6.8 percentage units in trypanosome prevalence from 1987 to 1988.

The idea behind \{REDD\} + is that payments for sequestering carbon can tip the economic balance away from loss of forests and in the process yield climate benefits. Recent analysis has suggested that developing country carbon sequestration can effectively compete with other climate investments as part of a cost effective climate policy. This paper focuses on opportunities and complications associated with bringing community-controlled forests into \{REDD\} +. About 25% of developing country forests are community controlled and therefore it is difficult to envision a successful \{REDD\} + without coming to terms with community controlled forests. It is widely agreed that \{REDD\} + offers opportunities to bring value to developing country forests, but there are also concerns driven by worries related to insecure and poorly defined community forest tenure, informed by often long histories of government unwillingness to meaningfully devolve to communities. Further, communities are complicated systems and it is therefore also of concern that \{REDD\} + could destabilize existing well-functioning community forestry systems. "

We used a coupled functional–structural analysis of innovation systems to analyse the influence of socio-economic and policy constraints on the development of the Ethiopian dairy sector. Results show that problems with structural elements such as the absence of key actors, limited capacity of existing actors, insecure property rights, cumbersome bureaucratic processes, poor interaction among actors and inadequate infrastructure have all limited dairy innovation. Out of the seven innovation system functions studied, our findings show that entrepreneurship, knowledge diffusion, market development and legitimacy creation have been particularly weak. Our evidence thus suggests that problems with certain structural elements coupled with weaknesses in various innovation system functions have been major hindrances to the uptake of technologies and dairy sector development in Ethiopia. The narrow policy focus on biophysical technology generation and dissemination, without considering the underlying problems related to institutional conditions and socio-economic processes, has also contributed to low technology adoption and limited broader development in the dairy sector. We suggest that combinations of institutional and technological interventions are needed to overcome the various system weaknesses that have hindered dairy sector development in Ethiopia. "

The objective of this study was to explore options to improve farm-level nitrogen cycling, productivity and economic performance through the analysis of N flows within four contrasting crop-livestock farm systems of Madagascar highlands. Farms were conceptualized as networks where the compartments were the household and their farming activities, all connected by N flows. Indicators assessing network size and cycling, and the organization and diversity of the N flows, were compared with system productivity, food self-sufficiency, and gross margins for the current situation and under four scenarios of intensification (i) dairy production increased by increasing N inputs as supplementary feed; (ii) crop production increased by increasing N inputs as mineral fertilizer; (iii) manure management improved to increase N conservation during storage and application to soils; (iv) a combination of the two most economically attractive scenarios (i and iii). The four case study farms represent local diversity differing widely in terms of network size, with total annual system N throughput ranging from 113 to 1037 kg N per capita, and in terms of N cycling, from 3 to 41 kg N per capita per year. They differed less in terms of external dependence, from 0.26 to 0.41 kg N kg N−1. Improving N conservation through improved manure management (scenario iii) had a positive impact on gross margin, and this in combination with increased concentrate supply (scenario iv) led to increases in whole-farm N use efficiencies from 2% to 50%, in N cycling from 9% to 68% and in food self-sufficiency from 12% to 37% across farm types. Gross margin was the most sensitive indicator to changes in management. Intensification through scenario iv had the highest impact on farm productivity, gross margin, food self-sufficiency, and environment sustainability (N use efficiency, capacity of the soil to stock N).

Economic weights were objectively assigned to these indicator traits in a selection index such that the overall gains in the breeding objective traits were maximised. Four options for calculating \{EVs\} for \{SCC\} and \{FEC\} were considered. Option 1, response from single trait selection was set equivalent to index response for the trait. Option 2, response from single trait selection was set equivalent to maximum gains achievable. Option 3, level of FEC/SCC was set to zero; and option 4, response in FEC/SCC was set to the minimum gains achievable. In all the options, \{EVs\} with/without risk for breeding objective traits 12-month live weight (LW-kg); ADG, average post-weaning daily gain (ADG-g); DMY, average daily milk yield (DMY-kg) were used. For each production trait selected for improvement, a less positive response in the traits \{FEC\} and \{SCC\} would be desirable. Maximum negative \{EVs\} were achieved at a point where the response in \{SCC\} was set at zero (option 3) while \{EVs\} for \{SCC\} were zero when response for \{DMY\} was maximised (option 2). In addition, considerable differences in \{EVs\} for \{SCC\} were obtained when \{EVs\} with/without risk were used. Similar results were also observed for \{FEC\} when \{LW\} was the objective of improvement. However, more positive \{EVs\} for \{FEC\} were estimated relative to \{ADG\} and DMY. The results confirm that there is a scope to incorporate disease resistance traits in a breeding program with objective of reducing disease incidences and the costs of disease control. "

The countries with high levels of income produced 46% of all goat papers for only 1% of the world goat population. Generally, the quality and efficiency of goat research is very variable, although the situation has improved during the last 20 years. Despite limited financing support for goat research, its efficiency could be improved by a better research organisation and implementing committees, which include representatives of professional organisations to decide research priorities, and by implementing research networks, which would incite researchers from various institutions to work together. Such research networks must supply new general, scientific knowledge by pooling the results obtained from various experimental conditions with linkage analyses particularly if the bibliographic results appear to be heterogeneous or conflicting. Organisations for analysing and synthesising the scientific information must be created in order to make it easier for application by end users. Moreover, strong efforts must be made to improve the professional training of researchers in the goat sector. A project for improving the structuring of goat research at the world-wide level must be supported by international organisations such as FAO, ICARDA, ILRI, IGA, etc. Difficulties encountered by goat research are the same as those of the other animal species but in the goat sector the consequences are more significant because of its delayed development and very limited organisation.

Design aspects of \{MCWH\} are reviewed: \{MC\} size, ratio of contributing area to collecting area, and layout. \{MCWH\} is especially suitable to non-irrigated areas. The Kinematic Wave Equation and Dynamic Equations have been used in modelling MCWH. \{RFWH\} can be useful in improving irrigation water availability in surface reservoirs.

To reverse declining agricultural productivity, a combination of surface and subsurface drainage, supplemented by improved irrigation management, has been identified as the most appropriate strategy. But subsurface drainage for salinity control is costly. Therefore, its benefits in terms of sustained agricultural production must be thoroughly investigated to establish its techno-economic feasibility. The present study attempts to do this by analysing the cost of installing subsurface drainage, the direct on-farm benefits of subsurface drainage, and the financial feasibility of subsurface drainage. The site of the study selected for this study is Haryana State. The results show that, after the installation of drainage, land use intensified because a sizeable area of formerly fallow land was brought under cultivation. They also show that the cropping pattern changed in favour of more remunerative crops and that crop yields increased. These immediate gains from drainage are helping to increase land productivity, gainful employment of the farmers and, hence, farm income. The financial and economic feasibility of drainage in waterlogged and saline areas looks favourable, provided that sufficient water is available for leaching and irrigation, and that a sustainable solution for the disposal of the low-quality drainage effluent is found. With regard to the latter, creating ponds to temporarily store drainage effluent is technically possible, while not threatening the financial feasibility of the investments in drainage. "

abstract = "In the irrigated areas of semi-arid regions, especially in northwest India, a considerable recharge to the groundwater leads to waterlogging and secondary salinization. In several sub-areas groundwater is mined, water tables fall, and salts are added to the root zone because a high proportion of irrigation water is derived from pumped groundwater of poor quality. Out of 1 million hectares of irrigation induced waterlogged saline area in northwest India, approximately half a million hectares are in the state of Haryana. Taking a homogenous physical environment as a starting point, the way and the extent to which farmers’ activities will affect the salinity and sodicity situation depend on farming and irrigation practices. In the past, soil salinity was mainly associated with high groundwater tables, which bring salts into the root zone through capillary rise when water is pumped. But nowadays, increasing exploitation of groundwater for irrigation purposes has led to declining groundwater tables and a threat of sodification and salinization due to use of poor quality groundwater. Farmers in northwest India are facing a situation in which they have to deal with salt volumes that are harmful for water uptake of crops. They are also facing the problem of sodicity, which has an adverse effect on the physical structure of the soil, causing problems of water intake, transfer and aeration. To mitigate the adverse effect of soil salinity on crop yield, the farmers irrigate frequently, either mixing canal water and groundwater, or alternately using canal water and groundwater. Due to differences in environmental parameters in the farming systems, such as groundwater quality, soil types and uneven distribution of irrigation water, income losses to the farming community are not uniform. This paper highlights the economic loss due to environmental degradation through the twin problems of waterlogging and soil salinity, which threaten the sustainability of agricultural production in Haryana state. Our analysis shows that the net present value of the damage due to waterlogging and salinity in Haryana is about Rs. 23,900/ha (in 1998–1999 constant prices). The estimated potential annual loss is about Rs. 1669 million (about US$ 37 million) from the waterlogged saline area. The major finding of the paper is that intensification per se is not the root cause of land degradation, but rather the policy environment that encouraged inappropriate land use and injudicious input use, especially excessive irrigation. Trade policies, output price policies and input subsidies all have contributed to the degradation of agricultural land. "

abstract = "Although fundamental factors were clearly responsible for shifting the world to a higher food price equilibrium in the years leading up the 2008 food crisis, there is little doubt that when food prices peaked in June of 2008, they soared well above the new equilibrium price. Numerous arguments have been proposed to explain overshooting, including financial speculation, depreciation of the United States (US) dollar, low interest rates, and reductions in grain stocks. However, observations that international rice prices surged in response to export restrictions by India and Vietnam suggested that trade-related factors could be an important basis for overshooting, especially given the very tangible link between export volumes and export prices. In this paper, we revisit the trade story by closely examining monthly data from Thailand (the largest exporter of rice), and the United States (the largest exporter of wheat and maize and the third largest exporter of soybeans). In all cases except soybeans, we find that large surges in export volumes preceded the price surges. The presence of these large demand surges, together with back-of-the-envelope estimates of their price impacts, suggests that trade events played a much larger and more pervasive role than previously thought.

abstract = "Abstract Livestock provides numerous benefits to smallholders in sub-Saharan Africa, but also represents a potential agent of environmental degradation. Exclosures have been implemented in grazing areas for the past decades in Ethiopia and have been effective in regenerating natural vegetation, controlling soil erosion and increasing soil fertility. More recently, the principles of exclosure have been applied to farmland in pilot areas of Ethiopia. This paper analyzes the impact of eight years of farmland exclosure in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia. The performance of ‘exclosed farms’ (EF) – in which livestock was excluded from the farmland throughout the year – was compared to the performance of neighboring ‘open grazing farms’ (OF) – in which fields were open for aftermath grazing in winter. \{EF\} and \{OF\} had significantly different feed and fuel use strategies. Compared to OF, \{EF\} relied less on cereal residues, farmland grass, and livestock dung, and more on biomass produced in the communal grazing area (trees and grass) and tree biomass produced on-farm. Because of these different patterns of feed and fuel use, more biomass – in the form of crop residue, manure and compost – was available as soil amendment in EF. This translated into significantly more fertile soils and significantly higher tef yields in \{EF\} as compared to \{OF\} (1980 ± 644 kg ha−1 in \{EF\} vs. 1173 ± 434 kg ha−1 in OF). These results demonstrate that farmland exclosure is a practical pathway toward sustainable intensification. However, attention should be drawn to three points: (1) the approach impacted positively on crop productivity, but had a negligible impact on livestock productivity, (2) \{EF\} livestock still depended partially on grazing (outside of the exclosure) for their acquisition of feed, pointing at the fact that zero-grazing sensu stricto may not be realistic in semi-arid areas of Ethiopia, and (3) land rehabilitation through controlled grazing may only be feasible in particular geographic locations (e.g., physical barriers preventing outside livestock to access the area, and presence of alternative grazing areas in the vicinity).

Farmers’ reasons for adopting soil conservation measures vary sharply between stone terraces and soil bunds. Long-term investments in stone terraces were associated with secure land tenure, labour availability, proximity to the farmstead and learning opportunities via the existence of local food-for-work (FFW) projects. By contrast, short-term investments in soil bunds were strongly linked to insecure land tenure and the absence of local food-for-work projects. Public conservation campaigns on private plots reduced adoption of both stone terraces and soil bunds. Whereas capacity factors largely influenced the adoption decision, expected returns carried more influence for the intensity of stone terrace adoption (measured as metres of terrace per hectare). More stone terracing was built where fertile but erodible silty soils in higher rainfall areas offered valuable yield benefits. Intensity of terracing was also greater in remote villages where limited off-farm employment opportunities reduced construction costs. These results highlight the importance of the right kind of public interventions. Direct public involvement in constructing soil conservation structures on private lands appears to undermine incentives for private conservation investments. When done on public lands, however, public conservation activities may encourage private soil conservation by example. Secure land tenure rights clearly reinforce private incentives to make long-term investments in soil conservation. "

Most stover fodder quality traits were highly significantly different among the lines except ADF. These differences were substantial among best and worst lines for the traits, with stover N varying threefold and NDF, \{ADF\} and \{IVOMD\} by more than 10 percentage units. Among the agronomic traits, significant positive associations were observed among grain and stover yield. Grain yield was significantly negatively associated with DtA50 and Anthesis to silking interval (AtS) and positively with PH. Stover yield was significantly negatively associated with DtA50 and positively with PH. Desirable stover quality traits N, \{IVOMD\} and \{ME\} were significantly negatively associated with grain yield (R2 = 0.25–0.28) while undesirable quality traits NDF, \{ADF\} and \{ADL\} were significantly positively associated with grain yield (R2 = 0.04–0.23). Stover yields were largely unrelated fodder quality traits except for a significant negative association with \{NDF\} and \{ADF\} (R2 = 0.04 to 0.08). \{GWAS\} analysis carried out using \{GBS\} (genotyping by sequencing) and a 55K \{SNPs\} genotypic dataset revealed several regions of significant association for N, \{ADF\} and IVOMD, each explaining from 3 to 9% of phenotypic variance for these fodder quality traits. \{SYN7725\} from the 55K chip on chromosome 4 explained the largest proportion of phenotypic variance (∼9%) for \{ADF\} and had a robust minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.35. A specific genomic region on chromosome 3 (132.7–149.2 Mb) was found to be significantly associated with all the three forage quality traits, with the largest effect on IVOMD. This region merits attention for further validation and marker-assisted introgressions. A cellulose-related candidate gene, Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (xth1, GRMZM2G119783) was also identified closer to the peak on chr.10 (∼76.9 Mb) for ADF, which has been previously demonstrated to have a significant role in fiber elongation in cotton.

Data were recorded on various agronomic traits including yields. At harvest the stover was analyzed for a range of fodder quality traits. On the basis of high stover in vitro digestibility (IVOMD) (a trait chosen because it correlated well with pricing in fodder trading of another coarse stover, namely sorghum) and high grain yield, the top ranking 10 inbred lines were selected and crossed in all possible combinations (excluding reciprocals) using diallel mating design in the rainy season of 2010.

While the normal phase transformation in the batch \{MT\} crystallizer required over 120 min of crystallization time without using the sodium chloride additive, the process was completed within 60 min when a small amount of the salt additive was added. The phase transformation was also significantly accelerated in the continuous \{CT\} crystallizer.

The test showed limited sensitivity for detection of primary-infected cattle but was capable of accurately detecting secondary infections.

The effect of process parameters such as extraction temperature and pressure, pre-expansion temperature, spray distance, and nozzle configuration on the particle size of adefovir dipivoxil was evaluated and it was found that the process parameters did influence the particles size. The solubility of adefovir dipivoxil in \{CO2\} was measured for the purpose of setting proper experimental conditions. Increasing the extraction temperature (308.15–328.15 K) caused the particle size of adefovir dipivoxil to increase. Particle size decreased with increasing extraction pressure (20–30 MPa). The particle size of adefovir dipivoxil increased with increasing pre-expansion temperature. An increase in the spray distance (8, 16, 32 cm) resulted in a decrease in the average size of particles. The effect of the internal nozzle diameter on the size and shape of the precipitated particles was examined using different nozzle internal diameters (152, 500, 762 μm).

Retaining crop residues in the field is not only a prerequisite for \{CA\} but may also be the most viable option for African farmers to retain their fields in a productive state. In this paper, (1) we explore the possibility of increasing the quantity of crop residue available by closing the maize yield, (2) we propose interventions that can reduce crop residue demand for livestock feed, and (3) we quantify the optimum amount of crop residues required as mulch, using empirical, secondary and modeling data from Western Kenya and the Ethiopian Rift Valley. Residue retention can also be increased by reducing livestock demand. Closing the maize yield gap–i.e. achieve 90% of the water-limited yield potential–and intensifying dairy production–which would promote the use of rations that are more energy-dense than cereal residue-based rations–would increase the estimated proportion of farmers retaining at least 1 t ha−1 of crop residues from the current 36% to 97% in Western Kenya. In the Ethiopian Rift Valley, closing the maize yield gap and substituting mechanization to animal draught power would increase the estimated proportion of farmers retaining at least 1 t ha−1 of crop residues from the current 3% to 83%. We conclude that the question is not ‘if’, but ‘how’ cereal residues can fulfill the demand of both the soil and the livestock. "

The potential impacts of changes in climate and climate variability on these mixed systems are not that well understood, particularly as regards how the food security of vulnerable households may be affected. There are many ways in which the mixed systems may be able to adapt to climate change in the future, including via increased efficiencies of production that sometimes provide important mitigation co-benefits as well. But effective adaptation will require an enabling policy, technical, infrastructural and informational environment, and the development challenge is daunting. "

This is performed by simulating the behavior of individuals in an agent-based modeling framework which integrates the village characteristics as well as the family internal rules that condition access to economic and production activities. Villagers are differentiated according to the social and agro-ecological constraints they are subjected to. Two development project interventions are simulated, assuming no land scarcity: increasing the availability of inorganic fertilizers for farmers and an inventory credit technique based on millet grain. Two distinct approaches were used to model the rationale of farmers’ decision making: gains or losses in economic value or gains or losses in within-village “reputation”. Our results show that village populations do not respond en masse to development interventions. Reputation has little effect on the population behavior and should be considered more as a local proxy for wealth amongst villagers, suggesting the monetization of these societies. Populations involve themselves in the two simulated development interventions only at sites where savings are possible. Some level of household food security and investment capacity is actually required to take part in the development interventions, which are largely conditioned by family manpower and size. As long as uncultivated land remains available in the village territory, support for inorganic fertilizers has little impact in the absence of any intensification process. Inventory credit engages a maximum of 25% of the population at the site with medium agro-ecological conditions. Therefore, both interventions should be viewed as a potential support tool for a limited part of the population capable of going beyond the survival level, but not as a generic poverty-alleviation panacea.

Also, the kinetics of polymorphic transformation was investigated to effectively control polymorphs. The \{AD\} crystals were obtained by crystallization at −10 °C, and then the polymorphic transformation was induced by raising temperature. The polymorphs of \{AD\} were confirmed using DSC, \{XRD\} and solubility analyses. The polymorphic fraction during transformation was monitored for kinetic investigation. Via polymorphic transformation in solution, four polymorphs of \{AD\} were found and two of them were new (NF-I, NF-II). The \{DSC\} analysis revealed that solvate form (NF-I) was changed to form-V in solid state, and then re-crystallized to NF-II at 93 °C, and finally became form-I at 97 °C. This serial change of polymorphs in \{DSC\} was identical to polymorphic transformation sequence in solution. The kinetic rates of polymorphic transformation described by nucleation and mass transfer theories were well matched with experimental measurement. The polymorphic transformation approach was effective to search polymorphs of which the structure was changed to the other one in the solution. The kinetic information of polymorphic transformation predicted by Volmer's nucleation model and Stokes–Einstein diffusion equation was valuable for exact control of polymorphic purity. "

We then outline a method to cluster the soils in the Harmonized World Soil Database to produce soil maps at coarser resolution, and we describe derived global soil maps at spatial resolutions of 5 and 10 arcmin, which may be more practical for some large-scale modelling studies. The derived data files allow a user to select any point or area on land and then to access the set of soil profiles pertaining to the mapping unit selected, which are available in a format suitable for use in modelling applications. In situations where the user has little or no other information about the soils in the region of study, the methods described can be used to produce plausible soil profile information based on the most up-to-date global soil map currently available.

Therefore, we compared the protective capacity of the live T1/44 vaccine with two inactivated preparations of Mmm strain Afadé, inoculated with an adjuvant. Protection was measured after a challenge with Afadé. The protection levels were 31%, 80.8% and 74.1% for the formalin-inactivated, heat-inactivated and live attenuated preparations, respectively.

Our aim was to induce antibody responses to \{CPS\} in cattle, and challenge them when they had specific \{CPS\} antibody titres similar or higher than those from cattle vaccinated with the live vaccine. The \{CPS\} was linked to the carrier protein ovalbumin via a carbodiimide-mediated condensation with 1-ethyl-3(3-imethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC). Ten animals were immunized twice and challenged three weeks after the booster inoculation, and compared to a group of challenged non-immunized cattle. When administered subcutaneously to adult cattle, the vaccine elicited CPS-specific antibody responses with the same or a higher titre than animals vaccinated with the live vaccine.

Two hundred and eighteen farms were selected to represent areas of the country with high goat and sheep populations and the full range of farm sizes, from smallholders with just a few animals to commercial and institutional farms with several hundred. Initial surveys of worm control advisers indicated that \{BZs\} have been in continuous widespread use for up to 20 years with little use of other chemical groups. A larval development assay (LDA: DrenchRite®) was modified for use with \{BZs\} alone to allow up to five samples to be analysed on a single microtitre plate. The assay was validated by comparison with the faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT). The dominant nematode genera were Haemonchus and Trichostrongylus with small numbers of Oesophagostomum. The range of \{BZ\} efficacy estimated from the \{LDA\} results was 0–100% and the distribution of efficacy levels was continuous, with mean efficacy of 82 and 64% for goats and sheep, respectively. There were significant associations between efficacy and parameters measured to characterize the sampled farms: size of animal management group, \{FEC\} of sample, recent importation of stock and no access to common grazing were all correlated with decreased efficacy. Likewise, low efficacy was associated with reported frequency and number of years that \{BZ\} drenches had been used. The \{LDA\} was found to be highly suited to estimate efficacy in nematode populations from small farms where performance of a \{FECRT\} for even one chemical would be impractical. Using a larval development assay, we have demonstrated a wide efficacy range for \{BZs\} against nematodes from all sizes of goat and sheep farms in the tropics. "

To prevent this irreversible erosion of genetic diversity, the limited funds available for conservation need to be allocated in the most efficient way. Applying the diversity concept of Weitzman [Quart. J. Econ. \{CVII\} (1992) 363; Quart. J. Econ. \{CVIII\} (1993) 157] this paper presents a framework for the allocation of a given budget among a set of breeds such that the expected amount of between-breed diversity conserved is maximized. As a novel methodological contribution, a functional relationship between conservation funds spent in one population and the conservation effect in terms of reduced extinction probability is suggested. Based on arguments from population genetics, three different functions are derived, which may reflect the range of possible functions in typical conservation situations. The methodology is illustrated with an example of 23 African zebu and zenga cattle breeds. The results indicate that conservation funds should be spent on only three to nine of the 23 breeds, depending on the model used. Highest priority is given to breeds, for which the ‘conservation potential’, that is, the product of extinction probability and marginal diversity is maximum, and these are not necessarily the most endangered breeds. The methodology can be extended to the maximization of total utility, which incorporates diversity, as well as other direct use, and special value, characteristics. However, a number of essential input parameters such as extinction probabilities and economic values are lacking and realistic models for developing cost-efficient conservation strategies have to be derived. Given these lacking bits of information become available, the methodology suggested provides a breakthrough towards applicability of diversity-based approaches for decision taking in conservation programs.

The objective is to investigate the performance of choice experiments (CEs) in Maasai cattle trading, by conducting an external test of preference consistency. We compare value estimates for cattle attributes from \{CEs\} data with those from hedonic analysis of actual transactions by the same population of traders, in the same markets and over the same period. If \{CEs\} perform well, they can be used to investigate values of those genetically-determined livestock traits currently not prominent in pastoralists’ populations, but desirable candidates for breeding or conservation programmes (e.g. disease resistance). The results indicate that \{CE\} estimates pass the external test and appear to be adequately precise in estimating values for cattle traits that are relevant in market transactions for Maasai traders. Accounting for taste and variance heterogeneity does not change this conclusion. \{CEs\} may, therefore, be a promising tool for valuing phenotypic traits expressed by indigenous AnGR. "

Therefore, we assessed the long-term impact of a commonly used \{SWC\} technique (Fanya-juu terracing) on SOM-related properties in South Eastern Kenya. A soil sampling campaign was conducted in a replicated stratified random manner on three land uses that had been continuously managed for over 30 years. Samples were analyzed for organic carbon and nitrogen contents, δ13C, δ15N, pH and texture. Compared to sites implementing conventional agriculture, the establishment of \{SWC\} structures in this erosion-prone landscape resulted in the recovery of \{SOM\} levels comparable to those observed in neighboring semi-natural ecosystems. Sites under conventional agriculture practices contained 20 Mg C ha− 1 (0.85 m), while sites with \{SWC\} measures and those hosting semi-natural vegetation stored above a third more. There were significant differences in soil C/N ratios as well as in δ13C and δ15N values between \{SWC\} cultivation practices classified according to the presence or absence of trees. The presence of woody vegetation in sites with \{SWC\} structures had a strong impact on the spatial variability of SOM-related properties. There was also a significant negative relationship between δ15N values and C/N ratios across the different land uses. Our findings indicate the existence of contrasting \{SOM\} dynamics caused by vegetation-related effects, and provide suggestions for enhancing \{SOM\} storage in agricultural sites implementing \{SWC\} measures.

In pearl millet stems, lignin and esterified p-coumaric acid (pCA) were significantly different between genotypes. In sorghum, N, lignin and phenolic acids—except esterified pCA were significantly different between genotypes. Except at 12 h for sorghum, gas production of walls was significantly different between genotypes and ranked genotypes differently than gas of stems. Soluble sugars in the stems of both pearl millet and sorghum were positively correlated to gas production at 12, 24, and 36 h, and vice versa for cell walls. In pearl millet, phenolic acids were not significantly correlated with either gas production of whole stems or that of walls, with the exception of etherified pCA of walls. On the other hand, in sorghum, etherified pCA of stems and walls were negatively correlated with gas at 72 and 96 h. The significant differences of gas production between genotypes, different ranking of genotypes with the progression of the fermentation, and the gas production differences between whole stems and walls indicate the differential effect of soluble sugars and of cell wall type on the digestibility of whole stems. This study points out the need to look in greater details at the relationship and the interactions between the effects of soluble and structural carbohydrates in stovers and the genetic base that determines it. Such studies could identify the most adequate combination of traits useful in crop improvement programs taking into account feed value of stover of dual-purpose crops. "

To do so, a meat sheep herd for fattening lambs and rearing young replacement sheep was simulated. Traits included in the analysis were: daily gain (fattening trait), live weight of ewes, length of productive life, lambing interval, litter size, stillbirths and lamb survival (functional traits). To avoid double counting, the economic value for each trait was derived while keeping all other traits constant. Economic values were obtained per ewe place, year, and genetic standard deviation. For the Menz breed, economic values in € per genetic standard deviation were 0.63 (daily gain), −0.77 (mature ewe live weight), −0.97 (length of productive life), 1.57 (lambing interval), 0.98 (litter size), 0.41 (stillbirths) and 2.20 (lamb survival). Economic values (in €) of 1.35 (daily gain), −1.26 (mature ewe live weight), −1.15 (length of productive life), 1.98 (lambing interval), 3.67 (litter size), 0.56 (stillbirth) and 3.25 (lamb survival) were derived for the Horro breed. Negative economic values for length of productive life and mature ewe live weight were estimated for both breeds. After setting the economic values of length of productive life and mature ewe live weight to zero, the economic values (in %) for the ratio of the trait complexes fattening: functional traits were 11:89 and 12.5:87.5 for Menz and Horro, respectively. Economic values for litter size, lambing interval and lamb survival traits were sensitive to changes in price for breeding rams in both breeds. "

Three challenges are highlighted: (1) ensuring the appropriate scope for action; (2) moving beyond intervention-based decision guidance; and (3) developing long-term shared capacity for strategic planning. To overcome these challenges we have applied explorative scenarios and normative back-casting with stakeholders from different sectors at the regional level in East Africa. We then applied lessons about appropriate scope, enabling adaptation pathways, and developing strategic planning capacity to scenarios processes in multiple global regions. Scenarios were created to have a broad enough scope to be relevant to diverse actors, and then adapted by different actor groups to ensure their salience in specific decision contexts. The initial strategy for using the scenarios by bringing a range of actors together to explore new collaborative proposals had limitations as well as strengths versus the application of scenarios for specific actor groups and existing decision pathways. Scenarios development and use transitioned from an intervention-based process to an embedded process characterized by continuous engagement. Feasibility and long-term sustainability could be ensured by having decision makers own the process and focusing on developing strategic planning capacity within their home organizations. "

A cross-sectional study, to determine the sero-prevalence of the parasite in pigs kept under rural and urban production settings, was carried out in three Ugandan districts, Masaka, Mukono and Kamuli. Serum samples from 1185 pigs were tested for the presence of T. solium cysticercosis antigen using the \{HP10\} antigen-ELISA (Ag-ELISA) and the ApDia Ag-ELISA assays. Using parallel interpretation of the two tests showed lower levels of observed prevalence of T. solium in rural production settings (10.8%) compared to urban (17.1%). Additionally, Maximum Likelihood Estimation for evaluating assays in the absence of a gold standard, using \{TAGS\} on the R platform, estimated the true sero-prevalence to be lower in rural production setting, 0.0% [0.0–3.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI)] than in urban production setting, 12.3% (4.2–77.5% CI). When the sensitivity/specificity (Se/Sp) of the assays were estimated, assuming conditional independence of the tests, \{HP10\} Ag-ELISA was more sensitive and specific [(Se = 53.9%; 10.1–100% CI), (Sp = 97.0%; 95.9-100% CI)] than the ApDia assay [(Se = 20.2%; 1.5–47.7% CI), (Sp = 92.2%; 90.5–93.9% CI)].

The first part of the study investigated livestock keeper knowledge about trypanosomosis and trypanotolerance. For each breed 60 livestock keepers were interviewed, resulting in a total of 240 interviews. The second part of the study focused on biological evidence for trypanotolerance. Blood samples of about 100 head of cattle per breed were collected during peak trypanosomosis challenge period and analyzed for packed cell volume (PCV) and parasitaemia. In addition individual body measurements of the sampled animals were taken and the keepers provided some information regarding their animals. Livestock keeper interviews revealed that trypanosomosis was considered a major problem in all areas (95–100%). Almost all Abigar livestock keepers knew how trypanosomosis is transmitted, whereas only 34–52% of the keepers of the other breeds had that knowledge. Most Sheko keepers (75%) knew of trypanotolerance and claimed to have trypanotolerant animals in their own herds. Among the other three breeds the knowledge of trypanotolerance was much less (8–18%). A majority of the keepers were interested in purchasing trypanotolerant animals. \{PCV\} was highest among Horro (26.2) and Sheko (25.1) cattle whereas Abigar had the lowest \{PCV\} (20.0). Sheko were least infected by trypanosomes (6%) and had the lowest number of trypanocidal treatments per year (1 treatment/animal and year). Abigar cattle were most infected (23%) followed by Gurage (20%) and Horro (17%). Gurage had by far the highest number of treatments per animal and year (24). There were large differences between the number of cattle perceived by the keepers to be infected, and the number detected from blood sampled, among Abigar, Gurage and Horro. Sheko livestock keepers were better at correctly diagnosing trypanosomosis in their animals. It is concluded that Sheko cattle have higher trypanotolerance attributes of the breeds investigated and a better use of this breed could improve cattle health and household welfare in tsetse-infested areas.

Using the recombinant \{DNA\} hybridization technique, the isolates were further classified as the ‘savannah’ type of Trypanosoma congolense. Furthermore, chromosome separation by OFAGE, carried out on six clones derived from different isolates, exhibited a profile characteristic of T. congolense, ‘savannah’ type. However, there were differences in the number and positions of the medium-sized and minichromosomes indicating a diversity of serodemes within the isolates. Hence the infecting trypanosomes in this disease outbreak were T. congolense, ‘savannah’ type, and comprised several serodemes or strains. "

The character of international agricultural research has changed profoundly in the last decades of the twentieth century. This can be illustrated by developments within the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). The need for a support of comprehensive systems' analysis of the \{CGIAR\} agenda required new research; therefore, the development agencies of the Dutch and Swiss governments initiated the Ecoregional Methodology Fund in 1995 as part of its development-oriented activities. This Fund was expected to support the development of new methodological tools for research that is ecoregional in scope with the intention of promoting new approaches to natural resource management and rural development in ecoregions. This chapter summarizes and discusses the accomplishments and the future challenges of Ecoregional Methodology Fund. In doing so, the chapter presents a sketch of the changing social and political environment in which the work has been done, ranging from the \{UN\} Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to the strategy of the \{CGIAR\} Science Council and the Gleneagle summit. It also elaborates the changing role of research, vis-a-vis the policy cycle. Implications for research, including new forms of interaction, design of operational tools, and new forms of education and communication are also discussed in the chapter. "

abstract = "Abstract Endemic animal diseases such as tsetse-transmitted trypanosomosis are a constant drain on the financial resources of African livestock keepers and on the productivity of their livestock. Knowing where the potential benefits of removing animal trypanosomosis are distributed geographically would provide crucial evidence for prioritising and targeting cost-effective interventions as well as a powerful tool for advocacy. To this end, a study was conducted on six tsetse-infested countries in Eastern Africa: Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda. First, a map of cattle production systems was generated, with particular attention to the presence of draught and dairy animals. Second, herd models for each production system were developed for two scenarios: with or without trypanosomosis. The herd models were based on publications and reports on cattle productivity (fertility, mortality, yields, sales), from which the income from, and growth of cattle populations were estimated over a twenty-year period. Third, a step-wise spatial expansion model was used to estimate how cattle populations might migrate to new areas when maximum stocking rates are exceeded. Last, differences in income between the two scenarios were mapped, thus providing a measure of the maximum benefits that could be obtained from intervening against tsetse and trypanosomosis. For this information to be readily mappable, benefits were calculated per bovine and converted to US$ per square kilometre. Results indicate that the potential benefits from dealing with trypanosomosis in Eastern Africa are both very high and geographically highly variable. The estimated total maximum benefit to livestock keepers for the whole of the study area amounts to nearly US$ 2.5 billion, discounted at 10% over twenty years – an average of approximately US$ 3300 per square kilometre of tsetse-infested area – but with great regional variation from less than US$ 500 per square kilometre to well over US$ 10,000. The greatest potential benefits accrue to Ethiopia, because of its very high livestock densities and the importance of animal traction, but also to parts of Kenya and Uganda. In general, the highest benefit levels occur on the fringes of the tsetse infestations. The implications of the models’ assumptions and generalisations are discussed. "

abstract = "Abstract This study builds upon earlier work mapping the potential benefits from bovine trypanosomosis control and analysing the costs of different approaches. Updated costs were derived for five intervention techniques: trypanocides, targets, insecticide-treated cattle, aerial spraying and the release of sterile males. Two strategies were considered: continuous control and elimination. For mapping the costs, cattle densities, environmental constraints, and the presence of savannah or riverine tsetse species were taken into account. These were combined with maps of potential benefits to produce maps of benefit-cost ratios. The results illustrate a diverse picture, and they clearly indicate that no single technique or strategy is universally profitable. For control using trypanocide prophylaxis, returns are modest, even without accounting for the risk of drug resistance but, in areas of low cattle densities, this is the only approach that yields a positive return. Where cattle densities are sufficient to support it, the use of insecticide-treated cattle stands out as the most consistently profitable technique, widely achieving benefit-cost ratios above 5. In parts of the high-potential areas such as the mixed farming, high-oxen-use zones of western Ethiopia, the fertile crescent north of Lake Victoria and the dairy production areas in western and central Kenya, all tsetse control strategies achieve benefit-cost ratios from 2 to over 15, and for elimination strategies, ratios from 5 to over 20. By contrast, in some areas, notably where cattle densities are below 20 per km2, the costs of interventions against tsetse match or even outweigh the benefits, especially for control scenarios using aerial spraying or the deployment of targets where both savannah and riverine flies are present. If the burden of human African trypanosomosis were factored in, the benefit-cost ratios of some of the low-return areas would be considerably increased. Comparatively, elimination strategies give rise to higher benefit-cost ratios than do those for continuous control. However, the costs calculated for elimination assume problem-free, large scale operations, and they rest on the outputs of entomological models that are difficult to validate in the field. Experience indicates that the conditions underlying successful and sustained elimination campaigns are seldom met. By choosing the most appropriate thresholds for benefit-cost ratios, decision-makers and planners can use the maps to define strategies, assist in prioritising areas for intervention, and help choose among intervention techniques and approaches. The methodology would have wider applicability in analysing other disease constraints with a strong spatial component. "

This paper investigates spatial variation in willingness to accept (WTA) payments made by the Wildlife Conservation Lease Program in the Athi-Kaputiei plains of Kenya. The program, designed as an incentive to keep land open for wildlife and livestock, offers land owners 10 US$ per ha per year, irrespective of location. We model the relation between \{WTA\} and distances to roads, towns and rivers, annual precipitation and slope and display the predicted spatial variation in WTA. The results reveal significant spatial variation in willingness to accept payments for availing land for conservation, with higher \{WTA\} concentrated away from roads and also in the Southeast of the plains. The results further suggest that wildlife movement will be blocked due to low \{WTA\} in the proximity of towns and tarmacked roads. We conclude that an effective strategy to keep the land open for migratory wildlife should consider spatial variation in \{WTA\} payment for land lease. It is suggested to consider stratifying the lease rates geographically to reflect the underlying spatial variation in WTA. "

Most of the research, however, focuses only on aggregate human well-being and disregards distributional and equity issues associated with ecosystem services. We review approaches from institutional economics, political ecology and the social sciences in order to develop an analytical framework to understand the distribution of benefits from ecosystems across different socio-cultural groups and the underlying social processes involved. We then present a case study of the distribution of provisioning ecosystem services in a forest-fringe village in Odisha, India. Our analysis shows the unequal distribution of ecosystem services and complex social processes that determine these. We identify the determining factors and processes to include: differential resource-specific needs, different cultural identities, differentiated social status and bargaining power, exclusionary and inclusionary social practices, differential access. Our analysis proves therefore that aggregation of forest ecosystem benefits obscures crucially important patterns of distribution, and the underlying social processes that determine these. This also demonstrates the necessity of applying social science frameworks in such analyses. Our study also shows that most ecosystem services are co-produced through both ecosystem processes and social actions, and so their assessment cannot be separated from the social context in which they are embedded. In conclusion we recommend that ecosystem services research engages more with process-oriented, context-specific and integrated approaches, based on a recognition of the complexity of social-ecological realities.

About 67% of red meat is produced in the arid and semi-arid lands under pastoral production system. With demand for meat products rapidly increasing, improved meat marketing may raise the ability of livestock keepers to meet financial obligations and generally improve livelihoods. The meat consumption behaviour by consumers will contribute to the development of livestock sector in general and small ruminant in particular. Yet the information on consumer demand for small ruminants is not well quantified. One contributing factor is lack of data and information on marketing of small ruminants and their products. This causes failure in appreciating the importance of these animals in contributing to the development of livestock sector. This article aims to contribute to filling this information gap by collecting and analysing data related to the consumption of small ruminant meat. Specifically, this article explores the factors that influence demand for small ruminant meat. A structured questionnaire was used to elicit information on consumer demand. A transect line method was used to sample 103 households. Both descriptive and econometrics analysis were used to examine factors that influence demand for small ruminant meat. The survey revealed that about 55% of the households preferred to consume small ruminants’ meat over beef. The Tobit model revealed small ruminant price, district location of household, household monthly income spent on food, purchase cost of small ruminant meat as a proportion of income and perception of small ruminant meat as quality to be factors influencing the probability of consumer demand for the meat. The article recommends dissemination of these findings as important since knowledge of existing and potential demand would assist both scientists and extension workers to educate and encourage producers to produce what is needed in the market. Thus, this would enhance producer access and bargaining power in the market, leading to increased incomes and improved livelihoods of the people. "

From an initial 41 pure or cross-bred Bos taurus calves which were less than 2 months and whose birth and disease histories were known, study calves were recruited progressively and monitored until they were weaned at around 146 days. Overall, 130 calves in 67 farms were monitored and these contributed a total risk period of 30,062 days. Disease parameters were analysed and compared as true annual and age-specific incidence rates. The incidences of East Coast fever (ECF) (23.1%) and trypanosomosis (29.1%) were the highest among the vector-borne diseases. The corresponding mortality incidence rates of \{ECF\} and trypanosomosis were 10.9 and 3.6%, respectively. The annual incidence rates of anaplasmosis and babesiosis were 10.9 and 1.2%, respectively. There was no mortality arising specifically from anaplasmosis or babesiosis. Analysis of survival times to natural infection indicated that the field challenge resulting to cases of trypanosomosis was much higher compared to the risk of either \{ECF\} or anaplasmosis. It was concluded that these vector-borne diseases constrain production of replacement stock in this coastal lowlands region of Kenya. "

abstract = "Abstract Metacestodes, the larval stages of canid cestode parasites, are among the causes of morbidity, mortality and financial losses in small ruminants in Ethiopia as a result of organ and carcass condemnation at slaughter. Several studies have been conducted over the years; however, these studies often had limited scope and coverage. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to collate the information so far available in order to provide a pooled prevalence estimate at national level and identify potential predictors. Published and grey literature written in English and Amharic in the period from, 1st of January 1990 to June 25, 2015 were searched from electronic databases and repositories of academic and research institutions. Relevant animal level data on 67,743 small ruminants was extracted from 23 published articles and one master’s thesis resulting altogether in 86 animal level reports that conformed to predefined criteria. The dataset was analyzed using a meta-analytical approach. The pooled prevalence estimate computed for metacestodes infection was 11.8% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 9.1, 15.4. The highest prevalence estimate 31.2% (95% CI: 23.1, 40.9) was found for Cysticercus tenuicollis (Taenia hydatigena) followed by cystic echinococcosis (Echinococcus granulosus) 8.8% (95% CI: 5.8, 13.1), Cysticercus ovis (Taenia ovis) 4.9% (95% CI: 2.9, 9.4) and Coenurus cerebralis (Taenia multiceps) 4.6% (95% CI: 1.6, 12.2). Among the predictors considered for heterogeneity analysis only sample size and metacestode type fitted the final multivariable meta-regression model and explained 26.3% of the explainable heterogeneity between studies (p&lt;0.05). The prevalence was noted to decrease with increasing sample size. No significant difference in prevalence was observed between sheep and goats (p&gt;0.05). In conclusion, this review showed a widespread occurrence of metacestodes in small ruminants in Ethiopia. Thus, a holistic approach to break the life cycle of these parasitic stages is suggested, including regulatory interventions that encourage dog owners to keep their dogs confined and prevent backyard slaughter and proper management of abattoir waste disposal.

Firstly, a sentinel-calf study was used to determine the age window for \{ECF\} immunisation by determining ages at clinical detection of infection with Theileria parva. Six groups of five naive cross-bred (Bos taurus/Bos indicus) male calves, introduced at intervals of 2 months at a mean age of 26 days, were exposed to natural tick challenge on a high ECF-risk, small-holder farm in the coastal lowland, coconut–cassava agro-ecological zone of coastal Kenya. Secondly, a challenge study evaluated the relationship between the presence of T. parva antibodies and immunity. Ten indigenous adult Zebu cattle and nine Zebu young stock purchased from farmers in the same zone, and eight cross-bred calves (survivors of the sentinel-calf study) were challenged with 10 times the immunising dose of T. parva Marikebuni stock. Twenty-four of these 27 cattle had high antibody titres before challenge. Two cross-bred calves, obtained from an ECF-free area and seronegative to T. parva schizont antigen, also were challenged and used as susceptible controls. Twenty-five (83%) of the 30 sentinel calves contracted \{ECF\} over an age range of 36–116 days (mean 72 days). The remaining five calves died of other causes within 2 months of arrival on the farm. Fourteen of the 25 calves survived the infection and developed antibodies to T. parva. Despite tick control, seven of these 14 calves had a second episode of \{ECF\} and two died. In total, 13 of the 25 calves that contracted \{ECF\} died. Only one of 19 indigenous Zebu animals developed clinical \{ECF\} when challenged with T. parva Marikebuni (mild clinical signs with spontaneous recovery). Of the eight cross-bred survivors from the first experiment, only one succumbed to \{ECF\} when challenged and it died. Both susceptible cross-bred calves developed severe clinical signs of \{ECF\} and one died. The experimental studies show that in the high ECF-risk areas of the coconut–cassava zone of coastal Kenya, immunisation against \{ECF\} in cross-bred (B. taurus/B. indicus) cattle should be targeted at an early age (preferably within 1–2 months of birth).

One hundred and thirty of the 157 herds with dairy cattle in Kaloleni Division were surveyed. These were from three agro-ecological zones (coconut–cassava, cashewnut–cassava and livestock–millet), comprised two management systems (stall-feeding and herded grazing) and were herds with either dairy cattle only or with Zebu and dairy cattle. A formal questionnaire sought answers to questions on cattle health and management practices. A total of 734 dairy and 205 Zebu cattle in 78 dairy and 52 mixed (dairy and Zebu) herds were sampled and screened for haemoparasites (Trypanosoma, Anaplasma, Babesia, and Theileria infections). Sera were tested for antibodies to Theileria parva, using the schizonts-antigen indirect fluorescent-antibody (IFA) test and to antibodies for Babesia bigemina and antigens to Anaplasma marginale by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Packed-cell volume (PCV) also was measured. Tick-control measures were practised by all except three of the farmers. Despite this, overall seroprevalence to T. parva was &gt;70% — suggesting either that control practices were not strictly implemented or they were ineffective. The seroprevalence of T. parva in adult cattle kept in stall-feeding systems in the coconut–cassava zone was significantly lower (57±8% (S.E.)) than in herded-grazing systems (79±3%) and there was no association between antibody prevalence and age of cattle in this zone. Antibody prevalences in cattle in the cashewnut–cassava and the drier livestock–millet zone increased with age. Cattle in herded-grazing systems had an overall lower seroprevalence of T. parva infection in the livestock–millet zone (45±6%) than in the other two zones. Analysis was confined to the coconut–cassava zone for B. bigemina and to the coconut–cassava and cashewnut–cassava zones for A. marginale. Mean prevalences of B. bigemina were 40.9±9 and 73±6% for dairy cattle under stall-feeding and herded-grazing systems, respectively, and increased with age. Antigen prevalences of A. marginale were over 80% in all age groups of cattle in the coconut–cassava and cashewnut–cassava zones. Overall trypanosome prevalence in cattle was &lt;1%. Trypanocidal treatment was uncommon. The variations in antibody prevalence associated with risk factors such as feeding system, agro-ecological zone and age of animal suggest that management system influenced exposure to tick-borne infection (particularly, T. parva infections) in small-holder dairy cattle in coastal Kenya.

A longitudinal study was conducted in same three districts over a 1-year period. The study sites were chosen from the cross-sectional study and included eight sites showing high trypanosomosis prevalence and where no control activities were recorded. Use was made of parasitological methods, tests of resistance in cattle and mice and isometamidium-ELISA. Overall mean prevalence of trypanosomosis was 14.4, with 96% of infections caused by Trypanosoma congolense. The remainder was caused by Trypanosoma vivax (2%) and Trypanosoma brucei (2%). Tests in mice showed that of the stabilates collected, 24 (34%) were resistant to only isometamidium chloride, 8 (11.3%) were resistant to only diminazene aceturate, 1 (1.4%) was resistant to both drugs, and 38 (53.5%) were sensitive to both drugs. At least 2 out of 27 stabilates tested in cattle appeared to be resistant to trypanocidal drugs, 1 to isometamidium and 1 to diminazene. Isometamidium could be detected in only 63 (4.1%) of 1526 serum samples from cattle in the study. Only 6 (2.8%) of 212 serum samples from trypanosome-infected cattle had serum levels of the drug above 0.4 ng isometamidium per ml serum which is indicative for drug resistance in the infecting parasite population. Although some drug resistance is apparent, diminazene aceturate and isometamidium chloride can still be expected to be effective as a sanative pair in this area in most cases, since not more than 1 stabilate of 71 investigated showed evidence of resistance to both drugs.

Subsequently, the study aimed to decrease turnoff age, maximization of reproduction rates and minimization of the mature weight of does in the low-input livestock production system in Kenya. Three crossbreeding systems and a synthetic breed development were evaluated, namely; (a) straight breeding system that utilized pure Small East African goat (SEAG) where parental lines were maintained to generate the desired terminal crosses, (b) three-breed crossbreeding system that utilized \{SEAG\} as pure breed, Galla goat (GG) as the first cross sire breed, and Improved Boer goat (IBG) as the terminal sire, (c) two-breed rotational crossbreeding system where the \{SEAG\} and \{IBG\} were purebreds, and (d) synthetic breed development system utilizing \{SEAG\} × IBG. The HotCross crossbreeding simulation software was used to assess the predicted performance of the different goat breed crosses under conditions of agro ecological zones (AEZ) V and VI. A model was developed to compare these crossbreeding systems, and showed the optimum numbers required in each stage of a cross to maximize production. In the \{AEZ\} V, it was found that the three-breed terminal system gave 18.2 kg (76%) improvement over straightbreds per doe mated per year. The multi-breed composite realized 20.4 kg (86%) improvement over pure SEAG. In the \{AEZ\} VI, it was found that the three-breed terminal system gave 10 kg (64%) improvement over straightbreds per doe mated per year. The multi-breed composite realized 14.6 kg (94%) improvement straightbreds per doe mated per year. The two-breed rotation was worse than the multi-breed composite in both environments. This implies that in low-input livestock production system, a multi-breed composite may be the crossbreeding system of choice, so long as supportive infrastructure is put in place. "

abstract = "Abstract Maize provides an important source of forage for the maize–dairy farmers in Kenya. However, due to small farm size, maize cannot supply all the feed needed for dairy cattle and forage is in short supply in the dry seasons. This paper examines practices to increase the health and use of maize and increase forage quality and quantity. The paper uses data from participatory on-farm research on cultural management practices of maize and on-station field trials in which plants were artificially infected with maize streak virus disease (MSVD) in the intensive maize–dairy production systems in central Kenya. Findings showed that smallholder farmers have deliberately changed the maize management practices by planting densely and systematically thinning the crop to obtain both fodder and grain. They perceived \{MSVD\} to have the greatest effect on forage yields and to be a difficult disease to control. Maize management trials showed that increasing plant density increased forage yields by up to 41% but decreased grain yields by up to 17% when specific thinning regimes were applied fairly late in the growth of the crop. However, grain yields were maintained when maize was planted at high density and then progressively thinned for forage during the growing season according to the crop situation or need for forage. The on-station research is the first study on the impacts of \{MSVD\} on maize forage and was carried out to increase production of forage during the wet seasons through use of resistant cultivars and agronomic interventions with a view to mitigating forage shortages during the dry seasons. \{MSVD\} infection was achieved with artificially infected leafhoppers (Cicadulina mbila (Naudé) (Hem.: Cicadellidae). In the 2001 short rainy season (SRS), early infection (14 days after crop emergence) reduced thinning yields by 43% in the susceptible cultivar, H511, compared to only 22% in a tolerant one, \{KH\} 521. Stover yields were reduced by 24% in \{H511\} while there were no significant losses in \{KH\} 521. Interestingly, the local landrace, Gikuyu, was tolerant of \{MSVD\} in terms of grain yield but not thinnings. Forage from crops infected 35 and 56 days after crop emergence did not differ significantly from the uninfected controls. In the 2002 long and short rainy seasons, early infection with \{MSV\} again reduced thinning and stover yields whereas fertilizer and plant density did not significantly affect the influence of \{MSVD\} on either maize forage or grain yields. Use of tolerant cultivars provided insurance against forage and grain yield losses caused by early infection by MSV, but yield benefits varied with season. With respect to forage quality, \{MSVD\} had a beneficial effect on susceptible cultivars (H511 and H614) due to the higher crude protein (CP) and lower neutral detergent fibre (NDF) concentrations of infected material in the early stages of growth. However, the reduced yields due to \{MSVD\} negate any advantage of increase in \{CP\} in infected material of susceptible maize cultivars. Further, the benefit of breeding for high \{NDF\} concentrations as a defense mechanism against disease effects is disadvantageous to improving quality of maize forage. "

Empirical evidence regarding explanatory factors for relative performance levels is presented using a special sample of 40 groups involved in tree nursery activities, with both descriptive analysis and regression models. Collective action is desired and practised for many tasks. The incredible number, diversity and dynamic nature of groups make it difficult to standardise and measure achievement. Choice and level of performance measures matters in explaining differences in group achievement. Focusing on groups undertaking similar activities allows deeper analysis of performance drivers. Examining different types of groups engaged tree nurseries found that performance was not linked to any easy-to-measure group characteristic, implying that for this task dissemination need not be targeted towards particular types of groups.

The 6-month \{ECF\} incidence rate was 20±8% (S.E.) in the stall-feeding system compared with 39±7% in the herded-grazing systems. There was a gradual increase in antibody prevalence with age to over 90% in cattle over 18 months of age in herded-grazing systems, whilst less than a third of cattle in the stall-feeding systems were sero-positive at any age. Overall accumulated mortality to 18 months of age was estimated to be 56%. Annual mortality in cattle &gt;18 months averaged 9%. Cattle managed in the herded-grazing system had a 60% higher mortality, although not significantly so, than those fed in stalls. Deaths due to \{ECF\} accounted for over two-thirds of the deaths. \{ECF\} was then the major disease constraint to small-holder dairy production in the coconut zone of coastal Kenya.

These authors also proposed that the serological antigenic relationship existing between BoHV-4 and alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 (AlHV-1) could confer to BoHV-4 infected buffaloes a protective immune response against lethal AlHV-1 infection. In the present study, we addressed two questions related to Rossiter et al. paper. Firstly, to investigate the role of the African buffalo as a natural host species of BoHV-4, the seroprevalence of anti-BoHV-4 antibodies was analysed in wild African buffaloes throughout eastern and southern Africa. A total of 400 sera was analysed using two complementary immunofluorescent assays. These analyses revealed that independently of their geographical origin, wild African buffaloes exhibit a seroprevalence of anti-BoHV-4 antibodies higher than 68%. This result is by far above the seroprevalence generally observed in cattle. Our data are discussed in the light of our recent phylogenetic study demonstrating that the BoHV-4 Bo17 gene has been acquired from a recent ancestor of the African buffalo. Secondly, we investigated the humoral antigenic relationship existing between BoHV-4 and AlHV-1. Our results demonstrate that among the antigens expressed in AlHV-1 infected cells, epitope(s) recognised by anti-BoHV-4 antibodies are exclusively nuclear, suggesting that the putative property of BoHV-4 to confer an immune protection against AlHV-1 relies on a cellular rather than on a humoral immune response.

In the first experiment (growth rate studies) 50 yearling Djallonke females weighing 5–13 kg were allocated randomly to the five diets, and dry matter intake, body-weight gain and feed conversion efficiency were determined. In a second experiment (metabolism studies) five young weaned Djallonke ram lambs weighing 5–11 kg were fed on each of the five diets in a Latin-square design. Feed intake, apparent digestibility coefficients of dry matter and organic matter and digestible dry matter and digestible organic matter intakes were measured. In a third experiment, the diets were also given to five fistulated adult wethers (Djallonke×Sahel) in a Latin-square design, and rumen pH was measured from 1 to 12 h and also 24 h after feeding. In the growth rate studies, dry matter intake significantly (P &lt; 0.01) increased from 73 g kg−1 W0.75 to a maximum of 101 g kg−1 W0.75 as the proportion of \{CPH\} increased from 0 to 600 g kg−1 diet, but growth rates (ranging from 37 to 55 g per day) and feed conversion efficiency were not significantly affected by dietary treatments. In the metabolism studies, feed intake increased with increasing levels of \{CPH\} in the diet, but intakes of digestible dry matter and digestible organic matter were not significantly affected by the dietary treatments. The apparent digestibility coefficients of dry matter and organic matter were significantly affected by the dietary treatments, with increase in \{CPH\} level reducing the values. The rumen pH, although low perhaps because of the grinding of the ingredients, was not the cause of the low digestibility of the CPH-containing diets. "

These species have generally been selected and recommended by the research system through the conventional nutritional and agronomic experimentation for use as animal feed and soil conservation. In Ethiopia, the introduction of exotic \{MPFT\} started in the 1970s. However, despite its apparent benefits, the adoption of exotic \{MPFT\} by smallholder farmers has been slow and in some cases farmers ceased using exotic \{MPFT\} in their farming systems. The objectives of the present study were to assess farmers’ preference criteria, compare their preference between exotic and local MPFT, and evaluate the relationship of farmers’ knowledge of feed value assessment with laboratory indicators. Focus group discussions and preference ranking and scoring by a total of 40 farmers were conducted in two districts representing two production systems (cereal and coffee-based livestock production systems) in the Ethiopian highlands. The comparison between exotic and local \{MPFT\} for their benefits and desired tree characteristics showed that farmers preferred local \{MPFT\} to exotics for biomass production, multi-functionality, life span, and compatibility to the cropping system. In terms of feed value, ease of propagation, and growth potential local \{MPFT\} were ranked lower than or comparable to exotics. There was also a strong correlation between farmers’ feed value score and laboratory results. Farmers were able to discriminate effectively \{MPFT\} species that had high and low protein and fibre content using their indigenous feed value indicator system for all pairwise comparisons. We concluded from this study that farmers’ preference criteria encompass multiple objectives beyond feed value and soil rehabilitation. The different merits that farmers associate with exotic and local \{MPFT\} could provide the opportunity to use both \{MPFT\} types and to improve farm bio-diversity. Hence, incorporating locally available MPFT, farmers’ indigenous knowledge and preference criteria at the research inception process is vital to maximize the likelihood of farmers’ adopting and maintaining these technologies.

A number of methods have contributed to the development of water resources use assessments of livestock production. The methods reviewed in this study were classified into three categories: water productivity assessments, water footprint assessments and life cycle assessments. The water productivity approach has been used to assess benefits derived from consumptive water use in livestock production; the water footprint approach has raised awareness of the large amounts of water required for livestock production; and life cycle assessments highlight the important connection between water resource use and local impacts. For each of the methods we distinguish strengths and weaknesses in assessing water resource use in livestock production. As a result, we identify three key areas for improvement: 1) both green and blue water resources should be included in assessments, and presented separately to provide informative results; 2) water quality should not be summarized within quantitative assessments of water resource use; and 3) methods for assessing water use in livestock systems must consider the alternative uses, multiple uses and benefits of a certain resource in a specific location.

Primers and a TaqMan® probe specific for \{ASFV\} were selected from conserved regions of the p72 gene. The limit of detection of the new real-time \{PCR\} assay is 5.7–57 copies of the \{ASFV\} genome. High accuracy, reproducibility and robustness of the \{PCR\} assay (CV ranging from 0.7 to 5.4%) were demonstrated both within and between laboratories using different real-time \{PCR\} equipments. The specificity of virus detection was validated using a panel of 44 isolates collected over many years in various geographical locations in Europe, Africa and America, including recent isolates from the Caucasus region, Sardinia, East and West Africa. Compared to the OIE-prescribed conventional and real-time \{PCR\} assays, the sensitivity of the new assay with internal control was improved, as demonstrated by testing 281 field samples collected in recent outbreaks and surveillance areas in Europe and Africa (170 samples) together with samples obtained through experimental infections (111 samples). This is particularly evident in the early days following experimental infection and during the course of the disease in pigs sub-clinically infected with strains of low virulence (from 35 up to 70 dpi). The specificity of the assay was also confirmed on 150 samples from uninfected pigs and wild boar from ASF-free areas. Measured on the total of 431 tested samples, the positive deviation of the new assay reaches 21% or 26% compared to \{PCR\} and real-time \{PCR\} methods recommended by OIE. This improved and rigorously validated real-time \{PCR\} assay with internal control will provide a rapid, sensitive and reliable molecular tool for \{ASFV\} detection in pigs in newly infected areas, control in endemic areas and surveillance in ASF-free areas.

The experiment was conducted as a 3 × 2 split-plot design. Manure was collected from 12 Boran steers (200 ± 4.5 kg live weight) fed a basal diet of Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) at 2.5% body weight on a dry matter (DM) basis. The main plot treatments were (i) manure from steers supplemented with 113 g Busumbu rock phosphate (BRP) per day (FBRP), (ii) manure from steers not supplemented with BRP, feces mixed with 113 g \{BRP\} per day (MBRP) and (iii) manure from steers not supplemented with \{BRP\} and feces not mixed with \{BRP\} (CONT). The sub-plots comprised composting the manure either (i) mixed with 440 g of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw per kg fresh feces (WS) or (ii) without straw (WOS). The manure was composted in 200 L plastic bins for 90 days. After 90 days, P availability was evaluated (i) by aerobic laboratory incubation at 25 °C for 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks and (ii) by greenhouse agronomic evaluation study using maize (Zea Mays L.) as the test crop in either a humic Nitosol or an Andosol. In the laboratory incubation study, resin P was higher (p &lt; 0.05) for the \{WS\} compost than for the \{WOS\} compost; values were higher (p &lt; 0.05) for the Andosol than for Nitosol and followed the order of FBRP–WS, Andosol &gt; FBRP–WS, Nitosol &gt; MBRP–WS, Andosol &gt; MBRP–WS, Nitosol &gt; FBRP–WOS, Andosol &gt; FBRP–WOS, Nitosol. In the greenhouse evaluation, maize crops in the \{WS\} compost had higher (p &lt; 0.05) biomass yield than the reference fertilizer, triple super phosphate, (173% versus 196%; Andosol and Nitosol, respectively). The biomass yield and P uptake relative agronomic effectiveness (RAE) for \{WS\} compost was also higher (p &lt; 0.05) than that of \{WOS\} compost (184 versus 3 ± 0.8 and 242 versus 162 ± 0.2, \{WS\} and WOS, biomass yield and P uptake, respectively).

The results show that P-enriched composting in the presence of wheat straw significantly increased P availability and increased plant growth. However, in terms of plant growth, there was no additional benefit of first feeding the \{RP\} to steers before composting the manure because most of the \{RP\} fed seem to have been utilized by the animal.

Performances were predicted from the results of a genetic model based on additive breed differences, dominance and additive×additive interaction effects for the breeds involved.

The mean lactation milk yield (MY) of production systems based on F×S, (AS)Rot or (BFS)Rot cows and in which replacements are raised from within, was also predicted under varying number of calvings (NL) and reproductive performance (RP). At the individual cow level, differences in the predicted \{MY\} between the F×S cross, three-breed rotation and the synthetic breeds were small. While the F×S cross was superior to the two-breed rotation for predicted MY, its performance was similar for \{MY\} expressed per unit of metabolic weight. Among the synthetic breeds, differences in \{MY\} expressed per unit metabolic weight were small. At the production system level, it was predicted that \{MY\} for production systems based on F×S cows become superior to those based on (AS)Rot cows only at a \{NL\} higher than 4 and were inferior to those based on (BFS)Rot. This study shows that F×S cows were closely rivalled by the (BFS)Rot and the synthetics. Its inferiority was particularly shown at the production system level. It is concluded that the first cross is not generally the best suited for dairy production systems in the tropics. There is the need to promote greater awareness of the potential of synthetic breeds and to formulate strategies for developing and exploiting them. "

Absence of TNF-α resulted in a diminished capacity to form germinal centres in lymph nodes and spleen. Since germinal centres are involved in antibody production and affinity maturation, the susceptibility of the TNF-α-deficient mice could have been due to this secondary defect. Despite the lack of the germinal centres, the antibody responses to internal and exposed trypanosome antigens and to non-trypanosome antigens were not significantly different. Also the relative avidities measured in infected sera did not significantly differ between the two mouse strains.

The objective of this experiment was to determine the methane emissions and feeding performance of two breeds of Zebu beef cattle fed rice straw based diets with oil plant inclusion. Eight mature bulls (four Thai native and four Brahman crossbred beef cattle weighing 290±10.2 and 401±29.7 kg (mean±SD), respectively) were assigned to a replicated 4×4 Latin square design with 21 day periods. The following dietary treatments were assigned: 1=control diet, 2=whole cottonseed diet, 3=whole sunflower seed diet and 4=coconut kernel diet. The animals were individually placed in metabolic cages and respiration chambers to determine feed intake, total tract digestibility and methane emissions. The two cattle breeds were not different in their dry matter intake per body weight (or metabolic body weight) and digestibility, but the corresponding values for the oil plant dietary treatments were less (P&lt;0.001) than those for the control diet. All of the oil plant treatments decreased (P&lt;0.001) the dry matter and \{NDF\} digestibility compared to the control diet, but the oil plants had no effect on ruminal pH, ammonia nitrogen or total volatile fatty acid concentration. The methane emissions of the Brahman crossbred beef cattle were greater (P&lt;0.001) than those of the Thai native cattle (135.4 and 171.5 L/day), but there was no difference (P&gt;0.05) when corrected for dry matter intake, organic matter intake, metabolic size or gross energy intake. The methane emission rate was reduced (P&lt;0.001) by up to 50.1% by the oil plant feeding strategy compared to the control diet. The methane emission rate of the base line typical feeding system in the control diet (10.4%) appeared to be much greater than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change value of 6.5% for cattle fed low-quality crop residues or by-products. Our results demonstrated that methane emissions did not differ between Zebu beef cattle when corrected for metabolic body weight and feed or gross energy intake. The inclusion of oil plants in the diets, such as the coconut kernel, sunflower seed and cottonseed, affects intake, digestibility and potentially be used as an enteric methane mitigation feeding strategy.

The Century and Daycent models are used to calculate the changes in soil carbon stocks, soil \{N2O\} emissions, and forage removals by ruminants associated with these practices. \{GLEAM\} is used in combination with these models to establish grazing area boundaries and to parameterize links between forage consumption, animal production and animal \{GHG\} emissions. This study provides an alternative to the usual approach of extrapolating from a small number of field studies and by modeling the linkage between soil, forage and animals it sheds new light on the net mitigation potential of C sequestration practices in the world’s grazing lands. Three different mitigation practices are assessed in this study, namely, improved grazing management, legume sowing and N fertilization. We estimate that optimization of grazing pressure could sequester 148 Tg \{CO2\} yr−1. The soil C sequestration potential of 203 Tg \{CO2\} yr−1 for legume sowing was higher than for improved grazing management, despite being applied over a much smaller total area. However, \{N2O\} emissions from legumes were estimated to offset 28% of its global C sequestration benefits, in \{CO2\} equivalent terms. Conversely, \{N2O\} emissions from N fertilization exceeded soil C sequestration, in all regions. Our estimated potential for increasing C stocks though in grazing lands is lower than earlier worldwide estimates (Smith et al., 2007; Lal, 2004), mainly due to the much smaller grazing land area over which we estimate mitigation practices to be effective. A big concern is the high risk of the practices, particularly legumes, increasing soil-based \{GHGs\} if applied outside of this relatively small effective area. More work is needed to develop indicators, based on biophysical and management characteristics of grazing lands, to identify amenable areas before these practices can be considered ready for large scale implementation. The additional ruminant \{GHG\} emissions associated with higher forage output are likely to substantially reduce the mitigation potential of these practices, but could contribute to more GHG-efficient livestock production.

C. ruminantium antigens that stimulate these responses are therefore of considerable importance to the development of a sub-unit vaccine against the disease. We have examined T cell responses against recombinant analogues of the surface-exposed C. ruminantium major antigen 1 (MAP1) a 28.8 kDa protein and \{MAP2\} (21 kDa) antigen in cattle immunised by infection and treatment. Vigorous and sustained proliferative responses to both antigens were observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from immune cattle. MAP1-specific responses were predominantly restricted to cluster of differentiation four antigen positive T cells (CD4+ T cells). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of cytokine expression by T cell lines derived from this population revealed strong expression of interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interferon alpha (IFN-α), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), tumour necrosis factor beta (TNF-β), interleukin-2 receptor alpha (IL-2Rα) transcripts, and weak expression of IL-2 and IL-4. Supernatants from these T cell cultures contained IFN-γ protein. CD4+ T cell clones specific for \{MAP1\} were generated. Two of these clones proliferated in the presence of autologous infected endothelial cells. In contrast, the response to \{MAP2\} was characterised largely by proliferation of gamma delta (γδ) T cells. RT-PCR analysis of cytokine expression by T cell lines which were dominated by γδ T cells revealed expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α, TNF-β, IL-2Rα transcripts. Supernatants of these T cell cultures also contained IFN-γ protein. Our findings indicate that immunisation of cattle by infection with C. ruminantium results in generation of MAP1- and MAP2-specific T cell responses that may play a role in protection against the pathogen.

After purification, the chimeric protein was used to immunise BALB-c mice and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated. The mAb 2F1, which had greatest anti-IgE activity in preliminary screens, was chosen for further characterisation and an examination of systemic and local IgE responses to the intestinal nematode, Trichostrongylus colubriformis. The chimeric IgE protein was not recognised in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by mAbs raised against ovine IgG1, IgG2, IgA or IgM. However, 2F1 was highly specific to the chimeric IgE protein, and did not cross-react with ovine IgG1, IgG2 or IgA. Western blot analysis also showed that 2F1 and secretory IgA (sIgA) did not cross-react, and that 2F1 and the anti-IgA mAb identified different \{MW\} bands from colostrum (approximately 200 and 400 kDa, respectively). 2F1 bound to mucosal mast cells (MMC) isolated from the intestines of lambs infected with T. colubriformis, but cultured bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) required prior incubation with the chimeric IgE protein for this binding to occur. Distinctive staining of plasma cells and putative mast cells were observed using 2F1 on immunohistological sections of mesenteric lymph node and jejunum. \{ELISA\} incorporating 2F1 was able to detect &gt;0.4 ng chimeric protein. Total IgE in ovine colostrum and intestinal homogenates was quantified using a capture ELISA, with known amounts of chimeric protein used to produce a standard curve. Colostrum from outbred Merino ewes had 0.55–11.05 ng ml−1 total IgE, and their lambs, at necropsy after infection with a total of 18,000 T. colubriformis infective larvae over a 9-week period, had 45–620 ng g−1 total IgE in intestinal tissue. Compared to genetically susceptible lambs, antigen-specific levels of IgE were significantly higher in genetically resistant lambs after infection with 4500 T. colubriformis infective larvae (TcL3) per week for 9 weeks (161.4 versus 44.8 geometric mean titres; P=0.043). In western blots, distinctive bands (19–21 and 27 kDa) from T. colubriformis larval antigen were differentially recognised by IgE, as identified by 2F1, in intestinal homogenates from genetically resistant animals. These results have demonstrated the value of 2F1 for quantification of IgE responses in samples derived from ovine fluids and tissues using ELISA, western blots and immunohistology. In this respect, it recognises native ovine IgE and does not require pre-treatment of the sample with denaturing agents or ammonium sulphate. "

Experimental Parasitology99, 123–131. We have evaluated whether sequence polymorphisms in the rRNA intergenic spacer region can be used to study the relatedness of two subspecies of Trypanosoma brucei. Thirteen T. brucei isolates made up of 6 T. b. brucei and 7 T. b. gambiense were analyzed using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). By PCR-based restriction mapping of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 ribosomal repeat unit, we found a fingerprint pattern that separately identifies each of the two subspecies analyzed, with unique restriction fragments observed in all but 1 of the T. b. gambiense “human” isolates. Interestingly, the restriction profile for a virulent group 2 T. b. gambiense human isolate revealed an unusual \{RFLP\} pattern different from the profile of other human isolates. Sequencing data from four representatives of each of the two subspecies indicated that the intergenic spacer region had a conserved ITS-1 and a variable 5.8S with unique transversions, insertions, or deletions. The ITS-2 regions contained a single repeated element at similar positions in all isolates examined, but not in 2 of the human isolates. A unique 4-bp {C3A} sequence was found within the 5.8S region of human T. b. gambiense isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of the data suggests that their common ancestor was a nonhuman animal pathogen and that human pathogenicity might have evolved secondarily. Our data show that cryptic species within the T. brucei group can be distinguished by differences in the PCR-RFLP profile of the rDNA repeat. "

Milk samples were collected from 129 households (33 project households and 96 non-project households). Clinical mastitis was determined using visual inspection of udders and detection of macroscopic clots and flakes in milk. The California Mastitis Test was used to diagnose sub-clinical mastitis from milk samples, and the \{IDEXX\} \{SNAP\} test to identify the presence of tetracycline residues. The prevalence of mastitis in trained households (39.4%) was 43.78% of that in untrained households (60.4%), lower but not significantly so (p = 0.08, 95% \{CI\} 0.17–1.12). Thirteen indicators of knowledge or practice for the control or prevention of mastitis were more likely to occur in trained households, four significantly so (not consuming milk from sick buffalo (p = 0.001), using soap to wash hands before milking (p = 0.001), discarding milk after antibiotic usage (p = 0.01), and choosing appropriate flooring for their livestock (p = 0.03)). Trained households that discarded milk from sick buffalo were 2.96 times more likely to have at least one animal with mastitis in the household (p = 0.03, 95% \{CI\} 1.15–7.65). Trained households that knew to wash buffalos’ teats after milking were less likely (OR 0.25) to have mastitis in their herd (p = 0.02, 95% \{CI\} 0.08–0.80). Of the 138 buffalos tested, only one tested positive for tetracycline residues. "

The CypA gene is present at one copy/haploid genome in T. brucei, T. congolense and T. vivax and is located on large chromosomes (&gt;3 Mb) in T. brucei. CypA is differentially transcribed in African trypanosomes and is localized in the cytosol as well as in the flagellum. It is also detected in the supernatant of in vitro cultivated parasites. The African trypanosome CypA is unique due to a ten amino acid residue N-terminus extension and a block that includes a three amino acid insertion around position 100 that might result in a differently structured surface. Wild-type recombinant CypA and several mutants were over-expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to &gt;98% homogeneity. Antisera from cattle immunized with a trypanosome fraction containing immunosuppressive activity react strongly against CypA. These data indicate that trypanosome CypA might play an important role in the establishment and maintenance of infections in susceptible animals. "

Intake, passage, digestion and excretion were studied in 16 cattle, 16 sheep and 16 goats offered these feeds at levels corresponding to 0.8 and 1.3 times voluntary feed intake. Parameters of particle passage were derived from faecal excretion of a pulse-dose of short (1–2 mm) and long (&gt;2 mm) particles labelled with Ytterbium, using age-dependent Gamma-2 single-compartment models. Across the three species, mean retention time of particles in the mixing compartment (CMRT) varied between 39–50 and 54–66 h in green and dry pasture vegetation and between 66 and 88 h in millet leaves, and was always longer in cattle than in small ruminants (P&lt;0.05). Particle passage through the mixing compartment (λ), particle half life (T50) and total tract mean retention time (TMRT) were correlated to the dry matter digestibility and to the contents of nitrogen and neutral detergent fibre of the ingested diet, while particle size had no and feed intake only a weak influence on these parameters. The results suggest that seasonal and species-specific differences in gastrointestinal passage of feed particles should be taken into account when addressing the temporal aspects of livestock-mediated matter and nutrient flows across the agro-pastoral landscapes of the Sahel.

Yet, there is still uncertainty about wider implications of this technology for rural development, including effects for landless rural laborers. Bt-related yield advantages may lead to intensified production and higher demand for labor. Building on farm survey data collected in Pakistan and using double-hurdle regression models, we analyze employment effects of Bt cotton adoption. Model estimates show that Bt adoption has increased the demand for hired labor by 55%. Manual harvesting, which is common in Pakistan, is a labor-intensive activity primarily carried out by female laborers. Accordingly, gender disaggregation shows that the employment-generating effects are particularly strong for women, who often belong to the most disadvantaged groups of rural societies. These results suggest that Bt technology can contribute to additional employment income for the poor and to more equitable rural development. "

Grazing treatments were a factorial arrangement of two stocking rates (62·5 and 125 kg live weight ha−1) and four sheep:goat ratios (0:6, 2:4, 4:2 and 6:0 animals per pasture), with two pastures per treatment and two ungrazed controls. Observations were also made in a fallow subjected to 9 years of intense and uncontrolled mixed grazing, and in a site that had been protected from grazing for 15 years. The topsoil was sampled (at depths of 0–2, 2–6, 6–14 and 14–30 cm) below shrub canopy in herbaceous vegetation and in bare soil patches within each of 20 paddocks for determination of pH, organic C, and total N and P concentrations. Soil bulk density was measured in a subset of soil profiles. The areal extent of different types of soil crusts and other soil surface features was assessed in one-half of the paddocks. Grazing resulted in a reduction (p&lt;0·01) and fragmentation of the area of crusted soils. However, this trend was partially compensated for by an increase of newly formed crusts. As a result, the soil infiltration index slightly increased with moderate grazing, but decreased at higher stocking rates. Compaction due to trampling was observed in the topsoil beneath the shrub canopy and also in vegetated patches, but only under intense grazing pressure. Soil bulk density was not affected by grazing except for an increase observed below 10 cm depth at the understorey of shrubs which is therefore unlikely due to trampling. When compared to the ungrazed control, pH, organic C and N concentrations, and to lesser extent P concentration, decreased after 4 years of grazing. Soil P and pH further decreased after 9 years of very high grazing pressure. However, neither N nor organic C decreased further. "

With expansion of arable land and resultant decline in grazing resources, crop residues are becoming an increasingly important component of livestock feeds. This demand for livestock feeds has implications for the long-term sustainability of such systems since failure to return biomass to soils has implications for soil quality and the capacity of soils to support long-term productivity. Biomass allocation patterns are likely to vary with overall level of productivity and hence availability. In this study we used a household survey to quantify crop residue allocation patterns across a gradient of productivity in Eastern Africa focusing on two sites in Ethiopia and one in Kenya. We assessed the underlying determinants of crop residue allocation patterns with a view to understanding how productivity increases through intensification will influence biomass allocation in Eastern Africa and how livelihood and natural resource management objectives could be optimized. Results showed that farmers strongly favour allocation of residues to livestock feeding but that allocation to soil increases along the productivity gradient. This reduced feeding to livestock and increased allocation to soil fertility is associated with smaller farm sizes leading to reduced animal traction needs for tillage, increased overall livestock productivity, increased use of inputs and a reduced reliance on farm-based activities in overall livelihood strategies. The implications of these trends are that productivity increases in smallholder systems are likely to reduce pressure on biomass in the long term and that measures that enhance the prospects for farmers to intensify their production systems are likely to increase soil health and sustainability objectives in general. A key conclusion of the work is that intensification of livestock production could reduce crop residue allocation to soils with long term implications for soil productivity. "

This is followed by a carrier state, rather than death and therefore provides a better chance of transmission of the parasite back to the tick vector since in unimodal conditions, the different tick stages occur at different times. One isolate from such an area in Zambia, T. parva Chitongo, was compared for virulence with T. parva Muguga, isolated from an area exhibiting a continuous presence of all vector stages in East Africa. To reduce any variation due to infection dose, an in vitro standardized dose was used to initiate infection of groups of three local zebu cattle with each isolate. Parameters of virulence measured were prepatent period, fever, survival (based on \{ECF\} index), parasitosis, piroplasm parasitaemia and hematological parameters. Our results suggest that T. parva Chitongo developed a slightly later onset (1–2 days) and lower levels of parasitosis in the lymph node, causing less and later mortality. Comparison of the in vitro rate of transformation confirmed that the time needed to transform an infected lymphocyte took 4 days longer for T. parva Chitongo than T. parva Muguga. Elucidating the mechanism responsible for the lower virulence of T. parva Chitongo could be useful for designing an attenuated vaccine. "

To influence this decision-making, compulsory and voluntary mechanisms are implemented. However, farmers’ decision-making is a heterogeneous process that depends on their ability and willingness to take certain decisions. Discrepancies between farmers’ ability and willingness and the design of voluntary mechanisms occur frequently. This makes it necessary to understand how farmers’ participation in these mechanisms can affect LUC. The aim of this paper was to demonstrate an agent-based approach to analyse and explore how voluntary mechanisms can influence \{LUC\} processes in rural regions. This approach was applied to a rural region in Australia, where clearing of native vegetation has occurred for agricultural development. Historical land cover data and semi-structured interviews were used to parameterise an agent-based model. Factors that influence farmers’ ability and willingness to participate in these mechanisms were identified. Three scenarios were simulated with the model to explore how the implementation of different voluntary mechanisms can affect the landscape structure of the region. This paper identifies how the diversity of farmers’ decision-making can influence the landscape structure in the region. The advantages and limitations of an agent-based approach in relation to \{LUC\} research and policy are discussed. "

Recent reports appear to indicate that the serological tests recommended by the \{OIE\} for \{ASF\} monitoring are much less effective in East and Southern Africa where viral genetic and antigenic diversity is the greatest. We report herein an extensive analysis including more than 1000 field and experimental infection sera, in which the \{OIE\} recommended tests are compared with antigen-specific \{ELISAs\} and immuno-peroxidase staining of cells (IPT). The antibody detection results generated using new antigen-specific tests, developed in this study, which are based on production of antigen fractions generated by infection and virus purification from COS-1 cells, showed strong concordance with the \{OIE\} tests. We therefore conclude that the lack of success is not attributable to antigenic polymorphism and may be related to the specific characteristics of the local breeds African pigs. "

As many of the livestock functions as possible (physical and socio-economic) should be aggregated into monetary values and related to the resources used, irrespective of whether these ‘products’ are marketed, home-consumed or maintained for later use. A broad economic evaluation model involving three complementary flock-level productivity indices was applied to evaluate subsistence goat production in eastern Ethiopian highlands. The results showed that indigenous goat flocks generated significantly higher net benefits under improved than under traditional management, which challenges the prevailing notion in countries like Ethiopia that indigenous livestock do not adequately respond to improvements in the level of management. It is then concluded that the evaluation model not only allows a broad aggregation of benefits from subsistence livestock, but also provides a more realistic platform to propose sound improvement interventions.

abstract = "A number of studies have begun to show the large impact that pastoralism has on African savanna ecosystems. Here we look at the impact of abandoned settlements on the distribution of the large ungulates of Amboseli, Kenya. Monthly dung counts show that all 9 species studied are attracted by settlements for up to a century after abandonment. Densities increased in the first two decades of vegetation succession, when plant biomass is the highest, then declines steadily to background levels as plant biomass. The pattern of herbivore use varied among species in the course of succession, with grazers dominant in early successional stages and browsers later stages, when shrubs and trees began to replace grasses. The densities of both grazers and browsers correlated positively with herbaceous and woody biomass respectively. We conclude that the additional biomass and higher quality forage produced by heavy dung deposits in livestock settlements are a major factor governing the distribution and movement of large herbivore in the savannas. The abandonment of seasonal migrations and construction of permanent settlements under way in African savannas is likely to restrict wildlife movements and reduce habitat patchiness and species richness of large ungulates.

Before such a vaccine is developed it is essential to define target cattle populations as well as the range of anti-pathogen vaccines required in order to control disease. To further this objective, we have evaluated a reverse line blot (RLB) assay, which simultaneously detects the principal tick transmitted protozoan and rickettsial cattle pathogens, in different epidemiological scenarios in Uganda. A critical question is the sensitivity, particularly in relation to detecting carrier animals. As Theileria parva is considered to be the most important pathogen in the region, we assessed the sensitivity of the \{RLB\} assay for T. parva and showed that 1–2×103 parasites per ml of blood could be detected—a level comparable with previously developed \{PCR\} methods and well below conventional microscopic detection. We applied the \{RLB\} assay to evaluate the differences in pathogen profiles between crossbred and indigenous cattle and show that there were different profiles, with a low prevalence of T. parva and Theileria taurotragi in the indigenous cattle compared to a high prevalence in the crossbred cattle. In contrast, we show higher prevalences of Theileria mutans and Theileria velifera in the indigenous compared to the crossbred cattle. Interestingly Anaplasma marginale, Babesia bovis and Babesia bigemina were of low prevalence but a high prevalence of Ehrlichia bovis was seen, raising the question of whether this rickettsial species could be pathogenic in cattle. Analysis of animals with clinical symptoms of East Coast Fever showed that, while T. parva is a major cause of these symptoms, T. mutans and possibly T. taurotragi and T. velifera, may also cause clinical disease. Overall, the results presented here highlight the complexity of tick-borne pathogen infections in cattle in Uganda. "

Avian species richness was highest on actively disturbed land and gradually decreased with time since disturbance. Of 23 species restricted to one land-use type, 16 were found on cultivated land or recent fallows, 8 of them being categorized as uncommon in West Africa. Guild analyses suggest that availability of nest sites and food were the principal factors affecting bird distribution. For birds to persist in the agricultural landscape woody vegetation should include many different species and large trees should occur in the fields. Cultivated lands on the cuirasse had the highest average number of birds and many species were restricted to this land-use type. The potential for negative impact on the bird community was hence particularly high on the cuirasse. "

In the present study, seven strains of the genus Lactococcus were examined for their ability to remove cholesterol from laboratory media during growth. All strains of lactococci tested could remove cholesterol from media without degrading cholesterol. The amount of cholesterol removed was strain specific. Among them, Lc. Lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis \{N7\} could remove as much cholesterol as L. acidophilus \{ATCC\} 43121, which had a beneficial influence on serum cholesterol levels in pigs. The manner of cholesterol removal by strain \{N7\} corresponded to the manner of its growth. The growth of strain \{N7\} (growth yield and growth efficiency) was enhanced. The fatty acid composition of the cells of strain \{N7\} was altered by removing cholesterol from the media. The ability to remove cholesterol was also observed in the heat-killed cells of strain N7. However, the amount of cholesterol removed by the cells during growth was significantly higher than that removed by the heat-killed cells. Thus, strain \{N7\} has the ability to remove cholesterol from media independently of whether cells are viable. These results indicate that administration of strain \{N7\} in vivo may well be promising on the hypocholesterolemic effect. "

The basal feed used in the experiment was tef (Eragrostis tef) straw. The supplement treatments consisted of wheat bran (positive control) or dried foliage of the multipurpose trees (MPT), Sesbania sesban 1198, S. sesban 15019, Acacia angustissima 15132, and Leucaena pallida 14203, or the mixtures of S. sesban 1198 and S. sesban 15019 with either L. pallida 14203 or A. angustissima 15132 at a ratio of 2:1. The level of supplementation was at 0.9% of \{LW\} on dry matter (DM) basis. The objectives of the experiment were to evaluate the effects of supplementation on feed intake, plasma activities of certain enzymes, daily \{LW\} and scrotal circumference gains. The crude protein (CP) content in the \{MPT\} leaves and their mixtures ranged between 21.6% and 27.8% of DM. Supplementation with mixtures of \{MPTs\} promoted higher organic matter (OM) (P&lt;0.01), supplement and total \{DM\} (P&lt;0.001) intakes and higher feed conversion efficiency (FCE) (P&lt;0.001) than sole MPTs.

The sequences of the mini- and microsatellites were distributed across the four chromosomes with 16 on chromosome 1, 12 on chromosome 2, 14 on chromosome 3 and 18 on chromosome 4. The primers from the 60 sequences were tested against all the Theileria species that co-infect cattle in East and Southern Africa and were found to be specific for T. parva. In order to demonstrate the utility of these markers, we characterised eight tissue culture isolates of T. parva isolated from cattle in widely separated regions of Eastern and Southern Africa (one from Zambia, one from Uganda, two from Zimbabwe, four from Kenya) and one Kenyan tissue culture isolate from Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer). The numbers of alleles per locus range from three to eight indicating a high level of diversity between these geographically distinct isolates. We also analysed five isolates from cattle on a single farm at Kakuzi in the central highlands of Kenya and identified a range of one to four alleles per locus. Four of the Kakuzi isolates represented distinct multilocus genotypes while two exhibited identical multilocus genotypes. This indicates a high level of diversity in a single population of T. parva. Cluster analysis of multilocus genotypes from the 14 isolates (using a neighbour joining algorithm) revealed that genetic similarity between isolates was not obviously related to their geographical origin.

abstract = "In the Sahel of West Africa, the productivities of rangelands, croplands and livestock are inextricably linked. Cattle, sheep and goats graze rangelands and crop residues, and their manure/urine is used to fertilize crops. Rangelands provide important feeds during the manuring period, resulting in a net nutrient transfer from rangelands to croplands. This paper examines the sustainability of nutrient transfers in integrated rangeland/cropland systems of the Sahel by examining the impact of grazing on rangeland vegetation structure and floristic composition, the impact of livestock on nutrient balances of rangelands and croplands, and the role of livestock in offsetting nutrient deficits through manuring. Rangeland nutrient balances are in equilibrium (inputs = offtakes) whereas croplands lack the internal capacity to replenish nutrient offtakes in grain (as food) and crop residues (as feed). Although soil nutrient mining is of general concern for the Sahel, local management practices of some farmers (e.g. corralling animals overnight on fields between cropping seasons, use of fertilizers) offset cropland nutrient deficits. The number of additional livestock, and their feed requirements needed to supply sufficient manure to offset cropland nutrient deficits, depend on rangeland and cropland productivity, livestock production goals, and management strategies of farmers. Livestock must be managed so they do not deplete the nutrient supply of rangelands in order to increase the manure supply for improving cropland productivity. Sustained rangeland productivity in the Sahel will depend largely on producing alternative feeds derived mostly from croplands. Land use and tenure policies that inhibit livestock mobility and, therefore, farmers' access to the manure of pastoralists herds, will greatly undermine the resilience of Sahelian rangelands, and increase the need for other external nutrient inputs such as fertilizers to prevent declines in soil fertility and crop yields.

During each visit, the calves were weighed and other calf-management practices in the farm during the visit such as housing, feeding and tick control also were recorded. Other events such as morbidity and mortality between or during the visits were also recorded. The overall mean daily weight gains were 0.24–0.29 kg (S.D.=0.17–0.22 kg) and were lower than the recommended targets for smallholder farms of 0.40–0.50 kg. The major tendency in variability of daily weight gains was due to visit-to-visit variation (especially in calves &gt;3 months old). Differences in mean daily gains were associated with AEZ-grazing strata and calf-level factors that included breed of calf, calf sickness, incidence of ECF, feeding of milk, concentrate feeds and minerals and interaction between calf age and AEZ-grazing strata (P&lt;0.05). \{ECF\} and other calf sicknesses exerted a temporal effect on calf-growth at the height of illness and immediately after; calves later recovered the lost growth except where other factors such as poor calf nutrition prevailed.

Plant and soil data were sampled on and around abandoned settlements. The term, ‘onsite’, refers to the area within the perimeter fence, ‘offsite’ to the area up to 200 m beyond the fence. Herbaceous standing biomass onsite increased in the course of succession to peak at twice offsite levels within two decades. Biomass remained elevated for six decades then dropped to the background levels at the limit of sampling distance. Plant species richness onsite increased rapidly in the course of succession, then stabilized on older bomas. Species composition changed throughout succession, with pioneer herbs and grasses giving way to boma-edge species and woody vegetation later in succession. Soil nutrients, including carbon, nitrogen, magnesium and phosphorus, were highly elevated on abandoned settlements. The various nutrients declined at different rates during the course of plant succession. Potassium, phosphorus and magnesium levels remained at twice offsite levels for over a century, creating islands of high fertility and high plant biomass in the savanna landscape. We conclude that the perturbation caused by shifting nomadic settlements creates localized nutrient and plant diversity hotspots in savanna ecosystems that remain distinct from the surrounding savanna for decades, possibly centuries.

We undertook a placebo-controlled in vivo trial to measure the efficacy of pyrantel embonate against pooled isolates of the hookworm Ancylostoma caninum from Brisbane, Australia. A statistically significant fall in adult worm burden was observed among dogs in the pyrantel treatment group compared to the control dogs (178.0 ± 24.5 versus 239.7 ± 14.0; p = 0.02), equating to an efficacy of just 25.7% (95% CI, 15.0–35.1%), as based upon reduction in mean worm burden. Analysis of faecal egg count trends through the course of the study revealed that egg counts rose in both control and pyrantel-treated dogs, with a greater rise observed in the latter group (11.6 ± 8.3% versus 17.3 ± 7.6%; p = 0.04), despite the decrease in adult worm numbers in this group. Our results indicate that high-level anthelmintic resistance does occur in companion animal medicine, and highlight the need for greater vigilance and more judicious use of anthelmintics in small animal practice. They further indicate that the faecal egg count reduction test needs to be used with caution with this parasite. "

Detecting anthelmintic resistance in parasites of pets is problematic because traditional resistance-monitoring techniques used with livestock parasites, such as the faecal egg count reduction test, are often impractical for use in small animals. We used two field-collected isolates of A. caninum in an abbreviated critical trial to test their pyrantel resistance status. The strains showed high-level and low-level resistance, with in vivo pyrantel efficacies of 28% and 71%, respectively. We noted a distinct worm density dependence effect on faecal egg count during the critical trial; egg counts in the dogs containing the low-level resistant isolate were 41% higher 6 days after drug treatment, despite the removal of 71% of the adult worms by the drug treatment. We then assessed four candidate in vitro assays for their ability to detect pyrantel resistance in A. caninum larvae, using these two isolates. The assays included a new format termed the larval arrested morphology assay (LAMA), based on observation of the effects of pyrantel on the body shape adopted by infective stage A. caninum larvae in vitro. Our data suggests that three of these assays, the LAMA, the larval motility assay (LMA), and larval feeding inhibition assay (LFIA) show promise with regards to detection of pyrantel resistance in A. caninum, but the complexity of the \{LFIA\} would likely limit its suitability for field studies. In vivo pyrantel efficacies of 28% and 71% in the two A. caninum isolates were associated with a 17-fold shift in the in vitro \{IC50\} values measured using the LAMA. Further testing with isolates of varying degrees of resistance is required to determine which of these assays is suitable as a rapid in vitro laboratory test for pyrantel resistance in A. caninum. The present study also indicates that potential exists for the novel \{LAMA\} or the \{LMA\} to be of use in detecting pyrantel resistance in the human hookworms, Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale.

This fieldwork led to build a set of rules for the behaviour of individuals in non-pastoralist villages. We implemented these rules into an agent-based model simulating three village archetypes. Each archetype includes biophysical, economical, social agricultural and livestock modules. Results from simulations with no social transition processes show that villages specialize themselves into different economic activities according to natural resource specificities: A decreasing intensification gradient is observed from the most favoured site, with more local productions and good ecological indicators, to the less-favoured site, with a growing proportion of the population wealth coming from migration remittances and “off-shore” livestock. Two family transition processes were implemented, following field observations and literature-based hypotheses: family organizations evolve between a patriarchal mode and a non-cooperative mode following tensions due to income redistribution. Family inheritance systems evolve from a “customary” one-heir mode to a “local Muslim” mode in which all males inherits land. This evolution depends on family tensions due to land availability. Once introducing these processes, the population of each site differentiates itself into specialized groups according to size, assets and social status. Meanwhile, the group proportions and specializations strongly vary according to the sites but they are all characterized by the emergence of individualistic family types and the increase of the village populations’ robustness.

In this study we developed a chemiluminescent immunoblotting (cIB) assay to characterise the Trypanosoma equiperdum antigen pattern recognised by IgGs from naturally or experimentally dourine-infected horses and analyse the kinetics of IgG humoral response following the infection. One compounding factor is that sera from uninfected animals often cross-react with T. equiperdum antigens. Development of the cIB assay was based on the hypothesis that serum IgGs from healthy and infected animals recognise different T. equiperdum antigen patterns. We used sera from 8 naturally infected horses which had recovered from Italian outbreaks and 2 experimentally infected mares. In addition, sera from 10 healthy control animals, eight of which were \{CFT\} positive but \{IFA\} negative for dourine, were collected from disease free regions. Sera were compared by the complement fixation test (CFT), indirect immune fluorescence (IFA) and the cIB assay. cIB analysis revealed that IgGs from infected horses, in contrast to IgGs from healhty horses, specifically recognise a T. equiperdum antigenic profile with low molecular weight bands ranging between 16 and 35 kDa. A time course experiment indicated that IgGs specific for the 16–35 kDa parasite protein fraction appear 17 days post-infection. The cIB assay confirmed all ten infected animals as positive and all controls as negative. This study demonstrated that analysis of IgGs by cIB can provide clear confirmation of trypanosome infection in horses, suggesting that this technique can be applied as a confirmatory serological test for dourine infection.

These microorganisms were taken from the rumens of bush duiker, eland, impala, Grant's gazelle, hartebeest, Thompson's gazelle, Ethiopian goat, Kenyan goat, an Ethiopian sheep adapted to Acacia angustissima ingestion and from the hindgut of zebra. Dried A. angustissima leaves, 3 g/L \{ADAB\} or 3 g/L \{DABA\} were incubated with medium containing rumen or hindgut fluid. Degradation was measured using ammonia and volatile fatty acid production and substrate disappearance as indices. Individual microbial species were isolated from samples showing substrate degradation. Incubation of A. angustissima leaf with rumen fluids from the bush duiker and from a sheep slowly adapted to A. angustissima produced more gas (32.27 mL/100 g \{DM\} ± 1.15; 31.25 mL/100 g \{DM\} ± 2.17) than with fluid from other animals. Early substrate degradation was observed with samples incubated with bush duiker rumen fluid. The most total volatile fatty acids were produced by samples incubated with rumen fluid from Grant's gazelle, followed by impala and bush duiker (79.67 ± 4.35 μmol/mL, 78.21 ± 11.3 and 68.80 ± 4.49 μmol/mL, respectively).

Rumen fluid taken from an impala degraded more \{ADAB\} than the other sources, leaving only 4.17 μM residual ADAB. Rumen fluid from the hartebeest was completely ineffective and left all of the \{ADAB\} substrate undegraded. The adapted sheep rumen fluid degraded 0.980, the Grant's gazelle rumen fluid 0.922 and the impala rumen fluid only 0.101 of the ADAB. Eight ADAB-tolerant bacterial strains were isolated. Individually, these isolates were not able to substantially degrade ADAB. However, a mixture of all eight ADAB-tolerant bacterial isolates degraded 0.827 of the ADAB. Most DABA-tolerant bacterial strains were not able to degrade DABA. Only isolates from an adapted sheep, from a Kenyan goat and a Thomson's gazelle degraded \{DABA\} to a significant extent (0.283, 0.202 and 0.169, respectively).

Seventy individually penned Menz ewes with a mean initial weight of 14.77±0.32 kg (mean±S.D.) were randomly assigned to seven treatments in a randomized block design. The ewes were supplemented daily with three levels of L. pallida 14203, namely, \{LP1\} (8.3 g \{DM\} kg−1 LW), \{LP2\} (11 g \{DM\} kg−1 LW), \{LP3\} (13.3 g \{DM\} kg−1 LW); three levels of S. sesban 1198, namely, \{SS1\} (8.2 g \{DM\} kg−1 LW), \{SS2\} (10.9 g \{DM\} kg−1 LW), \{SS3\} (13.3 g \{DM\} kg−1 LW) and one level of L. purpureus, \{LAB\} (10.5 g \{DM\} kg−1 LW), which was used as a control. The basal feed, chopped tef (Eragrostis tef) straw, mineral blocks and water were offered ad libitum. The feeding period lasted for 5 months. Body weight was measured fortnightly, and monitoring of estrus was conducted twice daily for 60 days by visual observation and using vasectomized rams. Contents of crude protein (CP) were lower, and that of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and acid detergent lignin (ADL) were higher in L. purpureus compared to both MPTs. Soluble phenolics and condensed tannins were highest in L. pallida 14203, followed by S. sesban 1198 and least in L. purpureus. At equal levels of offer, digestible crude protein (DCP) intake was lower (P&lt;0.001) in sheep supplemented with L. pallida 14203 than with S. sesban 1198 or L. purpureus. L. pallida 14203 was readily consumed, whereas animals on L. purpureus and higher levels of S. sesban 1198 had variable quantities of refusals. Supplementation with L. pallida 14203 compared to S. sesban 1198 resulted in higher proportions (P&lt;0.01) of ewes manifesting estrus during the first estrous cycle. Manifestation of estrus was lower (P&lt;0.05) in ewes supplemented with the highest level of S. sesban 1198 than the two lower levels in the first and in the overall mean of the three estrous cycles monitored. Daily live weight gain was higher when the animals were supplemented with S. sesban 1198 as opposed to L. pallida 14203 (P&lt;0.05) or L. purpureus (P&lt;0.01). It is concluded that anti-nutritional factors such as condensed tannins seem to play little role in limiting intake of L. pallida 14203 at all levels of supplementation maintained in this study, whereas some anti-nutritional factors in S. sesban 1198 may limit its intake at higher levels of offer. Moreover, supplementation with S. sesban 1198 had a negative influence on the reproduction of ewes by compromising manifestation of estrus when offered at the highest level of supplementation. "

Leucaena pallida 14203, Sesbania sesban 1198 and Lablab purpureus were grown, harvested and dried at the research station. Seventy individually penned Menz ewes with a mean initial weight of 18.6±0.41 kg (mean±S.D.) were used in a randomized block design experiment that lasted for 6 months. Treatments consisted of supplementing ewes with L. pallida 14203 or S. sesban 1198 at 0.9%, 1.2% or 1.5% of live weight (LW). L. purpureus, offered at 1.2% of \{LW\} was used as a positive control. The basal feed tef straw (Eragrostis tef) was offered at 20% of refusal. Data on feed intake, \{LW\} gain, reproductive parameters and plasma activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), γ-glutamyletransferase (γ-GT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were collected and analyzed. Graded levels of L. pallida 14203 promoted superior intakes of basal feed dry matter (DM) (P&lt;0.05) supplement and total feed DM, CP, higher daily \{LW\} gain, higher fecundity (P&lt;0.001) and lambing rate (P&lt;0.01) than graded levels of S. sesban 1198. Intake of basal feed \{DM\} was higher (P&lt;0.05) for ewes supplemented with the lowest than the highest level of L. pallida 14203. Supplementation with S. sesban 1198 than with the same level of either L. pallida 14203 or L. purpureus resulted in increased (P&lt;0.001) plasma activities of the assayed enzymes. Ewes supplemented with L. pallida 14203 were heavier (P&lt;0.05) at lambing, had lambs with higher (P&lt;0.05) daily pre-weaning \{LW\} gain (first 30 days), and pre-weaning \{LWs\} at 10, 20 and 30 days compared to those supplemented with the same level of L. purpureus or S. sesban 1198. Ewe weight at lambing was positively correlated (P&lt;0.01) with lamb birth weight and pre-weaning lamb \{LW\} gain (P&lt;0.01) for the first 30 days after birth. Supplementation with S. sesban 1198 appears to interfere with the reproduction of ewes and thus it could be considered as unsuitable supplement feed to pregnant ewes for an extended period of feeding. The plasma activities of assayed enzymes suggest that S. sesban 1198 may contain hepato-toxic anti-nutritive factors. "

The present study was conducted to assess farmers' feeding practices and their perception about effects of Sesbania supplementation on sheep performance in annual (one wheat-based (WheatCL) and one teff-based (TeffCL)) and perennial (coffee-based (CoffeeCL)) crop-based livestock systems in the Ethiopian Highlands. Data were collected from 98 households by interviews using a structured questionnaire. Farmers had on average 6.9 years of experience using Sesbania as a cut and carry supplementary feed. Farmers in the WheatCL and TeffCL fed Sesbania throughout the dry season while farmers in the CoffeeCL had no specific season for feeding Sesbania. Farmers in WheatCL and TeffCL offered significantly (P &lt; 0.05) more frequently and a higher quantity per feeding of Sesbania than farmers in CoffeeCL. Most farmers perceived increased lamb birth weight and increased body weight gain, earlier onset of puberty, and improved pregnancy rate of ewes and rams' libido. Perceived improvement was significantly more (P &lt; 0.05) in WheatCL and TeffCL than in CoffeeCL. We concluded that Sesbania was appreciated across farming systems for its feeding value. The marginal advantage of Sesbania was lowest in the CoffeeCL with relatively good availability of good quality feeds compared to the WheatCL and TeffCL, which explains the less positive perception of production and reproductive performance of Sesbania feeding in CoffeeCL.

Such decisions are universally made, so that though different approaches may be required, animal health and production monitoring (HPM) is as important in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as it is in livestock systems in other parts of the world. To set the scene for our discussion of \{HPM\} in SSA, we broadly describe the main African production systems in tabular form, categorised by ecological conditions, production goals and input and output relations within a broad fanning systems context. Subsequently, the scope and diversity of \{HPM\} in \{SSA\} is reviewed. This review reveals that in 2 decades of system monitoring, a wide variety of objectives have been tackled from broad system description and constraint diagnosis to more focused research to identify and quantify the impact of disease and other specific factors on the productivity of cattle and small ruminants. There have been many monitoring clients, ranging from national governments through aid agencies and the scientific community, to individual farmers. To serve these diverse clients and their objectives, a plethora of methods and data collection techniques have evolved, which are briefly reviewed. Methods are often system-specific. As examples, we discuss the specific monitoring needs of two contrasting production systems (pastoralists in the arid and semi-arid zones and smallholder dairy farmers in the highlands of East Africa) to indicate how monitoring has contributed to our understanding of these systems and how monitoring might be better targeted to satisfy future needs. The impact of \{HPM\} on the “state of the knowledge’ of traditional African production systems are then summarised at two levels. The first includes specific health and productivity information gained while the second considers the more general lessons learned with respect to livestock enterprise functions and their impact on human welfare. Finally, future monitoring needs are discussed relative to changes in African livestock systems. It is anticipated that further specialisation and intensification of livestock enterprises will require decision-support systems, many of which already exist in the developed world and could be adapted to SSA.

If these traits are to be considered for inclusion in future dairy goat breeding programs, relationships between them and production traits such as milk yield must be considered. With the increased use of regression models to estimate genetic parameters, an opportunity now exists to investigate correlations between conformation traits and milk yield throughout lactation in more detail. The aims of this study were therefore to (1) estimate genetic parameters for conformation traits in a population of crossbred dairy goats, (2) estimate correlations between all conformation traits, and (3) assess the relationship between conformation traits and milk yield throughout lactation. No information on milk composition was available. Data were collected from goats based on 2 commercial goat farms during August and September in 2013 and 2014. Ten conformation traits, relating to udder, teat, leg, and feet characteristics, were scored on a linear scale (1–9). The overall data set comprised data available for 4,229 goats, all in their first lactation. The population of goats used in the study was created using random crossings between 3 breeds: British Alpine, Saanen, and Toggenburg. In each generation, the best performing animals were selected for breeding, leading to the formation of a synthetic breed. The pedigree file used in the analyses contained sire and dam information for a total of 30,139 individuals. The models fitted relevant fixed and random effects. Heritability estimates for the conformation traits were low to moderate, ranging from 0.02 to 0.38. A range of positive and negative phenotypic and genetic correlations between the traits were observed, with the highest correlations found between udder depth and udder attachment (0.78), teat angle and teat placement (0.70), and back legs and back feet (0.64). The genetic correlations estimated between conformation traits and milk yield across the first lactation demonstrated changes during this period. The majority of correlations estimated between milk yield and the udder and teat traits were negative. Therefore, future breeding programs would benefit from including these traits to ensure that selection for increased productivity is not accompanied by any unwanted change in functional fitness. "

During the period under study, one group ranch was subdivided and settled. The other remained communally owned under shifting seasonal use. Wildlife populations decreased sharply on the privatized ranch following subdivision and increased steadily on the adjacent ranch where pastoralists continued mobile pastoralism. The results of multivariate analysis show that sedentarization and settlement distribution accounts for wildlife declines on the subdivided ranch. Both the direct displacement of wildlife and the reduction in grass production following a switch from seasonal to permanent grazing associated with sedentarization are discussed as causes of wildlife loss. Given the demand for title deeds among pastoralists to counter land losses, the resulting sedentarization is likely to become the biggest threat to wildlife in the East African savannas. "

abstract = "Abstract The World Bank argued that West Africa's Guinea Savannah zone forms part of “Africa's Sleeping Giant,” where increases in agricultural production could be an engine of economic growth, through expansion of cultivated land in sparsely populated areas. The district of Bougouni, in southern Mali, falls within this zone. We used multiple data sources including a panel survey, remote sensing-based land cover classification, population data, and farmer focus group discussions, to investigate whether the area is following a commonly-described pathway of agricultural intensification due to increasing land scarcity. We then used our understanding of historical change to explore plausible future pathways. Bougouni forms part of the expansion zone of the CMDT, which since the mid-1980s has provided support for intensive agricultural systems of cotton-maize rotations with animal traction and use of mineral fertilizer. In the period of the panel survey (1994–2012), cropped land at household level was correlated with household size: households with less than one full team of draft oxen cultivated 0.50 ha/family member, while households with two or more teams cultivated 0.82 ha/family member (R2 &gt; 0.8). At the village level, cropped land increases varied with the amount of remaining available land and the importance of off-farm income. We see some intensification in maize and cotton, and corresponding improvements in food self-sufficiency. However, despite increasing fertilizer use, average maize and cotton yields remain around 1600 and 900 kg/ha respectively, well below national averages. Other crops are still grown in outfields relying on long fallows with limited nutrient inputs. Thus rather than either intensification or extensification the agricultural situation may be best described as stagnation. This may be due to limited incentives to invest in agriculture when compared to opportunities such as gold mining or small businesses, which (in 2012) contribute at least 25% of household income to ten out of 29 households. In future, cropland expansion will likely continue, which could lead to increased conflict between farmers and transhumant herders, and could lead to increased inequality at village level. Factors mitigating the tendency to land expansion include opportunities for off-farm income and migration, or market opportunities and capacity to produce high-value crops such as mango, cashew, or vegetables. This could preserve some remaining savannah area for grazing use and conservation purposes. Understanding household livelihood systems as part of a network of complex social and ecological factors allows the identification and exploration of multiple viable pathways towards desirable futures.

Publication of a reference genome sequence of Theileria parva, the causative agent of ECF, has led to a more thorough characterization of the genotypic and antigenic diversity of the pathogen. It also facilitated identification of antigens that are targets of bovine major histocompatibility complex class I restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), induced by a live parasite-based infection and treatment method (ITM) vaccine. This has led to improved knowledge of epitope-specific T-cell responses to \{ITM\} that most likely contribute to the phenomenon of strain-specific immunity. The Muguga cocktail \{ITM\} vaccine, which provides broad-spectrum immunity to \{ECF\} is now a registered product in three countries in eastern Africa. Effort is directed at improving and scaling up the production process to make this vaccine more widely available on a commercial basis in the region. Meanwhile, research to develop a subunit vaccine based on parasite neutralizing antibodies and \{CTLs\} has been revived through convening of a research consortium to develop proof-of-concept for a next generation vaccine. Many new scientific and technical advances are facilitating this objective. Hence, the next decade promises even more progress toward an improved control of ECF. "

The water balance equations for A and B are discussed, and combined in the water balance of the micro-catchment. The water balance is used as a tool to analyze the performance of the system, and to locate problems in the water harvesting process. Water balance data were collected during the rainy season 1982/1983 from an experimental field in Sede Boqer, in the Northern Negev Desert, Israel. Eight micro-catchments of 125 m2 and four control basins of 9 m2 were used, each providing water for a single tree. Analysis of the water balance illustrates two problems: runoff production and soil water storage. Effective Micro-Catchment-Water-Harvesting (MCWH) occurs in storms with sufficient runoff to allow infiltration deep into the profile free from evaporation. Besides evaporation at the surface of the basin area, water is lost by deep percolation. Efficiencies for runoff and storage are defined, which express the relevant processes in two numbers. For the eight micro-catchments during the rainy season 1982/1983 average runoff efficiency er = 0.19, and average storage efficiency es = 0.18. The analysis shows the usefulness of the water balance approach, and the methods used to evaluate its terms. \{MCWH\} is especially suitable for application in desert fringes with about 250 mm annual rainfall and loess soils, which form a surface crust. Micro-catchments are an effective tool to scale down engineering activities. They are easy and cheap to construct, which allows active participation of the local population. "

In addition, the performance of the modified layout was monitored in two areas of around 2000 ha each. The introduction of the modified layout will save approximately 25% of the irrigation water supplied to rice fields, which would otherwise be lost through the subsurface drainage system. The restricted outflow has no adverse effect on soil salinity or crop yield. Furthermore, the introduction of the modified layout will reduce the maintenance costs of the subsurface drainage systems because the farmers are no longer forced to adopt improper practices to restrict the drainage.

The bulk of this increase will come from developing countries, which host most biodiversity-rich areas of the planet. Whilst most biodiversity is found in production landscapes shared with people, where agriculture represents an increasing threat, international conservation organisations continue to focus on the maintenance and expansion of the network of protected areas. When conservation organisations partner with agricultural programmes, they promote low input, extensive agriculture. Combined with the focus on protected areas, this may exacerbate rather than mitigate conflicts between biodiversity conservation and agricultural production. Two models have been proposed to increase agricultural production whilst minimising the negative consequences for biodiversity: ‘land sparing’ and ‘land sharing’. Although often polarized in debates, both are realistic solutions, depending on the local circumstances. We propose a number of criteria that could guide the choice towards one or the other. We conclude that general principles to be considered in both land sparing and land sharing are: managing spillover effects, maintaining resilience and ecosystem services, accounting for landscape structure, reducing losses and wastes, improving access to agricultural products in developing countries and changing consumption patterns in developed countries, and developing supportive markets and policies.

Projections to meet the food and fibre needs of the world during the next 25 years shows that drainage of at least 10–15 million ha should be improved, which will require an investment of € 19 billion or about € 750 million annually. It is expected that one third of this area will be provided with subsurface drainage systems. Subsurface drainage has been practiced for thousands of years, however, the rapid introduction in Europe and North America only started around 1940, when the prevailing empirical knowledge of drainage and salinity control gained a solid theoretical foundation. Since then, the installation practices evolved from purely manual installation on individual farm plots to fully mechanized installation programmes covering thousands of hectares. To make this rapid change possible, practical tools for the implementation had to be developed, starting with the introduction of new types of installation equipment, i.e. trencher and trenchless drainage machines. To optimize the use of these machines, however, a number of problems had to be solved. New materials for drain pipes and envelopes had to be developed to reduce the high transportation and installation cost of the traditional materials and to improve quality of construction. Next, the traditional method of quality control proved to be inadequate because of the increased speed and method of mechanical installation. And last but not least, staff had to be trained in these modernised drainage machinery and installation techniques, as well as in the planning and organization of the implementation process. This paper discusses these developments in installation techniques, equipment and materials, and the corresponding institutional changes that were needed to keep up with these changing demands. These developments are still going on to meet the specific needs of installation in developing countries, under climatic, physical and social conditions that differ from the ones for which they have been designed. Furthermore, the specific needs of drainage are also changes, particularly with regards to the quality of drainage water, that require changes in the drain system design and corresponding installation practices.

It is estimated that nearly 8.4 million ha is affected by soil salinity and alkalinity, of which about 5.5 million ha is also waterlogged. Subsurface drainage is an effective tool to combat this twin problem of waterlogging and salinity and thus to protect capital investment in irrigated agriculture and increase its sustainability. In India, however, subsurface drainage has not been implemented on a large scale, in spite of numerous research activities that proved its potential. To develop strategies to implement subsurface drainage, applied research studies were set-up in five different agro-climatic sub-regions of India. Subsurface drainage systems, consisting of open and pipe drains with drain spacing varying between 45 and 150 m and drain depth between 0.90 and 1.20 m, were installed in farmers’ fields. The agro-climatic and soil conditions determine the most appropriate combination of drain depth and spacing, but the drain depths are considerably shallower than the 1.75 m traditionally recommended for the prevailing conditions in India. Crop yields in the drained fields increased significantly, e.g. rice with 69%, cotton with 64%, sugarcane with 54% and wheat with 136%. These increases were obtained because water table and soil salinity levels were, respectively, 25% and 50% lower than in the non-drained fields. An economic analysis shows that the subsurface drainage systems are highly cost-effective: cost–benefit ratios range from 1.2 to 3.2, internal rates of return from 20 to 58%, and the pay-back periods from 3 to 9 years. Despite these positive results, major challenges remain to introduce subsurface drainage at a larger scale. First of all, farmers, although they clearly see the benefits of drainage, are too poor to pay the full cost of drainage. Next, water users’ organisations, not only for drainage but also for irrigation, are not well established. Subsurface drainage in irrigated areas is a collective activity, thus appropriate institutional arrangements for farmers’ participation and organisation are needed. Thus, to assure that drainage gets the attention it deserves, policies have to be reformulated. "

The \{NCM\} hydroxide crystals produced by the reaction crystallization were simultaneously coagulated to form agglomerate particles via the consecutive steps of physical adhesion of the crystals and molecular growth. Thus, the hydrodynamic conditions and supersaturation profile in the \{CT\} crystallizer were the most critical influencing parameters determining the agglomerate particle size and shape. The particle size was reduced when increasing the rotation speed of the inner cylinder in the \{CT\} crystallizer, as enhancing the intensity of the Taylor vortex broke and re-dispersed the physically adhered crystals. In addition, a high Taylor vortex changed the irregularly shaped agglomerate particles into spherical ones. The supersaturation profile in the \{CT\} crystallizer was prolonged when increasing the mean residence time and decreasing the feed concentration, thereby enlarging the particle size. Similarly, a chelating reaction also prolonged the supersaturation profile in the \{CT\} crystallizer, resulting in a larger particle size. In the agglomeration, the individual crystals created a hexagonal system stacked on the (0 0 1) face, meaning that the particles were mostly covered by the (1 0 1) face. In general, under the tested operating conditions, the \{CT\} crystallizer was able to produce agglomerate particles that were narrowly distributed and smaller than 5 μm in size within 10 min of the mean residence time.

Maize grain is the key Mexican staple produced for home consumption and the market. Maize crop residues (stover) are an important by-product, primarily for feed use, often through in situ stubble grazing and/or as ex situ forage. This paper explores maize stover use along the agro-ecological gradient and the potential trade-offs, particularly the widespread use of maize stover as feed against its potential use as mulch (soil cover) to manage soil health within the context of conservation agriculture. The paper builds on three case study areas in Mexico in contrasting agro-ecologies: (semi-)arid, temperate highland and tropical sub-humid. Data were obtained through expert consultation and semi-structured farmer group/community surveys. Although in situ grazing is found in all three study sites, it represented the bulk of stover use in only one site (70% of stover in the sub-humid tropics), with ex situ feed dominating in the other two sites (&gt;80%). Maize stover commercialization is limited and mainly restricted to households with no livestock and often within the local context. Farmers are generally hesitant to adopt conservation agricultural practices that require the retention of stover as mulch, as this competes with their livestock feed needs and purchased feed is expensive. To reduce trade-offs, a portfolio of options could be adapted to these mixed systems, including partial residue retention, cover and feed crops and sustainable intensification. Promising but yet to be explored, are investments in the genetic improvement of maize stover feed quality. "

The woven oba was found only in the southern Guinea savanna and was used predominantly by women. Only 13% of the male farmers in the southern Guinea savanna and none in the other zones stored in an improved crib while no female farmers across all the zones used the crib system of storage. Male and female farmers across all the zones identified insect infestation, and fungal and rodent attack as the main problems in their stored maize. Insect infestation was reported by 83% of the female farmers in the southern Guinea savanna zone who stored maize in bags. The highest fungal attack on stored maize was reported by 71% of the male farmers who stored maize in bags in the humid forest zone, while 75% of the male farmers who stored in bags in the Sudan savanna zone complained of rodent attack. Across all zones, farmers of both genders identified insects as the most common storage problem. Farmers who reported insect problems were significantly more likely to have aflatoxin in their stores. The highest zonal mean aflatoxin level of 125.6 μg/kg was obtained from maize samples provided by male farmers in the Sudan savanna zone who stored maize in bags or in a rhumbu.

Since none of the existing control measures are entirely satisfactory, vaccine development is being actively pursued. However, due to antigenic variation, the quest for a conventional vaccine has proven elusive. As a result, we have sought an alternative ‘anti-disease vaccine approach’, based on congopain, a cysteine protease of Trypanosoma congolense, which was shown to have pathogenic effects in vivo. Congopain was initially expressed as a recombinant protein in bacterial and baculovirus expression systems, but both the folding and yield obtained proved inadequate. Hence alternative expression systems were investigated, amongst which Pichia pastoris proved to be the most suitable. We report here the expression of full length, and C-terminal domain-truncated congopain in the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris. Differences in yield were observed between full length and truncated proteins, the full length producing 2–4 mg of protein per litre of culture, while the truncated form produced 20–30 mg/l. The protease was produced as a proenzyme, but underwent spontaneous activation when acidified (pH &lt;5). To investigate whether this activation was due to autolysis, we produced an inactive mutant (active site Cys → Ala) by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant form was produced at a much higher rate, up to 100 mg/l culture, as a proenzyme. It did not undergo spontaneous cleavage of the propeptide when subjected to acidic pH suggesting an autocatalytic process of activation for congopain. These recombinant proteins displayed a very unusual feature for cathepsin L-like proteinases, i.e. complete dimerisation at pH &gt;6, and by reversibly monomerising at acidic pH &lt;5. This attribute is of utmost importance in the context of an anti-disease vaccine, given that the epitopes recognised by the sera of trypanosome-infected trypanotolerant cattle appear dimer-specific.

On average, comparison between measured and predicted drainage water salinity is satisfactory for both the Sampla site and the Hisar site. Calculations show that it may take 15–50 years before drainage water salinity has reduced to equilibrium levels. Leaching fraction has considerable influence on the drainage water salinity. An increase in the leaching fraction from 0.2 to 0.4 will reduce the time to reach equilibrium drainage water salinity levels by about 50%. Drain spacing has little influence on drainage water salinity, provided the hydraulic properties below drain level are uniform (Sampla). Some influence of drain spacing might be expected if the zone below drain level consists of a less conductive layer underlain by a more conductive layer (Hisar). In the latter case, the larger the drain spacing, the longer the time to achieve equilibrium drainage water salinity levels. "

When using the proposed Couette-Taylor (CT) crystallizer, the size distribution and crystal product recovery were much narrower and higher, respectively, than those from a conventional stirred tank (ST) crystallizer. Here, the coefficient of the size distribution for the crystal product from the \{CT\} crystallizer was only 0.45, while it was 0.78 in the case of the conventional \{ST\} crystallizer at an agitation speed of 700 rpm, mean residence time of 20 min, and feed concentration of 900 (g/L). Furthermore, when using the \{CT\} crystallizer, the crystal product recovery was remarkably enhanced up to 100%wt with a mean residence time of only 20 min, while it required a mean residence time of at least 60 min when using the conventional \{ST\} crystallizer. This result indicates that the \{CT\} crystallizer was much more effective than the conventional \{ST\} crystallizer in terms of controlling a narrower size distribution and achieving a 100%wt l-lysine crystal product recovery from continuous cooling crystallization. The advantage of the \{CT\} crystallizer over the conventional \{ST\} crystallizer was explained based on the higher energy dissipation of the Taylor vortex flow and larger surface area for heat transfer of the \{CT\} crystallizer. Here, the energy dissipation of the Taylor vortex flow in the \{CT\} crystallizer was 13.6 times higher than that of the random fluid motion in the conventional \{ST\} crystallizer, while the surface area per unit volume for heat transfer of the \{CT\} crystallizer was 8.0 times higher than that of the conventional \{ST\} crystallizer. As a result, the mixing condition and heat transfer of the \{CT\} crystallizer were much more effective than those of the conventional \{ST\} crystallizer for the cooling crystallization of l-lysine, thereby enhancing the l-lysine crystal size distribution and product recovery.

It addresses a set of related questions: (1) are herder mobility and other production decisions being altered by improved market opportunities; (2) what roles do markets play in pastoralist drought and drought recovery strategies; (3) which groups of producers are taking advantage of and/or benefiting from which market chains; and (4) what factors other than price help to explain why and when pastoralists sell livestock? The article concludes that macro-economic forecasts about supply response in the region may be overly optimistic and off target, because they fail to appreciate the non-price factors that influence pastoralist households’ decisions to sell livestock.

Active data were collected by administration of questionnaires to animal health personnel and their auxiliaries and to stockowners in six selected districts of eastern and northeastern Uganda. Passive data were extracted from vaccination and seromonitoring reports, and from field and laboratory reports. \{RP\} events were classified as “confirmed outbreaks”, “suspected outbreaks” and “rumours”. The classification of 56% of the \{RP\} events as “suspected outbreaks” indicates the difficulty in investigating disease outbreaks in Uganda. Although vaccination coverage and seroprevalence were &lt;85% (the recommended target), they nevertheless corresponded well-reflecting effective vaccination. However, because of the low seroprevalence, a sizable population of cattle in Uganda remained at risk of RP. The agreement between the local and national disease reporting systems was low-to-moderate (κ=0.39); this indicates inefficiency in disease reporting. Risk factors for \{RP\} outbreaks were cattle raids and communal grazing. Based on overlaid thematic maps of seroprevalence, vaccination coverage and \{RP\} events, close spatial and temporal associations were observed between cattle raids, transhumance and outbreaks and rumours. The high-risk areas were in the eastern and northeastern parts of the country. The results of this study support a phase approach of following the \{OIE\} pathway. "

Structured observations and questionnaire interviews were used to analyse pig rearing practices and household use of latrines in Chunya and Iringa Rural Districts only. The analysis of effect of pig management practices, lack of a latrine, eating undercooked pork, home slaughter and no inspection of pork and lack of knowledge of T. solium on their association to tongue positivity in pigs was done by means of a contingency table. Odds ratios (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and p-values were calculated. Structured questionnaire interviews identified factors associated with the disease prevalence in both Chunya and Iringa Rural Districts were free-ranging of pigs, home slaughtering of pigs and pork not being inspected. While in Chunya and Iringa Rural Districts lack of latrine and barbecuing were found a risk factor, respectively. To control the disease in the study areas of the southern highlands there is a need for significant improvements regarding the use of latrines, confinement of pigs, pork inspection and thorough cooking of pork.

Caused by the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium, this zoonotic disease forms larval cysts in humans and pigs that can lead to epilepsy and death in humans, reduces the market value of pigs and makes pork unsafe to eat. It occurs where pigs range freely, sanitation is poor, and meat inspection is absent or inadequate, and is thus strongly associated with poverty and smallholder farming. Although theoretically easy to control and declared eradicable cysticercosis remains neglected in most endemic countries due to lack of information and awareness about the extent of the problem, suitable diagnostic and management capacity, and appropriate prevention and control strategies. Human neurocysticercosis occurs when the larval cysts develop in the brain. It is considered to be the most common parasitic infection of the human nervous system and the most frequent preventable cause of epilepsy in the developing world. Thus far the infection has not been eliminated from any region by a specific program, and no national control programs are yet in place. We consider the tools available for combating cysticercosis and suggest simple packages of interventions, which can be conducted utilizing existing services and structures in the endemic countries to provide appropriate and sustainable control of the disease.

abstract = "Abstract A vibrant, resilient and productive agricultural sector is fundamental to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Bringing about such a transformation requires optimizing a range of agronomic, environmental and socioeconomic outcomes from agricultural systems – from crop yields, to biodiversity, to human nutrition. However, these outcomes are not independent of each other – they interact in both positive and negative ways, creating the potential for synergies and trade-offs. Consequently, transforming the agricultural sector for the age of sustainable development requires tracking these interactions, assessing if objectives are being achieved and allowing for adaptive management within the diverse agricultural systems that make up global agriculture. This paper reviews the field of agricultural trade-off analysis, which has emerged to better understand these interactions – from field to farm, region to continent. Taking a “cradle-to-grave” approach, we distill agricultural trade-off analysis into four steps: 1) characterizing the decision setting and identifying the context-specific indicators needed to assess agricultural sustainability, 2) selecting the methods for generating indicator values across different scales, 3) deciding on the means of evaluating and communicating the trade-off options with stakeholders and decision-makers, and 4) improving uptake of trade-off analysis outputs by decision-makers. Given the breadth of the Sustainable Development Goals and the importance of agriculture to many of them, we assess notions of human well-being beyond income or direct health concerns (e.g. related to gender, equality, nutrition), as well as diverse environmental indicators ranging from soil health to biodiversity to climate forcing. Looking forward, areas of future work include integrating the four steps into a single modeling platform and connecting tools across scales and disciplines to facilitate trade-off analysis. Likewise, enhancing the policy relevance of agricultural trade-off analysis requires improving scientist-stakeholder engagement in the research process. Only then can this field proactively address trade-off issues that are integral to sustainably intensifying local and global agriculture – a critical step toward successfully implementing the Sustainable Development Goals.

Camel species are Bactrians (Camelus bactrianus), dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius) and crosses between both species, hereafter referred as hybrids. Fiber traits included clean fine fiber yield (CY), mean fine fiber diameter (MFD), mean fine fiber diameter coefficient of variation (MFD CV), fine fiber curvature (Curv) and fine fiber staple length (SL). The arithmetic averages of CY, MFD, \{MFD\} CV, Curv and \{SL\} were respectively 37.3%, 18.0 μm, 30.6%, 87.7 °/mm and 46.0 mm for Bactrians; 29.1%, 21.2 μm, 30.3%, 78.2 °/mm and 52.7 mm for dromedaries; and 42.7%, 17.9 μm, 29.5%, 89.9 °/mm and 47.2 mm for hybrids. Significant age by species interaction was detected for all traits. Overall, Bactrian camels had higher CY, lower MFD, higher Curv and lower \{SL\} than dromedaries (P &lt; 0.05). The geographical locations significantly differentiated \{CY\} and Curv but not the other traits; thus, for the locations studied little could be gained by looking into location variability when planning genetic improvement programs. There were no significant sex differences for all the studied traits, whereas significant differences due to the color of the coat were found only for Curv. The residual phenotypic correlations among CY, \{MFD\} and Curv were all high and would be favorable for selection purposes. Likewise, the residual phenotypic correlations between each of these variables with \{SL\} would be unfavorable if selection targets an increased SL. The study detected heterogeneity for most fiber quality traits, suggesting that a base is in place for fiber quality improvement. "

Fixed effects involved location (geographical), animal age and coat color. Fiber traits included greasy down yield for cashmere (GDY, %) and clean yield (CY, %) for mohair; mean down diameter (MDD, μm) for cashmere and mean fiber diameter (MFD, μm) for mohair; coefficient of variation (CV, %) associated with \{MFD\} or MDD; comfort factor (CF, %); fiber curvature (Curv,°/mm) and staple length (SL, mm). Percentages of med, kemp and total medullation (TM) were also obtained for mohair samples. Residual phenotypic correlations between traits were calculated. Cashmere GDY, MDD, CV, CF, Curv and \{SL\} averaged respectively 26.8 ± 0.6%, 17.2 ± 0.1 μm, 21.0 ± 0.2%, 98.9 ± 0.2% 69.7 ± 0.5°/mm and 29.4 ± 0.7 mm. Location was a significant differentiating factor for all cashmere traits. Significant \{GDY\} decrease and \{MDD\} increase was observed with age. The \{SL\} was highly correlated with GDY, \{MDD\} and \{CF\} (0.63, 0.65 and −0.64, respectively), and so was \{GDY\} with \{MDD\} (0.78).

Significant location differences were found for mohair CY, MFD, CF, Curv, SL, kemp and TM, along with a significant \{MFD\} increase and \{CF\} decrease with age.

The mohair \{MFD\} was also highly correlated with \{CF\} (−0.99), Curv (−0.81), \{SL\} (0.70) and \{FM\} (0.64).

The results show that households face considerable challenges in adapting to climate change. While many households have made small adjustments to their farming practices in response to climate change (in particular, changing planting decisions), few households are able to make more costly investments, for example in agroforestry or irrigation, although there is a desire to invest in such measures. This emphasizes the need for greater investments in rural and agricultural development to support the ability of households to make strategic, long-term decisions that affect their future well-being.

We estimate a model of crop and variety choice in a theoretical framework of the farm household model to compare the determinants of crop and variety diversity, revealing some of these policy considerations. Farm physical features and household characteristics such as wealth and labour stocks have large and significant effects on both the diversity among and within cereal crops, varying among crops. Policies designed to encourage variety diversity in one cereal crop may have opposing effects in another crop. Trade-offs between development-related factors and diversity in this resource-poor system are not evident, however. Market-related variables and population density have ambiguous effects. Education positively influences cereal crop diversity. Growing modern varieties of maize or wheat does not detract from the richness or evenness of these cereals on household farms. "

Intake of digestible crude protein (DCP, g/d) and metabolizable energy (MJ/d) were higher (P &lt; 0.01) in lambs fed \{SSBP\} diet. The \{SSBP\} diet had higher (P &lt; 0.01) \{DCP\} and N (P &lt; 0.05) balance compared to other three diets. Increased (P &lt; 0.01) purine derivatives and microbial N supply was observed in processed diets. Expander extrusion of \{SSB\} based complete diet resulted in improved (P &lt; 0.01) efficiency of microbial protein synthesis. It is concluded that, when \{SSB\} was processed into complete diets, in terms of nutrient utilization and microbial N supply, the expander extruded pellet diet was better utilized than chopped or mash form by the growing ram lambs.

The major sporozoite surface antigen of T. parva (p67) is an important candidate for inclusion in a subunit vaccine. Recently, we reported the expression and production of different parts of p67 as fusions to either \{GFP\} or to the baculovirus \{GP64\} envelope glycoprotein in insect cells, which resulted in stable proteins recognized by a monoclonal specific for native p67. The immunogenicity of these fusion proteins was examined in out-bred mice and cattle. In mice, the full length p67 molecule without its signal peptide and transmembrane region, but fused to \{GFP\} (GFP:p67ΔSS) was the best immunogen followed by the C-terminus of p67 fused to \{GP64\} (GP64:p67C). These two immunogens also provoked a high level of sero-conversion in cattle when formulated in a water-in-oil or saponin-derived adjuvant with only 100 μg of protein and a single booster. The vaccine-elicited antibodies efficiently inhibited the infectivity of T. parva sporozoites in in vitro neutralization assays. This study demonstrated that these new baculovirus-derived p67 vaccines were highly immunogenic, and that in combination with a suitable adjuvant, they have a clear potential to induce protective immunity in cattle.

Early live body weights, mohair quantity and mohair quality data were collected and genotypes compared after correcting for season, farm and sex of progeny, fitting age as a co-variable. Body weights at birth were higher in crossbreds (2.39 vs. 2.19 kg, P &lt; 0.001) but body weights at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months were similar. Fleece weights at first shearing were much higher in crossbreds (1.16 vs. 0.68 kg, P &lt; 0.001) as well as staple length (19.6 vs. 16.3 cm, P &lt; 0.001).

It was suggested to monitor later life performance of crossbreds and it is concluded that the introduction of Texan Angora bucks improved Tajik goats. Further improvement may be based on cooperative breeding of Texan progeny and outstanding local goats on one site and distribution to multipliers in different communities. "

For semi-arid regions in particular, inadequate and highly variable rainfall and short growing periods limit yield potential and create a risky primary production environment. However, short-season crop varieties offer a promising option for farming with increased uncertainties. Against this background, the aim of this work was to collect field trial data for multiple seasons in Eastern Kenya to better calibrate the existing \{APSIM\} (Agricultural Production System sIMulator) legume models for short-season varieties of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)., cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) and lablab (Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet) and to evaluate the performance of the adapted models in terms of biomass production and yield. Finally with the use of a simulation study, the impact of management options (e.g. sowing time, planting density) and future climate predictions on the overall production potential of the different short-season grain legumes was explored. Results indicate that decisions on optimal sowing times will become more important with shortened growing periods to take full advantage of in-season rainfall. Short-season cultivars of beans were advantageous in extreme short growing periods with external droughts due to their very short maturity time. Lablab seemed to cope best with high in season rainfall variability producing stable yields across a range of rainfall scenarios independent of future climate predictions. Cowpea instead was out yielding beans and lablab in wet years and had a very high biomass production. Consequently, using the full diversity of available short-season legumes can function as an essential part of a sustainable risk management strategy to design more resilient farming systems and increase food security in semi-arid Eastern Kenya. Finally, if well calibrated and tested, simulations models have proved to be an excellent tool for ex-ante assessment of agricultural management interventions in the view of future climate change. "

Comparative genomics of the hemoprotozoan parasites B. bovis and Theileria parva revealed a highly conserved syntenic block of genes flanking the p67 gene of T. parva, a sporozoite stage-specific vaccine candidate against East Coast fever (ECF). The syntenic gene in B. bovis, designated bov57, encodes a protein of limited amino acid sequence identity (11.8%) to p67. Monoclonal antibodies were produced against recombinant \{BOV57\} and were used to demonstrate expression of \{BOV57\} in merozoite and kinete stages of the \{T2Bo\} strain of B. bovis. Transcript levels of bov57 in kinetes were increased 100-fold in comparison to msa-1, a previously identified gene encoding an erythrocyte stage surface protein. Amino acid sequence comparisons between the \{T2Bo\} strain and two attenuated and virulent strains from Argentina and Australia revealed a high degree of sequence conservation in \{BOV57\} among these geographically and pathogenically divergent isolates (97% amino acid sequence identity). Additional genomic comparisons show that the bov57 gene locus is also conserved in Babesia bigemina and Babesia equi. While not identifiable through amino acid or nucleotide sequence similarity, the conserved gene order within this locus in multiple piroplasms may suggest a critical function adapted for each species’ unique host and life-cycle.

This means that single solutions (or ‘silver bullets’) for improving farm productivity do not exist. Yet to date few approaches to understand constraints and explore options for change have tackled the bewildering complexity of African farming systems. In this paper we describe the Nutrient Use in Animal and Cropping systems – Efficiencies and Scales (NUANCES) framework. \{NUANCES\} offers a structured approach to unravel and understand the complexity of African farming to identify what we term ‘best-fit’ technologies – technologies targeted to specific types of farmers and to specific niches within their farms. The \{NUANCES\} framework is not ‘just another computer model’! We combine the tools of systems analysis and experimentation, detailed field observations and surveys, incorporate expert knowledge (local knowledge and results of research), generate databases, and apply simulation models to analyse performance of farms, and the impacts of introducing new technologies. We have analysed and described complexity of farming systems, their external drivers and some of the mechanisms that result in (in)efficient use of scarce resources. Studying sites across sub-Saharan Africa has provided insights in the trajectories of change in farming systems in response to population growth, economic conditions and climate variability (cycles of drier and wetter years) and climate change. In regions where human population is dense and land scarce, farm typologies have proven useful to target technologies between farmers of different production objectives and resource endowment (notably in terms of land, labour and capacity for investment). In such regions we could categorise types of fields on the basis of their responsiveness to soil improving technologies along soil fertility gradients, relying on local indicators to differentiate those that may be managed through ‘maintenance fertilization’ from fields that are highly-responsive to fertilizers and fields that require rehabilitation before yields can improved. Where human population pressure on the land is less intense, farm and field types are harder to discern, without clear patterns. Nutrient cycling through livestock is in principle not efficient for increasing food production due to increased nutrient losses, but is attractive for farmers due to the multiple functions of livestock. We identified trade-offs between income generation, soil conservation and community agreements through optimising concurrent objectives at farm and village levels. These examples show that future analyses must focus at farm and farming system level and not at the level of individual fields to achieve appropriate targeting of technologies – both between locations and between farms at any given location. The approach for integrated assessment described here can be used ex ante to explore the potential of best-fit technologies and the ways they can be best combined at farm level. The dynamic and integrated nature of the framework allows the impact of changes in external drivers such as climate change or development policy to be analysed. Fundamental questions for integrated analysis relate to the site-specific knowledge and the simplification of processes required to integrate and move from one level to the next. "

Both rainfall erosivity and vegetation cover are highly variable through space and time. Joint accounting for the variability of these factors is required to effectively map and monitor soil erosion. However, most studies merely use average annual erosivity values, partly due to data paucity. This study analyses the variability of rainfall erosivity across Africa through the use of 3-hourly \{TRMM\} Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) precipitation data. We obtained average annual erosivity estimates from 15 yr of \{TMPA\} data (1998–2012) using intensity–erosivity relationships. Our estimates showed a positive correlation (r = 0.84) with long-term annual erosivity values of 37 stations obtained from literature. Our TMPA-analysis confirmed and mapped the large interannual variability, with maximum annual erosivity often exceeding two to three times the mean value, especially in semi-arid areas. Seasonal variability of erosivity was investigated from TMPA-based average monthly erosivity estimates, which resulted in similar seasonal patterns as those reported in literature. We conclude that (1) spatial and temporal variability of erosivity is important and needs to be accounted for in combination with vegetation cover when monitoring soil erosion; and (2) 3-hourly \{TMPA\} data allow for a good first estimate of the variability of erosivity in Africa, which could be improved by upcoming techniques that provide more accurate rainfall information at higher spatial and temporal resolutions.

Simulation models can play an important role in quantifying water-limited potential yield, and therefore the scope for intensification, but no oil palm model exists that is both simple enough and at the same time incorporates sufficient plant physiological knowledge to be generally applicable across sites with different growing conditions. The objectives of this study therefore were to develop a model (PALMSIM) that simulates, on a monthly time step, the potential growth of oil palm as determined by solar radiation and to evaluate model performance against measured oil palm yields under optimal water and nutrient management for a range of sites across Indonesia and Malaysia. The maximum observed yield in the field matches the corresponding simulated yield for dry bunch weight with a \{RMSE\} of 1.7 Mg ha−1 year−1 against an observed yield of 18.8 Mg ha−1. Sensitivity analysis showed that \{PALMSIM\} is robust: simulated changes in yield caused by modifying the parameters by 10% are comparable to other tree crop model evaluations. While we acknowledge that, depending on the soils and climatic environment, yields may be often water limited, we suggest a relatively simple physiological approach to simulate potential yield, which can be usefully applied to high rainfall environments and is considered as a first step in developing an oil palm model that also simulates water-limited potential yield. To illustrate the application possibilities of the model, \{PALMSIM\} was used to create a potential yield map for Indonesia and Malaysia by simulating the growth and yield at a resolution of 0.1°. This map of potential yield is considered as a first step towards a decision support tool that can identify potentially productive, but at the moment degraded sites in Indonesia and Malaysia. "

abstract = "East Coast fever (ECF), caused by Theileria parva, is the most important tick-borne disease of cattle in much of eastern, central and southern Africa. In Kenya, immunization against \{ECF\} has been performed in many field trials using the infection and treatment method. The main targets for immunization are the Taurine and Taurine-cross cattle, due to their high susceptibility. However, indigenous Zebu cattle may also be targets for immunization where endemic instability to this parasite exists. For both cattle types, it is important to know the prevalence of other tick-borne diseases if the frequency of acaricide application is to be reduced following \{ECF\} immunization. In the Coast Province of Kenya there are four distinct agroecological zones (AEZs), classified on agroclimatic factors. The environmental conditions in these \{AEZs\} vary in their suitability for Rhipicephalus appendiculatus the main field vector of ECF. The abundance of this tick has a direct impact on the degree of endemic stability to T. parva and is hence the justification for immunization in the predominantly Zebu cattle population of the Province. A serological study was conducted on 316 Zebu calves on 30 farms in three of the four agroecological zones, and prevalence rates to Theileria parva, T. mutans, Babesia bigemina, Anaplasma marginale and Cowdria ruminantium were determined. Antibody prevalence rates to T. parva differed across \{AEZs\} (ranging from 22 to 85%) whereas to the other tick-borne diseases they were uniformly high (73–94%). It is concluded that the justification for immunization of Zebu cattle against \{ECF\} varies with AEZ, and that any reduction in acaricide usage following immunization is unlikely to be accompanied by an increased incidence of other tick-borne diseases. The sampling methodolohy used in the study was evaluated for its precision, and recommendations for sampling strategy in future studies of tick-borne disease prevalence are made. "

Also, additional data for these areas were collected to quantify the processes taking place at these locations. Correlations between tree pattern indices and explaining factors were analysed. We found a negative trend between tree cover and density of sheep and goats, but no relationship between tree cover and density of cattle, suggesting that small livestock have an effect on tree cover, but that larger livestock (or obligate grazers) do not. Also, a positive correlation between human population density and tree cover was found. Possible explanations for the found relations are discussed.

Several programmes, in Ethiopia and elsewhere, have attempted to improve chicken production as a means to reduce poverty. A key constraint to chicken production identified by farmers is disease. This study used participatory rural appraisal methods to work with chicken-keepers in order to prioritise chicken diseases, place these within the context of other production constraints, and to explore perceptions of disease risk factors and biosecurity measures. The study, focused on Debre Zeit, Ethiopia, included 71 poultry keepers (41 backyard and 30 semi-intensive chicken producers). Although women played an important role in backyard production systems, semi-intensive farms were more likely to be controlled by men. Participants identified 9 constraints to production: 7 of 8 groups of backyard producers and 15/31 semi-intensive producers ranked diseases as the most important constraint to chicken production. In contrast to previous reports, farmers in both groups had considerable knowledge of diseases and of factors affecting disease risk. Both groups, but particularly semi-intensive producers, highlighted access to feed as a constraint. Many of the challenges faced by both groups were associated with difficulty accessing agricultural and veterinary inputs and expertise. Whilst many of the constraints identified by farmers could be viewed as simply technical issues to be overcome, we believe it is important to recognise the social factors underpinning what are, in reality, relatively modest technical challenges. The low involvement of women in semi-intensive production needs to be recognised by poultry development schemes. Provision needs to be made to allow access to inputs for a wide range of business models, particularly for those, such as women, who have limited access to the capital to allow them to make the jump from backyard to semi-intensive producer, and require support to slowly build up a flock into a profitable venture.

Protection levels were measured using the pathology index, calculated from post mortem scores of lesions from animals killed during the course of clinical disease. In the challenge at 3 months post vaccination, the protection levels were 52% and 77% for the modified and current vaccine preparations, respectively. At 16 months post vaccination, the protection levels were 56% and 62% for the modified and current vaccine preparations, respectively. These findings indicate that there are no differences in protection levels between the two vaccines. Because of its longer half life after reconstitution, the modified vaccine might be preferred in field situations where the reconstituted vaccine is likely not to be administered immediately. "

Variables describing management and biosecurity practices were organised into five groups: structure of the farm, animal-contacts, person- and vehicle-contacts, feeding, and sanitary aspects. In general, few biosecurity measures were implemented in the pig farms included in the study. Regional differences in management and biosecurity practices emerged from the \{MFA\} and were mainly due to, in order of decreasing importance: structure of the farm, sanitary aspects, feeding and animal-contacts and, to a lesser extent, person- and vehicle-contacts. \{HCA\} resulted in the differentiation of four distinct types of farms in each of two study areas, Arivonimamo and Marovoay, while no grouping could be identified amongst farms in Ambatondrazaka area. The characterisation of the different types of smallholder pig farms will allow adapting recommendations on husbandry practices and control measures in pig farms of these regions of Madagascar. The development of tailored recommendations is essential for Malagasy smallholders who have limited resources and need to make evidence-based management changes to reduce the risk of contagious diseases in their herds.

abstract = "Information is needed on the biophysical and economic rationale for labour-demanding (and therefore, expensive) backyard animal rearing systems on smallholdings in the uplands of Java where livestock have been an integral part of highly intensive agriculture for centuries. The occurrence of high densities of ruminant livestock is counter-intuitive considering the extent and continuous nature of cropping on densely populated islands such as Java where little land remains suitable for grazing. As a consequence, livestock are permanently housed in backyards and fed indigenous forages cut from field margins and roadsides. Although cut-and-carry feeding is labour-intensive, it is surprising that farmers collect quantities of forage greatly in excess of the requirements of their livestock. In an experiment, indigenous forage was fed to sheep at increasing rates: 25, 50 or 75 g \{DM\} kg−1 liveweight daily. The results showed that although \{DM\} intake and liveweight gain rose with increasing offer-rate, the incremental improvements from 50 to 75 were non-significant (p&lt;0.05) and &lt;25 to 50. It is unlikely that farmers justify their excess-feeding strategies on the basis of these marginal gains in animal productivity alone. The rationale for excess-feeding also lies in the production of manure-composts. Group-interviews, involving preference-ranking and matrix scoring exercises, indicated that in upland areas, farmers have an extensive knowledge regarding organic fertiliser quality and use. Farmers place value on the inclusion of animal wastes, particularly urine, into composts. In rain-fed areas, manure production ranked similar to meat production in importance as outputs from the sheep enterprise. The research demonstrates how livestock are traditionally used to produce high quality compost and provides evidence to support the hypothesis that integration of livestock into Javanese agriculture is essential to sustaining some of the world’s most intensive smallholder farming systems.

Immunisation had no effect on the establishment of infection and the development of acute anaemia. However, immunised cattle, unlike control cattle, maintained or gained weight during infection. Their haematocrit and leukocyte counts showed a tendency to recovery after 2–3 months of infection. Cattle immunised with \{CP2\} mounted early and prominent IgG responses to \{CPs\} and to the variable surface glycoprotein following challenge.

The objective of this study was to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the Danish Bilharziasis Laboratory technique in cats, dogs, pigs, water buffaloes and rats in the Philippines. Faecal samples from each animal were collected on up to five occasions on five consecutive days in four villages of Sorsogon and Western Samar Provinces between January and July 2003. The faecal samples were analysed with the filtration and sedimentation Danish Bilharziasis Laboratory technique. Sensitivity and specificity of one, two, three, four, and five faecal samples were estimated using a Bayesian latent class approach. A total of 59, 43, 74, and 80% of the censored cats, dogs, pigs, and water buffaloes in the four villages were sampled, respectively. For all species, the sensitivity estimates when using the results of only 1 day of sampling were less than 80%. However, the sensitivity improved to at least 96% in all species when three or more faecal samples were collected on three separate days. The specificity was estimated to be above 92% across all species, even if just a single sample is used. The prevalences and 95% credible intervals of S. japonicum, adjusted for imperfect sensitivity and specificity, in cats, dogs, pigs, rats, and water buffaloes were 11.9% (6.8–18.3%), 19.9% (15.1–25.2%), 2.9% (1.1–5.2%), 31.3% (18.3–45.6%) and 6.3% (2.1–12.6%), respectively. Our results suggest that the Danish Bilharziasis Laboratory technique is valid for the detection of infection with S. japonicum in animals, and that sensitivity estimates are excellent when faecal samples are collected on at least three different days.

We also investigated whether sera raised against recombinant GlpO in cattle and mice inhibit production of \{H2O2\} by Mmm. Immunization of cattle with recombinant GlpO did not protect against challenge with a virulent strain of Mmm. Further, although both murine and bovine antisera raised against recombinant GlpO detected recombinant and native forms of GlpO in immunoblot assays with similar titres, only murine antibodies could neutralize GlpO enzymatic function.

abstract = "Abstract Since the discovery of the fumonisins in 1988, extensive academic studies have generated much knowledge, including data on chemistry, biochemistry, toxicology, methods of analysis, natural occurrence in food supplies, fate during various processing procedures, and human and animal exposures. These mycotoxins have also been assessed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and have twice been the subject of risk assessments by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The outcome of these investigations has been of a nature to alert risk managers to the necessity of controlling human exposure. However, the fumonisins occur mostly in maize, a world staple crop which is consumed in various communities at levels which can be as many as 100-fold different. Compounding the problem is the fact that maize is widely used as animal feed in many developed countries, whereas in Africa and some other developing countries, it is the primary food source. This contrast produces a problem for risk managers, partly solved at national level by the regulation of maximum tolerated levels (MTLs) applicable to individual countries. \{MTLs\} at an international level are currently under discussion at the Codex Committee on Contaminants in Food. The divergence in use and consumption and the fact that maize in various regions of the world can also vary greatly in contamination levels, leads to a dilemma for setting such MTLs, which would need to be low to protect the high maize consumers, but might then cause rejection of high amounts of the world supply. Higher MTLs, acceptable to maize exporters, would only protect the low maize consumers. This dilemma may only be solved by accepting that harmonizing regulations for raw maize is problematic and a more nuanced approach may be required. "

Sensitivity and specificity estimates for the \{ELISA\} based on 158 positive sera from cattle experimentally infected with Australian isolates of B. bovis and 318 negative sera collected from B. bovis-free herds in Australia were 100% and 99.4%, respectively. The specificity of the assay in Africa, based on 328 sera from B. bovis-free herds in Kenya and South Africa, was 99.7%. The \{ELISA\} was compared with the \{IFAT\} using sequential sera from 16 calves experiencing primary B. bovis infections, and a total of 777 field sera collected from B. bovis-endemic herds in Australia and Zimbabwe. In primary infections, the \{ELISA\} and \{IFAT\} detected antibodies at or about the same time. With sera from endemic herds, the performance of the \{ELISA\} was at least comparable with that of the IFAT. Two hundred and fourteen of 221 sera that were negative by IFAT, were negative by ELISA, and 428 of 439 sera that were clearly positive by \{IFAT\} were positive by ELISA. Of 117 sera that gave equivocal (suspect or weak positive) results in the IFAT, 20 were positive by ELISA, 7 were suspect and 90 were negative.

Six villages were used in each area. Each of these villages had a sentinel cattle herd that was screened for trypanosomosis on monthly basis using buffy coat technique. Animals found infected at each sampling were treated with diminazene aceturate at 7 mg kg−1 body weight. Treatments administered by the owners over the sampling intervals were recorded as well. Tsetse flies were trapped at the time of sampling using baited stationary traps and apparent tsetse density estimated as flies per trap per day (FTD). A fixed proportion (10%) of the flies was dissected and their infection status determined through microscopy. Blood meals were also collected from some of the flies and their sources identified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Tsetse challenge was obtained as a product of tsetse density, trypanosome prevalence and the proportion of blood meals obtained from cattle. This variable was transformed using logarithmic function and fitted as an independent factor in a Poisson model that had trypanosomosis incidence in the sentinel cattle as the outcome of interest. The mean trypanosomosis incidence in the sentinel group of cattle was 7.2 and 10.2% in Nkuruman and Nkineji, respectively. Glossina pallidipes was the most prevalent tsetse species in Nkuruman while G. swynnertoni was prevalent in Nkineji. The proportions of tsetse that had mature infections in the respective areas were 0.6 and 4.2%. Most tsetse (28%) sampled in Nkuruman had blood meals from warthogs while most of those sampled in Nkineji (30%) had blood meals from cattle. A statistically significant association between tsetse challenge and trypanosomosis incidence was obtained only in Nkuruman when data was pooled and analyzed at the area but not at the village-level. In the later scenario, lagging tsetse challenge by 1 month improved the strength but not the significance of the association. These findings show that when the spatial unit of analysis in observational studies or on-farm trials is small, for instance a village, it may not be possible to demonstrate a statistically significant association between tsetse challenge and trypanosomosis incidence in livestock so as to effectively control for tsetse challenge.

The predominant production system was mixed crop-livestock with farmers owning 2–11 local cattle on holdings between 2 and 5 ha. Approximately 15% of disease episodes in cattle were perceived to be trypanosomiasis, although the farmers’ ability to make diagnoses was limited in that over half of the diagnoses were inconsistent with the clinical signs described. Drugs were generally obtained from agro-veterinary shops, and the farmers themselves administered slightly more than half of these. One third of drug treatments given to sick cattle were trypanocides, but over half of these trypanocidal treatments were given to cattle believed to have diseases other than trypanosomiasis. "

Eight nomads agreed on improving fleece weight, body weight and down yield while reducing cashmere fibre diameter of white coated goats. Economic weights were calculated to define a breeding objective. Each nomad established a breeding nucleus selecting visually his best 40 does and two bucks from about 250 goats. Nomads used different systems to ensure separate mating of nucleus and general herd animals. Nomads were also able to identify the progeny of each buck. Nucleus progenies were recorded for weaning weight and fleece weight. Fleece samples were collected for analyses of down yield and down fibre diameter. General herd male progeny was castrated. Formal selection indices were used to select nucleus male replacements. To construct the indices phenotypic and genetic parameters were taken from project data and published figures. Accuracy of indices ranged 0.47 to 0.66 depending on the traits included. The inferior buck based on progeny index average was replaced by the best young buck available. Other high ranked young bucks were used in the general herd. The breeding program is in its fourth cycle and favourable selection differentials were confirmed for selected bucks in all traits of interests, in particular for down weight and down diameter, 62 g and −0.5 μm, respectively. The expected benefit of the program is about 4.0 \{USD\} accumulating per goat and per year. Fleece testing is an issue since the region lacks a fleece testing service. If fleece sampling is discontinued the expected benefit reduces to about 2.8 \{USD\} per goat and per year. Circular use of bucks to control inbreeding and participation of additional nomad families are planned for the future. This experience shows that a participatory breeding program can be successfully implemented under nomadic conditions through intensive collaboration of nomad herders, regional extension officers and scientists.

This study evaluates different crop management strategies both by their capacity to sequester carbon in agricultural soils and by their contribution to household income. A case study in Wa, Upper West Region of Ghana is used to test 48 different cropping strategies by means of a crop simulation model and a household-level multiple-criteria optimisation model. Each cropping strategy is evaluated after a 20-year simulation period by its capacity to accrue carbon in the soil, by its economic performance at the plot-level, and by its contribution to the farm income with and without carbon payments.

We propose to determine the genome sequence of Theileria parva, a pathogen of cattle, using the random shotgun approach pioneered at The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). A number of features of the T. parva genome make it particularly suitable for this approach. The G+C content of genomic \{DNA\} is about 31%, non-coding repetitive \{DNA\} constitutes less than 1% of total \{DNA\} and a framework for the 10–12 Mbp genome is available in the form of a physical map for all four chromosomes. Minisatellite sequences are the only dispersed repetitive sequences identified so far, but they are limited in distribution to 13 of 33 SfiI fragments. Telomere and sub-telomeric non-coding sequences occupy less than 10 kbp at each chromosomal end and there are only two units encoding cytoplasmic rRNAs. Three sets of distinct multicopy sequences encoding \{ORFs\} have been identified but it is not known if these are associated with expression of parasite antigenic diversity. Protein coding genes exhibit a bias in codon usage and introns when present are unusually short. Like other apicomplexan organisms, T. parva contains two extrachromosomal DNAs, a mitochondrial \{DNA\} and a plastid \{DNA\} molecule. By annotating the genome sequence, in combination with the use of microarray technology and comparative genomics, we expect to gain significant insights into unique aspects of the biology of T. parva. We believe that the data will underpin future research to aid in the identification of targets of protective CD8+ cell mediated immune responses, and parasite molecules involved in inducing reversible host leukocyte transformation and tumour-like behaviour of transformed parasitised cells.

This study aimed to determine whether fusing Tat, a cell penetrating peptide (CPP) from HIV-1 TAT, to a CD8+ T cell target antigen from T. parva (Tp2) enhances the cytosolic delivery and subsequent stimulation of bovine CD8+ T cell responses in vitro.

Although Mendelian genetics governs adult resistance to infection, juvenile resistance and susceptibility are complex traits. In this study, suppression subtractive hybridization was used to construct forward and reverse cDNA libraries to identify genes involved in the immediate response of juvenile resistant (BS-90), non-susceptible (LAC2) snails, and susceptible (NMRI) snails after early exposure to S. mansoni. Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) were generated from the repertoire of enriched transcripts. In resistant snails, several \{ESTs\} corresponded to transcripts involved in immune regulation/defense response. While no defense related transcripts were found among juvenile susceptible snail ESTs, we detected transcripts involved in negative regulation of biological process/morphogenesis/proliferation. Differential gene expression and temporal regulation of representative transcripts were compared among snails pre- and post-exposure to either normal or attenuated miracidia using quantitative real time RT-PCR. Results showed that several transcripts, such as fibrinolytic C terminal domain, cytidine deaminase, macrophage expressed gene 1, protein kinase C receptor, anti-microbial peptide; theromacin and Fas remained up-regulated regardless of whether or not snails were exposed to normal or attenuated miracidia. While \{ESTs\} related to C-type lectin and low-density lipoprotein receptor were induced only by exposure to normal miracidia. By comparing changes in gene expression between resistant and susceptible juvenile snails responding either to normal or attenuated parasites, we can conclude that the transcription of genes associated with the intra-dermal penetration process of the snail host by invading miracidia may need to be taken into account when assessing differential gene expression between resistant and susceptible strains of B. glabrata in relation to S. mansoni exposure.

Eight income-earning strategies were distinguished that reflect differences in comparative advantage between communities. We explain the choice of income earning strategy using a multinomial logit model that includes biophysical, economic, social and institutional variables. We use a probit model to show that adoption of conservation practices is determined by the type of income earning strategy, population density, market access, and organizational variables. Our results have some important policy implications. First, given the higher profitability of cash crops compared to staple foods, significant investments in road infrastructure are needed to better integrate hillside communities into the market economy. Second, while the potential of profitable conservation practices depends on the type of income earning strategy pursued, population density, market access and assistance from community-based and external organizations play an important role as well. The positive impact of population density on the adoption of many conservation technologies and investments becomes only effective at relatively high levels of population density which most communities in the rural hillsides of Honduras have not yet reached. Finally, given the limited coverage of basic public services such as public health, education, electricity, communication facilities and extension services in many hillside regions, it is imperative to substantially increase the low current levels of public expenditures in these areas. Subsequent research based on detailed household and plot level data from the same communities suggests that investments geared towards improved access to land, education, market access and extension with a focus on soil fertility maintenance have particular potential to raise incomes.

Following a baseline study on current trypanosomiasis knowledge, attitudes and practices by smallholder farmers, a communication intervention strategy was developed involving dissemination through school children, village elders, animal health centres and Agrovet shops, and using layered messages in posters and leaflets. A participatory research approach was used to develop, design and assess the impact of animal health messages on the control of bovine trypanosomiasis for smallholder farmers in tsetse and trypanosomiasis endemic areas in Busia (two administrative divisions) and Kwale Districts (two administrative divisions) of Kenya. Communication intervention materials (in poster and leaflet formats) were developed and disseminated to residents in villages in one administrative division in each district (intervention area) while those from the other division in each district were not deliberately exposed to the animal health messages (control area). Several communication impact indicators were derived and these were measured 4–6 weeks after dissemination of the print media through questionnaires on trypanosomiasis knowledge administered to school children and cattle-keeping smallholders in the intervention and control study sites. School children’s post-communication intervention trypanosomiasis signs knowledge was much higher than that observed during the pre-communication intervention survey. More trypanocides were named by school children during the post-intervention questionnaire survey compared to those known during the pre-intervention survey. The trypanosomiasis signs knowledge score obtained by the smallholder farmers exposed to the extension materials was higher than that obtained by those not exposed to them. Similarly, farmers’ exposure to extension materials resulted in higher trypanocidal drug knowledge scores among exposed farmers than among those not exposed. These results indicate that over the period monitored, the routes (i.e. school children, village elders, animal health centres and Agrovet shops) and media (posters and leaflets) selected were effective in promoting a significant increase in knowledge of trypanosomiasis, its causes and ways of dealing with it among livestock keepers.

We undertook a study to evaluate the ability of three in vitro assay systems to define drug sensitivity of clinical isolates of the human hookworm parasite Necator americanus recovered from children resident in a village in Madang Province, Papua New Guinea. The assays entailed observation of drug effects on egg hatch (EHA), larval development (LDA), and motility of infective stage larvae (LMA). The egg hatch assay proved the best method for assessing the response to benzimidazole anthelmintics, while the larval motility assay was suitable for assessing the response to ivermectin. The performance of the larval development assay was unsatisfactory on account of interference caused by contaminating bacteria. A simple protocol was developed whereby stool samples were subdivided and used for immediate egg recovery, as well as for faecal culture, in order to provide eggs and infective larvae, respectively, for use in the egg hatch assay and larval motility assay systems. While the assays proved effective in quantifying drug sensitivity in larvae of the drug-susceptible hookworms examined in this study, their ability to indicate drug resistance in larval or adult hookworms remains to be determined.

Eight heifers, four from each breed, were randomly allocated to the following four diets: napier grass alone (D1, control), napier/desmodium (D2, inter-cropped in the field), napier grass supplemented with lucerne hay (D3) and napier grass supplemented with desmodium hay (D4).

A conjoint analysis–contingent valuation was carried out on 190 households in Narok South District of Kenya to measure willingness to pay (WTP) and demand for \{CBPP\} vaccine and vaccination as well as factors affecting WTP. The mean \{WTP\} was calculated at Kenya Shillings (KSh) 212.48 (USD 3.03) for vaccination using a vaccine with the characteristics that were preferred by the farmers (preferred vaccine and vaccination) and \{KSh\} −71.45 (USD −1.02) for the currently used vaccine and vaccination. The proportion of farmers willing to pay an amount greater than zero was 66.7% and 34.4% for the preferred and current vaccine and vaccination respectively. About one third (33.3%) of farmers would need to be compensated an average amount of \{KSh\} 1162.62 (USD 13.68) per animal to allow their cattle to be vaccinated against \{CBPP\} using the preferred vaccine and vaccination. About two-thirds (65.6%) of farmers would need to be compensated an average amount of \{KSh\} 853.72 (USD 12.20) per animal to allow their cattle to be vaccinated against \{CBPP\} using the current vaccine and vaccination. The total amount of compensation would be \{KSh\} 61.39 million (USD 0.88 million) for the preferred vaccine and vaccination and \{KSh\} 90.15 million (USD 1.29 million) for the current vaccine and vaccination. Demand curves drawn from individual \{WTP\} demonstrated that only 59% and 27% of cattle owners with a \{WTP\} greater than zero were willing to pay a benchmark cost of \{KSh\} 34.60 for the preferred and current vaccine respectively. \{WTP\} was negatively influenced by the attitude about household economic situation (p = 0.0078), presence of cross breeds in the herd (p &lt; 0.0001) and years since \{CBPP\} had been experienced in the herd (p = 0.0375). It was positively influenced by education (p = 0.0251) and the practice of treating against \{CBPP\} (p = 0.0432). The benefit cost ratio (BCR) for \{CBPP\} vaccination was 2.9–6.1 depending on the vaccination programme. In conclusion, although a proportion of farmers was willing to pay, participation levels may be lower than those required to interrupt transmission of CBPP. Households with characteristics that influence \{WTP\} negatively need persuasion to participate in \{CBPP\} vaccination. It is economically worthwhile to vaccinate against CBPP. A benefit cost analysis (BCA) using aggregated \{WTP\} as benefits can be used as an alternative method to the traditional \{BCA\} which uses avoided production losses (new revenue) and costs saved as benefits.

Participatory data collection involving 52 focus group discussions in 37 village clusters and key informant interviews, a cross-sectional study involving 232 households and a post-vaccination follow up involving 203 households was carried out in 2006–2007 in Narok South district of Kenya. This was to investigate knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and practices (KAPP) associated with control of \{CBPP\} as well as the adverse post-vaccination reactions in animals in order to advice the control policy. The community perceived trans-boundary \{CBPP\} threat to their cattle. They had traditional disease coping mechanisms and were conversant with \{CBPP\} prevention and control with 49.8% (95%CI: 42.8–56.7%) giving priority to \{CBPP\} control. However, 12.9% (95%CI: 9.0–18.1%) of pastoralists had no knowledge of any prevention method and 10.0% (95%CI: 6.5–14.7%) would not know what to do or would do nothing in the event of an outbreak. Although 43.5% (95%CI: 37.1–50.2%) of pastoralists were treating \{CBPP\} cases with antimicrobials, 62.5% (95%CI: 52.1–71.7%) of them doubted the effectiveness of the treatments. Pastoralists perceived vaccination to be the solution to \{CBPP\} but vaccination was irregular due to unavailability of the vaccine. Vaccination was mainly to control outbreaks rather than preventive and exhibited adverse post-vaccination reactions among 70.4% (95%CI: 63.6–76.5%) of herds and 3.8% (95%CI: 3.5–4.2%) of animals. Consequently, nearly 25.2% (95%CI: 18.5–33.2%) of pastoralists may resist subsequent vaccinations against CBPP. Pastoralists preferred \{CBPP\} vaccination at certain times of the year and that it is combined with other vaccinations. In conclusion, pastoralists were not fully aware of the preventive measures and interventions and post-vaccination reactions may discourage subsequent \{CBPP\} vaccinations. Consequently there is need for monitoring and management of post vaccination reactions and awareness creation on \{CBPP\} prevention and interventions and their merits and demerits. \{CBPP\} vaccine was largely unavailable to the pastoralists and the preference of the pastoralists was for vaccination at specified times and vaccine combinations which makes it necessary to avail the vaccine in conformity with the pastoralists preferences. In addition, planning vaccinations should involve pastoralists and neighbouring countries. As the results cannot be generalized, further studies on \{CBPP\} control methods and their effectiveness are recommended. "

A conjoint analysis and ordered probit regression models were used to measure the preferences of farmers for \{CBPP\} vaccine and vaccination attributes. This was with regard to inclusion or not of an indicator in the vaccine, vaccine safety, vaccine stability as well as frequency of vaccination, vaccine administration and the nature of vaccination. The analysis was carried out in 190 households in Narok District of Kenya between October and December 2006 using structured questionnaires, 16 attribute profiles and a five-point Likert scale. The factors affecting attribute valuation were shown through a two-way location interaction model. The study also demonstrated the relative importance (RI) of attributes and the compensation value of attribute levels. The attribute coefficient estimates showed that farmers prefer a vaccine that has an indicator, is 100% safe and is administered by the government (p &lt; 0.0001). The preferences for the vaccine attributes were consistent with expectations. Preferences for stability, frequency of vaccination and nature of vaccination differed amongst farmers (p &gt; 0.05). While inclusion of an indicator in the vaccine was the most important attribute (RI = 43.6%), price was the least important (RI = 0.5%). Of the 22 household factors considered, 15 affected attribute valuation. The compensation values for a change from non inclusion to inclusion of an indicator, 95–100% safety, 2 h to greater than 2 h stability and from compulsory to elective vaccination were positive while those for a change from annual to biannual vaccination and from government to private administration were negative. The study concluded that the farmers in Narok District had preferences for specific vaccine and vaccination attributes. These preferences were conditioned by various household characteristics and disease risk factors. On average the farmers would need to be compensated or persuaded to accept biannual and private vaccination against CBPP. There is need for consideration of farmer preferences for vaccine attribute levels during vaccine formulations and farmer preferences for vaccination attribute levels when designing delivery of vaccines.

Several genes code for previously characterized tick proteins such as receptors for myokinin or ecdysteroid and an immunosuppressive protein. cDNAs coding for homologs of heme-lipoproteins which are major components of tick hemolymph were identified by searching the database with published N-terminal peptide sequence data derived from biochemically purified Boophilus microplus proteins.

The chemical composition of the feed was analysed, and maize stover degradation, rumen kinetics, passage rate were measured and enumeration of microbial population in the rumen was done. L. diversifolia had the highest content of nitrogen (33.4 g/kg dry matter (DM)) while L. purpureus had the lowest one with 31.0 g/kg DM. V. amygdalina and C. calothyrsus had a low palatability and were eaten at levels largely varying among sheep and days; these two supplements were excluded from further analysis. The apparent digestibility of nitrogen for the diets supplemented with L. diversifolia was 0.338 and expressed a tendency (P=0.06) to be lower compared to 0.583 and 0.546 found with the C. palmensis and the L. purpureus diet, respectively. The apparent neutral detergent fibre-bound nitrogen (NDF-N) digestibility of L. diversifolia was negative (−1.19) and lower (P&lt;0.01) compared to that of the other two supplements. L. diversifolia was also found to have a lower (P&lt;0.05) urinary nitrogen (N) output compared to C. palmensis. With L. diversifolia, the urinary N loss was lowest (P&lt;0.05), but due to higher faecal N losses, body nitrogen retention even tended to be lowest with 1.7 g per day compared to 2.8 and 3.3 g per day found with the use of C. palmensis and L. purpureus, respectively. There was no significant difference between the three supplements on the potential or effective degradability of maize stover in the rumen (assuming a constant rumen outflow rate), neither was there any difference among supplements in the counts of total bacteria or protozoa in rumen fluid. The study suggests that the nutritive value of the five supplements investigated can be ranked as L. purpureus, C. palmensis, L. diversifolia, C. calothyrsus and V. amygdalina. "

Additional data were collected in a follow-up survey of 50 households sub-sampled from the main survey sample. Cattle-keeping households were 987, of which 62% kept Friesian (FR) and Ayrshire (AY), 22% kept East African Zebu, Boran and Sahiwal (ZB) cattle and 16% kept Guernsey and Jersey (GJ) breeds. Farmers keeping \{ZB\} and \{GJ\} ranked producing milk for family consumption the most important reason for keeping cattle, whereas those keeping \{FR\} and \{AY\} ranked producing milk for cash income most highly. Farmers’ relative preference for GJ, \{AY\} and \{FR\} for high milk yield over hardiness was respectively 3.46, 7.58 and 17.63 times more when compared with preference for ZB. Additional attributes rated highly in the Bos taurus breeds were high butterfat yields, heavier bodyweight, unselective feeding behaviour in zero-grazing systems, hardiness and disease resistance in semi-zero- and free-grazing systems and high market value. Breeding practices tended to favour the use of dairy breeds of larger body size, particularly Friesian, which is inconsistent with technical recommendations that favour the use of the smaller dairy cattle breeds. These findings suggest that multiple objectives, including the need for more milk, adaptability to local feed conditions and diseases, and the provision of non-market production such as manure, insurance and financing roles of cattle, underlie smallholders’ breeding decisions in the Kenya highlands.

The free-, semi-zero- and zero-grazing systems practised represented increasing levels of intensification of the farms. Additional data were collected in a follow-up survey of 50 households from the main survey sample. In the main survey there were 987 cattle-keeping households, of which 44, 33 and 23% practised zero-, semi-zero- and free-grazing systems, respectively. Compared to free-grazing, zero-grazing farms had a higher proportion of cows in the herd (0.62 vs. 0.51) but lower calving rates (0.52 vs. 0.69), higher losses of potential heifer replacements (0.47 vs. 0.38), fewer heifer replacements as a proportion of cows disposed (0.46 vs. 1.11) and shorter productive life (3.8 vs. 4.8 years). Semi-zero-grazing farms had intermediate performance. They and the zero-grazing farms were unable to maintain their herds without acquiring replacements externally. Animal class mortality rates were high (7–19%) regardless of grazing system practised. Diseases accounted for the largest proportion of animal exits: 85% of heifer-calves, 38% of heifers and 36% of cows. According to farmers’ ranking, East Coast fever and Anaplasmosis diseases assumed less importance with a shift from free-grazing to zero-grazing system. A household’s needs for cash was the second most frequent reason after disease for animal exits: 33% of heifers and 27% of cows, indicating the importance of cattle as liquid capital assets. The results showed that many zero-grazed herds required external sources of replacement animals to sustain their populations. Solutions to this constraint will include technical and institutional innovations to serve small-scale farms that may result in greater complementarities between the small- and large-scale production components of the dairy sub-sector.

Long-term studies regarding the effects of feeding S. sesban on reproductive performance of sheep particularly in both sexes are scanty. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of S. sesban on feed intake, post-weaning growth rate, and onset of puberty of male and female lambs. Sixty weaned female and 60 male Ethiopian highland sheep in weight and age ranging between 7.2 and 11.8 kg and 4 and 5 months respectively were evaluated for a period of 9 months supplemented with three levels of S. sesban (0, 47.5 and 95% of supplementary protein provided by S. sesban and the rest being provided by a mix of concentrates). Between sex groups male sheep, and among treatments animals fed with 47.5 and 95% Sesbania in the supplement had significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher basal feed, supplement, and total feed intake than those supplemented with concentrate alone. Supplementation with Sesbania resulted in significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher DM, \{OM\} and N digestibility than supplementation with sole concentrates. Supplementation with 95% Sesbania elicited higher daily weight gain than supplementation with 47.5% Sesbania and sole concentrates over the growth period. The onset of puberty was at 265 (± 36) and 342 (± 45) days of age and puberty weight was 15.2 and 14.6 kg for ram and ewe-lambs respectively. Ram-lambs fed with 47.5% and 95% Sesbania in the supplement reached puberty by 34 and 21 days earlier and were 1.4 kg heavier (P &lt; 0.05) than those fed concentrates. Ewe-lambs supplemented with 47.5 and 95% Sesbania were faster (P &lt; 0.05) to attain puberty by 43 and 37 days than those supplemented with sole concentrates. The average scrotum circumference gain (SCF) until the onset of puberty was 0.5 (± 0.1) mm− d. Supplementation with Sesbania improved \{SCF\} gain but was not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05) among treatments. Mean \{P4\} (progesterone) concentrations during the first behavioural oestrus ranged from non-detectable levels to a peak of 4.32 ng/ml at mid-cycle without significant difference (P &gt; 0.05) among treatments. Therefore, it can be concluded that inclusion of S. sesban as a supplement up to 30% of the ration improved feed intake, growth rate, onset of puberty and sexual development of male and female sheep without adverse effects.

The experiment was done with animals that had been fed for 16 months on a basal diet of teff straw supplemented with concentrates alone (0% S. sesban) or 95% of supplementary protein provided by S. sesban (accession 15019). Thirty lactating ewes and their single lambs of Ethiopian highland Menz sheep were used in this study. The post partum weight of ewes and birth weight of their lambs ranged between 16–22 kg and 1.3–2.4 kg. The ewes continued to be fed a teff straw basal diet and supplemented with two levels of S. sesban (0, and 95% of supplementary protein provided by S. sesban and the rest being provided by concentrates) for 3 months. Three weeks after birth lambs were offered a succulent green grass–legume mixture ad libitum. Dry matter and organic matter intake of basal feed and total feed, live weight at weaning and post partum daily body weight gain of ewes were not significantly different (P &gt; 0.05) between treatments. The milk yield of ewes was significantly affected (P &lt; 0.05) by dietary treatments. Ewes supplemented with S. sesban showed a 13% increase in milk production over ewes supplemented with concentrates. The peak lactation for ewes supplemented with S. sesban was higher and persisted longer than for ewes supplemented with concentrates. Lambs born from ewes supplemented with S. sesban had a significantly higher pre-weaning growth rate and were heavier at weaning (P &lt; 0.05) than lambs born from ewes supplemented with concentrates.

This paper introduces a process-based model that estimates \{NH3\} emission reduction factors for a dairy cattle barn featuring single or multiple management-based \{NH3\} emission mitigation techniques, as compared to another barn, to which no mitigation measure is applied. The model accounts for the following emission mitigation measures: (a) floor scraping, (b) floor type, (c) floor flushing with water and (d) indoor acidification of manure. Model sensitivity analysis indicated that manure acidification was the most efficient \{NH3\} emission reduction technique. A fair agreement was observed between reduction factors from the model and empirical estimates found in the literature. We propose a list of combinations of techniques that achieve the largest reductions. In order of efficiency, they are: (a) floor scraping combined with manure acidification (reduction efficiency 44–49%); (b) solid floor combined with scraping and flushing (reduction efficiency 21–27%); (c) floor scraping combined with flushing and (d) floor scraping alone (reduction efficiency 17–22%). The model is currently being used to advise the Flemish Government (Belgium), on the performance of certain \{NH3\} emission reduction systems for dairy barns in Flanders. "

In an endemically stable state, animals become infected by vaccination or natural challenge at an early age, following which the immunity so created is boosted by continuing tick challenge. In this study, growth rates, health and hematological parameters were monitored at regular intervals for lambs born to two matched groups of ewes until weaning at 4 mo of age. One group of ewes was infected multiple times with Cowdria ruminantium; the other group remained uninfected. The overall mean leucocyte count of lambs born to infected ewes was significantly lower than that of lambs born to uninfected ewes (P=0.04). However, there were few other significant differences in the other hematological data between the two groups. The mean birth weight of single lambs born to uninfected ewes (4.6 kg) was significantly higher than the mean birth weight of single lambs born to infected ewes (4.4 kg) (P=0.02). Trends in milk consumption and growth rates were similar for the two groups, with few significant differences detected. Likewise, there were no significant differences in the incidences of health problems or pre-weaning mortalities between the two groups of lambs. The results of this study indicate that there is no detectable effect on productivity of pre-weaning lambs when their dams are carriers of C. ruminantium – a situation likely to occur in an endemically stable state. Hence, maintenance of endemic stability would be a suitable control option for heartwater. "

The performance model estimated daily feed intake, milk yield and body weight change of dairy cows on the basis of availability and quality of feed and potential milk yield. A set of cow-states was defined by lactation number (1 to 12), calving interval (11 to 16 months), potential milk yield (15 levels) and stage of lactation (months 1 to 16). Actual performance was obtained taking into account potential performance, feed properties, and feed intake constraints. Biological and economical parameters used in the model represented actual production circumstances in Costa Rican herds. Eight feeding strategies combining two forages and four concentrate allocation systems were simulated. Different feeding strategies resulted in maximal changes of 6.8 mo. in optimal average herd-life, US$26.1 in monthly income per cow and 1.9% in replacement rates, while average calving interval was not affected. The main difference was found between feeding strategies based on flat ratios of concentrate compared with feeding strategies based on daily milk yield. Feeding flat ratios of concentrate altered the course of profitability due to restriction of the variation in feeding costs between cows and its effect on animal performance. Average herd-life and monthly income under the optimal feeding strategy were highly sensitive to changes in milk price, but less sensitive to changes in price of concentrates or price of forage. Calving interval was not sensitive to any of the factors. Comparison of optimal policies with actual parameters obtained from field data indicated that cows are being culled close to the optimal herd-life with calving intervals longer than optimal. The model is an efficient tool to study interactions between nutrition, reproduction and breeding at the animal and herd level. "

Forty-eight indigenous male goats were infected naturally by grazing them on Haemonchus contortus-infected pasture. When the faecal egg count (FEC) in the goats was 3179 ± 540 eggs per gram of faeces (mean ± standard error), half the animals were treated with 4 g \{COWP\} (day 0; mean live weight = 25.5 ± 0.8 kg). Eight treated (COWP) and eight non-treated (CONTROL) goats were removed from the pasture on each of days 7, 28 and 56, maintained for 27 or 29 days in concrete pens and then humanely slaughtered for nematode recovery. Mean liver copper levels were in the high range in the goats removed from pasture at day 7 (treated: 191 ± 19.7 ppm; untreated: 120 ± 19.7 ppm; P = 0.022), but had dropped to normal levels at days 28 and 56.

No differences in live weight between groups were considered to be of any practical significance. The study indicated that persistence of efficacy of \{COWP\} is limited in goats, extending at most to 28 days after treatment.

These animals made up an “established” infection group (ESTGRP). At the start of week 7, six goats were each given a 2-g \{COWP\} bolus orally; six goats received a 4-g \{COWP\} bolus each and six animals were not treated.

However, in the \{DEVGRP\} goats, both the 2-g and 4-g \{COWP\} treatments were ineffective in reducing the worm burdens relative to the controls (mean burdens ± SD: 1102 ± 841, 649 ± 855, 1051 ± 661 worms, P = 0.16). Mean liver copper levels did not differ between the \{ESTGRP\} goats treated with 2-g COWP, 4-g \{COWP\} or no \{COWP\} (mean ± standard error of the mean, SEM, in ppm: 93.7 ± 8.3; 101.5 ± 8.3; 71.8 ± 8.3, P = 0.07) nor did they differ between the \{DEVGRP\} goats (mean ± SEM, in ppm: 74.1 ± 9.1; 75.4 ± 9.1; 74.9 ± 10.0, P &gt; 0.99). The copper values were considered adequate, but not high, for goats. The \{COWP\} boluses have the potential to be used in the place of conventional anthelmintics for the control of established H. contortus infections in indigenous South African goats, but their use as part of an integrated approach to control H. contortus in the field must be fully investigated.

In this study we used two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblot with sera from MmmSC-infected animals and MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry to identify novel immunogenic proteins as candidate molecules for improved diagnostics and vaccines. We identified 24 immunogens recognized by pooled sera from experimentally infected cattle. Furthermore, a serum from an animal with acute clinical disease as well as severe pathomorphological lesions recognized 13 additional immunogens indicating variation in the antibody responses to \{CBPP\} amongst cattle. Most immunogens showed compelling similarity to protein/gene sequences in the two ruminant pathogens M. capricolum subsp. capricolum and M. mycoides subsp. mycoides large colony type both belonging to the mycoides cluster. Three of these proteins, namely glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase, adenylosuccinate synthase, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, had no compelling homologue in the other distantly related bovine pathogen M. agalactiae. In addition, translation elongation factor Tu, heat shock protein 70, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and FKBP-type peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, which have been found to mediate adhesion to host tissue in other mycoplasmas were shown to be expressed and recognized by sera.

When transmitted to cattle, T. parva causes the often fatal disease East Coast fever. Here, we used insect cell-expressed recombinant versions of the R. appendiculatus homologs of Bm86, named Ra86, to vaccinate cattle. We measured multiple fitness characteristics for ticks that were fed on cattle Ra86-vaccinated or unvaccinated. The Ra86 vaccination of cattle significantly decreased the molting success of nymphal ticks to the adult stage. Modeling simulations based on our empirical data suggest that repeated vaccinations using Ra86 could reduce tick populations over successive generations. Vaccination with Ra86 could thus form a component of integrated control strategies for R. appendiculatus leading to a reduction in use of environmentally damaging acaricides. "

There was a marked increase in the representation of CD8+ T cells and the emergence of a sizable sub-population of CD2− CD8+ α/β T cells during this period. Analysis of T cell receptor β chain variable (TCR BV) gene expression did not reveal any evidence for the involvement of a superantigen in stimulating the response. Responding lymph node cells were found to produce increased quantities of IFNγ and IL-10, and both the CD2+ CD8+ and CD2− CD8+ populations expressed IFNγ transcripts. Purified CD2+ CD8+ cells proliferated when stimulated in vitro with autologous parasitised cells or non-specific mitogens, whereas CD2− CD8+ cells were refractory to these stimuli. In contrast to the parasite-specific cytotoxic activity associated with T cell responses in immune cattle, the responses to primary infection exhibited variable levels of non-specific cytotoxic activity. Stimulation of purified CD2+ CD8+ T cells in vitro with autologous parasitised cells also failed to reveal evidence of specific cytotoxic activity.

Due to incomplete cross-protection between different parasite isolates, a mixture of three isolates, termed the Muguga cocktail, is used for vaccination. While vaccination of cattle in some regions provides high levels of protection, some animals are not protected against challenge with buffalo-derived T. parva. Knowledge of the genetic composition of the Muguga cocktail vaccine is required to understand how vaccination is able to protect against field challenge and to identify the potential limitations of the vaccine. The aim of the current study was to determine the extent of genetic and antigenic diversity within the parasite isolates that constitute the Muguga cocktail. High throughput multi-locus sequencing of antigen-encoding loci was performed in parallel with typing using a panel of micro- and mini-satellite loci. The former focused on genes encoding CD8+ T cell antigens, believed to be relevant to protective immunity. The results demonstrate that each of the three component stocks of the cocktail contains limited parasite genotypic diversity, with single alleles detected at many gene/satellite loci and, moreover, that two of the components show a very high level of similarity. Thus, the vaccine incorporates very little of the genetic and antigenic diversity observed in field populations of T. parva. The presence of alleles at low frequency (&lt;10%) within vaccine component populations also points to the possibility of variability in the content of vaccine doses and the potential for loss of allelic diversity during tick passage. The results demonstrate that there is scope to modify the content of the vaccine in order to enhance its diversity and thus its potential for providing broad protection. The ability to accurately quantify genetic diversity in vaccine component stocks will facilitate improved quality control procedures designed to ensure the long-term efficacy of the vaccine. "

Moreover, the presence of all identified proteins in other ruminant Mycoplasma pathogens were investigated. Two proteins of the core proteome were identified only in other cattle pathogens of the genus Mycoplasma pointing towards a role in host–pathogen interactions. The data generated will facilitate the identification and prioritization of candidate Mycoplasma antigens for improved control measures, as it is likely that surface-exposed membrane proteins will include those that are involved in host–pathogen interactions.

One monoclonal antibody reacted with all A. marginale isolates but not A. centrale and may be species-specific. A second panel of seven antibodies detected epitopes common to all isolates and both species. These common epitopes were present on two major Anaplasma surface proteins of Mr 36,000 and Mr 105,000. Monoclonal antibodies capable of neutralizing heterologous A. marginale isolate infectivity recognized 100% of the organisms in each isolate including A. centrale. In addition, immune sera from cattle recovered from infection with each of the isolates contained high titer antibodies to the isolated surface proteins bearing the common epitopes.

These approaches are briefly reviewed and their specific features described; simulations further demonstrate that the different techniques lead to virtually the same estimates for the heterogeneity parameter. An important issue is the relationship between the size of a multicenter trial, in terms of number of centers and number of patients per center, and the bias and the spread of estimates of the heterogeneity parameter around its true value. Based on simulation results (restricted to constant hazard rate and the gamma frailty density), it becomes clear how the number of centers and the number of patients per center influence the quality of the estimates in the particular setting of breast cancer clinical trials. This insight is important in treatment outcome research, where one tries to relate differences with respect to clinical practice to differences in outcome in the various centers. "

However, there are very limited data available on the farmed tilapia value chain. The aim of this study therefore was to characterise production, marketing and consumption patterns of farmed tilapia in the Nile Delta of Egypt. A cross sectional study was conducted to collect data from tilapia producers (100), transporters (32), retailers (100), fish fry shops (20) and households (300) in three case study communities (fish producing, peri-urban and rural community). We conducted structured questionnaire interviews and participatory assessments for producers and consumers. Focus group discussions with mothers were also held to collect data for the availability, sources and consumption patterns of tilapia. Results showed that, more than half of producers were small scale, having a farm size of 10 feddan or less (1 feddan = 4200 m2). The main water supply for almost all farms was agricultural drain water, a potential source of contamination with chemical and biological hazards. The main production constraints were reported to be feed prices, water quality and availability, land rent, fuel and energy sources and environmental conditions. The farmed tilapia value chain was short with some value added in the form of marketing fresh and live fish as well as selling tilapia in fried or grilled form. The majority of produced tilapia was transported to retail sale and sold to consumers as fresh, while only a small proportion was processed by cleaning, grilling or frying. A lack of hygiene during transportation and marketing of farmed tilapia was found that could be potential sources for post-harvesting contamination. The availability and frequency of tilapia consumption were higher in the community in the production areas than in other communities. In non-producing areas, tilapia may be available in the market once a week during the village market day. Potential areas for further research in order to improve safety, quality and production of farmed tilapia were identified. "

Two color flow cytometric analyses in the present study demonstrated the mAbs formed three groups; group 1, a set of mAbs that recognize TcR1 determinants expressed on all γδ T cells and groups 2 and 3, sets of mAbs that recognize TcR1 determinants on some γδ T cells: TcR1-N6 and TcR1-N7 respectively. mAbs from the latter groups define families of TcR1 molecules that express either one or both of the determinants.

We observed genetic variation for P uptake and utilization in both seedling and mature plants. P utilization efficiency increased under \{LP\} conditions. Total P uptake was more important for grain production than P utilization under \{LP\} field conditions (r = 0.57*** vs r = 0.30***). The estimated response to indirect selection was positive for most of the measured morphological and P-efficiency parameters. We conclude that both seedling and mature plant traits are potentially useful as secondary traits in selection of pearl millet for low-P adaptation. These results should be validated using heterozygous pearl millet genetic materials. Ultimately, pearl millet breeding activities for low P tolerance in \{WA\} should be integrated with other system-oriented research such as nutrient cycling, intercropping or rotations with legumes, better crop-tree-livestock integration, and modest applications of locally available rock phosphate.

However, many small-scale \{UPA\} systems are characterised by excessive nutrient inputs to the livestock unit and poor handling of manure. To assess the impact of improved feeding and manure management on nutrient use efficiency within the cattle unit, simulation modelling was used to compare three typical \{UPA\} farm types in Niamey, Niger, that comprised: animal husbandry alone (AH), animal husbandry plus gardening (AH+G), and animal husbandry plus gardening plus millet cultivation (AH+G+M). Improved feeding increased annual body weight gain and milk offtake from cattle and reduced the amount of nitrogen (N) excreted in urine, thereby lowering the risk of N emissions. With improved manure management, dry matter (DM) and nutrients recycled per animal and year, and potentially available for cropping, ranged from 321–690 kg DM, 8–22 kg N, 1.2–2.5 kg phosphorus (P), and 3.0–5.6 kg potassium (K) in \{AH\} as well as AH+G+M farms compared to 221–479 kg DM, 5.0–14.0 kg N, 0.7–1.6 kg P, and 2.0–4.0 kg K in AH+G farms. These amounts were up to 2.2-, 2.5-, 1.9- and 1-fold higher than the quantities of DM, N, P and K recycled under current practices. Feeding dairy cattle according to their requirements will enhance milk and meat production; if coupled with regular manure collection and low-cost covering of manure heaps, substantial amounts of nutrients are recycled to cropland and vegetable gardens and environmental pollution is reduced.

Forty one body measurements each were taken from 15 bulls and 35 cows and phenotypic characteristics were described in detail. In the first experiment 12 groups of 6 to 8 cattle keepers were invited to rank several groups of 4–5 animals according to their preference for a breeding bull or cow based on phenotype alone. In the second experiment the ranking was based on phenotype and a hypothetical life history that was randomly assigned to each animal on each day of experiment. The history included milk yield (on own performance for cows and that of the dam for bulls), fertility of the animal and its sire as well as events of East Coast Fever. For analysis, Generalized Multinomial Logit Models were fitted. To compare different models the likelihood-based pseudo R square measure was used. The results indicate that, in the selection of cows, performance and fitness traits are emphasized by the cattle keepers while in the selection of bulls, the phenotypic appearance of the animal plays an important role. Individual fertility followed by milk performance are the main criteria for selecting cows, resistance to East Coast Fever was of highest importance in bulls. In both sexes a dark red coat colour was highly rated. The study indicates that the methodology of preference ranking combining phenotype and a hypothetical life history may provide insight into indigenous selection criteria of stock owners elsewhere. "

It has been proposed that, during switching, the variable antigen type (VAT) being inactivated can influence which \{VAT\} is subsequently activated. Antigenic variation proceeds by the differential activation of members of the large archive of distinct variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes. The most popular model for ordered expression of \{VATs\} invokes differential activation probabilities for individual \{VSG\} genes, dictated in part by which of the four types of genetic locus they occupy. We have shown, in pilot experiments in cattle, correlation between the timing of appearance of VSG-specific mRNA and of lytic antibodies corresponding to seven \{VSGs\} encoded by single-copy genes. We have then determined the times of appearance of VAT-specific antibodies, as a measure of appearance of the VATs, in a statistically significant number of mouse infections (n=22). There is a surprisingly high degree of order in temporal appearance of the VATs, indicating that antigenic variation proceeds through order in the probability of activation of each VAT. In addition, for the few examples of each available, the locus type inhabited by the silent ‘donor’ \{VSG\} plays a significant role in determination of order. We have analysed in detail previously published data on \{VATs\} appearing in first relapse peaks, and find that the variant being switched off does not influence which one is being switched on. This differs from what has been reported for Plasmodium falciparum var antigenic variation. All these features of trypanosome antigenic variation can be explained by a one-step model in which, following an initial deactivation event, the switch process and the imposition of order early in infection arise from the inherent activation probabilities of the specific \{VSG\} being switched on.

Soil attributes were collected from three soil depths (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm and 20–30 cm) and both aboveground and belowground carbon were estimated in all treatments. Belowground carbon stocks were higher than the aboveground carbon stocks in all management systems in Borana rangelands.

Therefore, rangelands enclosed for more than 20 years for dry season grazing and rangelands managed by prescribed fire had good carbon sequestration potentials both in the soils and aboveground vegetation.

More than 600 chickens (n=150 and n=120 from each breed during growing and laying period respectively) arranged in completely randomized design were followed on-station, and 270 (90 from commercial, crossbred and improved during laying period) were evaluated on-farm in Ada (n=6 farms) and Horro (n=9 farms) districts in a split-plot design. Body weight, cumulative feed intake, and survival were recorded while feed conversion ratio was calculated at week 8, 12, 16 and 20 during the growing period on-station. Age at first egg and total egg number during lifetime were recorded once. Survival and hen housed egg production were recorded at month 3, 6, 9 and 12 of age both on-station and on-farm. Egg weight, and feed per egg were recorded and used to calculate feed conversion ratio during the laying period on-station.

Serological analysis revealed 31 different serotypes, 10 of which occurred among both clinical and cockle samples. The clinical isolates commonly included the pandemic serogroup O3:K6, while a few of the cockle isolates exhibited likely pandemic serovariants such as O3:KUT and O4:KUT, but not O3:K6. The pandemic (orf8 gene-positive) strains were more frequently found among clinical isolates (78.4%) than cockle isolates (28.4%) (p &lt; 0.001). Likewise, the virulence and related marker genes were more commonly detected among clinical than cockle isolates; i.e., tdh gene (93.2% versus 29.7%), vcrD2 (97.3% versus 23.0%), vopB2 (89.2% versus 13.5%), vopT (98.6% versus 36.5%) (all p &lt; 0.001) and trh (10.8% versus 1.4%) (p &lt; 0.05).

Here we assessed and compared the environmental impacts of extensive and intensive beef production systems in northeastern Thailand, using life cycle assessment (LCA). The extensive system was based on grazing and forage from grassland, and the intensive system houses cattle in the fattening phase and uses purchased concentrate feed as well as home-grown forage. An \{LCA\} model was developed based on data collected by site investigations of beef farms as well as literature and \{LCA\} databases. The processes associated with the beef-farming life cycle, i.e., animal management including biological activities of the cattle, grassland management, purchased feed production, and waste treatment were included within the \{LCA\} system boundary. The functional unit was defined as 1 kg of liveweight of marketed beef cattle. The environmental impacts of the extensive and intensive beef production systems were 14.0 and 10.6 kg \{CO2\} equivalents for climate change, 3.5 and 11.3 MJ for energy consumption, 47.4 and 61.8 g \{SO2\} equivalents for acidification, and 30.4 and 33.9 g \{PO\} 4 3 − equivalents for eutrophication, respectively. These impacts except for eutrophication were significantly different (P &lt; 0.05) between the two systems. The enteric \{CH4\} emissions were the largest sources for climate change, and the manure-related emissions were the largest sources for acidification and eutrophication. In the intensive system, the purchased feed contributed a great deal to energy consumption and to some extent to other impact categories. Our results suggested that the ongoing intensification of beef production in Thailand reduces \{GHG\} emissions while increasing impacts on energy consumption and acidification. These results provide helpful information to develop a strategy to balance the increasing productivity with the environmental sustainability of beef production in developing countries. "

Rural households depend on farming for at least part of their livelihood, and poverty rates are among the highest in Kenya. Land is often depleted of nutrients, and for most farmers, access to inputs and markets is poor. There is a need to identify options that are manageable within the context of the farmer’s resource base and the household’s objectives that could improve farm household well-being. In this study we integrated qualitative informal participatory approaches with quantitative mathematical programming and biophysical simulation modelling. Households in four sub-locations in Vihiga District were clustered and pilot cases identified. Meetings were held with farmers to elicit their perceptions of what their ideal farm would look like, and how its performance might compare with their own farm’s performance. With farmers’ help, a range of scenarios was analysed, relating to changes in current enterprise mixes, changes in current farm sizes, and changes in prices of staples foods and cash crops. A considerable mismatch was found between farmers’ estimates of their own farm’s performance, and what was actually produced. There seems to be a threshold in farm size of 0.4 ha, below which it is very difficult for households to satisfy their income and food security objectives. Even for larger farms whose households are largely dependent on agriculture, the importance of a cash crop in the system is critical. There is a crucial role for extension services in making farmers aware of the potential impacts on farm revenue of modest changes in their farm management systems. We are monitoring nine households in the district, whose farmers have made some changes to their system in an attempt to increase household income and enhance food security. "

Data were analysed by multiple correspondence analysis in order to establish relationships amongst management intensity and variables related to farm structure, productive orientation and the farmers’ social conditions and information exposure to technical aspects. A cluster analysis was then carried out to identify groups of farms with similar characteristics within the sample population. The analyses demonstrated clear relationships between management intensity, the farms’ dimensions and the farmers’ social conditions and access to information.

Logistic Regression was used to study the influence of the intrinsic characteristics of the decisions and the decision-making units involved. A Multiple Correspondence Analysis was used to graphically represent the relationships between shared and delegated decisions and the actors involved. The \{CCA\} showed that the level of dedication to farming, the educational level and the size of the farm were the characteristics more strongly influencing the decision-making approaches. Monopolisation of decisions by one decision-maker was the most frequent decision-making approach in the population since half of the decisions were made by the farmer alone. However, other approaches in which other decision-making units, mostly the family, had an important role were also frequently found in the population. \{FA\} and \{CLA\} found very well defined groups of decisions in terms of decision-making units involved. The logistic regression suggested that the intrinsic characteristics of the farming decisions influenced the level of involvement of the different decision-making units. Operational decisions tended to be more delegated to farm staff and family members, while technical decisions were mostly shared mainly with technical advisors and family members.

abstract = "Abstract In Kajiado District, Kenya, ranches held communally by Maasai are being subdivided into individually owned parcels. Livestock owners know that herds on parcels that are too small cannot be viable, but the decline in the capacity of parcels to support livestock has not been quantified. We used ecosystem modeling to represent the effects of subdivision as Maasai group ranches were divided into 196, 10, 5, 3, and 1 km2 parcels. Within the spatially explicit, process-based Savanna ecosystem model, we used maps that constrained the movements of livestock to be within parcels. We also modeled cooperative grazing associations, giving groups of herders access to parcels composed of dispersed or contiguous 1 km2 parcels. Vegetatively productive areas had higher carrying capacities when isolated because resident animals did not compete with animals moving in seasonally from other areas. In a ranch of low but heterogeneous productivity, we saw a steady decline in capacity under subdivision, until 25% fewer livestock could be supported on the ranch of 1 km2 parcels relative to the intact ranch. On a ranch with both low productivity and heterogeneity, 20% fewer livestock were supported when parcels were still 10 km2. The most productive ranch studied saw small population changes with subdivision. Participation in grazing associations was helpful in the ranch intermediate in productivity and heterogeneity, but not other ranches. Subdivision of Kajiado lands might be inevitable, but our results show the relative benefits to stakeholders if land owners and policy makers act to maintain open or flexible access to individually held parcels.

Since their publication in 2005, the genomes of T. annulata and T. parva have been utilised for a diverse range of applications, ranging from candidate antigen discovery to the identification of genetic markers for population analysis. This has led to advancements in the quest for a sub-unit vaccine, while providing a greater understanding of variation among parasite populations in the field. The unique ability of these Theileria species to induce host cell transformation is the subject of considerable scientific interest and the availability of full genomic sequences has provided new insights into this area of research. This article reviews the data underlying published comparative analyses, focussing on the general features of gene expression, the major Tpr/Tar multi-copy gene family and a re-examination of the predicted macroschizont secretome. Codon usage between the Theileria species is reviewed in detail, as this underpins ongoing comparative studies investigating selection at the intra- and inter-species level. The TashAT/TpshAT family of genes, conserved between T. annulata and T. parva, encodes products targeted to the host nucleus and has been implicated in contributing to the transformed bovine phenotype. Species-specific expansion and diversification at this critical locus is discussed with reference to the availability, in the near future, of genomic datasets which are based on non-transforming Theileria species.

We detected 36 mitochondrial haplotypes with 128 polymorphic sites. Pooled with published data of South-East Asian and Australian water buffaloes and based on comprehensive median-joining network and population demography analyses we show evidence that both river and swamp buffaloes decent from one domestication event, probably in the Indian subcontinent. However, the today swamp buffaloes have an unravelled mitochondrial history, which can be explained by introgression of wild water buffalo mtDNA into domestic stocks. We are also discussing indications for an independent domestication of buffaloes in China. "

The trait is termed trypanotolerance, for which changes in packed red cell volume percent (PCV) and growth rate following infection are generally considered to be indicators. An \{F22\} population was created with the N’Dama and the Kenyan Boran (a trypanosusceptible breed). Two hundred and fourteen F2N’Dama×Boran cattle were infected by the bites of tsetse flies infected with the cloned parasite Trypanosoma congolense IL1180. Body weight, PCV, and parasite counts were recorded on a weekly basis for 150 days post infection. Seventeen derived traits were defined based on the data recorded; seven derived from bodyweight, seven from PCV, two from parasite counts recordings and survival. Average values among the \{F2\} animals were intermediate between those of N’Dama and Boran control animals for all traits. The highest and lowest responders in the \{F2\} group, when selected on maximum decrease in \{PCV\} or on maximum decrease in body weight, were equal to the averages of the Boran and N’Dama animals, respectively. The most trypanotolerant \{F2\} animals followed similar courses to N’Dama controls and the most susceptible animals followed similar courses to the Borans. There were moderate to low phenotypic correlations (0.00–0.32) between average log(parasite count) or number of times an animal was detected parasitaemic, and the \{PCV\} and body weight derived traits. There were low to moderate phenotypic correlations (0.02–0.74) between and within (0.01–0.96) \{PCV\} and body weight derived traits. Most of the traits defined in this study were heritable. Heritabilities ranged from 0.01 for \{PCV\} recovery, to 0.88, for initial PCV. Some \{F2\} animals seemed to be able to control anaemia and have a higher average body weight and body weight gain than the pure-bred N’Dama. Overall, in this study body weight change following infection seems an appropriate and easy to measure indicator of trypanotolerance. "

We determined the relative strength of immunogenicity, the discriminatory capacity between bovine positive and negative sera, and the cross-reactivity with rabbit hyperimmune sera directed against 15 different mycoplasmal species. The three best-performing antigens, a conserved hypothetical protein (MSC_0636), a glycosyl transferase (MSC_0108), and an acyl carrier protein phosphodiesterase (MSC_0029) were considered candidate diagnostic proteins. They were expressed as GST-fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, purified, and used in an \{ELISA\} as solid phase antigens. The diagnostic potential of the recombinant antigens was tested using the sera of ten experimentally infected animals and six control animals.

Our results show that while there was close genetic relatedness among parasite populations from the same geographical region, micro-heterogeneities exist between different stocks. Data are presented that indicate that not every human sleeping sickness focus may be associated with a particular human-infective trypanosome strain responsible for long-term stability of the reference focus.

An initial prevalence study was conducted to identify sites with a high risk of trypanosmosis in cattle. The trypanosome prevalence varied widely, with two sites, Kone (21.3%) and Village 1 settlement (15%) having a relatively high prevalence based on the phase-contrast buffy-coat technique (BCT). In the highest risk area, the Kone settlement, an isometamidium block treatment study was conducted from April to June 2001. A total of 300 cattle were included in this study, 100 from each of three villages (Cheleleki, Kolu and Burka). At day minus 14 of the study, all 300 cattle were treated with diminazene aceturate at 7 mg/kg body weight. Subsequently, these cattle were ear-tagged and randomly assigned into two groups, 50 controls and 50 for isometamidium treatment in each village. Fourteen days later (day 0), the 50 treatment cattle were given isometamidium chloride at 1 mg/kg body weight. Both groups of cattle were then examined for trypanosome parasites using \{BCT\} every 14 days until 84 days. The two indices used in assessing isometamidium resistance, namely the proportion of infections during an 8-week follow-up period and the ratio of mean hazards in an isometamidium treated versus untreated group, provided consistent results across the three villages. In Burka village, both indices demonstrated the presence of isometamidium resistance trypanosome infections while in Cheleleki and Kolu villages, both indices did not indicate significant levels of resistance. There were significant differences between the Kaplan–Meier survival estimates of the control and treatment groups in Cheleleki (P&lt;0.01) and Kolu (P&lt;0.05) but not in Burka (P&gt;0.05). "

OP-Tc is inhibited by alkylating agents, by serine peptidase-specific inhibitors including 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride and diispropylfluoro-phosphate and by other peptidase inhibitors including leupeptin, antipain and peptidyl chloromethyl ketones. Reducing agents such as dithiothreitol enhanced activity as did heparin, spermine and spermidine. The enzyme has trypsin-like specificity since it cleaved fluorogenic peptides that have basic amino acid residues (Arg or Lys) in the \{P1\} position. Potential substrates without a basic residue in \{P1\} were not hydrolysed. Although OP-Tc has weak arginine aminopeptidase activity, the enzyme clearly preferred substrates that had amino acids in the \{P2\} and \{P3\} positions. Overall, OP-Tc appears to be less efficient than OP-Tb because it usually displayed lower kcat/Km values for the substrates tested. However, like OP-Tb, the best substrate for OP-Tc was Cbz-Arg-Arg-AMC (Km=0.72 μM, kcat=96 s−1). OP-Tc preference for amino acids in the \{P2\} position was (Gly,Lys,Arg)&gt;Phe&gt;Leu&gt;Pro. The results also suggest that the P3-binding site has hydrophobic characteristics.

The observed choices are employed to estimate a series of random utility models whose results are first tested for preference equality between households and small farmers, then endogenous segmentation is allowed within households by means of latent class models. Stated-preference based estimates are found to be of the same magnitude as revealed-preference producers costs. As a consequence the method is deemed to be appropriate for the valuation of non-market functions in production. Estimates conditional on household characteristics are then presented and discussed.

A factor analysis was used to define new variables representing the farmers' predilection towards the InfS. A canonical correlation analysis was performed to find-out simple and canonical correlation between farmers'/farms' characteristics and the InfS preferences. Informational profiles in the population were defined through a Cluster Analysis. The \{MDPREF\} suggests that Family members and Technical advisors were the most preferred InfS. However their relative importance changed throughout the phases. Farm staff were rated in third place and their role became more important in the ‘Problem detection’ phase. Other farmers and Commercial agents were, in general, the less preferred information sources. The former became slightly more important in the ‘Seeking for new practices’ phase. The canonical correlation analysis found three low-medium correlations between the farmers'/farms' characteristics and the InfS factors. These correlations showed that the farmers' age, educational level and dedication and the farms' characteristics of area, herd size and distance to population centres had significant influence on the preference of the farmers towards different information sources. The cluster analysis found nine groups of similar farmers according to their preferences towards informational sources. Some implications mainly for extension activities are also stated and discussed. The importance of different informational sources slightly change throughout the decision-making steps, the family and farm staff being the most preferred information sources. "

In addition, sequence comparison data which clearly establish that these surface antigens are encoded by related genes are presented. The regions of SPAG-1 identified as containing cross-reactive epitopes recognized by p67 antiserum correlated to regions of high predicted homology between p67 and SPAG-1, which are located at their respective N- and C-termini. Furthermore, p67 and SPAG-1 were found to contain cross-reactive determinants responsible for neutralization of sporozoite infectivityin vitro,and at least some of these were located in the C-termini of both molecules. The relevance of these findings to the possible roles for these molecules in host cell invasion is discussed. "

The study explores — household decisions to collect gum arabic in the forest using the two stage Heckman selection model. The data for the analysis come from the 213 randomly sampled collectors from the north-eastern and western regions of Kenya. The findings show that livestock ownership, possession of skills, insecurity and price obtained from the previous season impact on decision making to collect gum arabic. Furthermore, household's age, experience in collecting gum arabic and topography increase the quantities collected while gender negatively impacts amounts of collection. The research concludes by emphasizing that collection of the non-timber forest products including gum arabic would be attractive if the returns from collection justify the risk and cost to go to the forest.

Within the Apicomplexa, Plasmodium, Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidium are parasites of considerable medical importance while Theileria and Eimeria are animal pathogens. P. falciparum is particularly important as it causes malaria, resulting in more than 1 million deaths each year. The malaria parasite actively invades the host cell in which it propagates and several proteins associated with the apical organelles have been implicated to be crucial in the invasion process. The biogenesis of the apical organelles is not well understood, but several studies indicate that microtubule-based vesicular transport is involved. Vesicular transport proteins are also present in Plasmodium and are presumed to be involved in transcellular transport in infected erythrocytes. Dynein is a multi-subunit motor protein involved in microtubule-based vesicular transport. In this study, we analyzed the cytoplasmic dynein light chains (Dlcs) of P. falciparum since they provide adaptor surface to the cargoes and are likely to be involved in differential transport. Dlcs consist of three different families: TcTex1/2, \{LC8\} and LC7/roadblock. The data presented demonstrate that P. falciparum Dlcs sequences and functional domains show high sequence similarity within the species, but that only the Dlc group 1 (LC8) has a high similarity to human orthologues. TcTex1 and LC7/roadblock have low similarity to human orthologues. This sequence variation could be targeted for vaccine or drug development. "

Information was collected on the social context, history and species of livestock kept. Constraints in livestock keeping were explored through description and probing. Proportional piling on the importance of different diseases and relative incidence scoring were also conducted. 243 sera were collected from cattle and tested for antibodies to Anaplasma marginale, Babesia bigemina, B. bovis, Theileria mutans and T. parva by ELISA. Additionally, 173 blood samples were collected for a \{PCR\} assay of T. parva. Livestock diseases were ranked as the most important constraint to livestock keeping. While East Coast fever was ranked as the most important disease in Kajo Keji, diarrhoea in small ruminants was reported as the most important disease in Yei. Serological analyses of the sera indicated that A. marginale, B. bigemina, T. mutans and T. parva were most prevalent. Prevalence of B. bovis was found to be low (4.0% and 7.4% in Kajo Keji and Yei, respectively). 35% of the samples screened with the T. parva p104 gene nested \{PCR\} assay were positive.

Two traditional long-term management systems were sampled: continuous low-input maize (Zea mays; Co), and kitchen garden (Ki) polyculture with organic inputs. Physical, biological, and chemical \{SQ\} indicators were measured. Degradation in Co followed exponential decay trends for most indicators (organic matter, active C, water-stable aggregates, available water capacity, electrical conductivity, CEC, pH, Ca, Mg and Zn), as well as for yield. Organic matter quality declined linearly, suggesting degradation will continue. For both parent materials and most indicators degradation of 25–93% below initial values resulted, but with ≤40% further drop below initial values and for more indicators under Co than Ki. P, Zn and possibly K accumulated over time under Ki. The extent of degradation was influenced by parent material. In conclusion, a basic accessible set of \{SQ\} indicators was successfully used to describe soil degradation dynamics under cultivation. Results suggest that regular organic inputs can significantly reduce degradation, especially of nutrient retention and soil structure, after forest conversion. "

All villages that reported sleeping sickness and fixed post-diagnostic sleeping sickness health units in Tororo and Busia districts were geo-referenced. The spatial distribution of early and late stage patient detection by health units was analysed using Geographical Information Systems (GIS).

Five hundred and eighty-five (44.5%) came from within a 10 km radius of the reporting health units. After multivariate analysis, the proportion of early stage patients detected was found to be significantly associated with patients originating from within a 10 km radius of the health unit (P&lt;0.01), with adults (&gt;19 years) (P&lt;0.01), and with annual parish incidence (P&lt;0.01).

Here we describe and apply such a new modelling tool, developed within the \{NUANCES\} framework (Nutrient Use in \{ANimal\} and Cropping systems: Efficiencies and Scales), called NUANCES-FARMSIM (FARM SIMulator), an integrated crop – livestock model developed to analyse African smallholder farm systems. NUANCES-FARMSIM was used to analyse a representative case study farm in the highlands of Western Kenya, a site for which each of the components of \{FARMSIM\} has been thoroughly tested. We present the results of a sensitivity analysis which showed the model to be sufficiently robust to identify key management options that explain most of the variability in farm productivity, and the long-term consequences of these options for the case study farm. The analyses showed clearly that the most important decisions are those related to the interactions between the different components of the farm and therefore justify the need of integrating crop and livestock components within one modelling tool. The allocation of limited resources across the farm, and the way organic matter is recycled or redistributed within the farm determines the long-term production capacity of the system. The results of the sensitivity analyses further showed that for the case study farm in Western Kenya a strong focus on improving the reliability of the subsystem level or process descriptions will only result in minor improvement in simulating productivity at farm level.

Here we describe the cloning of three A. caninum genes orthologous to components of the pyrantel-sensitive nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in Caenorhabditis elegans (UNC-29, -38, -63). Analysis of mRNA levels by quantitative \{PCR\} was also performed on these genes, plus an additional three nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit genes thought not to be constituents of the pyrantel-sensitive receptor, for which a partial sequence was obtained. Gene sequences and mRNA levels were compared between two isolates of A. caninum showing either high- or low-level resistance to pyrantel (as shown previously by in vivo efficacy and in vitro comparative studies). While no polymorphisms of likely significance between the two A. caninum isolates were observed, quantitative analysis of transcription revealed significantly lower levels for the three putative pyrantel receptor subunits (AAR-29, -38 and -63) in the highly pyrantel-resistant isolate compared with the isolate with low-level resistance. In contrast, transcription of the three subunits thought not to constitute the pyrantel receptor (AAR-8, -15 and -19) was either not significantly different between the two isolates, or slightly higher in the highly-resistant isolate. This data suggests that reduced transcription of the mRNA coding for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits that form the pyrantel-sensitive receptors may be a component of the pyrantel resistance mechanism in A. caninum.

A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to 80 randomly selected participants to obtain sociological information including gender, age category, education levels, and adoption of cover crops. Two binary logistic regression models were used to determine the factors affecting cover crops adoption by respondents. Results showed that 80% of the respondents had adopted cover crop technologies at Kalama compared to 57.5% at Kee. Results indicated that gender had a significant (P &lt; 0.05) effect on adoption. Men were less likely to adopt. Age category had mixed effects on cover crop adoption. At Kalama age category had a significant (P &lt; 0.05) effect on cover crops adoption however age effect was not significant at Kee. Education indicated mixed effects on cover crop adoption suggesting other factors not covered in the study were at play. Views from farmers with experience in growing cover crops revealed that, knowledge and skills, demonstration of gains and related cost had a significant (P &lt; 0.05) effect on cover crop adoption. Majority of farmers, adopters or non-adopters used seeds from market. Non-adopters in Kee (37.5%) used relief seed suggesting other factors were required to give the threshold required to influence adoption. This implies research is needed to identify factors with likelihood to reach threshold for adoption under different farming systems. The study recommends capacity building to develop cover crop knowledge and skills, demonstrate gains and related costs to improve men and women’s likelihood to adopt. In addition, the study recommends research to shed light on other factors likely to influence adoption. "

Insight into the structure and mechanism of the involved enzymes can aid in the development of potent inhibitors, leading to new curative drugs. Nucleoside hydrolases are key enzymes in the purine salvage pathway of Trypanosomatidae, and they are especially attractive because they have no equivalent in mammalian cells. We cloned, expressed and purified a nucleoside hydrolase from Trypanosoma vivax. The substrate activity profile establishes the enzyme to be a member of the inosine-adenosine-guanosine-preferring nucleoside hydrolases (IAG-NH). We solved the crystal structure of the enzyme at 1.6 Å resolution using \{MAD\} techniques. The complex of the enzyme with the substrate analogue 3-deaza-adenosine is presented. These are the first structures of an IAG-NH reported in the literature. The T. vivax IAG-NH is a homodimer, with each subunit consisting of ten β-strands, 12 α-helices and three small 310-helices. Six of the eight strands of the central β-sheet form a motif resembling the Rossmann fold. Superposition of the active sites of this IAG-NH and the inosine-uridine-preferring nucleoside hydrolase (IU-NH) of Crithidia fasciculata shows the molecular basis of the different substrate specificity distinguishing these two classes of nucleoside hydrolases. An “aromatic stacking network” in the active site of the IAG-NH, absent from the IU-NH, imposes the purine specificity. Asp10 is the proposed general base in the reaction mechanism, abstracting a proton from a nucleophilic water molecule. Asp40 (replaced by Asn39 in the IU-NH) is positioned appropriately to act as a general acid and to protonate the purine leaving group. The second general acid, needed for full enzymatic activity, is probably part of a flexible loop located in the vicinity of the active site. "

The disease is tick-transmitted and results in annual economic losses of at least $300 million per year. While this vaccine technology has been available for over 40 years, few attempts have been made to standardize the production process and characterize the vaccine. The latest batch was produced in early 2008 at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI). The vaccine production involves the use of cattle free from parasites routinely monitored throughout the production process, and a pathogen-free tick colony. This paper describes the protocol used in the recent production, and the process improvements, including improved quality control tools, that had not been employed in previous \{ITM\} productions. The paper also describes the processes involved in determining the appropriate field dose, which involved a three-step in vivo study with various dilutions of the vaccine stabilate. The vaccine was shown to be safe and viable after production, and a suitable field dose was identified as 1 ml of a 1:100 dilution. "

These relationships can be particularly complex within resource-poor, smallholder livestock systems, necessitating a rigorous informed-consent process. Little has been published on informed consent beyond human-subject research. This paper outlines two studies on informed consent, for research identifying diseases of animal and human importance, within smallholder livestock value chains. Firstly, a randomized independent-group study compared three communication tools (written, cartoons, and photographs) for informing 22 Tanzanian livestock-keepers before seeking their consent. A significant difference in comprehension and engagement in the informed-consent process was found between tools, and cartoons had the highest (i.e. best combined comprehension and engagement) scores. Most (21 out of 22) farmers answered half or more the questions correctly, but none were able to answer all questions. Comprehension testing allowed identification of common misunderstandings, such as immediate benefits the farmers would receive and the process to be used for relaying research results. Dialogue stimulated by cartoons and photographs allowed researchers to determine and respond to participants’ varied relationships with their livestock. The second study assessed preferred methods for indicating consent among informal-sector milk vendors in Nairobi, Kenya. Of consenting participants, 61% (140/230) indicated consent verbally, 39% (90/230) signed consent and none chose thumbprint. There was a significant enumerator-effect on both overall consent and the methods chosen. Several of these findings echo those published in human-medical research. Additionally, highlighted here is the importance of facilitating dialogue during the informed-consent process in One Health research, for a more nuanced understanding of relationships between humans, animals, and their environment. Also discussed is how a requirement to sign consent forms might limit consent among workers in informal markets, which are commonly studied in One Health research. We suggest expansion of these, and development of further, studies towards improving consent processes in One Health research. "

MHC-B haplotype chickens are an important genetic resource for studying the genetic determination of pathogen resistance and susceptibility. The \{BWEL\} chicken population is the only specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens bred and developed by the State Center of Poultry Genetic Resources of Laboratory Animals in China. In this study, we successfully established six homozygous MHC-B haplotype populations from the \{BWEL\} chickens using microsatellite marker technology, named as BW/G(1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7) lines, and their molecular genotypes were matched to six serologically defined MHC-B haplotypes, B13, B15, B2, B5, \{B21\} and B19, respectively. The sequences of \{BF\} genes exons 2 and 3 from four successive generations (F1–F4) of the BW/G(n) lines were completely consistent with those of serologically defined MHC-B haplotypes. Subsequently, six BW/G(n) line specific allo-antisera were prepared by immunization with red blood cells (RBCs) and hemagglutination tests results showed the BW/G(n) \{SPF\} chickens could be serologically differentiated. Additionally, susceptibility to Marek’s disease (MD) in the BW/G3 (B2 haplotype) and BW/G7 (B19 haplotype) lines were determined by comparing mortality, macroscopic and histopathological lesions, and viral loads in feather pulp. The BW/G7 line showed greater genetic susceptibility to the very virulent \{MD\} virus (MDV) strain than the BW/G3 line. The establishment of MHC-B haplotype chicken populations associated with susceptibility to \{MD\} will be helpful for studying host immune responses and further developing the more effective vaccines in the context of \{MHC\} specificities, and they are also very useful for an understanding of \{MHC\} genes architecture and function.

This is a problem when designing a water harvesting system, for instance, with micro-catchments. This paper presents a design method for micro-catchments, based on a simulation approach. Available rainfall and evaporation data are supplemented with soil physical data, determined from samples taken on the spot. A linear regression model combined with a transient one-dimensional finite difference water balance model is used to simulate the complete water harvesting process for a number of years. The theoretical basis of the model, including initial and boundary conditions is discussed. Experimental data from the Northern Negev Desert are used to calibrate the model. The water balance is simulated for two sets of soil physical properties, and for extremely arid and arid conditions. The performance of micro-catchments with varying runoff area A and basin area B is studied. This \{AB\} ratio is a key parameter in micro-catchment design. The following conclusions are drawn: (1) extremely arid conditions (‘true desert’) are too dry for micro-catchment-water-harvesting; (2) for arid conditions with average annual rainfall of ca. 200 mm, and the trees and loess soil considered, a preliminary design would have a basin area B of ca. 40 m2 and a runoff area A of between 40 and 80 m2.

For the sandy loam soil, simulated cumulative soil evaporation and cumulative bottom flux showed large spatial variability (standard deviation of 100 to 150 mm). For the loam soil, this variability was limited (standard deviation of 4 to 16 mm). Scaled mean soil hydraulic properties could describe the water balance and depth-wise soil salinity of the loam soil accurately. Scaled mean soil hydraulic properties did not perform satisfactory for the sandy loam soil.

As crystal aggregation involves the physical adhesion of crystals, the particle size changed sensitively according to the sonication energy and agitation speed during the crystallization. In contrast, since crystal agglomeration is based on molecular growth following crystal aggregation, the agglomerates were strong enough to resist the acoustic impact of the sonication and turbulent shear of the agitation during the crystallization. Thus, the crystal aggregates in the product suspension were completely re-dispersed by an acoustic after-treatment of 30 W for 20 min. Acoustic after-treatment was also used to determine the agglomerate size and estimate the degree of aggregation of the product suspension. As a result, sonication above 60 W was found to be adequate to prevent any aggregation or agglomeration during the crystallization, regardless of the agitation conditions. "

The benefits to growing hybrid maize appear to be yield and drought tolerance. Open pollinated varieties are selected by farmers who value early maturity. Local maize varieties are popular among farm households owing to a number of favourable processing and consumption characteristics: storability, poundability, flour-to-grain ratio, and taste. Further research using nationally representative data is needed to assess whether findings for Mulanje District can be generalized to Malawi as a whole. If future studies agree with the results herein then maize breeding research programs in Malawi should consider a diversity of traits beyond grain yield to encompass the range of production, processing, and consumption attributes that are valued by farmers.

In this study, the film thickness on pharmaceutical pellets was examined for quantification using in-line \{NIR\} spectroscopy during a fluid-bed coating process. A precise monitoring of coating thickness and its prediction with a suitable control strategy is crucial to the quality assurance of solid dosage forms including dissolution characteristics. Pellets of a test formulation were manufactured and coated in a fluid-bed by spraying a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) coating solution. \{NIR\} spectra were acquired via a fiber-optic probe during the coating process, followed by multivariate analysis utilizing partial least squares (PLS) calibration models. The actual coating thickness of pellets was measured by two separate methods, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and laser diffraction particle size analysis (LD-PSA). Both characterization methods gave superb correlation results, and all determination coefficient (R2) values exceeded 0.995. In addition, a prediction coating experiment for 70 min demonstrated that the end-point can be accurately designated via \{NIR\} in-line monitoring with appropriate calibration models. In conclusion, our approach combining in-line \{NIR\} monitoring with \{CLSM\} and LD-PSA can be applied as an effective \{PAT\} tool for fluid-bed pellet coating processes. "

Each face exhibited hillocks with step sites that can be assigned to specific crystal planes, enabling direct determination of the growth rates along specific crystallographic directions. The addition of macromolecules with anionic side chains, poly-l-aspartate, poly-l-glutamate, and polyacrylate resulted in inhibition of growth on the hillock step planes. The magnitude of their effect depended on the macromolecule structures and identity of the step site. The isotropic shape of the \{COD\} hillocks mimicked the shape of the resulting macroscopic \{COD\} crystals based on step-specific binding of the macromolecules to the \{COD\} crystal, with stronger step pinning along the [0 1 0] direction than in the [0 0 1] direction. Electrostatic matching between the crystal faces and additives according to the ionic array of calcium oxalate in the \{COD\} structure was found to be responsible for the preferential binding of the macromolecules to terraces.

Observations were made in 1996 and 1997 on management by a Fulani tribal household, based on manure application through corralling and on use of fallow. Field corralling of cattle left between 1.5 and 17 Mg ha−1 of manure on limited areas of the fields. Millet grain yields were increased from 500 kg ha−1 in areas manured 6 or more years ago to 1100 kg ha−1 in recently manured areas. Drought during the growing season of 1997 limited the effects of manure application on grain and straw yields. Soil carbon and nitrogen levels were higher at depths below 0.20 m in sites where manure was applied 4–5 years ago (M4), while pH and P were higher in 0–0.10 m of the soil profile in practices where manure was applied the same year (M0). Nutrient management in 1997 could have been improved by reducing the locally very high manure rates in order to fertilize a two or three times larger area and consequently improve yields over a larger area and reduce risks of nutrient leaching and crop damage from droughts.

Annual cast deposition in undisturbed systems was significantly higher on Alfisols (49,000 kg ha−1) than on Ultisols (25,000 kg ha−1). Vegetation clearance had significant detrimental effects on earthworm activity. With an increasing length of continuous cropping, cast deposition declined. In young fallows, cast production exceeded levels attained in previously un-cropped controls on Alfisols, yet, on Ultisols, it depended on the previous \{LUS\} and length of the previous cropping phase. Recovery was highest after agrisilviculture and after clearing bush fallow. After forest clearance, burning and one year cropping, cast deposition did not recover within three years. On Alfisols, cast production was higher under planted tree fallow and natural fallow than under herbaceous fallow. On Ultisols, fallow type had no effect. Earthworm surface cast production contributes to soil quality. However, its suitability as an indicator of soil quality is limited to rough assessments as it is dependent upon earthworm species composition, vegetation management and soil type, with more drastic changes on the poorer Ultisols than the more fertile Alfisols.

However, in the stirred tank reactor, the local non-homogeneity of the mixing intensity led to the simultaneous production of cube-like and spindle-like particles at a high reactant concentration. The agglomeration of CaCO3 resulted in a bimodal size distribution. However, the morphology and size of a single particle were predominantly changed by the excess species in the solution.

However, due to multiple other uses, small landholders in these countries are faced with trade-offs in managing crop residues. This article reviews crop residue management practices, mainly surface retention, incorporation or removal, describing their advantages and limitations in cereal-based agroecosystems in developing countries. The benefits of residue retention are regionally variable and depend on both agroclimatic and socioeconomic factors. Most studies from developing countries in Asia, Latin America, and Africa show positive effects of retaining crop residues on soil quality, soil organic matter and carbon storage, soil moisture retention, enhanced nutrient cycling, and decreased soil loss, among other environmental and soil health benefits. Variation was observed in the effect of surface retention vs. incorporation on various soil properties indicating the importance of taking into account abiotic factors such as climate, soil texture, study duration, sampling methods, and agronomic practices when assessing the impact of these practices. Negative effects of residue retention on crop performance attributed to nitrogen immobilization, waterlogging and decreased soil temperature have also been reported in some environments. Residue trade-offs in mixed crop-livestock systems in developing countries can limit the amount of residue retained. However, interventions such as intensification, partial retention, improved return of nutrients from manures, and the provision of substitutes to the current functions of livestock (e.g. mechanization, insurance) could reduce these residue trade-offs in favour of promoting long-term soil health.

A field experiment was carried out to study the effect of water-repellency on water and bromide movement in a coarse-textured soil in the southwestern part of The Netherlands. The field data were analyzed using a relatively simple numerical model based on the standard Richards' equation for unsaturated water flow and the Fickian-based convection-dispersion equation for solute transport. Water-repellency was accounted for by multiplying the water content and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil with F, a factor equal to the volumetric fraction of soil occupied by preferential flow paths resulting from the unstable flow process. The good comparison of simulated and measured bromide concentrations suggests that the model provides a viable method for simulating unstable water flow in water-repellent soils. "

In experiment 1, each pooled ejaculate was divided into four equal aliquots and diluted (37 °C) with the Tris based extender, containing 0 (control), 0.5, 1 and 2 mM lycopene, at a final concentration of approximately 400 × 106 sperms/ml (single step dilution), In experiment 2, cysteamine at concentrations of 0 (control), 0.5, 1 and 2 mM, was used as an additive in the extender, and the procedure explained above was applied for the division of aliquots and the dilution of semen. Diluted semen samples were kept in glass tubes and cooled from 37° to 5 °C in a cold cabinet, and maintained at 5 °C. Sperm and oxidative stress parameters were evaluated after 0, 24, 48 and 72 h of storage at 5 °C. The extender supplemented with 0.5 mM lycopene resulted in higher mitochondrial activity rate (p &lt; 0.05) in comparison to the control group at 72 h of storage. Lycopene at 0.5 mM dose led to higher sperm motility rate (p &lt; 0.05) when compared to 2 mM lycopene group at 72 h of liquid storage. As regards oxidative stress parameters, only 2 mM lycopene increased total glutathione levels (p &lt; 0.05) at 0 h of storage.

We determined the effectiveness of Hanoi's wastewater conveyance system, placing particular emphasis on the quality of wastewater used in agriculture and aquaculture. Between April and June 2014, a total of 216 water samples were obtained from 24 sampling points and the concentrations of total coliforms (TC), Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and helminth eggs determined. Despite applied wastewater treatment, agricultural field irrigation water was heavily contaminated with \{TC\} (1.3 × 107 colony forming unit (CFU)/100 mL), E. coli (1.1 × 106 CFU/100 mL) and Salmonella spp. (108 most probable number (MPN)/100 mL). These values are 110-fold above Vietnamese discharge limits for restricted agriculture and 260-fold above the World Health Organization (WHO)'s tolerable safety limits for unrestricted agriculture. Mean helminth egg concentrations were below \{WHO\} tolerable levels in all study systems (&lt; 1 egg/L). Hence, elevated levels of bacterial contamination, but not helminth infections, pose a major health risk for farmers and consumers of wastewater fed-products.

Characterization of movement networks between pig farms and through other types of farm and household enterprises that are involved in pig value chains can provide useful information on the role that different participants in the networks play in pathogen transmission. Analysis of social networks that underpin these pig movements can reveal pathways that are important in the transmission of disease, trade in commodities, the dissemination of information and the influence of behavioural norms. We assessed pig movements among pig keeping households within West Kenya and East Uganda and across the shared Kenya–Uganda border in the study region, to gain insight into within-country and trans-boundary pig movements. Villages were sampled using a randomized cluster design. Data were collected through interviews in 2012 and 2013 from 683 smallholder pig-keeping households in 34 villages. NodeXL software was used to describe pig movement networks at village level. The pig movement and trade networks were localized and based on close social networks involving family ties, friendships and relationships with neighbours. Pig movement network modularity ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 and exhibited good community structure within the network implying an easy flow of knowledge and adoption of new attitudes and beliefs, but also promoting an enhanced rate of disease transmission. The average path length of 5 defined using NodeXL, indicated that disease could easily reach every node in a cluster. Cross-border boar service between Uganda and Kenya was also recorded. Unmonitored trade in both directions was prevalent. While most pig transactions in the absence of disease, were at a small scale (&lt;5 km) and characterized by regular agistment, most pig sales during \{ASF\} outbreaks were to traders or other farmers from outside the sellers’ village at a range of &gt;10 km. The close social relationships between actors in pig movement networks indicate the potential for possible interventions to develop shared norms and mutually accepted protocols amongst smallholder pig keepers to better manage the risk of \{ASF\} introduction and transmission.

However, high seroprevalence of Leishmania infantum infection (one of the Leishmania species that cause visceral leishmaniasis) was detected in dogs and humans in the Mont Rolland community (close to Thiès, Senegal), despite the lack of reports concerning human clinical cases. Our aim was to genetically characterize this L. infantum population and identify its origin. We thus conducted seven field surveys in 25 villages of the Mont Rolland community between 2005 and 2009 and blood samples were collected from 205 dogs. Serological testing indicated that 92 dogs (44.9%) were positive for Leishmania infection. L. infantum was identified as the cause of infection. Analysis of 29 L. infantum isolates from these dogs by multilocus microsatellite typing and multilocus sequence typing indicated that this population had very limited genetic diversity, low level of heterozygosity and only seven different genotypes (79.3% of all isolates had the same genotype). Multilocus sequence typing showed that the Mont Rolland isolates clustered with strains from the Mediterranean basin and were separated from East African and Asian strains. Therefore, our data suggest a quite recent and unique introduction into Senegal of a L. infantum strain from the Mediterranean basin. "

The herds were randomly chosen in the summer grazing area of nomads within 20 km of the city of Baft, province of Kerman, South of Iran, the main cashmere producing area in Iran. Cashmere yield (CY) was determined from the weight of dehaired cashmere to weight of shorn fiber. Cashmere fibers were analyzed using an \{OFDA\} instrument. A general mixed linear model including sex, age and sex by age interaction as fixed effects and herd as random effect was used to analyze the data and measure the relationships between different cashmere characteristics and fleece attributes. The overall means ± standard deviations were for fleece weights (FW) 507 ± 183 g, cashmere yield (CY) 56.5 ± 12.2%, mean fiber diameter (MFD) 19.7 ± 1.5 μm, fiber diameter standard deviation (FDSD) 4.5 ± 0.6 μm, fiber curvature (FC) 62.9 ± 8.5°/mm and staple length (SL) 54.2 ± 7.0 mm, respectively. Herd effect was significant for all traits except for \{SL\} and sex by age effect was only significant for MFD. One year old males and females had finer cashmere than older goats. \{FW\} and \{FDSD\} were higher in males and \{CY\} and \{FC\} was higher in young animals. Pearson correlation between \{MFD\} and FC, \{FDSD\} and MFD, \{MFD\} and \{FW\} was −0.647, 0.399 and 0.211 respectively. Raeini cashmere is white, has an excellent \{SL\} and \{FC\} but is relatively coarse. Given the differences between and within herds there seems to be substantial scope to improve the commercial value of Raeini cashmere. "

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that \{WEHE\} increased \{DNA\} binding activity of the transcription factor NF-κB, which is responsible for iNOS gene expression. Furthermore, its trans-acting activity was confirmative as determined by in vitro transfection assay using a reporter gene construct, p(NF-κB)3-CAT, whose expression is solely regulated by the activity of NF-κB. Concomitantly with the activation of NF-κB, \{WEHE\} markedly decreased intracellular IκBα level as demonstrated by Western blot assay.

Low-resource societies face evident knowledge gaps on disease distribution, transmission within and across species and impact on human and animal health, precluding the development of integrated control strategies. Recommendations While veterinarians have been the main driver of the One Health initiative, the medical profession does not seem to be fully aware of how veterinary science can contribute to human public health. It was postulated that transdisciplinarity could help fill knowledge gaps and that encouraging such transdisciplinarity should start with undergraduate students. Furthermore, intersectoral collaboration on zoonoses should not ignore the social sciences (e.g. assessment of indigenous knowledge and perception; participatory surveillance), which can contribute to a better understanding of the transmission of diseases and improve communities’ participation in disease control activities.

Treatment was allocated at the herd level to ensure adequate protection of all the animals in a herd, with measurements of effectiveness conducted at the individual-animal level. The trial began in April 2005 and ran for 16 months including a baseline phase of 4 months. We recruited 12 herds in each area using a restricted random-sampling technique and distributed them equally into intervention (repellent) and control groups. Sample size was determined using a formal power calculation. Effectiveness or minimal worthwhile difference was defined as a 50% reduction in the incidence of trypanosome infection in the treated versus control group (effectiveness below which the technology was considered by experts as not viable compared to existing control techniques). All the animals in the recruited herds were screened monthly (buffy-coat technique) for trypanosome infections. The analysis followed the principle of intention-to-treat by which subjects are analysed according to their initial treatment assignment, regardless of the mechanical performance of the device. Crude and adjusted effects of the technology were 23% (p &lt; 0.001) and 18% (p = 0.08) reduction in the infection incidence in the treatment compared to the control groups, respectively. The impact of the technology estimated in this study did not achieve the threshold of 50% reduction in the trypanosome infection incidence set a priori to indicate effectiveness (p &lt; 0.001). We therefore concluded that the prototype repellent technology package was not sufficiently effective in reducing trypanosome infection incidence under natural tsetse challenge to merit commercial development.

But despite the fact that global food production over the past half century has kept ahead of demand, today around one billion people do not have enough to eat, and a further billion lack adequate nutrition. Food insecurity is facing mounting supply-side and demand-side pressures; key among these are climate change, urbanisation, globalisation, population increases, disease, as well as a number of other factors that are changing patterns of food consumption. Many of the challenges to equitable food access are concentrated in developing countries where environmental pressures – including climate change, population growth and other socio-economic issues – are concentrated. Together these factors impede people's access to sufficient, nutritious food; chiefly through affecting livelihoods, income and food prices. Food security and human development go hand in hand, and their outcomes are co-determined to a significant degree. The challenge of food security is multi-scalar and cross-sector in nature. Addressing it will require the work of diverse actors to bring sustained improvements inhuman development and to reduce pressure on the environment. Unless there is investment in future food systems that are similarly cross-level, cross-scale and cross-sector, sustained improvements in human wellbeing together with reduced environmental risks and scarcities will not be achieved. This paper reviews current thinking, and outlines these challenges. It suggests that essential elements in a successfully adaptive and proactive food system include: learning – through connectivity between scales to local experience and technologies – high levels of interaction between diverse actors and sectors ranging from primary producers to retailers and consumers, and use of frontier technologies.

These were used to predict and compare, first, performance of cows under nine crossbreeding strategies and, second, the performance of the production systems when applying the strategies that included maintaining the purebred S dams and bulls required for the production of crossbreds. Performance was predicted from parameters of a genetic model based on additive-dominance and additive×additive interaction effects for the following strategies: first cross (F×S), two-breed rotation (AS)Rot, three-breed rotation (BFS)Rot and two- (F and S), three- (B, F and S) and four- (A, B, F and S) breed synthetic (Syn) breeds based on equal and unequal contributions of the foundation breeds. The sensitivity of predicted performance at the cow level to variation in economic parameters was also investigated. For profit per day of productive herdlife (PLD), the B and F additive breed effects were not significantly different from that of A. The additive breed effect for S was negative and significant (P&lt;0.01) indicating that it was inferior to the Bos taurus for PLD. Dominance effects for \{PLD\} in the crosses A×S and B×S were positive and significant (P&lt;0.05). The additive×additive interactions were negative and significant in all the crosses. At the individual cow level, predicted \{PLD\} would be lowest in (ABFS)Syn and highest in F×S. The (3/4F 1/4S)Syn would be the second-best strategy giving 90% of the expected F×S profit, while (FS)Syn would give 87%. At the production system level, systems based on F×S cows were superior to those based on the rotations at all level of number of calvings (NL) and would be superior to those based on the two-breed synthetics only at a \{NL\} higher than 4. Variation of costs and prices greatly affected predicted economic benefit but not the ranking of strategies. The absence of significant differences in the additive breed effects of the B. taurus breeds for \{PLD\} showed that comparable economic benefits were derived by use of any of the three breeds for continuous crossbreeding with the S in a production system with management achieving 3000 kg lactation yields. It is also expected that the economic benefits from the development of two-breed synthetic breeds based on A, B or F would also be comparable in production systems achieving lower yields (e.g., in many smallholder units).

In particular, the risk of heavy livestock losses suffered during recurrent severe droughts associated with climate change and variability presents one of the most serious threats to pastoral livestock keepers. To generate insights into how climate change and variability adversely affect cattle production in the Borana of southern Ethiopia, we analyzed perceptions of herders and long-term changes in cattle numbers and climate data. A total of 242 households were surveyed to generate data on perceived trends in climate, rangeland condition and livestock production. Socio-demographic characteristics of households and cattle mortality due to the 2010/2011 drought were also recorded. Using a local time calendar, cattle herd history was reconstructed for a period spanning five major droughts to portray the linkage between changes in cattle numbers and changes in rainfall and temperature. Most of the herders perceived that rainfall has become more unpredictable, less in amount and shorter in duration, while drought recurrence and temperature have increased. Similarly, the majority perceived a decreasing trend in cattle herd sizes and their production performances. The 2010/2011 drought was associated with a substantial decline in cattle herd sizes due to increased mortality (26%) and forced off-take (19%). Death occurrences and mortality rates varied significantly by district, herd size and feed supplementation. Spectral density analysis revealed a quasi-periodic pattern in the annual rainfall with an approximate cycle period of 8.4 years, suggesting that droughts recur approximately every 8.4 years. A downward trend in cattle population mirrored a similar underlying trend in the interannual rainfall variation. Accordingly, changes in cattle number were significantly linked with changes in rainfall. In conclusion, perceptions corroborated by empirical evidences showed that climate change and variability were associated with declining cattle numbers, portending a precarious future to the sustainability of cattle pastoralism in southern Ethiopia and other pastoral systems.

The ability of certain cattle breeds to remain productive despite infection is known as trypanotolerance; however, the underlying immune mechanisms contributing to this trait remain poorly understood.

Expression levels of \{AMP\} genes (TAP, LAP, BNBD4, DEFB1, \{DEFB5\} and LEAP2) and \{APP\} genes (HP, CP, AGP, LBP, \{SAA3\} and CRP) were investigated using real time quantitative reverse transcription \{PCR\} (qRT-PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from two breeds of African cattle (trypanotolerant N’Dama and trypanosusceptible Boran), experimentally infected with Trypanosoma congolense. Haptoglobin and serum amyloid A (SAA) were also measured in plasma using quantitative protein assays. Results demonstrated that tracheal antimicrobial peptide (TAP) gene expression increased by 32-fold in Boran, compared to only 3-fold in N’Dama, by 14 days post-infection (dpi) and rising to 136-fold at 29 dpi in Boran, compared to 47-fold in N’Dama (P &lt; 0.05).

Recent index insurance schemes have the potential of being a viable tool for insuring pastoralists against drought-related risk. Such schemes require as input a forage scarcity (or drought) index that can be reliably updated in near real-time, and that strongly relates to livestock mortality. Generally, a long record (&gt;25 years) of the index is needed to correctly estimate mortality risk and calculate the related insurance premium. Data from current operational satellites used for large-scale vegetation monitoring span over a maximum of 15 years, a time period that is considered insufficient for accurate premium computation. This study examines how operational \{NDVI\} datasets compare to, and could be combined with the non-operational recently constructed 30-year \{GIMMS\} \{AVHRR\} record (1981–2011) to provide a near-real time drought index with a long term archive for the arid lands of Kenya. We compared six freely available, near-real time \{NDVI\} products: five from \{MODIS\} and one from SPOT-VEGETATION. Prior to comparison, all datasets were averaged in time for the two vegetative seasons in Kenya, and aggregated spatially at the administrative division level at which the insurance is offered. The feasibility of extending the resulting aggregated drought indices back in time was assessed using jackknifed \{R2\} statistics (leave-one-year-out) for the overlapping period 2002–2011. We found that division-specific models were more effective than a global model for linking the division-level temporal variability of the index between \{NDVI\} products. Based on our results, good scope exists for historically extending the aggregated drought index, thus providing a longer operational record for insurance purposes. We showed that this extension may have large effects on the calculated insurance premium. Finally, we discuss several possible improvements to the drought index. "

abstract = "Abstract Pastoralist households across East Africa face major livestock losses during drought periods that can cause persistent poverty. For Kenya and southern Ethiopia, an existing index insurance scheme aims to reduce the adverse effects of such losses. The scheme insures individual households through an area-aggregated seasonal forage scarcity index derived from remotely-sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. Until recently, insurance contracts covered animal losses and indemnity payouts were consequently made late in the season, based on a forage scarcity index incorporating both wet and dry season \{NDVI\} data. Season timing and duration were fixed for the whole area (March–September for long rains, October–February for short rains). Due to demand for asset protection insurance (pre-loss intervention) our aim was to identify earlier payout options by shortening the temporal integration period of the index. We used 250 m-resolution 10-day \{NDVI\} composites for 2001–2014 from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). To better describe the period during which forage develops, we first retrieved per-pixel average season start- and end-dates using a phenological model. These dates were averaged per insurance unit to obtain unit-specific growing period definitions. With these definitions a new forage scarcity index was calculated. We then examined if shortening the temporal period further could effectively predict most (&gt; 90%) of the interannual variability of the new index, and assessed the effects of shortening the period on indemnity payouts. Our analysis shows that insurance payouts could be made one to three months earlier as compared to the current index definition, depending on the insurance unit. This would allow pastoralists to use indemnity payments to protect their livestock through purchase of forage, water, or medicines. "

Parasite vaccines are still rare, but there are encouraging signs that their number will increase in the next decade. The modern paradigm is that an understanding of parasite genes will lead to the identification of useful antigens, which can then be produced in recombinant systems developed as a result of the huge investment in biotechnology. However, we should also continue to devote efforts to basic research on the host–parasite interface. "

The small size of parcels and their scattered nature that are the product of existing inheritance systems are incompatible with the new technologies available.

The Turkish government has proposed a series of changes in how inheritance rights are to be managed in a program of land consolidation and reorganization. Such changes would have a major impact on the rural economy and could elicit strong cultural and political reactions. This study analyses the views of agricultural stakeholders to these proposed legal changes to prevent further fragmentation of agricultural land. The research was designed to predict impact rather than create policy. The interviewed stakeholders were separated into two groups; Those “in favor of the solution” and those “opposed to the solution” by a two-step cluster analysis, taking into account the social and economic characteristics of the stakeholders as well as the region where the study was conducted. It was determined that their economic concerns are the primary obstacle to creating effective policy. Education, social security, living place, tradition, and experience in the implementation of the policy were identified as other influential factors. "

Economic values were derived using a bio-economic model that combined genetic potential performance, feeding strategies and optimum culling and insemination policies to obtain actual phenotypic performance. Two evaluation bases were considered: fixed herd-size and fixed milk-output. With a fixed herd-size economic values were 0.04 (carrier), 5.25 (fat), 3.95 (protein), 0.92 (dressing percentage), 1.30 (conception rate), 2.42 (survival rate), 0.81 (body weight) and 84.53 (rumen capacity). With a milk-output limitation, economic values for all traits except survival rate were lower than for fixed herd-size. The respective values were −0.04, 3.53, 2.91, 0.88, 0.85, 3.18, 0.51 and 45.59. Sensitivity analysis indicated that economic values of fat, protein and rumen capacity increased significantly with higher prices of milk solids. Other traits were less sensitive to a change in price of milk solids. Changes in price of concentrate did not alter economic values significantly. Under a fixed feeding strategy, economic values for functional traits increased substantially, while those for production traits decreased. The results of this analysis suggest that genetic improvement of fertility, health and cow-efficiency traits will have a clear positive effect on profitability of Holstein cows in Costa Rica, especially when feeding conditions are not optimal.

Cassava represents an important staple food in sub-Saharan Africa. The analysis of aflatoxigenic fungi in 36 cassava samples obtained from producers in Benin indicated that 40% were contaminated by Aspergilli of the section Flavi. Upon morphological and molecular characterization of the 20 isolates, 16 belonged to Aspergillus flavus, 2 to Aspergillus parvisclerotigenus and 2 to Aspergillus novoparasiticus. This is the first time that this latter species is isolated from food. Although most of these isolates were toxigenic on synthetic media, no \{AFB1\} contamination was observed in these cassava samples. In order to determine the action of cassava on \{AFB1\} synthesis, a highly toxigenic strain of A. flavus, was inoculated onto fresh cassava and despite a rapid development, no \{AFB1\} was produced. The anti-aflatoxin property was observed with cassava from different geographical origins and on other aflatoxigenic strains of the section Flavi, but it was lost after heating, sun drying and freezing. Our data suggest that fresh cassava is safe regarding \{AFB1\} contamination, however, processing may alter its ability to block toxinogenesis leading to secondary contamination. "

The largest survey to date of Se status of Australians found a mean plasma Se concentration of 103 μg/l in 288 Adelaide residents, just above the nutritional adequacy level. In the total sample analysed (six surveys from 1977 to 2002; n=834), plasma Se was higher in males and increased with age. This study showed that many South Australians consume inadequate Se to maximise selenoenzyme expression and cancer protection, and indicated that levels had declined around 20% from the 1970s. No significant genotypic variability for grain Se concentration was observed in modern wheat cultivars, but the diploid wheat Aegilops tauschii L. and rye (Secale cereale L.) were higher. Grain Se concentrations ranged 5–720 μg/kg and it was apparent that this variation was determined mostly by available soil Se level. Field trials, along with glasshouse and growth chamber studies, were used to investigate agronomic biofortification of wheat. Se applied as sodium selenate at rates of 4–120 g Se/ha increased grain Se concentration progressively up to 133-fold when sprayed on soil at seeding and up to 20-fold when applied as a foliar spray after flowering. A threshold of toxicity of around 325 mg Se/kg in leaves of young wheat plants was observed, a level that would not normally be reached with Se fertilisation. On the other hand sulphur (S) applied at the low rate of 30 kg/ha at seeding reduced grain Se concentration by 16%. Agronomic biofortification could be used by food companies as a cost-effective method to produce high-Se wheat products that contain most Se in the desirable selenomethionine form. Further studies are needed to assess the functionality of high-Se wheat, for example short-term clinical trials that measure changes in genome stability, lipid peroxidation and immunocompetence. Increasing the Se content of wheat is a food systems strategy that could increase the Se intake of whole populations. "

Cessation of cell division and profound morphological changes were seen in procyclic forms but not in \{BSF\} after incubation with concanavalin A (Con A), wheat germ agglutinin and Ricinus communis agglutinin. These lectins caused the trypanosomes to cease division, become round and increase dramatically in size, the latter being partially attributable to the formation of what appeared to be a large ‘vacuole-like structure’ or an expanded flagellar pocket. Con A was used in all further experiments. Spectrophotometric quantitation of extracted \{DNA\} and flow cytometry using the \{DNA\} intercalating dye propidium iodide showed that the \{DNA\} content of Con A-treated trypanosomes increased dramatically when compared to untreated parasites. Examination of these cells by fluorescence microscopy showed that many of the Con A-treated cells were multinucleate whereas the kinetoplasts were mostly present as single copies, indicating a disequilibrium between nuclear and kinetoplast replication. Immunofluorescence experiments using monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for paraflagellar rod proteins and for kinetoplastid membrane protein-11 (KMP-11), showed that the Con A-treated parasites had begun to duplicate the flagellum but that this had only proceeded along part of the length of the cells, suggesting that the cell division process was initiated but that cytokinesis was subsequently inhibited. Tunicamycin-treated wild-type trypanosomes and mutant trypanosomes expressing both high levels of non-glycosylated procyclins and procyclin isoforms with truncated N-linked sugars were resistant to the effects of Con A, suggesting that N-linked carbohydrates on the procyclin surface coat were the ligands for Con A binding. This was supported by data obtained using mutant parasites created by deletion of all three \{EP\} procyclin isoforms, two of which contain N-glycosylation sites, by homologous recombination. The knockout mutants showed reduced binding of fluorescein-labelled Con A as determined by flow cytometry and were resistant to the effects of Con A. Taken together the results show that Con A induces multinucleation, a disequilibrium between nuclear and kinetoplast replication and a unique form of cell death in procyclic African trypanosomes and that the ligands for Con A binding are carbohydrates on the \{EP\} forms of procyclin. The possible significance of these findings for the life cycle of the trypanosomes in the tsetse fly vector is discussed. "

This study aimed to assess animal health and management practices, constraints and opportunities for intervention in smallholder pig value chains in three high poverty districts of Uganda. Semi-qualitative interview checklists through Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were administered to 340 pig farmers in 35 villages in Masaka, Kamuli and Mukono districts. Quantitative data was obtained during the exercise through group consensus. Results of \{FGDs\} were further triangulated with secondary data and information obtained from key informant interviews. Findings show that pig keeping systems are dominated by tethering and scavenging in rural areas. In peri-urban and urban areas, intensive production systems are more practiced, with pigs confined in pens. The main constraints identified by farmers include high disease burden such as African swine fever (ASF) and parasites, poor housing and feeding practices, poor veterinary services, ineffective drugs and a general lack of knowledge on piggery management. According to farmers, \{ASF\} is the primary cause of pig mortality with epidemics occurring mainly during the dry season. Worms and ectoparasites namely; mange, lice and flies are endemic leading to stunted growth which reduces the market value of pigs. Diarrhoea and malnutrition are common in piglets. Ninety-three percent of farmers say they practice deworming, 37% practice ectoparasite spraying and 77% castrate their boars. Indigenous curative treatments include the application of human urine and concoctions of local herbs for \{ASF\} control and use of old engine oil or tobacco extracts to control ectoparasites. There is a need for better technical services to assist farmers with these problems. "

In the present study it was determined that rats are sensitive to anti-nutritional factor(s) of A. angustissima and can therefore be used in bioassays to evaluate the toxicity of this legume. Weanling rats fed a diet supplemented with 7.5% A. angustissima had reduced intake and average daily gain (ADG) (4.5 and −0.8 g/d) when compared to rats fed a diet containing 7.5% Medicago sativa (6.8 and 2.4 g/d). When A. angustissima leaves were incubated in the rumen of steers for 24 h before feeding to the rats no toxicity symptoms were observed suggesting that the anti-nutritional factors were either transformed by rumen microbial activity, solubilized out of the plant leaves or reduced due to oven drying. Variable mild lymphocytic typhlitis was observed in cecal tissues in both groups fed 7.5% A. angustissima, either whole or after rumen incubation. No other significant histological or gross pathological changes were observed. In order to ascertain the nature of the anti-nutritional factor(s) milled A. angustissima leaf material was extracted with a variety of solvents and extracts added to rat diets to determine their effect. Intake and \{ADG\} (6.0 and 0.5 g/d) were significantly reduced in rats fed a diet containing a 70% acetone extract compared to the rats fed the control diet (8.8 and 3.1 g/d). The rats fed the 70% acetone extract containing diet showed an increase in cecal wet weight and/or contents, salivary gland dry weight (% of live weight), fecal nitrogen excretion and increased concentrations of proline, glycine and glutamic acid in the feces. Further fractionation of a 70% acetone fraction was performed to yield ethyl acetate, acetone and water-soluble fractions. Again intake and \{ADG\} (6.7 and 0.2 g/d) were significantly reduced in rats fed a diet containing a 70% acetone extract compared to the rats fed the control diet (10.7 and 3.6 g/d). In vitro incubation of the 70% acetone fraction with rumen fluid did not result in significant microbial transformation of the anti-nutritional factors (7.4 and 0.1 g/d). Intake and \{ADG\} were significantly reduced when compared to the control diet in the diet containing the ethyl acetate soluble fraction (8.6 and 2.1 g/d), but no anti-nutritional effects were noted in the diets containing the acetone (11.3 and 3.8 g/d) or water-soluble fractions (11.1 and 3.8 g/d) of the 70% acetone extraction. The size increase in salivary glands, increased fecal nitrogen excretion and increased concentrations of proline, glycine and glutamic acid in the feces together with decreased intake and \{ADG\} when diets are fed containing phenolics indicate that phenolics were the major component involved in the anti-nutritional effects of A. angustissima used in these studies. Condensed tannins, but not gallotannins, were detected in phenolic-containing plant extracts. Inhibition of intake and weight gain of condensed tannin containing diets was reversed by polyethylene glycol, which complexes with tannins. "

Genetic distances between palpalis and morsitans subspecies suggest that their status needs revision. In particular, cytochrome oxidase 1 sequences showed large geographical differences within G. palpalis palpalis, suggesting the existence of cryptic species within this subspecies. The morphology of palpalis group female genital plates was examined, and individuals were found varying outside the ranges specified by the standard identification keys, making definitive morphological classification impossible. A diagnostic \{PCR\} to distinguish G. palpalis palpalis, G. tachinoides and G. palpalis gambiensis based on length differences of internal transcribed spacer 1 sequences is presented. "

Four activation agents, i.e., calcium ionophore (A23187), ionomycin (Ion), electric pulse (EP) and ethanol (Eth) were used in various combinations to activate bovine \{ICSI\} embryos. The normal fertilization rate was similar in bovine \{ICSI\} embryos activated by \{A23187\} + Eth, Ion + Eth, Ion + \{EP\} + Eth, and 2-Ion (Ion administered two times) + Eth. Increasing the frequency of ionomycin stimulation from two (2-Ion + Eth) to three times (3-Ion + Eth) significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased the cell number per embryo at the blastocyst stage. In addition, spermatozoa were pretreated with dithiothreitol (DTT), glutathione (GSH) or \{GSH\} + lysolecithin (LL) and used for producing bovine \{ICSI\} embryos. The blastocyst rate of bovine \{ICSI\} embryos produced from sperm pretreated with \{GSH\} was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher than those of embryos produced from sperm pretreated with \{DTT\} and \{GSH\} + LL. In conclusion, the embryo activation methods and sperm pretreatments examined in the present study did not affect the normal fertilization rate of bovine \{ICSI\} embryos. However, activation with 3-Ion + Eth and sperm pretreatment with \{GSH\} increased the cell number per embryo at blastocyst stage and the blastocyst rate, respectively, in bovine \{ICSI\} embryos. "

These five strains represented a population different from the populations belonging to the ‘Mycoplasma mycoides cluster’ as tested using multi locus sequence typing, Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry analysis and DNA–DNA hybridization. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene (rrs), genomic sequence based in silico as well as laboratory DNA–DNA hybridization, and the analysis of phenotypic traits in particular their exceptionally rapid growth all confirmed that they do not belong to any Mycoplasma species described to date. We therefore suggest these strains represent a novel species, for which we propose the name Mycoplasma feriruminatoris sp. nov. The type strain is \{G5847T\} (= \{DSM\} 26019T = \{NCTC\} 1362T). "

Since Pten/Trp53 double conditional knockout mice show earlier onset and fast progression of prostate cancer when compared to Pten knockout mice, we asked whether heterozygosity of these two tumor suppressor genes was sufficient to accelerate prostatic tumorigenesis. To answer this question we examined prostatic lesion progression of Pten/Trp53 double heterozygous mice and a series of controls such as Pten heterozygous, Pten conditional knockout, Trp53 heterozygous and Trp53 knockout mice. Tissue recombination of adult prostatic epithelium coupled with embryonic rat seminal vesicle mesenchyme was used as a tool to stimulate prostatic epithelial proliferation. In our study, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) was found with high frequency at 8 weeks post-tissue recombination transplantation. \{PIN\} lesions in Pten/Trp53 double heterozygous mice were more severe than those seen in Pten heterozygous alone. Furthermore, morphologic features attributable to Pten or Trp53 loss appeared to be enhanced in double heterozygous tissues. \{LOH\} analysis of Pten and Trp53 in genomic \{DNA\} collected from high-grade \{PIN\} lesions in Pten heterozygous and Pten/Trp53 double heterozygous mice showed an intact wild-type allele for both genes in all samples examined. In conclusion, simultaneous heterozygosity of Pten and Trp53 accelerates prostatic tumorigenesis in this mouse model of prostate cancer independently of loss of heterozygosity of either gene. "

Reconstructed embryos cloned by transfer of non-heated Holstein donor cells to heat-shocked Holstein ooplasm (Ho+–Hd−) had a lower (P &lt; 0.05) blastocyst rate than those cloned from non-heated Holstein ooplasm receiving heated (Ho−–Hd+) or non-heated (Ho−–Hd−) Holstein donor cells (11.3 vs. 34.3 or 36.8%). Heat-shocked donor cells from either Holstein or \{TY\} cows did not significantly affect blastocyst rates of reconstructed embryos produced from Holstein ooplasm (30.6–32.9%). In contrast, blastocyst rates of reconstructed embryos generated with heat-shocked Holstein ooplasm were lower (P &lt; 0.05) than that with heat-shocked \{TY\} ooplasm (11.2 vs 45.2%). Without heat shock, embryos reconstructed by transferring donor cells to ooplasm of Holstein or \{TY\} cows had similar (P &gt; 0.05) blastocyst rates (28.9–33.3%). Transplantation of reconstructed embryos (n = 30) to recipients (n = 23) resulted in three live calves, derived from embryos cloned with \{TY\} ooplasm and donor nuclei from either Holstein (n = 2) or \{TY\} cows (n = 1). In conclusion, ooplasm of \{TY\} cattle was more resistant to heat stress than that derived from Holsteins; therefore, ooplasm may be a major determinant for thermal sensitivity in bovine oocytes and embryos.

abstract = "\{ERS\} wind scatterometer (WSC) time series are analyzed over different ecoclimatic regions of the African Sahel during the period 1991–1995. At 45° incidence angle, the strong seasonality of σo time series can be directly linked to the successive wet and dry seasons. Moreover, the annual σo dynamic range was found to be strongly correlated to total rainfall. The interpretation of the σo temporal plots is carried out by combining a backscattering model to a grassland growth model. Results highlight the decreasing contribution of the herbaceous component with latitude. However, its contribution is far from negligible and can reach 60% in the Soudano-Sahelian subzone at peak herbaceous mass. Additionally, the tree layer has a negligible effect on the radar signal at the scale of a resolution cell. Finally, a simple parametric backscattering model is calibrated and used in an inversion process. The resolution of the inverse problem is based on a ‘brute-force’ method that consists of exploring all the combinations of parameters of interest. Despite a poor estimation of the temporal variation of the herbaceous mass Bt, the retrieved maximum mass compares well with ground estimates. "

This study presents results of the combined use of a simple water balance model, a radiative transfer model and \{ERS\} scatterometer data to produce map of vegetation biomass and thus vegetation cover at a spatial resolution of 25 km. The backscattering coefficient measured by spaceborne wind scatterometers over Sahel shows a marked seasonality linked to the drastic changes of both soil and vegetation dielectric properties associated to the alternating dry and wet seasons. For lack of a direct observation, \{METEOSAT\} rainfall estimates are used to calculate temporal series of soil moisture with the help of a water balance model. This a priori information is used as input of the radiative transfer model that simulates the interaction between the radar wave and the surface components (soil and vegetation). Then, an inversion algorithm is applied to retrieve vegetation aerial mass from the \{ERS\} scatterometer data. Because of the nonlinear feature of the inverse problem to be solved, the inversion is performed using a global stochastic nonlinear inversion method. A good agreement is obtained between the inverse solutions and independent field measurements with mean and standard deviation of −54 and 130 kg of dry matter by hectare (kg DM/ha), respectively. The algorithm is then applied to a 350,000 km2 area including the Malian Gourma and Seno region and a Sahelian part of Burkina Faso during two contrasted seasons (1999 and 2000). At the considered resolution, the obtained herbaceous mass maps show a global qualitative consistency (r2=0.71) with \{NDVI\} images acquired by the \{VEGETATION\} instrument. "

Diseases caused by these Mycoplasma negatively affect the agricultural sector especially in developing countries through losses in livestock productivity, mortality and international trade restrictions. There is therefore urgent need to develop antimicrobials from alternative sources such as medicinal plants to curb these diseases. In Kenya, smallholder farmers belonging to the Maasai, Kuria and Luo rely on traditional Kenyan herbals to treat respiratory symptoms in ruminants. In the current study extracts from some of these plants were tested against the growth of members of Mycoplasma mycoides cluster. Aim This study aimed at identifying plants that exhibit antimycoplasmal activities using an ethnobotanical approach. Materials and methods Kenyan farmers of Maasai, Luo and Kuria ethnic groups were interviewed for plant remedies given to livestock with respiratory syndromes. The plant materials were thereafter collected and crude extracts prepared using a mixture of 50% of methanol (MeOH) in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), neat methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH) and water to yield four crude extracts per plant part. The extracts were tested in vitro against five strains of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri, five strains of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides and one strain of Mycoplasma capricolum subsp capricolum using broth micro-dilution assays with an initial concentration of 1 mg/ml. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the most active extracts were determined by serial dilution. Results Extracts from five plants namely: Solanum aculeastrum, Albizia coriaria, Ekebergia capensis, Piliostigma thonningii and Euclea divinorum exhibited the highest activities against the Mycoplasma strains tested. Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides were more susceptible to these extracts than Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri and Mycoplasma capricolum susp. capricolum. The activities of the crude extracts varied with the solvent used for extraction. The \{MICs\} mean values of the active extracts varied from 0.02 to 0.6 mg/ml. Conclusions The results suggested that these plants could potentially contain antimicrobial compounds that might be useful for the treatment of respiratory diseases in ruminants. Future work should focus on the isolation and identification of the active compounds from the plant extracts that showed interesting activities and evaluation of their antimicrobial and cytotoxic potential.

The basic reproduction number for \{CBPP\} in southern Sudan was estimated to range from 3.2 to 4.6. The homogeneous model indicates that the critical community size for the persistence of \{CBPP\} falls within the typical herd sizes for pastoral communities in East Africa suggesting that individual isolated herds are capable of maintaining infection indefinitely.

abstract = "This paper focuses on the conceptual evolution of watershed management within the context of an action research program operating in the highlands of eastern Africa, as informed by both theory and practice. Following a review of the watershed management literature, and brief program and methodological overviews, the paper explores in detail the concepts of “participation” and “integration” in watershed management. Conceptual and methodological dimensions of the terms are discussed in the context of a watershed implementation process, clarifying how “watershed issues” are defined by local users, how “stakeholders” are defined with respect to those issues, and how participation and integration may be operationalized in practice. Data are selectively chosen from different pilot sites to illustrate how concepts underlying watershed management have been refined, and methods improved. It is clear that “participation” in problem diagnosis and program implementation must move beyond community-level fora to socially-disaggregated processes and explicit management of trade-offs to diverse groups. Secondly, integration does not come about through implementation of parallel interventions, but rather through an explicit analysis of potential trade-offs and synergies of interventions to diverse system components, and strategies to define and reach systems-level goals. Each approach requires attention to ways to optimize returns to diverse social groups and system components while minimizing negative spin-offs. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications for agricultural research and development in the eastern African region. "

This paper focuses on farming systems in the semi-arid areas of Zimbabwe, where biomass production is limited and farmers integrate crop and livestock activities. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is promoted to intensify crop production, emphasizing the retention of surface mulch with crop residues (CR). This paper quantifies the associated potential economic trade-offs and profitability of using residues for soil amendment or as livestock feed, and explores alternative biomass production options. We draw on household surveys, stakeholder feedback, crop, livestock and economic modeling tools. We use the Trade-Off Analysis Model for Multi Dimensional Impact Assessment (TOA-MD) to compare different \{CR\} use scenarios at community level and for different farm types: particularly the current base system (cattle grazing of maize residues) and sustainable intensification alternatives based on a \{CA\} option (mulching using maize residues ± inorganic fertilizer) and a maize–mucuna (Mucuna pruriens) rotation. Our results indicate that a maize–mucuna rotation can reduce trade-offs between \{CR\} uses for feed and mulch, providing locally available organic soil enhancement, supplementary feed and a potential source of income. Conservation Agriculture without fertilizer application and at non-subsidized fertilizer prices is not financially viable; whereas with subsidized fertilizer it can benefit half the farm population. The poverty effects of all considered alternative biomass options are however limited; they do not raise income sufficiently to lift farmers out of poverty. Further research is needed to establish the competitiveness of alternative biomass enhancing technologies and the socio-economic processes that can facilitate sustainable intensification of mixed crop-livestock systems, particularly in semi-arid environments.

A precise and reliable monitoring of the particle characteristics during crystallization along with a suitable control strategy should be highly encouraged for the conformance to new quality system of pharmaceutical products. In this study, the anti-solvent crystallization process of indomethacin (IMC) was monitored using an in-line NIRS. \{IMC\} powders were produced via anti-solvent crystallization using two schemes; ‘S-to-A’ (solvent-to-antisolvent) and ‘A-to-S’ (antisolvent-to-solvent). In-line \{NIR\} spectra were analyzed by a \{PCA\} (principal component analysis) method. Although pure α-form \{IMC\} powder was resulted under A-to-S scheme, a mixture of the α-form and γ-form was produced for S-to-A case. By integrating the \{PCA\} results with off-line characterization (SEM, XRD, DSC) data, the crystallization process under each scheme was elucidated by three distinct consecutive steps. It was demonstrated that in-line NIRS, combined with PCA, can be very useful to monitor in real time and interpret the anti-solvent crystallization process with respect to the polymorphism and particle size.

These validation trials are paired plot comparisons of conventional agricultural practice and conservation agriculture that had been established between 2004 and 2009. Traditional cropping systems vary across the study area although they all are tillage based and maize is the main crop grown. The treatments proposed on the validations trials reflect this variability in conventional practice and propose an adapted conservation agriculture option. The sites are thus grouped into four specific treatment comparisons. Bulk density and soil C concentrations were measured from samples collected at four depth layers (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm and 30–60 cm), thereafter C stocks were calculated. On the basis of the stover biomass harvest C inputs were assessed. No consistent differences in bulk density and soil C concentrations were found. Carbon stocks were found to be positively influenced by conservation agriculture only when a mouldboard ploughed maize-legume rotation was compared to a direct seeded maize legume rotation (with residue retention). Even when increases were significantly greater under conservation agriculture the order of magnitude was small (∼2 Mg ha−1). Limited C inputs, ranging between 0.1 and 1 g C kg−1 soil yr−1, are likely to be the major bottleneck for C increase. These results, based on on-farm validation trials indicate that there is a limited potential for conservation agriculture to significantly increase soil C stocks after up to 7 years of conservation agriculture practices, in the studied systems.

The combined results of the three seasons on disease parameters showed that sowing dates significantly affected final disease severity and area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC); faba bean genotypes significantly affected final disease severity, rate of disease development and AUDPC. The highest \{AUDPC\} (255% days) was observed in early than late planted (168% days) faba bean genotypes. The mean \{AUDPC\} of faba bean genotypes ranged from 189% days on genotype 1053–1325 to 234% days on ILB-1814. Only faba bean genotypes and fungicides showed significant interactions in affecting final disease severity and AUDPC. Fungicide sprays significantly affected mean percent pod infection and rate of disease development but not mean percent seed infection. Faba bean genotypes showed significant differences in dry seed yield and the yield ranged from 1.7 t ha−1 in cv. Ascot to 2.4 t ha−1 in faba bean genotype 945-105. Improved varieties with Ascochyta blight resistance are not currently released and available for farmers in northern Syria and the integration of early planting (November–December) with one foliar fungicide spray at vegetative stage can help to reduce Ascochyta blight severity, pod and seed infections. Chlorothalonil and azoxystrobin are widely used fungicides to manage Ascochyta blights on food legumes in many countries and one of them could be used depending on their availability and costs to managing faba bean Ascochyta blight in Syria and other Mediterranean type environments.

The study comprised 14 non-commercialized hybrids (seven pairs of near-isogenic Bt and non-Bt hybrids) and four non-Bt commercial hybrids. Each plant was artificially infested twice with 10 first instar larvae. In CFT, plants were infested with C. partellus 14 and 24 days after planting; in BGH, plants were infested with B. fusca 21 and 31 days after planting. In CFT, the seven Bt hybrids significantly differed from their non-Bt counterparts for leaf damage, number of exit holes, percent tunnel length, and grain yield. When averaged over three seasons, Bt-hybrids gave the highest grain yield (9.7 t ha−1), followed by non-Bt hybrids (6.9 t ha−1) and commercial checks (6 t ha−1). Bt-hybrids had the least number of exit holes and percent tunnel length in all the seasons as compared to the non-Bt hybrids and commercial checks. In \{BGH\} trials, Bt-hybrids consistently suffered less leaf damage than their non-Bt near isolines. The study demonstrated that \{MON810\} was effective in controlling B. fusca and C. partellus. Bt-maize, therefore, has great potential to reduce the risk of maize grain losses in Africa due to stem borers, and will enable the smallholder farmers to produce high-quality grain with increased yield, reduced insecticide inputs, and improved food security.

In reality, estimates of international scientific organizations such as the International Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) are in close agreement, with variation mainly arising on how \{GHG\} emissions are allocated to land use and land use change. Other estimates involve major deviations from international protocols, such as estimated global warming potential of \{CH4\} or including respired \{CO2\} in \{GHG\} emissions. These approaches also fail to differentiate short-term \{CO2\} arising from oxidation of plant C by ruminants from \{CO2\} released from fixed fossil C through combustion. These deviances from internationally accepted protocols create confusion and direct attention from anthropomorphic practices which have the most important contribution to global \{GHG\} emissions.

It is possible that co-infections may be as important as environmental risk factors. However, in cross-sectional studies, where the timing of infection is unknown, apparent associations between infections may be observed due to parasites sharing common risk factors. This study measured antibody titres to 3 viral (Newcastle disease, Marek's disease and infectious bursal disease) and 2 bacterial (Pasteurella multocida and Salmonella) diseases, and the infection prevalence of 3 families of endo- and ecto-parasites (Ascaridida, Eimeria and lice) in 1056 village chickens from two geographically distinct populations in Ethiopia. Samples were collected during 4 cross-sectional surveys, each approximately 6 months apart. Constrained ordination, a technique for analysis of ecological community data, was used to explore this complex dataset and enabled potential relationships to be uncovered and tested despite the different measurements used for the different parasites. It was found that only a small proportion of variation in the data could be explained by the risk factors measured. Very few birds (9/1280) were found to be seropositive to Newcastle disease. Positive relationships were identified between Pasteurella and Salmonella titres; and between Marek's disease and parasitic infections, and these two groups of diseases were correlated with females and males, respectively. This may suggest differences in the way that the immune systems of male and female chickens interact with these parasites. In conclusion, we find that a number of infectious pathogens and their interactions are likely to impact village chicken health and production. Control of these infections is likely to be of importance in future development planning. "

The most commonly used tests for detection of trypanocidal drug resistance are tests using mice or ruminants, but these suffer from lack of standardisation and hence it may be difficult to compare the results of different investigators. Tests in mice are less expensive than tests in ruminants, but while tests in mice they may be useful as a general guide to resistance in a geographic area they should not be extrapolated to cattle on an individual trypanosome level. Moreover, the commonly used protocols are too laborious for their application to large number of trypanosome isolates on an area-wide basis. This paper presents guidelines for standardised testing of trypanocidal drugs in vivo, and introduces a simplified single-dose test for use in mice, which is convenient for use in areas with limited laboratory facilities. The single-dose test is appropriate for characterisation of geographic areas in terms of trypanocidal drug resistance using large numbers of trypanosome isolates, for making comparisons between areas, and for monitoring changes in trypanocidal drug resistance over time. Multiple-dose tests may be used to determine the degree of resistance of individual stabilates to be determined precisely in mice are also described, but for logistical reasons these will rarely be conducted on more than a few stabilates, and testing of a larger number of stabilates in the single-dose test will generally provide more useful information. Finally, we describe tests in cattle that may be used to determine the efficacy of recommended curative doses of trypanocidal drugs for the treatment of infection with individual trypanosome isolates, including Trypanosoma vivax, which is rarely infective for mice.

More efficient tools to control the disease are needed, but to develop the tools, a better understanding of host–pathogen interactions is necessary. The aim of this study was to characterize the kinetics of the humoral immune response against 65 Mmm surface antigens for an extended period in cattle that survived a primary infection with Mmm. We describe clinical and haematological outcomes, and dissect the humoral immune response over time, to specific antigens and compared the antibody responses between different pathomorphological outcomes. No antigen-specific antibodies correlating with protection were identified. Interestingly we found that animals that developed Mycoplasma-containing sequestra had significantly higher antibody levels against proteins comprising the surface proteome than the animals that cleared Mycoplasma from their lungs. Based on these data we suggest that high antibody titres might play a role in the establishment of pathomorphological changes, such as vasculitis, which should be investigated in future studies. Beneficial antibody specificities and cellular immune responses need to be identified in order to foster the development of an improved vaccine in the future. "

Diagnostic trials were implemented in Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria and Tanzania, as part of the African Soils Information Service (AfSIS) project, to identify soil fertility constraints to crop production across various cropping systems and soil fertility conditions. In each country, one to three sites of 10 km × 10 km were included with each site having 12–31 field trials. The treatments tested included a control, an \{NPK\} treatment, three treatments in which the N, P and K nutrients were omitted one at a time from the \{NPK\} treatment, and three treatments in which secondary and micronutrients (Ca, Mg, S, Zn and B) simply referred here as multi-nutrients, manure and lime were added to the NPK. The field trials were conducted for 1–2 seasons; the test crop was maize except in Mali where sorghum was used. Nitrogen was limiting in all sites and generally the most limiting nutrient except in Sidindi (Kenya) and Kontela (Mali) where P was the most limiting. The general pattern in Kiberashi (Tanzania) shows none of the nutrients were limiting. K is mainly limiting in only one site (Mbinga) although incidences of K limitation were seen in almost all sites. Addition of multi-nutrients and manure further improved the yields of \{NPK\} in most sites. Cluster analyses revealed that maize crop in 11% of fields were highly responsive to nitrogen application, 25% (i.e., 21% poor and 4% fertile) ‘non-responsive’ to any nutrient or soil amendment, 28% being ‘low responsive’ and 36% of ‘intermediate response’. This study indicates that constraints to crop production vary considerably even within a site, and that addressing limitations in secondary and micronutrients, and increasing soil carbon can improve response to fertilizers. For sustainable crop production intensification in smallholder farming systems in SSA, there is need to develop management strategies to improve efficiency of fertilizer use and of other inputs, recognizing the site-specific nutrient response patterns at various spatial scales.

As parts of agricultural product supply chains, land use (LU) and land use change (LUC) are considered to be major contributors to global \{CO2\} emissions. Nevertheless, \{LU\} and \{LUC\} (LULUC) are rarely included in \{GHG\} estimations for food and feedstuffs. Here we propose a method which can be used to derive emissions from \{LU\} and \{LUC\} on a regional level. Emissions are distributed over an accounting period chosen to match the physically occurring carbon fluxes. As fluxes from soil organic carbon persist for years or even for decades after a \{LUC\} episode, depending on the climatic conditions of the region, we apply 10 and 20 years as suitable accounting periods for tropical and temperate climate zones, respectively. We compare the proposed method with two other methods proposed in the literature. Using two types of feedstuffs (Brazilian soybean-meal and Austrian barley) as examples, we find that the other two methods produce mostly lower emission estimates in the case of Brazilian soybeans, and higher estimates for Austrian barley. We conclude that these differences are caused mainly by different accounting periods and by a (non)consideration of regional specificities. While analysing life cycles necessarily entails a well supported – but still arbitrary – setting of such system boundaries, we argue that the methodology presented here better reflects actually occurring carbon fluxes that we understand to be the foundation of any environmental product assessment.

The aim was to provide a description of the livestock production system in the Northern Areas and investigate the effect of agro-ecological zone and proximity to transport infrastructure on small-holder practices, especially those relating to livestock management. Two transects were selected for study differing in the quality of their transport infrastructure; the Karakoram Highway transect was defined by the Karakoram Highway, a major transport link through the study region, while the Gilgit–Ghizer Region transect lay along a side valley with a more limited transport infrastructure. One village from each of the three main agro-ecological zones within the region was selected in each transport infrastructure transect. Results showed that average landholding size was 1.6 ha of which around 60% was cultivated. Overall herd size did not differ significantly by zone or transect but there were more animals derived from cross-breeding with exotic breeds in the Karakoram Highway transect. The amount of fodder stored for livestock was higher in the Karakoram Highway transect than in the Gilgit–Ghizer Region transect. There was more selling of livestock in the Gilgit–Ghizer Region transect and the use of draught animals was also more prevalent in the Gilgit–Ghizer Region. The household questionnaire indicated that cash cropping, off-farm employment and degree of formal education were all higher in the Karakoram Highway transect, providing indirect evidence for a household economy less reliant on traditional livestock keeping for income. In conclusion, the survey results reveal a traditional small-holder system with heavy reliance on livestock. Householders in the lower altitude zones and those close to transport infrastructure appear to rely less heavily on livestock for income but have fodder resources which are more appropriate for their complement of livestock.

The main constraint in the control and prevention of \{RVF\} is inadequate knowledge on its occurrence during the interepidemic period. This study was aimed at understanding the occurrence of \{RVF\} in cattle in Ijara to enable the development of improved community-based disease surveillance, prediction, control and prevention. Six herds each 700–1000 cattle were identified with participatory involvement of locals and project technical team of the project. One animal per herd was tagged with global position system (GPS) collar to enable follow up. Sero-surveys were conducted periodically to understand the herd's movement through various ecological zones and risk of exposure to \{RVF\} virus. Sixty animals less than 3 years old from each herd were randomly selected each sampling time and sero-surveyed for \{RVF\} four times (September 2012, December 2012, February 2013 and May 2013) during the study period and along the nomadic movement route. The serum samples collected were subjected to \{RVF\} inhibition \{ELISA\} test to detect if there was exposure for \{RVF\} virus (RVFV). The \{RVF\} inhibition \{ELISA\} positive samples were subjected to IgM \{ELISA\} test to determine if the exposures were current or recent (within 14 days). The result of the survey indicated that 13.1% (183/1396) of cattle sero-surveyed had \{RVFV\} antibodies by inhibition \{ELISA\} test while 1.4% (18/1396) was positive for IgM \{ELISA\} test. The highest \{RVFV\} circulation was detected after herds pass through bony forest between Lamu and Ijara and Halei forested areas. These forested areas also had the highest IgM detections. The findings indicate that even limited rainfall was able to initiate \{RVFV\} circulation in Ijara region with highest circulation detected within forested areas with potential to become epidemic if rains persist with extensive flooding. There is need to carry out regular participatory disease surveillance in domestic animals and other host systems to identify risk locations in hotspot areas and carry out community awareness and focal vaccination campaigns against \{RVF\} for preparedness, prevention and control. Additionally, monitoring of environmental conditions in risky ecological zones to detect enhanced rainfall and flooding should be prioritized for preparedness. "

abstract = "Abstract The intensification of agriculture in Europe has contributed significantly to the decline of mixed crop-livestock farms in favour of specialised farms. Specialisation, when accompanied by intensive farming practices, leaves farms poorly equipped to sustainably manage by-products of production, capture beneficial ecological interactions, and adapt in a volatile economic climate. An often proposed solution to overcome these environmental and economic constraints is to recouple crop and livestock production via cooperation between specialised farms. If well-managed, synergies between crop and livestock production beyond farm level have the potential to improve feed and fertiliser autonomy, and pest regulation. However, strategies currently used by farmers to recouple dairy livestock and crop production are poorly documented; there is a need to better assess these strategies using empirical farm data. In this paper, we employed farm surveys to describe, analyse and assess the following strategies: (1) Local exchange of materials among dairy and arable farms; (2) Land renting between dairy and arable farms; (3) Animal exchanges between lowland and mountainous areas; and (4) Industrially mediated transfers of dehydrated fodder. For each strategy, cooperating farm groups were compared to non-cooperating farm groups using indicators of metabolic performance (input autonomy, nutrient cycling and use efficiency), and ecosystem services provision. The results indicate that recoupling of crop and dairy production through farm cooperation gives farmers access to otherwise inaccessible or underutilised local resources such as land, labour, livestock feed or organic nutrients. This in turn leads to additional outlets for by-products (e.g. animal manure). Farmers’ decisions about how to allocate the additional resources accessed via cooperation essentially determine if the farm diversifies, intensifies or expands operations. The key finding is that in three of the four crop-livestock integration strategies assessed, these newly accessed resources facilitated more intensive farming practices (e.g. higher stocking rate or number of milking cows per hectare) on cooperating dairy farms relative to non-cooperating, specialised dairy farms. As a consequence, cooperation was accompanied by limited environmental benefits but helped to improve resource use efficiency per unit of agricultural product produced. This article provides a critical step toward understanding real-world results of crop-livestock cooperation beyond the farm level relative to within-farm crop-livestock integration. As such, it brings practical knowledge of vital importance for policy making to promote sustainable farming. "

Unfortunately, its measurement under field conditions remains challenging because of the difficulty of estimating bite mass. The hand plucking method provides a simple, noninvasive method of estimating bite masses and thus instantaneous intake of grazing herbivores. However, many authors questioned its accuracy and interobserver repeatability. In this study, we tested the accuracy and the repeatability of the hand plucking method using four observers and two herbivore species (i.e., cattle and goats). We compared hand plucked bite mass estimates to actual bite mass of bites taken by the herbivores on natural patches of grass. Training of the observers was fundamental to obtaining accurate bite mass measurements. The mean daily accuracy of the observers’ bite mass estimates increased from 60–80% to 80–94% within 5 d. After training, the relationship between bite mass estimates and actual bite mass was linear and not significantly different from a Y  =  X relationship. This means that individual bite mass estimates were centered on the real values and thus positive and negative errors canceled each other when combined. As a result, estimates of cumulative intake over about 10 feeding stations had accuracies of over 95%. Furthermore, neither the observer identity nor the herbivore species affected the accuracy of the measurements. The categorization of bites into different size categories proved to be essential in achieving accurate measurements. When observers are trained, hand plucking is a reliable and accurate method of estimating bites mass and instantaneous intake of grazing herbivores. This has important implications for rangeland research and management, as hand plucking is often the only practicable method available for estimating instantaneous intake of free-ranging herbivores.

The molecular mechanisms that underlie host cell transformation by T. parva schizonts have been studied extensively, and it is known that the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) is activated in schizont-infected cells, making T. parva-transformed cells resistant to apoptosis. However, the mechanism by which the parasite triggers the activation of NF-κB remains enigmatic. In the present study, we biochemically characterized a novel protein, which we termed TpSCOP (T. parva schizont-derived cytoskeleton-binding protein), which is expressed in the schizont stage of T. parva. TpSCOP was shown to interact with F-actin in vitro. Expression of TpSCOP in a murine lymphocytic cell line resulted in the activation of NF-κB signaling pathways, leading to apoptosis resistance. The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), was also detected. Furthermore, the introduction of TpSCOP into T. parva-infected cells also enhanced the activation of NF-κB. This is the first report to demonstrate that a parasite-derived molecule has the ability to activate the host NF-κB pathway. Based on these results, TpSCOP likely plays an important role in apoptosis inhibition during Theileria infection. "

There is, for example, strong evidence that major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play an essential role in mediating immunity to East Coast fever (ECF), a fatal lymphoproliferative disease of cattle prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and caused by Theileria parva. To complement the more traditional approaches to \{CTL\} antigen identification and vaccine development that we have previously undertaken we propose a use of immunoinformatics to predict \{CTL\} peptide epitopes followed by experimental verification of T cell specificity to candidate epitopes using peptide–MHC (pMHC) tetramers. This system, adapted from human and rodent studies, is in the process of being developed for cattle. Briefly, we have used an artificial neural network called NetMHCpan, which has been trained mainly on existing human, mouse, and non-human primate MHC–peptide binding data in an attempt to predict the peptide-binding specificity of bovine \{MHC\} class I molecules. Our data indicate that this algorithm needs to be further optimized by incorporation of bovine MHC–peptide binding data. When retrained, NetMHCpan may be used to predict parasite peptide epitopes by scanning the predicted T. parva proteome and known parasite \{CTL\} antigens. A range of pMHC tetramers, made “on-demand”, will then be used to assay cattle that are immune to \{ECF\} or in vaccine trials to determine if \{CTLs\} of the predicted epitope specificity are present or not. Thus, pMHC tetramers can be used in one step to identify candidate \{CTL\} antigens and to map \{CTL\} epitopes. Our current research focuses on 9 different BoLA class I molecules. By expanding this repertoire to include the most common bovine MHCs, these methods could be used as generic assays to predict and measure bovine T cell immune responses to any pathogen. "

We conducted a genome wide association study on 352 un-utilized Afghan wheat landraces against stripe rust resistance in eight locations. High level of disease variation was observed among locations and a core-set of germplasm showed consistence performance. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) decayed rapidly (R2 ≈ 0.16 at 0 cM) due to germplasm peerless diversity. The mixed linear model resulted in ten marker-trait associations (MTAs) across all environments representing five QTL. The extensively short \{LD\} blocks required us to repeat the analysis with less diverse subset of 220 landraces in which \{R2\} decayed below 0.2 at 0.3 cM. The subset \{GWAS\} resulted in 36 \{MTAs\} clustered in nine QTL. The subset analysis validated three \{QTL\} previously detected in the full list analysis. Overall, the study revealed that stripe rust epidemics in the geographical origin of this germplasm through time have permitted for selecting novel resistance loci. "

This reaction is quite exergonic and provides a thermodynamic advantage for many ATP-driven biosynthetic reactions. We have previously demonstrated that cytosolic \{PPase\} from R. microplus embryos is an atypical Family I PPase. Here, we explored the functional role of the cysteine residues located at the homodimer interface, its redox sensitivity, as well as structural and kinetic parameters related to thiol redox status. Methods In this work, we used prokaryotic expression system for recombinant protein overexpression, biochemical approaches to assess kinetic parameters, ticks embryos and computational approaches to analyze and predict critical amino acids as well as physicochemical properties at the homodimer interface. Results Cysteine 339, located at the homodimer interface, was found to play an important role in stabilizing a functional cooperativity between the two catalytic sites, as indicated by kinetics and Hill coefficient analyses of the WT-rBmPPase. WT-rBmPPase activity was up-regulated by physiological antioxidant molecules such as reduced glutathione and ascorbic acid. On the other hand, hydrogen peroxide at physiological concentrations decreased the affinity of WT-rBmPPase for its substrate (PPi), probably by inducing disulfide bridge formation. Conclusions Our results provide a new angle in understanding redox control by disulfide bonds formation in enzymes from hematophagous arthropods. The reversibility of the down-regulation is dependent on hydrophobic interactions at the dimer interface. General significance This study is the first report on a soluble \{PPase\} where dimeric cooperativity is regulated by a redox mechanism, according to cysteine redox status. "

On the other hand, elective control programmes based on herd level vaccination, treatment of clinical cases or a combination of both vaccination and treatment enabled individual livestock owners to capture a large benefit in terms of reduced animal-level prevalence and mortality experience.

abstract = "Abstract Agroforestry has attracted considerable attention in recent years because of its potential to reduce poverty, improve food security, reduce land degradation and mitigate climate change. However, progress in promoting agroforestry is held back because decision-makers lack reliable tools to accurately predict yields from tree-crop mixtures. Amongst the key challenges faced in developing such tools are the complexity of agroforestry, including interactions between various system components, and the large spatial domains and timescales over which trees and crops interact. A model that is flexible enough to simulate any agroforestry system globally should be able to address competition and complementarity above and below ground between trees and crops for light, water and nutrients. Most agroforestry practices produce multiple products including food, fiber and fuel, as well as income, shade and other ecosystem services, all of which need to be simulated for a comprehensive understanding of the overall system to emerge. Several agroforestry models and model families have been developed, including SCUAF, HyPAR, Hi-SAFE/Yield-SAFE and WaNuLCAS, but as of 2015 their use has remained limited for reasons including insufficient flexibility, restricted ability to simulate interactions, extensive parameterization needs or lack of model maintenance. An efficient approach to improving the flexibility and durability of agroforestry models is to integrate them into a well-established modular crop modeling framework like APSIM. This framework currently focuses on field-scale crops and pastures, but has the capability to reuse or interoperate with existing models including tree, livestock and landscape models, it uses parameters that are intuitive and relatively easy to measure, and it allows scenario analysis that can include farm-scale economics. Various types of agroforestry systems are currently being promoted in many contexts, and the impacts of these innovations are often unclear. Rapid progress in reliable modeling of tree and crop performance for such systems is needed to ensure that agroforestry fulfills its potential to contribute to reducing poverty, improving food security and fostering sustainability.

We find that at least one sequential cropping system is traditionally used in 35% of all administrative units in the dataset, mainly including maize or groundnuts. We compare six different management scenarios and test their susceptibility as adaptation measure to climate change using the dynamic global vegetation model for managed land LPJmL. Aggregated mean crop yields in sub-Saharan Africa decrease by 6–24% due to climate change depending on the climate scenario and the management strategy. As an exception, some traditional sequential cropping systems in Kenya and South Africa gain by at least 25%. The crop yield decrease is typically weakest in sequential cropping systems and if farmers adapt the sowing date to changing climatic conditions. Crop calorific yields in single cropping systems only reach 40–55% of crop calorific yields obtained in sequential cropping systems at the end of the 21st century. The farmers’ choice of adequate crops, cropping systems and sowing dates can be an important adaptation strategy to climate change and these management options should be considered in climate change impact studies on agriculture.

Agricultural production is highly vulnerable even to 2C (low-end) predictions for global mean temperatures in 2100, with major implications for rural poverty and for both rural and urban food security. Agriculture also presents untapped opportunities for mitigation, given the large land area under crops and rangeland, and the additional mitigation potential of aquaculture. This paper presents a summary of current knowledge on options to support farmers, particularly smallholder farmers, in achieving food security through agriculture under climate change. Actions towards adaptation fall into two broad overlapping areas: (1) accelerated adaptation to progressive climate change over decadal time scales, for example integrated packages of technology, agronomy and policy options for farmers and food systems, and (2) better management of agricultural risks associated with increasing climate variability and extreme events, for example improved climate information services and safety nets. Maximization of agriculture's mitigation potential will require investments in technological innovation and agricultural intensification linked to increased efficiency of inputs, and creation of incentives and monitoring systems that are inclusive of smallholder farmers. Food systems faced with climate change need urgent, broad-based action in spite of uncertainties. "

We have employed a reverse line blot assay to detect the prevalence of tick-borne parasites in an intensively studied cohort of indigenous calves in western Kenya. The calves were recruited close to birth and monitored for the presence of infectious disease for up to 51 weeks. The final visit samples from 453 calves which survived for the study period were analyzed by RLB. The results indicated high prevalences of Theileria mutans (71.6%), T. velifera (62.8%), Anaplasma sp. Omatjenne (42.7%), A. bovis (39.9%), Theileria sp. (sable) (32.7%), T. parva (12.9%) and T. taurotragi (8.5%), with minor occurrences of eight other haemoparasites. The unexpectedly low prevalence of the pathogenic species Ehrlichia ruminantium was confirmed by a species-specific \{PCR\} targeting the pCS20 gene region. Coinfection analyses of the seven most prevalent haemoparasites indicated that they were present as coinfections in over 90% of the cases. The analyses revealed significant associations between several of the Theileria parasites, in particular T. velifera with Theileria sp. sable and T. mutans, and T. parva with T. taurotragi. There was very little coinfection of the two most common Anaplasma species, although they were commonly detected as coinfections with the Theileria parasites. The comparison of reverse line blot and serological results for four haemoparasites (T. parva, T. mutans, A. marginale and B. bigemina) indicated that, except for the mostly benign T. mutans, indigenous cattle seem capable of clearing infections of the three other, pathogenic parasites to below detectable levels. Although the study site was located across four agroecological zones, there was little restriction of the parasites to particular zones. "

abstract = "Abstract Climate change has the potential to impair livestock health, with consequences for animal welfare, productivity, greenhouse gas emissions, and human livelihoods and health. Modelling has an important role in assessing the impacts of climate change on livestock systems and the efficacy of potential adaptation strategies, to support decision making for more efficient, resilient and sustainable production. However, a coherent set of challenges and research priorities for modelling livestock health and pathogens under climate change has not previously been available. To identify such challenges and priorities, researchers from across Europe were engaged in a horizon-scanning study, involving workshop and questionnaire based exercises and focussed literature reviews. Eighteen key challenges were identified and grouped into six categories based on subject-specific and capacity building requirements. Across a number of challenges, the need for inventories relating model types to different applications (e.g. the pathogen species, region, scale of focus and purpose to which they can be applied) was identified, in order to identify gaps in capability in relation to the impacts of climate change on animal health. The need for collaboration and learning across disciplines was highlighted in several challenges, e.g. to better understand and model complex ecological interactions between pathogens, vectors, wildlife hosts and livestock in the context of climate change. Collaboration between socio-economic and biophysical disciplines was seen as important for better engagement with stakeholders and for improved modelling of the costs and benefits of poor livestock health. The need for more comprehensive validation of empirical relationships, for harmonising terminology and measurements, and for building capacity for under-researched nations, systems and health problems indicated the importance of joined up approaches across nations. The challenges and priorities identified can help focus the development of modelling capacity and future research structures in this vital field. Well-funded networks capable of managing the long-term development of shared resources are required in order to create a cohesive modelling community equipped to tackle the complex challenges of climate change.

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) participate in cell cycle control in eukaryotes. \{CDKs\} are serine/threonine protein kinases and these catalytic subunits are activated or inactivated at specific stages of the cell cycle. To determine the potential of using \{CDKs\} as anti-tick vaccine antigens, hamsters were immunized with recombinant Ixodes persulcatus CDK10, followed by a homologous tick challenge. Though it was not exactly unexpected, IpCDK10 vaccination significantly impaired tick blood feeding and fecundity, which manifested as low engorgement weights, poor oviposition, and a reduction in 80% of hatching rates. These findings may underpin the development of more efficacious anti-tick vaccines based on the targeting of cell cycle control proteins. "

abstract = "Summary The estimated heritability of human \{BMI\} is close to 75%, but identified genetic variants explain only a small fraction of interindividual body-weight variation. Inherited epigenetic variants identified in mouse models named “metastable epialleles” could in principle explain this “missing heritability.” We provide evidence that methylation in a variably methylated region (VMR) in the pro-opiomelanocortin gene (POMC), particularly in postmortem human laser-microdissected melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH)-positive neurons, is strongly associated with individual BMI. Using cohorts from different ethnic backgrounds, including a Gambian cohort, we found evidence suggesting that methylation of the \{POMC\} \{VMR\} is established in the early embryo and that offspring methylation correlates with the paternal somatic methylation pattern. Furthermore, it is associated with levels of maternal one-carbon metabolites at conception and stable during postnatal life. Together, these data suggest that the \{POMC\} \{VMR\} may be a human metastable epiallele that influences body-weight regulation. "

It also requires an analysis of causal linkages and feedback loops between systems. These questions and the conceptual approach of the research design of the Climate–Land Interaction Project (CLIP) are rooted in the classical human–environment research tradition in Geography. This paper discusses a methodological framework to quantify the two-way interactions between land use and regional climate systems, using ongoing work by a team of multi-disciplinary scientists examining climate–land dynamics at multiple scales in East Africa. East Africa is a region that is undergoing rapid land use change, where changes in climate would have serious consequences for people’s livelihoods, and requiring new coping and land use strategies. The research involves exploration of linkages between two important foci of global change research, namely, land use/land cover (LULC) and climate change. These linkages are examined through modeling agricultural systems, land use driving forces and patterns, the physical properties of land cover, and the regional climate. Both qualitative and quantitative methods are being used to illustrate a diverse pluralism in scientific discovery. "

Mass rearing and changes in global climate may exacerbate disease and more efficient transmission of parasites in stressed or immune-deficient hosts. Further, human microsporidiosis appears to be adventitious and primarily associated with an increasing community of immune-deficient individuals. Taken together, strong evidence exists for an increasing prevalence of microsporidiosis in animals and humans, and for sharing of pathogens across hosts and biomes. "
