The importance of nutrient recycling of otherwise unused waste materials as an important element and a benefit of integration is emphasised. Approaches for new entrants to explore and plan integration on their farms are presented. In comparison to other enterprises, the pond offers relatively greater potential for integration on farms and for flows of nutrients to and from the new enterprise. Opportunities for integration are classified based on nutrient source and system. The role of \{IAA\} systems in rural livelihoods and the considerations for \{IAA\} under the specific conditions of nutrient-deficient smallholder farms are outlined. The present state of experience in dissemination, uptake and system evolution of \{IAA\} farms is reviewed as well as the achieved impacts in Asia, both on the poor and on commercial developments, based on examples from Bangladesh, China, India and Thailand. It is concluded that considerable potential exists for further aquaculture integration in Asia, with notable improvements in the livelihoods of rural small-scale farmers. "

While some claim that fish trade has a pro-poor effect, others denounce the negative effect of fish export on local populations’ food security and doubt its contributions to the macro-economy. In this paper, we explore this debate in sub-Saharan Africa. Our analysis did not find any evidence of direct negative impact of fish trade on food security; neither did it find evidence that international fish trade generates positive, pro-poor outcomes. This paper discusses the possible reasons for this apparent lack of development impact and highlights the unsupported assumptions underlying the current discourse about international fish trade. We suggest that, given lack of evidence for the development benefits of fish trade between Africa and developed countries, fisheries policy could consider support for regional (Africa-to-Africa) trade that meets the growing African demand for lower-value fish. Means of overcoming barriers to intra-African trade in fish are discussed. "

The objective of the study was to compose a synthetic base population of Nile tilapia for further selective breeding, and to estimate phenotypic and genetic parameters in that population. The base population was formed by choosing parent stock among the best performing animals within the best strain combinations resulting from a full diallel cross design (8 × 8) involving four African wild strains and four Asian farmed strains (64 strain combination cells altogether). The grandparent ancestors of the base population were mainly representing the three strains originating from Egypt, Kenya and Thailand (20.2, 27.3 and 19.6%, respectively). The proportion of ancestors from the Senegal strain was medium (12.2%) whereas the proportion of ancestors from Ghana, Israel, Singapore and Taiwan strains was low (3 to 8%) and mainly due to a restriction that all parent strains should be represented in the synthetic base. Statistical analyses using a mixed animal model were carried out on records from 13,570 individually tagged and surviving progeny of 50 sires and 123 dams. The growth performance of the fish was tested in seven diverse environments. The test environments covered a wide range of tilapia farming systems, namely, earthen ponds fertilized with inorganic fertilizer and organic manure or on-farm agricultural residues, cage culture, and test stations located in different agro-climatic regions. The model fitted included the fixed effect of test environment and sex and the linear and quadratic covariate of age at stocking. The random terms were the additive genetic effect of individual fish and the additional effects common to full-sib groups. The estimates of heritability for body weight at harvest in different test environments ranged from moderate to high (0.12 to 0.56) and the estimate across test environments was 0.15. The variances due to other effects common to full-sib families were significant, accounting for 8 to 16% of total variation in body weight. The genetic correlations among body weights recorded in similar environments were high (mostly &gt; 0.80, i.e. among the earthen ponds in experimental locations). By contrast, the genetic correlations between harvest weight in earthen pond and in cage environments were more variable (0.36–0.82). Overall, the results suggested that the genotype by environment interactions were of limited importance, at least for the target pond farming systems in the Philippines. It was concluded that as the additive genetic variation in the base population was large, the harvest weight of the \{GIFT\} fish could be effectively improved by selective breeding, and that there was no immediate need to develop separate strains for different environments.

Hatchery operators at fifty tilapia hatcheries in four governorates were interviewed and four focus group discussions were held with 61 participants in March 2012. Technical characteristics and economic performance data were obtained for three tilapia hatchery systems: hapa-based in earthen ponds (hapa), hapa-based in greenhouse tunnels (greenhouse) and concrete tanks in greenhouse tunnels with water heating (heated greenhouse). The study showed that the average tilapia hatchery production was 9.92 million seed per year (5.82 million, 12.17 million and 12.25 million for hapa, greenhouse and heated greenhouse systems, respectively) while the average employment level was 4.5 full-time equivalents (FTE). On average 95.8% of hatchery production was sold as fry, while only 4.3% of seed production was sold as fingerlings. Both total costs and total revenues were highest in heated greenhouse hatcheries, followed by greenhouse-based and lowest in hapa-based systems. Net profits were highest in greenhouse-based systems (45.1% of sales), compared to both heated greenhouse (33.2% of sales) and hapa-based systems (37.6% of sales). Focus group discussions showed that hatchery operators currently face many critical factors: shortages of good quality brood fish; poor water quality and shortages of water; high fuel costs; lack of access to affordable finance; a ban on fry transport between governorates; and limited knowledge of best management practices. The study concluded that greenhouse-based hatcheries are more profitable than heated greenhouse systems which produce more but face additional costs and hapa-based hatcheries which are low-cost but have a shorter production period. Greenhouse-based hatcheries are also more likely to remain profitable when faced with financial shocks. "

The number of recruitment peaks, growth performance index (φ′) and exploitation ratio (E=F/Z) was also assessed for each species. Routines in the FAO-ICLARM Stock Assessment Tools (FiSAT) software were used to estimate the parameters from length distribution data collected during a trawl survey in the coastal waters (10–100 m depth) of Brunei Darussalam from July 1989 to June 1990. The key parameters were used in yield- (Y/R) and biomass-per-recruit (B/R) analyses to derive reference points and evaluate the exploitation status of the 25 species. The E estimates for the 25 species were compared with those from other studies conducted in South and Southeast Asia to assess the relative exploitation status of demersal fish stocks in Brunei Darussalam. The other parameters obtained were also compared with available estimates to evaluate consistency of the results with current knowledge about the species in the region. The 25 species studied represented 70% of demersal abundance off Brunei Darussalam during the 1989–1990 survey. Relatively high K (and low L∞) values, typical of short-lived tropical fishes, were obtained for most (22) of the species. Combined with the high Z (0.85–3.40) and M (0.73–3.10) estimates, these results imply low annual survival and high turnover rates. All 25 species exhibited year-round recruitment, with 20 species having two recruitment peaks annually and five species having a single annual recruitment peak. The φ′ (2.05–3.32) and M parameters obtained were consistent with those available in the literature for the 25 species. The values of F (0.03–0.72) and E (0.02–0.27), however, were low compared to other assessments conducted in South and Southeast Asia. Estimates of E for the 25 species were also low compared to the E0.1 (0.31–0.42) reference points obtained from the Y/R and B/R analyses. Low length-at-first capture was evident for 6 of the 25 species, although this is technologically difficult to avoid in multispecies fisheries. Overall, the results indicate that the 25 fish species were lightly fished in 1989–1990. The results provide baseline information (as well as reference points) that can be incorporated into wider reference systems relevant to current fisheries assessment and management in Brunei Darussalam, and are relevant to further (multispecies or ecosystem) studies of fisheries in the country and the region.

The outputs of this initiative are presented in the next four papers of this volume of Fisheries Research. The assessments have highlighted two disturbing regional trends: coastal fisheries resources are severely depleted, biological and economic overfishing is occurring throughout the region. These are symptoms of the lack of effective management of fishing capacity in the region. This overview paper highlights the urgent need to reduce fishing capacity in the region. Only through such capacity reduction strategies can fish stocks be rebuilt to more productive and sustainable levels so that potential economic and social benefits from fisheries can be realized. Strategies need to be country- and fishery-specific and should focus on the development of effective access and property-rights regimes. For instance, countries need to explicitly allocate rights between small-scale and industrial fisheries, where resources are shared. This will require an understanding of the overlap between the sectors in terms of resource use and also the relative economic and social benefits from each sector. "

abstract = "Egypt's aquaculture production (705,490 tonnes in 2009) is by far the largest of any African country and places it 11th in terms of global aquaculture production. The aquaculture sector in Egypt is now a mature one having developed over a period of more than 30 years, but the financial performance of the sector is not well understood or documented, even though value-chain analysis provides a methodological tool to do so. To provide a better understanding of the sector, a WorldFish Center study completed in September 2011 and funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, conducted a value-chain analysis of the pond fish farming sector. The sector concentrates on the production of tilapia with additional production of mullet, catfish and carp from earthen ponds. The study mapped the value-chain and showed that there is no processing and virtually no export of farmed fish, a short time-period from harvest to final consumption by the consumer (typically around one day) due to the live/fresh nature of all sales, and very low rates (&lt; 1%) of post-harvest losses. Quantitative data were collected for each link in the value-chain on operational and financial performance (e.g. gross output values, variable and fixed costs, operational and net profit margins, value-added generation), and on employment creation (by gender, age and full-time/part-time). The results showed that the industry generates a combined \{LE\} 4619 ($775) of value-added (i.e. profits plus wages/earnings) for farmers, traders and retailers for each tonne of fish produced. Employment generation is also significant with around 14 full-time equivalent jobs generated for every 100 tonnes of fish produced. However, the sector as a whole is under increasing financial pressure. Critical factors impacting on the performance of the value-chain relate to inputs (most importantly to rising feed costs and the poor quality of fry), to production (most importantly to poor practices with regard to feed management, farm design and construction, fish health management, and stocking densities), and to the marketing, transportation and sale of product (most importantly to declining fish prices in real terms, consumer preference for wild fish and a distrust of filleted/processed products, fluctuating seasonal prices, poor hygiene and handling practices, the lack of value-addition through processing, and the lack of exports). This paper highlights the benefits of value-chain analysis as a useful tool to understand sector performance and argues for its wider use in identifying critical factors and actions to support aquaculture sector improvements.

Rapid expansion of commercial aquaculture pegged down fish prices, resulting in increased fish consumption by extreme poor and moderate poor consumers and those in rural areas. These outcomes are closely linked to the pro-poor nature of national economic growth during this period. These findings contribute to a broadening of the debate on whether the growth of aquaculture in Bangladesh has been pro-poor. "

Mean survival of H. scabra at the mangrove–seagrass sites was 95–100% 1 h after release and approximated 70% 3 days later. At the coral reef flat sites, however, mean survival was as low as 37.5% 1 h after release and total mortality occurred in two of the three releases within 48 h. Mortality of the juvenile H. scabra was due mainly to predation by fish in the families Balistidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae and Nemipteridae. Survival of juvenile H. scabra was improved significantly by releasing them within a cage of 8-mm mesh. This procedure resulted in 100% survival of juveniles in the coral reef flat habitat during the course of the experiment. Our data indicate that mangrove–seagrass areas should be suitable habitats for release of cultured juvenile sandfish in restocking and stock enhancement programs. Release of sandfish at night, to coincide with the time they emerge during their inherent diel burrowing cycle, and the short-term use of protective cages, should be investigated to improve survival of individuals released in mangrove–seagrass habitats.

Aeromonas hydrophila, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas species and two Gram-positive isolates (Bacillus pumilus and Bacillus firmus) were identified. A total of 120 O. niloticus were used to evaluate the pathogenicity of Aeromonas hydrophila and 240 O. niloticus were used to assess the safety of the isolated probiotics. Three out of the 15 isolates examined (B. pumilus, B. firmus and C. freundii) showed inhibitory effects against A. hydrophila in vitro and did not cause either disease sings or mortalities in case of B. pumilus and B. firmus when injected into the fish. Diets were prepared and supplemented with isolates which showed the greatest promise as probiotics. The viability of the bacteria in the diets was assessed following storage of the diet at 4 and 25 °C for five weeks. B. pumilus survived at either 4 °C or 25 °C for five weeks. B. firmus and C. freundii survived at 4 °C at week 5 and week 4 of storage respectively, but they were no longer viable in the feed stored at 25 °C after 2 and 1 weeks of storage, respectively. Feeding experiments were conducted on 600 O. niloticus using the diets containing single or mixed isolated probiotic bacteria. A challenge test was carried out on the fish fed supplement diets using pathogenic A. hydrophila to assess their disease resistance to the bacterium. Fish that received feed supplemented with probiotics showed no evidence of disease after challenge infection. Survival was highest with fish fed diets supplemented with B. pumilus, followed by a mixture of probiotics, and then C. freundii. B. pumilus appears promising as a probiotic for controlling A. hydrophila infection among O. niloticus. "

I is the insulation coefficient and can be estimated as follows: I=WV·W−1S·lnTdb−lnTde·t−1, where Tdb is the difference in temperature between water and air at the beginning of time interval t, and Tde is the difference in temperature between water and air at the end of the time interval. The average insulation coefficient for a standard Styrofoam box with 2.5 cm wall thickness and filled with about 8 ℓ water is I=0.11. The total surface area of the water in the box can be determined as follows: WS=2·BLi·BWi+2·WV/BWi+2·WV/BLi, where \{WS\} is the surface area in cm2, \{BLi\} is the inner length and \{BWi\} is the inner width of the box in cm. Using thicker Styrofoam boxes or increasing insulation by other means is appropriate during Northern Hemisphere cold spells. Adding bags with hot water is less effective, but may be chosen when other means are not available. A better designed, cube-shaped Styrofoam box is suggested as the most promising and cost-effective measure to reduce mortalities resulting from heat loss during transport. "

The breeding program was initiated using two wild caught populations from Thailand and Indonesia and an existing local stock from Bangladesh. To produce the parental base population in 1996, the three unrelated founder stocks were mated through a complete 3×3 diallele crossing experiment to produce nine heterogeneous, outbred genetic groups. In 1997, the first generation (F1) trials were made. For each of the six reciprocal crosses, five to eight pairs were mated separately and the best three progeny groups were selected on the basis of egg fertilization rate, lack of deformities, healthy movement, and survival to make 18 full sib progeny lines. These were then communally stocked by mixing equal numbers of larvae from each family and grown until maturity in ponds. During the spawning season of 1998, the heaviest 20% of mature females and males were mass selected from the \{F1\} communal crossbred group and mated to produce the \{F2\} generation. In 1999, mass selection was again performed, selecting 15% of the best mature breeders from the \{F2\} generation to produce the third generation (F3) for trials. In each generation, evaluation of growth performance was carried out through comparative trials between selected and nonselected control (existing stock of Bangladesh, B×B) groups. A 7.5% genetic gain in growth performance was attained by the \{F1\} crossbred group over the nonselected control group. The \{F2\} and \{F3\} selected groups attained 2.3% and 12.1% cumulative weight gain, respectively, over two generations. The average gain per generation across two generations of selection for growth performance in weight was estimated as 7.2%. The weight gain values of the third generation of the selected group showed 21.9% superiority over the nonselected control. Present findings suggest that the method for improvement of silver barb through several generations of genetic selection might be a useful technique for other carp species in Bangladesh and elsewhere in Asia.

Positive correlations were observed between size at stocking and size at harvest. The magnitude of correlations, however, decreased towards the end of the production cycle. Predictability of final body weight was highest when body weights of males and females were greater than 33 g and 25 g, respectively. Onset of sexual maturation seemed to reduce predictability.

Four smallholder rice farms (1.36–2.76 hectares) — including monoculture rice and diverse rice-based systems with livestock, aquaculture, tree, and vegetable components — are used to illustrate the approach. Data collection employs a range of techniques (bioresource flow diagramming, farm transects, direct observation, field measurements, farm records, and informal discussions). Weekly data gatherings are used to construct annual, mass-balance, nutrient (nitrogen) flow models of each farm system. The models form the basis for quantifying a series of agroecological system attributes (species richness, agricultural diversity, efficiency, harvest index, productivity, nutrient cycling, throughput, standing biomass, production/biomass, biomass/throughput, and agroecosystem nutrient balance) and economic properties (gross margin and returns to labour) for each farm. The comparative analysis suggests that what we perceive as ecologically sound farming, i.e. diverse and integrated natural resources management, can indeed be productive, profitable, and manageable, given access to labour and secure tenure. This type of analytical framework can help operationalise the sustainability concept. "

Coastal settlements are generally densely populated with widespread poverty, especially among fishing communities. The Segara Anakan is a nursery ground that supports both a lagoon and offshore shrimp fishery. Mangroves are extensive and are traditionally exploited by the coastal communities. Key management issues are the decreasing size of the lagoon due to heavy sediment input from upland activities, water quality problems, particularly pesticides runoff from upland agriculture and poor economic conditions of the coastal inhabitants. Lingayen Gulf is a major fishing ground in the Philippines and an important aquaculture site for milkfish and oysters. In addition, coral reefs and seagrass beds are extensive and sandy beaches along the eastern side are popular tourist attractions. Significant management issues include destruction of coral reefs due to blast fishing, cyanide poisoning and trawling activities as well as rural poverty. Also, coastal water quality is undermined by indiscriminate dumping of untreated domestic wastes, pesticides and mine tailings from upland mining operations. Efforts to develop integrated coastal area management plans for the two sites are currently being undertaken to resolve the aforementioned issues and provide some strategies for the sustainable development of the coastal resources as well as alternative livelihood for the coastal inhabitants. The mechanisms of plan development for both sites, including legal and institutional support, are discussed in the context of regional and local organizations/communities participation. "

Analysis revealed clear evidence of positive income and consumption effects of aquaculture on households. However, employment effects are still not significant. The context of targeting small-scale and subsistence-oriented farmers as a means of improving food security in the developing countries has also been analyzed by identifying key socio-economic and policy factors affecting aquaculture adoption and its impact on the poor. The paper concludes that national policies for aquaculture development will need to concurrently address the food security and poverty questions more sharply than has been done at present, by providing institutional and infrastructure support for access to resources such as land and water and to markets by poor households. Finally, more empirical evidence should be collected on the varied opportunities aquaculture would provide to improve the income, employment and food consumption levels within households. "

Aquaculture and related technologies were introduced to a total of 3594 resource-poor Adivasi households. Baseline and end-line surveys were applied to assess the changes in their livelihoods following intervention. Household incomes of project participants rose significantly (p ≤ 0.01), which was attributed to the increased share of aquaculture and related enterprises from 15% in 2007 to nearly 30% in 2009 in terms of annual household incomes. By contrast, the contribution of aquaculture to household incomes remained virtually unchanged (p &gt; 0.05) among non-project participants. The monthly frequency of fish, meat and egg consumption increased between 2007 and 2009 (p ≤ 0.01), confirming improved food and nutrition security among project participants. Although non-project participants also slightly increased their fish consumption, it remained significantly lower (p ≤ 0.01) than that of the project participants. The results from the present study contradict the prevailing view that aquaculture is inappropriate for landless, socially marginalized and extremely poor communities by demonstrating its relevance to improving livelihoods, provided that a diversified approach is followed and interventions are tailored to needs and capabilities of target households.

This paper assesses the outcomes of investments in improving carp seed quality and farmer training, targeting poor and women fish farmers, on the productivity and profitability of homestead aquaculture systems in Southwest Bangladesh. The paper also assesses the effect of factors such as stocking density, use of fertilizer and feed, farmers’ characteristics and location on fish yields and determines the major driving factors influencing adoption of improved practices. The results show that farmers who used improved carp seed and received training had higher yield and profit from homestead aquaculture than farmers who received training but did not use improved seed. Both of these farmer categories had higher homestead pond yields and profit than those who did not receive training but used improved seed and all three categories were found to have higher yield and profit than the control group. These results suggest that using improved seed without technical advice is unlikely to have a significant impact on aquaculture productivity and profitability while training without using improved quality seed is likely to have a positive impact on these outcomes. These results are supported by a multiple regression model which shows that, when controlling for other factors, farmers who had been trained and used improved seed were 52% more productive than the control group, while those who had been trained and did not use improved seed were 15% more productive. There was no significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) in productivity between farmers who had not received training but used improved quality seed and the control group. Location, stocking density, pond water area and experience were also found to significantly influence homestead pond productivity. The additional net return generated by farmers as a result of investments in improved seed and training is estimated to be approximately US$ 470,000 and US$ 210,000 for training alone, representing a return on investment (ROI) of 285% and 394% respectively. Despite the high ROI, the modest absolute increases in income and production estimated for participating households, due mostly to the low base from which growth is taking place, suggests the need for future investments to bring about relatively higher rates of productivity increases if they are to have meaningful impacts on household production and income. Overall, these results suggest that it is not enough for aquaculture development interventions to focus only on the technical fix of improved seed, rather capacity building of farmers is also crucial if aquaculture productivity and profitability are to be successfully improved.

The first was that collections of spat of the blacklip pearl oyster, Pinctada margaritifera, should be greater from offshore than inshore zones in ‘open’ reef systems adjacent to high islands. The second was that the lack of heavy run-off from land-masses will result in greater abundance of spat being caught from inshore zones during the dry season as compared to the wet season, whereas offshore zones less influenced by run-off should have catches that are comparable between seasons. Sampling was done at three sites within inshore and offshore zones at two regions (Gizo and Noro) in Solomon Islands, during the dry and wet seasons of 1996–1997. During both seasons, abundances of spat from offshore zones were significantly greater than from inshore zones in both regions. However, the two patterns of distribution in the second prediction were upheld at only one region: there was a dramatic decline in abundance of spat between the dry and wet season at Noro, and there was no difference in the number of spat caught inshore during the dry season and wet season at Gizo. In addition to natural fluctuations in settlement of spat over space and time, patterns of distribution between inshore and offshore zones corresponded to variations in salinity and water clarity, and current speed. However, the exact mechanism(s) determining the distribution of spat between inshore and offshore zones cannot be identified until experiments on the effects of land run-off on collections of spat are completed, and until plankton surveys are done to quantify variation in supply of larvae to inshore and offshore zones.

The standardized fishing effort allowed for comparison of the impact of various gears in the fishery. The fishing effort functions were useful in evaluating the impacts of alternative regulations or policies for reducing fishing intensity. For instance, if restrictions on gross tonnage or vessel capacity are implemented, the largest decrease in fishing effort would come from the commercial sector of the Danish seine and encircling gill net fleets.

It is stated that flatfish are overadapted to feeding on zoobenthic in- and epifauna. In combination with a trend of decreasing importance of the benthic system towards the tropics, this suggests an increasing importance of food-limitation with decreasing latitude and as a consequence lower biomass values. Furthermore, the general increase of maintenance metabolism with temperature reduces in tropical systems the size of flatfish at which oxygen limits further growth. This aspect is responsible for the general trend of a smaller flatfish size with decreasing latitude. Finally, implications for future flatfish research are discussed. "

Records were available over three spawning seasons (2002, 2003 and 2004) for weight at the beginning of communal rearing (initial weight), harvest weight and survival rate. The dataset consisted of 9267 progeny records from 214 sires and 323 dams. Phenotypic and genetic parameters, as well as response to selection, were estimated fitting an animal model as well as a sire and dam model to the data. Initial and harvest weight were transformed to log10 for analysis. The heritabilities (s.e.) from the animal model for initial weight, harvest weight and survival were 0.106 (0.0576), 0.144 (0.0598) and 0.120 (0.0346), respectively, whereas the corresponding maternal and common environmental effects, c2, were 0.652 (0.0475), 0.384 (0.0496) and 0.015 (0.0214), respectively. The genetic correlations had large standard errors, but they were in a favorable direction, especially between harvest weight and survival [0.458 (0.2035)]. Response to selection was estimated in two different ways: (i) from the difference in average breeding values between generations, and (ii) from the difference in breeding value between the selection and the control lines. Using the former method the responses in harvest weight were 6.64 and 6.96%, comparing the progeny of the 2002 with 2003, and 2003 with 2004 spawnings, respectively, giving a cumulative response of about 14% in two generations. With the second method, the difference between the control and selection line in 2004 was 3.82%. The results are discussed in relation to other selection work conducted with tilapia, and the future direction of the genetic improvement program is outlined. "

The outcomes so far are assessed with respect to social, institutional, and physical context, and the interactions that arose in establishing CBFM. The lessons drawn are that: it was essential that communities obtained rights over the fisheries, strong facilitation was necessary, taking up visible resource management actions greatly helped, success was more likely in homogeneous communities, external threats were a strong limiting factor, clear boundaries and small fisheries were not so critical, and new institutions could be built with as much ease (or difficulty) as modifying existing ones. Effective well-defined partnerships of \{NGOs\} and government were not easy to establish but were sufficiently beneficial that in several locations new community institutions for fisheries management were established. This is a slow process, the sustainability of local management institutions is not yet established, although they continued during an interim period without funding, further phased support is planned to strengthen these organizations and to generate evidence of impacts and momentum to influence wider fisheries policy in and beyond Bangladesh.

A total of 789 farmers from 10 sub-districts in Khulna Division were surveyed randomly, including a control group of 350 farmers using traditional technologies. Farmers gained significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) net returns when practicing improved shrimp farming systems as compared to traditional farms. The profitability of \{CST\} farms was more than double that of \{MTT\} farms, and the profitability of \{MTT\} farms was more than that of traditional farms. Similar (P &gt; 0.05) financial benefit was derived from adoption of \{MTT1\} and \{MTT2\} technologies. Feed use, stocking density, gher size and white spot syndrome virus incidence were key factors associated with the economic returns of \{CST\} farms, while various supplementary feed inputs made a significant positive contribution towards increased return for the \{MTT\} farms.

abstract = "Abstract Land based aquaculture has the potential to mitigate future shortfalls of food fish supply in Solomon Islands. However, aquaculture is relatively new in the Pacific and such potential is hampered by a lack of aquaculture knowledge and practice within local cultures. A participatory action research approach was used to conduct on-farm trials with farmers in Solomon Islands to develop relevant and improved ways of farming and maximising productivity of the resident exotic tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus. During the 34 month period when the research was undertaken improvements were evident, through increased farmer participation and improved knowledge of farmers on pond design and fish husbandry techniques. One of the contributing factors to improved farmer understanding was the production of knowledge products which were co-developed with and based on the farmers' local context. Productivity of a typical 20–38 m2 pond ranged from 726 to 1819 kg ha− 1 year− 1. Because 80% of this production was consumed by households, such ponds, producing easily harvestable small tilapia, have a role in supplementing household diets and contributing to improved nutrition at the subsistence level. While pond system productivity reached levels equivalent to low input tilapia ponds in other regions, the resident tilapia in Solomon Islands has limited opportunity for more than low level commercial enterprises. Established ponds are included in the daily livelihood tasks of both men and women and explicitly gender equitable approaches to partnerships with pond farmers provide opportunities to further increase benefits to households. A participatory action research approach, and the principles embodied therein, is recommended for further development of household aquaculture enterprises, regardless of species, in Solomon Islands. Statement of relevance We feel that our paper makes significant and novel advance to the field of aquaculture by:(1) Presenting results of a research that shows the importance and potential role of aquaculture in mitigating food and nutrition security in locations where it is increasingly difficult to access fish based protein sources, even in a South Pacific location perceived to contain an abundance of fish. (2) Participatory Action Research (PAR) has been employed in agriculture and aquaculture in Asia and Africa in the last 20 years. We report in here the use of the \{PAR\} method within the Pacific Islands context in conducting research and developing aquaculture in a location where there is very little history of aquaculture within the local culture.

Light traps set concurrently at Discovery Bay and at three fringing reefs in \{BVI\} caught many species of pre-settlement reef fishes, except grunts and parrotfish, and one \{BVI\} site (Hans Creek) may be an area of particularly high settlement.

Settlement rates of unexploited species were more similar in Discovery Bay and BVI. Abundances of juvenile fish caught in wire-mesh traps were monitored over several years in Discovery Bay and at three sites in BVI. Consistently low numbers of exploited species were taken at Discovery Bay compared to the \{BVI\} sites, indicating that settlement and recruitment rates have been low in recent years.

Defining resource boundaries and measuring connectivity in the marine environment, however, has not been easy. Asian developing countries, where the capability to use molecular genetic tools in fisheries and aquaculture has escalated in the last few years, are exploring the use of genetic markers as a means to obtain the elusive answers. The challenge is to test the potential of molecular methods and their usefulness to provide some indication of resource boundaries and connectivity among management units in the context of developing countries.

Average size and reproductive performance of broods from the deep zone were significantly higher than those of broods caught from the shallow zone. The incidence of \{WSSV\} infection in shallow zone broods was much higher than that in deep zone broods. The association between depth zone and \{WSSV\} infection is independent of brood size. \{WSSV\} infection is negatively associated with hatching rate, irrespective of location. Exclusive use of tiger shrimp broods collected from the deep zone could reduce vertical transmission of \{WSSV\} by 46% without additional management measures.

An industry structure was assumed whereby the genetic improvement program is conducted in a nucleus which provides brood stock to hatcheries, which in turn produce fry for farmers to grow out to market size. Discounting was used to express all returns and costs in terms of net present value. The economic benefit (discounted returns minus discounted costs, EB) and the benefit/cost ratio (BCR) were studied for a 10 year time horizon. The sensitivity of \{EB\} and \{BCR\} to a number of factors was examined, namely: (i) Biological (heritability values, accounting for feed intake), (ii) Economic (initial investment, annual cost, discount rate, price of fish), and (iii) Operational (year when first return occurs, reproductive efficiency). The risk involved was assessed by studying the anticipated variability in response to selection (and hence in \{EB\} and BCR). Heritability values had a moderate effect, whereas it was shown that the cost of increased feed intake as a correlated response to selection for greater growth rate should be considered to avoid gross over-estimations of \{EB\} and BCR. Initial investment, annual costs and choice of discount rate had a relatively small effect on \{EB\} and BCR, whereas the effect of the price of fish was substantial. Delays in obtaining the first returns in the program resulted in reduced \{EB\} and BCR. However, the greatest contribution to variations in \{EB\} and \{BCR\} came from improvements in the reproductive efficiency at the level of both the nucleus and the hatcheries. The risk of program's failure due to technical reasons was found to be extremely low. We conclude that even under the most conservative assumptions, genetic improvement programs are highly beneficial from an economic viewpoint, and that for the case studied they could result in \{EBs\} ranging from over four million US$ to 32 million US$, and corresponding \{BCRs\} of 8.5 to 60.

A range of actions or ‘coping strategies’ were employed by households to ensure that their families had sufficient food and income resources to survive in the months following the cyclone. Coping strategies adopted by the households were categorized into three groups (i) food related, ii) income generated through selling assets, and iii) income generated though borrowing money. We found that the range of coping strategies adopted did not depend statistically on access to aquaculture assets, indicating that neither group (those with aquaculture assets and those without aquaculture assets) was better equipped to cope with the disaster. Aquaculture ponds were, however, important for supplying food and income in the post-disaster period and 78% of households were willing to re-invest in aquaculture despite the risk of stock losses and damage to infrastructure during recurrent disasters. It is concluded that aquaculture ponds are likely to provide a mechanism for coping after a disaster, despite the costs involved in repairing them. We recommend that aquaculture development be promoted for income and food security for rural families but that development occurs in areas that does not compromise other ecosystem functions i.e., mangrove forests. Risk management strategies, such as raising fast growing fish, which shortens the production cycle and allows for early harvesting, be embedded into policy reforms. We also recommend that a diversified livelihood strategy including non-farm activities be included in the reforms. "

Using the case of Lake Volta in Ghana, the paper investigates the social and economic impacts of this technique, looking in particular into issues of income, assets and (re)distribution of the wealth created by those acadjas. Our analysis shows that the impact of acadjas on fishing communities is mixed. While acadja certainly helps to enhance the supply of protein-rich food and may have trickle down effects at the community level, those positive contributions are greatly reduced by other more negative effects. The data show in particular that acadjas are not a poor-neutral technology in the sense that their contribution to household income seems to benefit disproportionably the wealthiest owners. As such, acadja fisheries often create negative sentiments amongst the households who cannot afford investing in this technology, creating a situation which may lead to social tension and intra-community conflicts.

The strengths and weaknesses of each link of the value chain were assessed and appropriate upgrading, management and development strategies were suggested. Quantitative data were collected for each link in the value-chain through structured questionnaires that were drafted and distributed to the key players in the sector; 25 fish feed mills and 34 fish farms covering different geographical and production regions. The results indicated that the Egyptian aquafeed value-chain is relatively simple; including only four main stakeholder groups. These are feed input suppliers, aquafeed producers, aquafeed marketers and traders and fish farmers. Between 50 and 99% of feed ingredients used in aquafeed production in Egypt are imported. About 90% of Egyptian aquafeeds are produced by the private sector in the form of conventionally pressed, pelleted feeds (80–85%) and extruded feeds (15–20%). About 85% of those producers sell their feeds directly to farmers with payment either in cash or on credit, while the remaining 15% sell through intermediaries such as traders. State-owned mills produced only 10% of total commercial fish feed production in 2012, exclusively in the form of pressed, pelleted feeds. Employment generation in private sector feed mills was 29.2 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs per mill, with an average of 3.9 jobs per 1000 tonnes of feed produced. Employment generation in state-owned mills was much higher; with an average of 90.3 \{FTE\} per mill. Males represented 90% of the full-time employment in the state-owned mills and 96.6% in the private sector. Feed costs represent 75–90% of the total operating costs of the fish farms. The major factors impacting on the performance of the value-chain relate to inputs, to feed production, to fish farmers and to marketing and financial services. The study recommends actions to mitigate these issues including the local production of more feed raw materials, strengthening quality control and inspection, providing training for feed mills, better organization of fish farmers and improving the legal and policy environment.

abstract = "Abstract Egyptian aquaculture production has grown rapidly to over one million tons per year so that it now provides most of the country's fish supply. However, Egyptian fish farmers have received little extension advice or training. An intervention starting in 2012 aimed to address this gap by providing best management practice (BMP) training for pondbased tilapia monoculture and tilapia-mullet polyculture fish farmers. A series of field-based training modules were developed and designed with the participation of leading fish farmers and delivered through private sector farmer-trainers to over 2400 fish farm owners and managers. This paper reports on the results of an impact assessment survey carried out in 2015 comparing fish farm performance, production and profitability in randomly selected farms where the manager had received and was applying the principles of \{BMP\} training (BMP) and farms where the manager had not received \{IEIDEAS\} project training (control). The results show that although the two groups were very similar in terms of general farm characteristics, \{BMP\} farms were more likely to practice tilapia-mullet polyculture than monoculture of tilapia. The main \{BMP\} training messages apparent in the results were improved feed and fertilizer management. This resulted in more efficient food conversion ratios in \{BMP\} farms compared to control farms. Average fish yields and values were similar between the two groups, although \{BMP\} farms produced less small-sized tilapia and more mullet than the control farms. Lower feed costs resulted in significantly lower operating costs in \{BMP\} farms compared to control farms, whereas fixed costs were similar for the two groups. Average net profits were significantly higher in \{BMP\} farms compared to control farms equivalent to additional profits of over $15,000 for an average farm size of 7.5 hectares. Taking into account the number of farmers trained and \{BMP\} adoption rates suggests that $18.9 million additional profits were generated through the intervention in 2014. The results demonstrate that fish farms in mature aquaculture systems can benefit significantly from the adoption of improved farm management practices suggesting that similar approaches, including field-based \{BMP\} training and the use of private sector farmer-trainers should be used to accelerate the development of nascent aquaculture sectors in other parts of Africa. Statement of relevance While it is often assumed that training will benefit fish farmers the true economic benefits have rarely been documented. This research demonstrates clear improvements in the profitability of Egyptian fish farmers following best management practice training. "

Fifty spat collectors were deployed at each site every 3 months and harvested 6 months later. Several different types of spat collector, made of black plastic sheeting or shademesh, were used during the study. Spat were most abundant on shademesh collectors deployed in October and January. At these times, there was an average of 3.0–4.6 spat per collector at the two sites with the greatest abundance of spat. Another 10 sites have average abundances of around 1.0 spat per collector. Sites subject to run-off from high islands yielded the lowest numbers of spat because the collectors placed there became heavily fouled. On the other hand, sites that had clear water, moderate currents, and that were &gt;35 m from the nearest reef, produced the greatest numbers of spat. However, there was mortality of spat at all sites and 42% of all spat collected were dead at harvest. Much of this mortality was attributed to predation by Cymatium gastropods and crabs that also settled on the collectors. This study showed that there is a potential to collect wild spat for the culture of blacklip pearl oysters from `open' lagoons of the central–western Pacific, provided the high rates of mortality of spat on collectors can be overcome.

One of these is the tendency for initial guesses (e.g. of the relations between optimal catches and production, of conversion efficiencies between trophic levels, or of the trophic level of harvested fish) to become legitimized with age. This has led to debates on potential yields turning into circular arguments. Obviously, a way out of this is also proposed. "

This study tested a new strategy for reducing the mortality of spat on collectors. The existing practice of leaving spat on collectors for 6 months was compared with removal of spat after 3, 4 or 5 months, followed by the rearing of the spat in panel nets to facilitate removal of predators. In one of two field experiments, there were significantly fewer spat on collectors after six months than after 3–4 months. A similar, but non-significant, trend occurred for the other field experiment. A tagging experiment showed that survival of spat left on collectors between months 4 and 6 was 58%. By contrast, spat removed from collectors after 3 and 4 months at a mean size of &gt;15 mm dorso-ventral measurement (DVM), and reared in panel nets, had mean rates of survival of 82 and 93%, respectively. Provided spat are a mean size of &gt;15 mm \{DVM\} when removed from collectors, and there is adequate husbandry of spat in intermediate culture systems, greater numbers of blacklip pearl oysters can be produced in the western Pacific by using a 3–4-month cycle for collecting spat.

The nation's population is growing rapidly and continues to depend heavily on inshore marine resources, particularly finfish, for subsistence. In the past decade, there have been substantial exports of bêche-de-mer (processed sea cucumber), trochus shell, pearl oyster shell, green snail shell, turtle shell and crocodile skin. In late 1993, export of turtle shell and crocodile skin was banned in response to an obvious need for the conservation of these species. The export of pearl oyster shell was also prohibited in late 1993, to foster the development of aquaculture, by improving the supply of wild spat and by ensuring that there were sufficient numbers of wild oysters to provide broodstock for future hatcheries. Since 1986, there has been active research in Solomon Islands on the aquaculture of giant clams to improve their future export value and provide opportunities to reseed denuded reefs. Simple controls, e.g. minimum and maximum size limits, have been placed on the harvest of several non finfish species, and closed seasons have been self-imposed on sea cucumber and trochus by some communities. Increased use of self-imposed regulations by customary owners and a variety of conservative common-sense management measures would help to ensure that the stocks of the main export commodities, such as sea cucumber, trochus and green snail, provide sustainable and lucrative harvests in the future.

Fishing in this very remote rural region of \{DRC\} is operated both by men and women, as part of a household multiple activity livelihood strategy. The data shows that poor households rely heavily on fishing for their supply of protein-rich food, in particular through women’s subsistence catches. Fishing also appears to be the main source of cash-income for the majority of households, including local farmers. Based on these findings and a review of the literature, the paper argues that small-scale fisheries can play a fundamental role in local economies, especially in remote rural areas where they strengthen significantly the livelihoods of people through their role in both food security and cash-income generation.

We began our work with a belief that community transformation can be achieved only if all community members, including women, participate actively in development projects. We adopted a gender transformative participatory action research approach. We find that before initiating participatory projects, it is critical to address gendered power asymmetries through capacity development to enable marginalised groups to effectively participate in decision making processes. By opening space for leadership to emerge from marginalised groups, participatory action research can bring about transformative and sustainable outcomes. When their needs are genuinely addressed, community members can champion development activities that transform their communities. Implementing such initiatives, however, requires substantial investment and a fundamental change in the way participatory development initiatives are implemented. "

The present study aimed at evaluating any relative environmental gains that \{BMP\} and \{G9\} offers compared to conventional farming using life cycle assessment (LCA). Inventory data representing 137 farmers and four groups (control, BMP, \{G9\} and \{BMP\} + G9) were evaluated. Life cycle impact assessment results including quantitative uncertainties were then calculated and statistically tested, using Monte Carlo analysis and Wilcoxon paired significance test. Five impact categories were explored: global warming, eutrophication, acidification, freshwater consumption and land use. The \{G9\} stain offered the greatest improvements across the evaluated impact categories, significantly reducing environmental impacts with between 12% and 36%. BMP, in the meantime, only offered significant improvements compared to the control with regards to eutrophication, acidification, freshwater consumption and land use. Meanwhile, \{BMP\} + \{G9\} performed comparably to only \{G9\} except for eutrophication where it had a significantly larger environmental footprint. More efficient feed utilization and higher productivity were the main reasons for the environmental improvements.

Hapa productivity was impacted by local soil type, presence of shade, depth of mud and level of drainage inputs; more fry were produced in ponds based on sandy and sandy-loam soils with less overhanging vegetation and shade, lower levels of turbidity and benthic mud, and no drainage connections with tube wells or surface run-off. Poorer households were more successful overall and tended to prioritise sale of fry over retention for foodfish culture Households engaged in ancillary fry trading and/or nursery businesses also tended to be relatively successful.

Fluorescence brightness and the proportion of marked spicules generally increased with concentration and duration of immersion. Frequency of burial (an indicator of stress) in sandfish increased with both fluorochromes at concentrations above 50 mg L− 1. Growth in the two weeks post-marking was unaffected at immersion concentrations of 50 and 100 mg L− 1 compared to controls, but appeared inhibited by immersion in solutions of 200 and 400 mg L− 1 of tetracycline or calcein. Sequential marking by tetracycline (yellow) and calcein (green), in either order, showed that calcein was deposited in a higher proportion of spicules. Three other fluorochromes with disparate colors, alizarin complexone, calcein blue and xylenol orange, also marked sandfish spicules and expanded the variety of dichromic combinations. Both tetracycline and calcein fluoresced more brightly when juveniles were marked at 26 or 30 °C than at 21 °C, and this low temperature appears also to reduce the proportion of spicules marked by tetracycline. Our findings show that seawater temperature should be regulated for ex situ immersion marking. The behavioral and biological sensitivities of sandfish demand care in administering the fluorochromes. Fluorochrome immersion at 100 mg L− 1 for 24 h at ≥26 °C provides a practical compromise between minimizing the fitness of released juveniles and ensuring the efficacy of the markers for studies on the growth and survival of sea cucumbers stocked in the wild.

Then the stakeholder groups separately analyze possible solutions and their impacts, before meeting in plenary to share their analysis and form a consensus on win–win solutions. The process identifies the collective actions that are needed to arrive at preferred solutions, and determines potential impacts on different stakeholders and responsibilities for implementation, monitoring and evaluation. We outline the process in the context of building social capital through consensus, and compare indicators of social capital as an outcome of its application in a Vietnamese village in the Mekong delta with the outcomes of a similar process in a floodplain wetland in Bangladesh.

The commercially valuable sea cucumber Holothuria scabra, or ‘sandfish’, has potential for stock enhancement but cheap, long-lasting tags have not yet been developed. We evaluated five non-genetic tags against several criteria: cost, ease of application, retention rate, and ease of detection. In a 1-month trial, T-bar tags and visible elastomer implants proved unsuitable on hatchery-produced sandfish juveniles. Coded-wire tags and two fluorochromes, tetracycline and calcein, showed more promise, so retention rates of these tags were tested on juveniles held in an earthen seawater pond for 1 year. Sixty percent of juveniles retained at least one of two coded-wire tags for 1 year. Under \{UV\} illumination, spicules from the body wall of sandfish immersed in solutions of tetracycline are yellow, whereas calcein-stained spicules are green. From months 1 to 12 after immersion, the average percentage of stained spicules declined from 40% to 8% with tetracycline and 54% to 5% with calcein. After 1 year stained spicules were detected in all immersed animals, i.e. mark retention was 100%. Stained spicules from the ventral body wall of juveniles were generally in greater proportions, and fluoresced brighter, than those from the dorsal body wall. Spicule density exceeded 7000 spicules per mm2 of body wall in juveniles of 2–13 g, and decreased with sandfish weight. Fluorescence provides a simple diagnostic tool for identifying marked individuals and the sampling is non-destructive. Several mm2 of outer body wall is ample for tag identification. Immersion-staining with fluorochromes is preferred to coded-wire tags and provided a cheap and reliable batch-mark for distinguishing released and wild sandfish. "

On the first day after release, the normal sand burrowing was suppressed in juveniles held for 12 and 24 h, suggesting that pre-release acclimation for 1 day at field sites would benefit restocking. After the initial ‘shock’ of transport, handling stress appeared to increase burrowing behaviour for several days.

However, marine resources in the Philippines are facing increasing pressure from overfishing, destructive fishing practices, habitat destruction, declining water quality and limited management capacity. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are part of the management strategy to address these issues but the majority of \{MPAs\} around the world do not meet their management objectives. This paper discusses the identification and testing of management effectiveness indicators to evaluate \{MPA\} management for seven sites in the Philippines. The selection of 14 indicators was a participatory process that involved representatives from the academe, civil society groups, fishing associations, local government units (LGUs), national government agencies and research institutions. Overall, the majority of the indicators are rated positive but there is significant room for improvement, particularly in areas of resource use conflict, availability and allocation of resources and interaction between \{MPA\} managers and stakeholders. It is imperative that \{MPAs\} across the Philippines be managed and implemented as a network to maximize conservation and fisheries management. Moreover, given that the Philippines lies in the Coral Triangle area of the highest marine biodiversity in the world, increased political will and support for \{MPAs\} is urgently needed to meet global marine biodiversity targets and allow the Philippines to be an example of effective marine biodiversity conservation.

Partly challenging the current narrative, but in line with experience in other sectors (e.g., forestry), the review shows that the outcomes of these decentralizations have not been systematically positive. In most cases, fisheries co-management failed to improve governance, but simply altered the distribution of power and responsibility amongst the different stakeholders. In this new political landscape, poorly designed reforms have enabled a variety of (usual and new) local actors to advance their own agendas, often at the detriment of the direct end-users (fisherfolk).

In four sequential experiments, clams of 5, 11, 16 and 18 mm shell length (SL) were maintained at low and high stocking densities in 60-l tanks with unfiltered seawater (8 l h−1) for 25 days. Throughout this period, clams received daily spikes of dissolved ammonium sulfate at concentrations of &lt;1 (control), 20, 35 and 50 μM NH4+ for the three smallest size classes of clams, and &lt;1, 35, 50 and 80 μM NH4+ for the largest size class. Our experiments simulated the conditions used to mass-produce clams of this species during the nursery phase. All individuals used in the four experiments were from the same cohort. The growth responses of T. maxima to ammonium enrichment were dependent on the size of the clams. For clams of 5 mm SL, both increase in mean wet weight and \{SL\} were significantly lower at 35 and 50 μM NH4+ compared to control and 20 μM NH4+ spikes. In contrast, increases in mean wet weight and \{SL\} of giant clams of 11, 16 and 18 mm \{SL\} were all significantly greater when ammonium was added, with the greatest increases in mean weight and \{SL\} occurring at the highest ammonium levels for the two largest size classes. The abundance of zooxanthellae per clam increased in response to addition of ammonium for clams of 11, 16 and 18 mm SL, but not for individuals of 5 mm SL. Stocking density had a variable effect on changes in mean weight, shell length and abundance of zooxanthellae. Values of all variables were significantly greater at low stocking densities for clams of 11 mm SL, but only marginally significant for most variables for clams of 16 and 18 mm SL. This study shows that addition of ammonium does not enhance growth of T. maxima during the early stages of rearing clams in the land-based nursery, but that relatively high levels of ammonium should be applied in the latter part of the nursery phase. This highlights the importance of identifying changes in nutrient requirements as juvenile giant clams grow. "

System recovery time, the time required for all functional groups to returns to baseline level, and here used as a measure of model stability, was inversely correlated to Finn's Cycling Index, i.e. to the fraction of ecosystem throughput that is recycled, and to the mean length of trophic pathways in the systems. Systems with higher capacity to recycle detritus are systems with a higher ability to recover from perturbations. The results are in agreement with the E.P.

The individuals for replenishment of broodstock are those which were retained after the hatchery has reached its seed production target for a given year. There is a growing concern that hatchery stocks may be severely inbred because their overall performance has been rapidly deteriorating. Exact estimates of the rate of inbreeding accumulation, however, is difficult because the effective population size is not known and systematic records of various broodstock management operations are not available. In this paper, effective population size (Ne) and the rate of inbreeding (ΔF) have been estimated in terms of the numbers of new individuals entering the broodstock population each year and the variance of their reproductive success. This study is based on data collected during the 1987–1988 breeding season from 18 fish hatcheries in Karnataka State, southern India. Ne ranges from as low as 3 to a maximum of 30, and ΔF from 2% to 17% per year. Rapid inbreeding of stocks is evident. Possible ways of reducing further accumulation of inbreeding in broodstock populations are discussed. "

These are categorized here as homestead pond culture (carp dominated low intensity production conducted on a semi-subsistence basis, requiring limited management, labor and capital investment) and entrepreneurial pond culture (semi-intensive or intensive culture entered into as a productive investment with moderate or high capital costs and frequently employing labor).

To better understand the current condition of the lake, we monitored a suite of physical, chemical and biological parameters at approximately monthly intervals over an annual cycle in 2004–2005. The limnology of the lake was extremely sensitive to seasonal changes in the lake's seasonal hydrological cycle. The physico-chemical parameters, temperature, electrical conductivity, and total suspended solids exhibited clear seasonal patterns driven by the highly seasonal rainfall and resultant lake levels. In response, phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance, as well as biologically dependent oxygen concentrations and pH, exhibited several maxima levels over the year. The peaks of phytoplankton and zooplankton were out of phase suggesting a lag in the zooplankton grazing in response to pulses in primary productivity. Chlorophyll concentrations can exceed 1 mg/L in surface waters indicative of hypereutrophic conditions, but they fell dramatically during zooplankton peaks. This hydrologically driven, shallow and mesohaline lake is a productive and critical resource to the region. Its management poses challenges arising from the dependence of its limnology and fishery on the lakes hydrology, catchment land use and climate variability. "

We examined the build up of inbreeding and we estimated the effective population size by different methods (namely, from: the number of selected parents, the variance in family size, the inbreeding coefficient, and the co-ancestry among selected individuals). The rate of inbreeding was 0.0037 per generation and the effective population size calculated from the rate of increase in the co-ancestry was 88. We conclude that the mate allocation strategy has been successful in containing inbreeding and that the effective population size is satisfactory for the sustainability of the selection program. By contrast, the effective population size is below the minimum (e.g. 500) necessary for the retention of evolutionary potential, hence the population would be unlikely to adapt and cope with severe environmental challenges.

abstract = "The quantitative genetic basis of fatty acid composition was examined in the Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia (GIFT) strain of Nile tilapia selected for high breeding value for body weight and in the contemporaneous control selected for average breeding value. Gas chromatography analysis of 514 frozen fillet samples, obtained from the offspring of 104 sires and 154 dams from two generations in 2006 and 2007, showed that the fish possess all important fatty acids (FA), with the amount of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids being 3.6%. The ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids was greater than one (1.4) in the \{GIFT\} fillets, which is in line with the current dietary recommendation. Genetic analysis of \{FA\} was combined with 5532 performance and fillet records, and 2000 fillet samples analyzed for flesh composition and flesh quality attributes. A restricted maximum likelihood method applied to bivariate or trivariate mixed model was carried out in a full pedigree comprising a total of 18,970 animals to estimate genetic parameters and correlated responses in \{FA\} composition to the selection program. The estimates of heritability for individual \{FA\} varied from zero to medium, suggesting that \{FA\} composition of the \{GIFT\} fillet can respond to selection. Genetic correlations among \{FA\} within the same group (saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated FA) were generally synergetic, but were antagonistic between groups. There were also both favourable and unfavourable genetic associations between important high chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and performance, fillet and flesh quality traits. Correlated changes in \{FA\} composition were measured by comparing least square means of the selection and control lines. Overall, selection for high growth resulted in very little change in \{FA\} composition. One notable change was that the content of heptadecanoic acid (C17:0) decreased in the selection relative to control line, which is beneficial for human health. In summary, the set of genetic parameters estimated and the response realized in the \{GIFT\} strain indicate that \{FA\} composition of tilapia or fish in general can be altered by genetic means. "

First, a no-exploitation situation where the ecosystem performances are measured through the capacity of species richness to maintain the ecosystem above a minimum ecological viability threshold measured through a Shannon index. Second, an exploitation situation where the performances of the ecosystem are measured through its economic sustainability, that is, its capacity to generate direct-use values greater than a minimum guaranteed utility level. The analysis, based on numerical simulations, shows that biodiversity has a positive effect on both ecological and economic performances and that in both cases the marginal contribution of biodiversity is positive. Furthermore, this marginal contribution exhibits maximum values. These maximum values seem however to decrease with the level of species richness. These results show interesting links with two of the main current debates on biodiversity: the Noah's Ark problem and the assumption of decreasing marginal value supported by some recent works on bio-prospecting.

Fish is central to the Bangladeshi diet and small fish species are an important micronutrient source. Although fish consumption per capita has increased in recent years as a result of rapid expansion of aquaculture, it is likely that consumption of fish from capture fisheries (including small indigenous species particularly rich in micronutrients), has declined. This paper evaluates data on fish consumption collected in Bangladesh by the International Food Policy Research Institute in 1996/7 and 2006/7 to assess changing patterns of fish consumption and their implications for food and nutrition security. This analysis indicates that growth of aquaculture has been positive, mitigating a sharp reduction in the quantity of fish consumed from capture fisheries and smoothing out seasonal variability in consumption. However, increased availability of fish from aquaculture may not have fully compensated for the loss of fish from capture fisheries in terms of dietary diversity, micronutrient intakes and food and nutrition security, particularly for the poorest consumers. A range of approaches are recommended to sustain and enhance the contributions capture fisheries and aquaculture make to food and nutrition security in Bangladesh "

Progeny were generated in two spawning seasons, 2002 and 2003. A number of statistical models were fitted to the data collected throughout the study, either to estimate breeding values (EBVs), variance components, or response to selection. Parents used in the spawning season of 2003 were either selected as having high estimated breeding values for live weight (LW) at approx. 7 months of age, or as having \{EBVs\} as close as possible to the average. In this way Selection and a Control lines were created, respectively. Two production environments were used to grow-out the progeny. At approx. 7 months of age females' live weight was 84% that of males, whereas live weight in cages was 83% of that in ponds. The heritability estimated from the animal variance component was 0.34 (s.e. 0.069), whereas the maternal and common environment effect estimated from the dam variance component was 0.15 (s.e. 0.031). Response to selection was estimated by three methods: (i) Comparing the least squares means of \{LW\} for the Selection and Control lines in the progeny of the 2003 spawning season, (ii) Comparing the estimated breeding values for \{LW\} between the progeny of the 2002 spawning season and those of the Selected line in the 2003 spawning season, and (iii) Comparing the estimated breeding values of the Selection and Control lines in progeny of the 2003 spawning season, respectively. Expressed as a percentage of the overall least squares mean for \{LW\} in the population, the estimates were 8.4, 8.7 and 11.4 for methods (i), (ii) and (iii), respectively.

A discount approach was used for the economic evaluation over a 10 year time horizon. G × E interaction resulting from scaling effects generally had a negligible impact on \{EB\} and BCR. However, both \{EB\} and \{BCR\} decreased with the magnitude of the G × E (i.e. with the decrease in the genetic correlations between homologous traits in the selection and production environments). Furthermore, both \{EB\} and \{BCR\} from the genetic improvement program depend on other factors, which can be categorized in three groups: i) biological (heritability and feed intake), ii) economic (initial investment, annual recurrent cost, discount rate, price of fish and feed cost) and iii) operational (year when first return is realized, adoption rates of the improved fish by the production sector). The level of heritability affected \{EB\} and BCR, with greater heritability being associated with greater \{EB\} and BCR. Accounting for feed intake in breeding objectives avoided an overestimation of \{EB\} and BCR. Generally, the economic efficiency of the breeding program was almost insensitive to initial investment and annual cost. Increasing the discount rate by three times reduced \{EB\} and \{BCR\} by a factor of only 1.4 and 2.0, respectively. The price of fish and feed costs had a substantial effect on \{EB\} and BCR. However, the greatest contribution to variations in \{EB\} and \{BCR\} came from increases in adoption rates of the improved fish by the industry. The risk program failure due to technical reasons was extremely low. We conclude that even under the most conservative assumptions, and in the presence of G × E interaction, genetic improvement programs are highly beneficial from an economic viewpoint, and that for the situations studied they could result in \{EBs\} ranging from 11 to 226 million US$, and corresponding \{BCRs\} of 22 to 420.

The progeny produced went through a 120 day grow-out period, after which live weight, standard length, body depth and survival were recorded. The estimated total genetic change in live weight was 64% over nine generations, or 7.1% generation. The genetic change was lower than the estimate reported by Eknath et al.

A multi-trait model using restricted maximum likelihood method was applied to a full pedigree comprising a total of 18,970 animals. The estimates of heritability for body and carcass traits were of moderate magnitude (0.20 to 0.33). The proportions of variance explained by the maternal and common environmental effects were small, ranging from 4 to 8% for body traits and fillet weight, but were negligible for fillet yield. Genetic correlations among body traits were high (0.78 to 0.95), except between standard length and body width (0.56). High genetic correlations (0.78 to 0.96) were also obtained between body traits and fillet weight, whereas those between body traits and fillet yield were generally low (0.35 to 0.44). Genetic changes were measured as the difference in least squares means between the selection and control lines. The correlated increase in fillet weight was 23% in the latest generation studied or 0.97 phenotypic standard deviation units (σP). The correlated response in fillet yield was negligible. In conclusion, selection for high growth significantly increased fillet weight. Strategies for the improvement of fillet yield in the \{GIFT\} strain are discussed. "

Citing cases from India, the Philippines, Cambodia, and South Africa, we show how human rights advocacy can be an effective element of support for development in fisheries. Finally, we outline how fisheries reform can better address human rights issues as an essential complement to the equitable allocation of fishing rights, contributing to improved resource management and human wellbeing.

The implications are crucial in terms of food security as fish represents the major protein source for local populations in many regions reliant on small-scale fisheries. The case of the Solomon Islands’ fishery presented in this paper represents an illustrative example of these issues. The paper proposes a bio-economic model based on the local fishery that accounts for multi-species and multi-fleet dynamics and integrates calibrated Lotka–Volterra trophic dynamics. Several contrasting fishing scenarios are tested and their results compared using two biological indicators (Simpson index and species richness) and two socio-economic indicators (fish consumption and cash income). The simulations identify the conditions under which fishing outputs including subsistence and profitability of fishing can be sustained for the next forty years. "

Body weight, length, depth and width data at harvest from 12,308 individuals, progeny of 232 sires and 340 dams, were analyzed by restricted maximum likelihood methods fitting a multi-trait animal model. To explore the genetic variation in sexual dimorphism the trait expressions in the two sexes were treated as if they were different traits. Heritabilities and maternal and common environment effects for all the traits were very similar in females and males. The genetic correlations between sexes for all traits were close to unity (0.91 to 0.96), indicating that there was no sex by genotype interaction. When treated as a single trait the heritabilities (± SE) for body weight, length, depth and width were moderate to high, ranging from 0.20 to 0.35 (± 0.04 to 0.05). The maternal and common environment effects accounted for 16 to 24% of the variance. Genetic correlations among the four body measurements were highly positive (0.94 to 0.99), suggesting the existence of little or no genetic variation independent of each other. We concluded that there was no need to treat trait expressions in the two sexes as different traits in genetic improvement programs. Furthermore, that the relative dimensions of the body were essentially controlled by the same genes, but that continued selection for live weight would result in relatively longer and thinner fish because of the greater correlated response in length relative to width and depth.

Our experiments in hapas within shrimp ponds were designed to detect any deleterious effects of sandfish on shrimp, and vice versa. These experiments showed that a high stocking density of juvenile sandfish had no significant effects on growth and survival of shrimp. However, survival and growth of sandfish reared with shrimp for 3 weeks were significantly lower than for sandfish reared alone. Increased stocking density of shrimp also had a significant negative effect on survival and/or growth of sandfish. A grow-out trial of juvenile sandfish in 0.2-ha earthen ponds stocked with 20 shrimp post-larvae m− 2, and densities of sandfish between 0.8 and 1.6 individuals m− 2, confirmed that co-culture is not viable. All sandfish reared in co-culture were dead or moribund after a month. However, sandfish stocked alone into 0.2-ha earthen ponds survived well and grew to mean weights of ∼ 400 g within 12 months without addition of food. The grow-out trial demonstrated that there is potential for profitable pond farming of sandfish in monoculture. Further research is now needed to identify the optimal size of juveniles, stocking densities and pond management regimes. "

Community motivations for co-management are often related more to the protection of fisheries resources from outsiders than to conservation. Access rights are important but exclusion from food resources in a context of widespread poverty should be approached carefully. Cross-scale institutional linkages make adaptive management possible by bringing together groups with broad local foci and ones with narrow trans-local mandates. The role of the government is balancing interactions between these various groups. This is not a role that is compatible with top-down management. "

The results of the meta-analysis suggest that, overall fisheries co-management delivers benefits to end-users through improvements in key process and outcome indicators. However, the dataset as a whole is constituted primarily of data from the Philippines. When we exclude this body of work, few generalisations can be made about the impact of fisheries co-management. The lack of comparative data suitable for impact assessment and the difficulties in comparing data and generalising across countries and regions reiterates calls in other fields for more systematic approaches to understanding and evaluating governance frameworks.

The enclosed water body is stocked with fish seed and the benefits are distributed amongst those who own land in the impounded area. This study has found that \{FPA\} tends to exclude a large number of poor households and adversely affects them through the attenuation of their common property rights over the floodplains, besides skewing the distribution of benefits amongst those who directly benefit from it.

abstract = "Publisher Summary This chapter presents the restocking initiatives for a wide variety of marine invertebrates such as, Giant Clams, Topshell, and Sea Cucumbers. The two immediate obstacles to restocking giant clams are the high cost of rearing clams until they are large enough to escape predation and the poaching of transplanted clams. The limited number of giant clams that can be produced for restocking highlights the need to maximize the reproductive contribution of each individual. The conclusion in the chapter that restocking of trochus (Topshell) is best accomplished by the translocation of adults provides an important focus for fisheries managers. A major reason that restocking is being assessed as a potential management tool for cultured sandfish is that increased numbers of sea cucumbers are unlikely to have detrimental effects on other important fauna. Development of technology for restocking sandfish has progressed to the point where the basic methods for propagating juveniles are available—but are now required to scale-up the production of juveniles cost-effectively—and for releasing cultured juveniles in the wild at high rates of survival.

abstract = "Publisher Summary This chapter outlines the basic information required to determine whether restocking is likely to help rebuild severely depleted stocks or whether stock enhancement could help overcome recruitment limitation in operational fisheries and return a profit on investment. The chapter demonstrates that either restocking or stock enhancement is likely to be beneficial and identifies various ways in which the released animals should be managed to obtain optimum benefits from these two types of interventions. It explains whether release of cultured juveniles will add value to other measures normally used to rebuild spawning biomass to more productive levels. Managers need sound information on stock delineation, that is, the biological and genetic structure of the population(s) comprising the fishery, the projected time frames for recovery with and without various levels of restocking, and the capacity of hatcheries to produce juveniles. The managers of restocking programs are aiming for long-term benefits, and the managers of stock enhancement programs need to demonstrate, often over a short term, that the value of the additional harvest exceeds the cost of producing and releasing the juveniles. The chapter focuses on development of regulations to optimize the biological, social, and financial sustainability of the interventions made to increase the productivity of the fishery and need to pay particular attention to the number of juveniles released and to identifying and implementing measures that maximize the benefits from the process.

Stock enhancement of scallops stands out among marine invertebrates for the nature and scale of the operations. A major advantage of using wild spat for stock enhancement of scallops is that the seed has no inherent morphological, behavioral or genetic deficits. Another major problem limiting the potential for stock enhancement of queen conch is the limited availability of nursery habitats. A limiting factor for restocking and stock enhancement programs for Abalone may be the inability of hatcheries to produce the required number of juveniles. The potential for extensive mariculture of Queen Conch was considered to be low because of high hatchery costs, lack of mass-rearing techniques, and high predation on juveniles. The great economic value of Shrimp fisheries has led to very high exploitation and prompted several countries to assess the potential for stock enhancement programs. Two main types of interventions are underway to increase production of Spiny Lobsters further. Major problem limiting the potential for stock enhancement of Queen Conch is the limited availability of nursery habitats. Much of the basic technical and ecological knowledge required to mass produce juvenile Sea Urchins and release them with a relatively high probability of survival is now in place. "

The small differences in life-history traits among species, for example, larval duration; nursery habitats; vulnerability to predation; age at first maturity; feeding areas, which can have major effects on the approach required; and the costs involved for releasing marine invertebrates in restocking and stock enhancement programs. These differences have necessitated approaches as diverse as hatchery production of juveniles, collection of wild spat, provision of more settlement habitat, redistribution of settled juveniles, and translocation of adults. The broad range of case studies provides a clear message for fisheries agencies considering the use of restocking and stock enhancement as management tools, that is, there are no generic methods for such interventions. The variations in life history among species, the range of possible ways of increasing the numbers of juveniles, and the numerous failures, lead to the inescapable conclusion that there are no shortcuts to targeted research to identify whether a particular form of restocking or stock enhancement is likely to be cost-effective.

abstract = "Publisher Summary This chapter reveals that considerable efforts have already been made to investigate and apply the methods for restocking and stock enhancement of marine invertebrates, explains that large scale stock enhancement initiatives have not succeeded in increasing national production to former levels—although some of these releases are credited with arresting declining harvests—and demonstrates that many of the future assessments of the potential for managing fisheries with the use of cultured juveniles should be re-oriented from stock enhancement to restocking. There has been encouraging progress in three components of the responsible approach for several restocking and stock enhancement initiatives. These are understanding the factors that affect survival of juveniles released in the wild, releasing juveniles in ways that optimize their survival, and developing methods for identifying released individuals to measure success. To identify whether restocking and stock enhancement have a contribution to make, it is necessary to model whether measures, such as the release of cultured juveniles or provision of additional habitats for juveniles, are likely to deliver the expected benefits before the interventions are made. The chapter emphasizes that the investments in hatchery technology are likely to fail unless managers know the status of the target stocks and define the objectives of the releases. "

These considerations are the need to measure whether the intervention has been as successful as expected, minimize the potential negative impacts of releasing cultured juveniles on the genetic integrity of the wild populations, reduce the risk of introducing diseases to the target species and broader animal community, and avoid undesirable changes to the relative abundances of other valuable species in the ecosystem. The changes to the genetic diversity of target stocks, and the risks of introducing diseases to conspecifics and other species in the ecosystem, are not the only potential impacts of restocking and stock enhancement. There is concern that the changes in relative abundance of target species, brought about by successful large-scale releases or associated manipulations, may be at the expense of other valuable components in the ecosystem. Another feature of the stock enhancement of marine invertebrates to be considered when assessing potential impacts of releases is that many of the target species feed low in the food chain. "

abstract = "Publisher Summary This chapter presents the approaches and outcomes across species and outlines general progress toward the components of a responsible approach done separately for the species/groups used in restocking and those used for stock enhancement initiatives. A key feature of the restocking initiatives for marine invertebrates described in the chapter is that the cultured juveniles have always been produced in hatcheries. Two striking features of the restocking initiatives, compared with stock enhancement programs, are that they are all at an early stage and that they are underway mainly in developing countries and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) with the assistance of international partners. In contrast to restocking initiatives, several different methods have been used to supply juveniles for marine invertebrate stock enhancement programs, these include collection and nursing of wild spat, translocation of excess juveniles that have settled naturally, hatchery-reared juveniles, and provision of suitable habitat to enable spat to settle in greater numbers or in areas where settlement would not otherwise be possible. The chapter discusses the stock enhancement initiatives for the eight species/groups that provide more opportunities to assess progress toward a responsible approach than the work done so far on restocking. It is evident that capture and culture of wild spat is one of the simplest and most attractive options for stock enhancement; it reduces the cost of supplying large numbers of environmentally fit juveniles and can avoid effects of releases on the genetic structure of stocks.

In intensive aquaculture, pond water gets polluted due to high stocking density and large amount of supplemental feeding results in huge accumulation of unused feed and faeces in the pond bottom. The accumulated bottom sludge depletes dissolved oxygen (DO) and releases harmful gases due to excessive use of chemicals and lack of water exchange facilities. These have negative impact on fish production and economic performance, through disease outbreak, mortality, poor feed conversion ratio (FCR), specific growth rate (SGR) and bad odor in fish muscles. This study was undertaken to develop a sludge remover for cleaning sludge from the intensive fish farming pond and to find the impact of sludge removal on water quality and growth of fish. A sludge remover was developed in Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) which is capable of removing sludge up to 40–50 mm from the pond bottom. The main components of sludge remover are a float, axial flow pump (102 mm diameter), 7.50 kW diesel engine, sludge sucker, crane, propeller, rudder, etc. The discharge of the sludge pump was 14.11 L/s. The effective field capacity and field efficiency were 0.078 ha/h and 77.23% respectively at the forward speed of 12.5 ± 1.55 m/min. The water and sludge ratio was 3.6:1.0 (weight basis). A field trial was carried out to determine the effect of sludge removal on water quality and growth of fishes in intensive cultured ponds. Sludge was removed at three months interval from three pangus-tilapia-carp polyculture ponds. Three ponds of same size and fish stocking were kept as control. Water quality parameters like DO, pH, transparency and, unionized ammonia significantly (p ≤ 0.05) improved in the sludge removed ponds compare to control ponds. Sludge removed ponds demonstrated better \{FCR\} (1.64) and \{SGR\} (0.80% per day) compare to \{FCR\} (1.90) and \{SGR\} (0.71% per day) of control ponds. Fish survival, net yield, net return and \{BCR\} (5.40) of sludge removed ponds were higher than those of control ponds. This sludge remover may be recommended for cleaning sludge from intensive cultured fish ponds. "

A Cobb-Douglas production function model was used to identify which inputs affect fish yields. Stocking density, feed inputs, labor and pond depth were found to significantly affect total fish production, whereas mola production was significantly influenced by inputs of inorganic fertilizer, mustard oilcake, the number of months water was retained in the pond, labor and pond depth. A financial analysis showed the benefit-cost ratio of mola polyculture was higher than 1, indicating the investment efficiency of this technology for rural farmers. The study indicates that application of appropriate inputs could be considered to maximize production of mola in future projects attempting to promote its culture. Statement of relevance This paper assesses the productivity of vitamin A rich mola carplet, farmed in polyculture with carp in Bangladesh, and identifies factors contributing to mola carplet productivity to support the design of attempts to promote mola culture in future.

Effective communication between conflicting parties is perceived as a key for establishing successful negotiations for managing conflicts. On this premise, this paper presents and assesses a Fisheries Conflicts Communication Framework, henceforth called FishCom, a tool for developing plans and strategies for managing fisheries conflicts in the inland fisheries of Bangladesh. This tool embodies a structured participatory process intended for use by policy-makers and conflict management practitioners. They have important roles in catalyzing and effecting changes that are instrumental in minimizing, if not totally eliminating conflicts. Experiences from applying FishCom in the inland fisheries study sites in Bangladesh show that it has enabled a systematic stakeholder-inclusive identification and evaluation of fisheries conflicts and planning of communication interventions to manage them.

The size of the lake varies seasonally and among years, sometimes drying completely. Its surrounding wetland and floodplain provide habitat for a diversity of birds and economically valuable grasses and reeds. When the lake has water, there is considerable activity on its shores and temporary fishing villages spring up. People move in and out of the lake basin in concert with these seasonal and longer term changes. This paper examines the environmental dynamics of Lake Chilwa and its surrounding wetlands, presents an overview of the socio-economic context of the area and discusses threats to this resilient system that might occur as a result of climate change. We conclude that management of Lake Chilwa must place the lake in the wider economic and ecological system in which it is situated. Ultimately, land-use practices within the basin present more of a threat to the resilience of the fishery and people's livelihoods than overfishing or a strict focus on the lake's resources. These perspectives present significant challenges to conventional fisheries governance. "

In 2010 a study of two peri-urban areas of Solomon Islands analysed the demand and potential for inland aquaculture, and the role of the introduced Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) in household livelihoods and existing value chains. Of 178 households interviewed, marine reef fish were the preferred fish for consumption, although tinned fish was also common. At the study sites, Mozambique tilapia was accessible and contributed to food security, particularly for inland households. Sixty five percent of the people actively fished for tilapia at least monthly; 13% of these fished on almost a daily basis. Fish were consumed by men, women and children and sold by both men and women in local village markets. Mozambique tilapia is considered to perform poorly in aquaculture. While other species like Nile tilapia or milkfish (Chanos chanos) are being considered for aquaculture by the Solomon Islands Government, Mozambique tilapia is currently the only cost-effective and widely available alternative for farming fish for household food security. This study lends weight to the premise that peri-urban households that are cash poor are likely to benefit nutritionally from easier access to tilapia or other freshwater fish. "

Biodiversity and its values to society are threatened by demographic and habitat change, rising demand, intensive harvesting and climate change. In partnership with international conservation organisations and development funders, the governments of the region′s six countries have come together to develop the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security. The \{CTI\} has explicit goals and defined targets for marine biodiversity conservation, but not for the food security of the region′s marine-resource dependent people, despite this being the wider aim used to justify conservation action. This article suggests how the food security aim of the \{CTI\} could be made more explicit. It outlines the complex pathways linking marine biodiversity with food security and argues that improved social science analysis, inter-sectoral policy and management interactions are necessary if conserving marine biodiversity is to contribute towards meeting food security challenges in the region.

However, there is little information available to determine the size of the no-take zones (NTZs) needed to protect the released animals so that they can form nucleus breeding populations. To do this, we measured short-term movement paths of released juvenile (1–105 g) and wild adult (130–690 g) sandfish in a seagrass bed in New Caledonia. We then developed an individual-based model (IBM) to predict long-term dispersal of sandfish released as juveniles (1–16 g) at 1 individual m−2 within a 1-ha area, drawing on distributions of speed and directionality and the relationship between speed and animal weight from field data. Movement was non-random at the sampling scale used, since animals tended to turn &lt;90° at each 2-h time step. We examined high- and low-growth scenarios by applying 50% and 25% of the modelled growth rates of sandfish held in earthen ponds (where they are known to grow faster). The dispersal of released sandfish was predicted to be limited in the first 2 years, then markedly faster thereafter. After 10 years, 6–12% of surviving animals were predicted to remain in the original 1-ha release site. To protect surviving sandfish as nucleus breeding populations for 10 years, and accepting 10% spillover, square \{NTZs\} would need to be 19–40 ha. The findings are useful for the management of restocking and pre-defining the size of sites for recapture surveys. Our model allows user-specified values for future releases and should be applicable for other sedentary marine invertebrates where basic data on movement and growth are available. "

This nucleus consists of two independent populations corresponding to different year-classes (even and odd, depending on the spawning year), which have been successfully selected for harvest weight (approximate genetic gain per generation of 10%). In order to constrain the buildup of inbreeding a strategy based on avoiding full-sib mating in each generation was used. In this study we assess the inbreeding levels and effective population size of the two year-classes to evaluate the outcome of the mating strategy within the nucleus. The average rate of inbreeding in the two year classes was around 1% per generation. However, rapid increase of inbreeding coefficients in the latest generations suggests that the simple mating strategy used should be improved in order to constrain maximum inbreeding values in further generations. The effective population size calculated based on the regression of the average rate of co-ancestry across generations was 34 and 39 for the odd and even populations, respectively. The effective population number is 50 for both, odd and even populations, based on the regression of the average rate of inbreeding over generations. The results indicate that the mate allocation strategy has contained the rate of inbreeding within acceptable values to date, but that current effective population size must be increased in order to be adequate for the viability of the breeding program in the medium to long term. However, the effective population size of these populations is far below 500, the minimum number suggested for retaining the evolutionary potential to adapt to new environmental conditions. Further strategies to constrain maximum inbreeding levels across all the individuals belonging to the nucleus and to maintain a satisfactory effective population size for ensuring the sustainability of this breeding scheme are proposed.

Statistical analyses were carried out on data consisting of records from 1280 individuals reared in both freshwater (0 ppt) and saline water (30 ppt) environments. Among the purebreds, and across the testing environments, the Malaysian strain exhibited the highest additive genetic performance for harvest weight. Whereas the Stirling strain was the poorest (7.4% above and 13.4% below the overall mean of pure strains, respectively). The average level of heterosis was generally low (4.2%) and the average of all crossbreds was not statistically different from the mean of the pure strains. Overall, the growth performance of red tilapia was significantly lower in saline than in freshwater environments (P &lt; 0.001). The high correlation between additive genetic and total performance suggests that improvement of red tilapia can be effectively based on the exploitation of additive genetic variation (i.e. through selective breeding).

Strategies for the future breeding program in red tilapia are discussed. "

Affinity for shelter and nocturnal foraging underlie the mechanism of barrens formation by C. rodgersii. Centrostephanus rodgersii has undergone a range extension into Tasmania facilitated by larval transport in the Eastern Australia Current. Investigation of the impacts of this extension has generated major advances in understanding the biology and ecology of C. rodgersii. In Tasmania lobsters and fishes modulate the success of C. rodgersii and creation of barrens habitat.

The systems differed in their level of intensification, diversification and origin of labor. Labor efficiency was higher in intensive than in extensive farms. The difference in technical practice affected the farm economy and specifically its operational monetary cost which was 25–45 times higher in intensive commercial farms than in brackish water polyculture and rice–shrimp farms, respectively. The intensive commercial farms were significantly less affected by virus outbreak than the extensive brackish water polyculture farms. This last shrimp production system presented a very low shrimp yield but a higher capital use efficiency than intensive commercial farms. Rice–shrimp farms, which are located in a specific agro-ecological environment, presented average sustainability characteristics and an average disease occurrence.

Based on household surveys conducted both before and after resettlement, we estimate changes in water use and benefits among households of 4 resettled villages. Results show that access to domestic water supply as well as water consumption have significantly improved after resettlement, while river-based livelihoods have for the most part been adversely impacted by the conversion of the Nam Gnouang River into a hydropower dam reservoir, and subsequent loss of riverbank gardens and the overall change in the ecosystem. In particular, the sources of income have become concentrated to much fewer options than before resettlement, with some households more specialized in fisheries than others. Our results represent a transitional state of economic activities by rural communities immediately after resettlement, rather than a fully evolved livelihood portfolio in a new environment. The results also suggest that a better understanding of changes in water use and benefits and of the determinants of adaptation is needed to better design appropriate interventions for rebuilding local livelihoods.

Hampered by ineffective institutional arrangements and donor-driven projects, the substantial gains in desperately needed food security and economic growth predicted by development agencies have generally not been achieved. Nevertheless, African aquaculture has demonstrated its competitiveness, producing fishes that feed low on the food chain in a range of well-adapted, environmentally friendly and profitable farming systems that meet the needs of a broad spectrum of user-groups. Key constraints to broader growth include lack of good quality seed, feed and technical advice; poor market infrastructure and access; and weak policies that, rather than accelerate, impede expansion, largely by emphasizing central planning over private sector initiative. If African aquaculture is to make substantial and much needed contributions to the continent’s development, government policy should attempt to facilitate the alleviation of key constraints and rely more heavily on commercial investments to lead future growth. Evidence to date indicates that a pragmatic business approach focusing on small and medium-scale private enterprises would produce more benefits for more people than centrally planned and government led development projects.

Although there is an abundant literature on what makes \{CBRM\} effective, is it less clear how \{CBRM\} is introduced or develops as an idea in a community, and the process of how the idea leads to the adoption of a new resource management approach with supporting institutions. Here we aim to address this gap by applying an explicit process-based approach drawing on innovation history methodology by mapping and analysing the initiation and emergence of \{CBRM\} in five fishing-dependent communities in Solomon Islands. We use insights from the literatures on diffusion of innovation and transformability to define phases of the process and help guide the inductive analysis of qualitative data. We show the \{CBRM\} institutionalisation processes were non-linear, required specific strategies to move from one phase to the next, and key elements facilitated or hindered movement. Building active support for \{CBRM\} within communities depended on the types of events that happened at the beginning of the process and actions taken to sustain this. Matching \{CBRM\} to known resource management ideas or other social problems in the community, developing legitimate institutions and decision-making processes, strong continual interactions between key actors and the rest of the community (not necessarily \{NGO\} actors), and community members witnessing benefits of CBRM, all contributed to the emergence and diffusion of \{CBRM\} in the communities, and helped to overcome barriers to transformative change.

Twenty-three indicators were used for evaluation: six biophysical indicators that largely measured the status of capture fisheries and coastal habitats; eight socioeconomic indicators that largely assessed the economic status and the perceptions of coastal communities; and nine governance indicators that measured the various facets of \{MPA\} management. Key lessons learned indicate the need to correlate the perceptions of coastal stakeholders with scientific findings as some perceptions did not reflect the results of biophysical surveys.

Once this happens, conventional management measures alone, such as closed seasons/areas, size limits and gear restrictions, will usually fail to repair the damage. A different suite of active management interventions must be considered to restore the spawning biomass of severely over-exploited populations. These include: (1) restocking no-take zones with hatchery-reared juveniles; (2) aggregating remnant wild individuals in no-take zones; and (3) development of small enterprises to rear wild-caught sea cucumbers in simple sea pens, or dedicated sublittoral areas, to the size above sexual maturity that optimises earnings. The first intervention is currently limited to a few species of tropical sea cucumbers, whereas the second and third interventions can be applied to many species. The third intervention is particularly attractive – it allows fishers to add value to their catch, reverses the effects of fishing from damaging to improving the potential for replenishment by overcoming the Allee effect, and creates multiple groups of spawners to supply recruits throughout the range of the population(s) supporting a fishery.

As compared to the typical production system (fertilized unfenced ponds) and at a stocking density of 10 two-day old fry/m2, survival increased by 28% in fenced ponds, 34% in open hapas and 55% in bird-netted hapas. These increases were believed due to the respective exclusion of adult amphibians, aquatic insects and flying predators, implying that they would be respectively responsible for 28%, 6% and 23% of the fry mortality which was observed in unfenced ponds. When the stocking density of closed hapas (predator-free systems) was increased from 10 to 40 fry/m2, fry survival significantly dropped (P &lt; 0.002), indicating a shortage of adequate food/fry. Consequently, the maximum yield was only 29 out of 40 fingerlings/m2 (though up from 10 out of 10 in the lowly stocked systems) and 29 larvae/m2 appeared to be the stocking density which could optimize the profitability of smallholder C. gariepinus hatcheries. Calculations based on corresponding survivals, final average weights and size-dependent selling price showed that stocking at this (optimum) density could significantly improve profitability, as for instance, from − 184 francs to + 982 francs/m2 through the use of closed hapas. Smallholders should therefore determine and stock their nursing systems at optimum densities as well as defend the stocked fry against predators, in order to maximize their profits. "

We analyzed parentage and quantified male reproductive success of O. niloticus under commercial hatchery conditions in two breeding hapas each stocked with 12 males and 25 females. Eleven microsatellite markers were used to estimate the reproductive success of individual males and females. In total, 760 offspring from 76 spawnings were included in the paternity analysis. Mating patterns in Nile tilapia ranged from single pair to promiscuous mating. Multiple paternity was detected in 70% of the broods, with up to 4 males fertilizing a single clutch. Multiple maternity was also detected in over 30% of the clutches analyzed. There was a very high variance in male reproductive success, with one third of males siring more than 70% of the offspring. Male condition factor had a significant effect on reproductive success with larger males siring a large proportion of offspring. The high reproductive variance resulted in a Ne of around 16 for hapas A and B, and a low Ne/N ratio, 0.43 and 0.45 for hapas A and B, respectively. The rate of inbreeding, ΔF, for each hapa, was estimated to be around 3.0% per generation, which is about twice the inbreeding expected in an idealized population of the same census size. When designing fish breeding programmes based on mass spawning, the higher inbreeding and lower effective population size should be taken into consideration. "

Based on interviews with hunters, we found that snake catches declined by 74–84% between 2000 and 2005, raising strong concerns about the sustainability of this hunting operation. A combination of experimental trials to estimate population sizes and extensive catch and trade monitoring programs indicated that population density varies both spatially and temporally, largely due to the seasonally fluctuating environment of Tonle Sap Lake. The quantity of snakes captured mirrors the lake’s seasonal fluctuations, due to temporal changes in both catch per unit effort and the number of people hunting. Through interviews with hunters we scored the seven exploited species for perceived changes in catch size. All species were reported as declining and their scores match their predicted vulnerability based on a combination of timing of exploitation relative to breeding, proportion of catch consisting of mature females and large fecund females, fecundity, body size, size at maturity, and vulnerability to capture by gill nets. This information can inform conservation decisions for the long-term preservation of this snake assemblage. We propose emphasis should be placed on the snake skin trade that is targeting the largest, highly fecund females, and that any efforts to reduce hunting should focus on the peak in trade that occurs during the main breeding season.

The heritable effect of an individual on the trait values of other individuals it interacts with is known as an indirect genetic effect (IGE). Such \{IGEs\} may affect response to selection. Fish selected for high growth rate, for example, have been shown to be more aggressive and competitive, which may reduce the observed response in growth rate.

A total of 6330 fish with harvest weight information were used to estimate genetic and non-genetic parameters. A bivariate analysis of harvest weight and survival was conducted by fitting different mixed models to investigate the presence of \{IGEs\} and other non-genetic effects. The full set of genetic parameters could not be estimated simultaneously with the inclusion of maternal common environmental effects. A confounding between maternal common environmental effects and direct genetic effects resulted from the mating strategy, where one sire was mated to only one or two dams. A 1 male to 2 females mating design is common in aquaculture, but it has limited power to estimate genetic parameters. Models without maternal common environmental effects showed significant \{IGE\} on harvest weight, which contributed 48% of total heritable variance. Models with maternal common environmental effects suggested the presence of IGE. The direct–indirect genetic correlation for harvest weight was negative (− 0.38 ± 0.19), indicating that traditional selection, if performed in an environment where the fish have to compete with each other for the resources, will increase competition. A strongly negative genetic correlation between direct effects on survival and indirect effects on harvest weight (− 0.79 ± 0.30) showed that individuals with better genes for survival suppressed growth rate of their social partners. Our results suggest that heritable competitive interactions affect harvest weight in Nile tilapia. Hence, breeding schemes may need to be adapted to avoid an increase in aggressiveness due to selection for growth rate in a competitive environment. Further studies are required to investigate the relevance of \{IGE\} and its implications on different systems of commercial aquaculture production. Statement of relevance Sociable fish will help to improve aquaculture production. "

Selective breeding is one of the effective approaches that may enable a reduction of size variability (or increase in uniformity) for body weight by genetic means. The genetic variance of uniformity is commonly known as genetic heterogeneity of environmental variance for particular traits. The data collected from a social interaction experiment were used to investigate the presence of genetic variation in heterogeneity of environmental variance for harvest weight in the \{GIFT\} strain. A total of 944 records pooled (by family-group) from 6330 individual harvest weights were used in the analysis. For the estimation of genetic parameters we fitted a bivariate sire–dam model to harvest weight and its standard deviation. To normalize the residuals, individual harvest weight was Box–Cox transformed. The heritability (at the family by group level) and genetic coefficient of variation for standard deviation of Box–Cox transformed harvest weight (0.23 and 0.17, respectively) indicated that uniformity of harvest weight was partly under genetic control. In addition, we found a very low genetic relationship between Box–Cox transformed harvest weight and its standard deviation, rA = 0.095 ± 0.183. Hence, these two traits are unrelated and can be selected in different directions using index selection, namely, aiming to increase growth rate while decreasing size variation. We conclude that there is potential to increase harvest weight and its uniformity by selective breeding in the \{GIFT\} strain of farmed tilapia. Statement of relevance Uniformity will help to increase aquaculture production. "

The present study consists of laboratory based analysis of the nutrient content of pangasius pond sediments (PPS), a trial of the efficacy of reuse of \{PPS\} as fertilizer to produce para grass as a green fodder for dairy cattle, and a comparative assessment of the economic viability of para grass production in rice fields using \{PPS\} to support small-scale dairy farming operations, thereby removing a major constraint to the growth of commercial dairy production in Bangladesh. \{PPS\} had significantly higher levels of organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium and sulfur than rice plot soil, and was a highly effective fertilizer for para grass cultivation. Production of green fodder for dairy cows using \{PPS\} yielded a higher rate of return than rice production. The indirect integration of aquaculture with agriculture through the reuse of \{PPS\} as fertilizer for green fodder production has significant potential to contribute to sustainable intensification and nutrition security goals, by improving the efficiency of nutrient use in aquaculture, reducing local environmental impacts associated with sediment disposal, and increasing the production of micronutrient rich milk.

To overcome the difficulties, an \{IFCAS\} (3.66 m × 2.44 m = 9 m2) was set in each of 9 shaded ponds – 5 highly shaded ponds (HSP) and 4 moderately shaded ponds (MSP) – in which \{GIFT\} tilapia strain (Orechromis niloticus) was stocked at the rate of 100 m−3 cage. In the ponds, carp species (Catla catla, Labeo rohita, Cirrhinus cirrhosus and Cyprinus carpio) were stocked at the ratio of 1:2:2:1, and at the rate of 14,820 ha−1. Tilapia were fed floating feed and the carp were fed with supplementary feed. Vegetables were grown on the \{IFCAS\} scaffold, and tilapia were grown in the net-cage constructed underneath. Women members of \{HSP\} households participated fully in the action research in the production of vegetables and fish in IFCAS. Participating households started consuming vegetables and tilapia from \{IFCAS\} within 1.5 and 1 month of the start of the experiment, respectively. Average fish consumption of 20 kg household−1 was recorded within four months, of which more than 50% was tilapia from IFCAS. Overall fish and vegetable production was higher in \{MSP\} as compared to HSP.

This paper operationalizes the concept of social wellbeing (comprised of interlinked material, subjective and relational dimensions) as a framework for understanding the effects of agrarian change, as experienced by inhabitants of two villages in rural Southwest Bangladesh. Production of two ostensibly similar high value export crops (tiger shrimp and freshwater prawn) resulted in radically different trajectories of agrarian change and social wellbeing outcomes in the two villages. These were broadly positive in the village producing prawn, but broadly negative in the village producing shrimp. The paper links these divergent wellbeing outcomes to the ways in which peasant livelihoods became commodified in each village. Different patterns of commodification are shown to be linked to differences in the biological characteristics of the two organisms farmed. The paper demonstrates the theoretical, methodological and analytical utility of integrating social wellbeing and political economy of agrarian change perspectives in the study of rural development.

However, little rigorous empirical research exists on the determinants of adoption and welfare impact of such technologies, particularly in marginalized people's settings. This article addresses this research gap, using the case of indigenous small-scale \{IRFFS\} farm households cross-sectional survey data from northern and northwestern regions of Bangladesh. It employs double hurdle model for determining the factors affecting \{IRFFS\} adoption and intensity of adoption in the first stage and propensity score-matching (PSM) method to analyze the causal impact of \{IRFFS\} adoption on welfare of marginalized indigenous farm households in Bangladesh in the second stage. The findings of the first stage study indicate that among the key determinants of adoption are gender of the household head, access to irrigation, education and conflict with villagers. The results also show that farm size and access to credit play a significant role in the extent of adoption, implying land and credit constraints; hence, it can be difficult for land and credit constraint farmers to extend the adoption of the technology. In the second stage the study shows that \{IRFFS\} has a robust positive and significant impact on farm household welfare measured by household annual income, farm income, and quantity and frequency of fish consumption. Overall, the article provides evidence that promoting \{IRFFS\} technology is important to improve welfare of rural people especially for marginalized poor indigenous small-scale rural farm households in Bangladesh. But necessary interventions are needed to overcome the inhibiting factors for more widespread adoption of this promising technology. "

The occurrence of sexual maturation in the females was recorded four weeks after the first swim-up fry were observed in the pond. Broodstock was selected from full-sib families with a high (&gt;75%) or a low (&lt;20%) frequency of mature females. After about 4 weeks of single pair stocking in breeding hapas, 16 pairs of breeders from families with a mean frequency of 83% early maturing females and nine pairs of breeders, all from families with 0% early maturing females, had produced fry. The fry from each pair were reared separately until a size of 3–5 g, when totally 3179 fingerlings equally representing the 25 progeny families were tagged and communally stocked in three replicated ponds for testing. Recording of sex, body weight and occurrence of sexual maturation in the females was carried out 2, 3 or 4 weeks, respectively, after observing the first swim-up fry in the three ponds. The fish were restocked and reared until recording at harvest. The age corrected least square means across ponds and across families within selection groups for frequency of sexually mature females at intermediate recording was 57.0% and 33.6% in progeny of breeders from full-sib families with a high or a low frequency of early maturing females, respectively. The response to selection, measured as the difference between the two progeny groups, was highly significant (P=0.0002). The timing of the recording was appropriate in all three ponds. A significant correlated response in body weight of males at harvest (P=0.027) and a nearly significant correlated response in body weight of females at intermediate recording (P=0.052) was also observed. The age corrected least square means of body weight were higher in the progeny of breeders from full-sib families with a high frequency of early maturity in the females, suggesting an unfortunate genetic association between the two traits in Nile tilapia used in aquaculture. It is proposed to carry out combined selection for body weight and frequency of early maturing females in applied breeding programs for farmed Nile tilapia. "

The strains represented four wild populations collected from various locations in Africa and four populations that had been reproduced over a large number of generations for tilapia farming in Asia. Growth performance was recorded in a total of 23 739 individually tagged progeny of the 64 different strain combinations after a grow-out period of about 90 days in seven different test environments representing applied farming systems in the Philippines. Least square means of body weight at harvest were computed for each strain combination within and across test environments, and additive genetic effects, maternal (reciprocal) effects and non-additive genetic effects (heterosis) were estimated. The least square mean heterosis of both reciprocals of all strain crosses across all test environments was 4.3%, and the cross that expressed the largest non-additive genetic effect showed a least square mean heterosis of 14%. However, only seven out of the 22 crosses that expressed a significant heterosis were better performing than the best pure strain, and the largest gain was then about 11%. The least square mean heterosis within test environments ranged from 0 to 9.6%, and the largest heterosis was observed in some of the test environments with poor growth performance. Significant reciprocal effects were observed, showing that some strains performed better as sire strains and others as dam strains. Significant genotype (strain combination) by test environment interactions were also detected. The interactions were mainly associated to an expected variation in the magnitude of the differences between genotypes that was proportional to the mean performance in the test environments. However, some examples of re-ranking of the genotypes were observed, mainly associated to the non-additive component of performance. It was concluded that specific crossing schemes, possibly involving specialised sire and dam lines, may improve growth performance in Nile tilapia, but that this improvement will be quite marginal and should be accompanied by selection within the parent strains. Furthermore, the growth performance of such hybrids may be more sensitive to genotype by environment interactions affecting the non-additive component of performance. A regular selection program based on additive genetic performance will normally result in a comparable genetic improvement after a short period of repeated selection, and may then continue beyond the results obtained in the present cross experiment without the complications caused by the laborious dissemination procedures required by a crossbreeding program and the problems caused by a possibly increased environmental sensitivity in the hybrids.

All individuals exhibited daily burrowing and feeding rhythms in response to environmental factors. The cycle of the smallest juvenile, &gt;10–40 mm, was linked to light; they began to burrow around sunrise and emerged close to sunset. Their burrowing activity was inhibited by continuous darkness. Juveniles &gt;40–140 mm responded to changes in temperature; they burrowed earlier around 03:30 h, seeking shelter in the sediment as temperature declined, and emerged around mid-day. The maintenance of a constant warm temperature prevented them from burrowing. For all juveniles, time spent on the surface corresponded with feeding and periods of locomotion; while burrowed they remained stationary, did not feed and had a low intestinal transit. Organic matter content in the intestine was also found to vary with the daily cycle. Decreases in salinity from 35 to 30, 25 and 20‰ induced the burrowing of all juveniles within minutes, but they began to re-emerge after a few hours. Acclimation occurred most rapidly at salinity 30‰ and was slowest at salinity 20‰. Conversely, nearly 40% of the juveniles were unable to cope with a decrease to salinity 15‰. Juveniles of all sizes demonstrated a strong selectivity for sediment characteristics. In two substrate selection experiments, their preference for sand with a grain size around 0.4 mm and for organically rich material was firmly expressed within an hour. The general behavior of juvenile H. scabra reflects their ability to inhabit shallow sandy areas with high terrigenous inputs and variable environmental conditions. "

Independent and paired choice experiments revealed that several substrates could induce metamorphosis into pentactulae, but that specific substrates favoured settlement. Leaves of seagrass Thalassia hemprichii, with or without their natural bio-film, yielded the highest settlement rates (4.8–10.5%). T. hemprichii was preferred as a settlement substrate over sand, crushed coral, several other plant species and artificial seagrass leaves with or without a bio-film. Only settlement on the seagrass, Enhalus acoroides, was similar to that recorded for T. hemprichii. In the absence of a substrate, the larvae delayed settlement for nearly 96 h and survival was less than 0.5%. Sand and crushed coral, either alone or together, induced settlement from &lt;1.5% of the available larvae. The pentactulae found on sand, coral and in bare containers were 10–35% smaller than those on T. hemprichii leaves. Soluble extracts from T. hemprichii and E. acoroides successfully induced metamorphosis and settlement on clean plastic surfaces. Newly settled juveniles remained on the seagrass leaves for 4–5 weeks before migrating to sand at around 6 mm in length. Prior to this, the juveniles spent 4–5 days moving on and off the leaves. Once on the sand, the juveniles became deposit-feeders, but did not show the typical burrowing behaviour of older specimens until they reached around 11 mm in length. The larvae of H. scabra appear to actively select seagrass leaves, possibly through chemical detection. We hypothesise that larvae settling on seagrass have an increased chance of growth and survival because they are provided with a suitable substrate on which to grow, and a bridge to sand substrates as they become deposit-feeders.

Trochus with a mean size of 5.61 mm±0.06 \{SE\} maximum basal diameter (MBD) reared in concrete tanks used to produce juvenile giant clams attained a mean size of 28.28 mm MBD±0.25 \{SE\} after 22 weeks and grew approximately twice as fast as trochus raised in fibre-glass tanks fitted with poly-carbonate plates. Trochus from the concrete tanks were then transferred to the small (0.36 m−2) sea cages used to grow-out Tridacna derasa for the marine aquarium trade. Mortality in the sea cages was negligible and the trochus grew from a mean size of 30.52 mm MBD±0.04 to 46.33 mm±0.39 \{SE\} in 18 weeks. Stocking density and husbandry (to remove algae and sediment) had a significant effect on the growth of trochus in sea cages: animals stocked at a density of five individuals per cage grew significantly faster than those stocked at 10 per cage and growth was significantly greater in cages where the larger species of algae were removed regularly. Trochus did not appear to have any deleterious effects on the growth and survival of T. derasa. On the contrary, there was some evidence that growth and survival of the giant clams were improved at the highest stocking density of trochus. Trochus grazed on a range of filamentous and turfing algae within the sea cages but were ineffective at removing larger species of algae compared to husbandry procedures. Trochus harvested from sea cages were released at seven coral reef flat sites, with two levels of shelter. Mean survival at all sites after 4 weeks was at least 76%±4.6% \{SE\} and was not affected significantly by the amount of shelter. There were no apparent morphological weaknesses, or behavioural deficits, in the cultured trochus compared to wild individuals. In fact, the shells of cultured animals were significantly heavier than those of wild trochus. Rearing trochus in combination with giant clams produces individuals that are fit for survival in the wild at reduced cost, and paves the way for giant clam farmers to restock trochus by releasing them on reefs under their customary marine tenure, or in marine protected areas.

Diagnostic frameworks are mostly designed and used for systematic scientific analysis or impact evaluation. Through participation they also have potential to guide contextually informed improvements to management in practice, including transitions to contemporary forms of governance like the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF)—the focus of our study. We document and critically reflect on participatory diagnosis processes and outcomes at sites in Indonesia, Philippines, Solomon Islands and Tanzania. These sites were part of an international project on the implementation of the \{EAF\} and differed widely in institutional and operational contexts. The Participatory Diagnosis and Adaptive Management framework and the “issue radar” diagnosis map were used to identify, evaluate and address factors associated with navigating management transitions towards the EAF. We found that many challenges and priority actions identified by participants were similar across the four study countries. Participants emphasized habitat restoration, particularly mangrove rehabilitation, and livelihood enhancement. The importance of strengthening governance entities, networks and processes (e.g., harmonization of policies, education and awareness of policies) was also a prominent outcome of the diagnosis. Site-specific factors were also explored together with the differing views among stakeholders. We conclude that diagnosis frameworks are indeed useful tools for guiding management transitions in fisheries, particularly where they enable flexibility in approaches to diagnosing problems and applying solutions to local contexts.

Mixed models were separately fitted to the data from each selection line. There was a significant sex effect in all strains (P &lt; 0.001). A significant (P &lt; 0.001) sex by generation interaction was observed in all strains (scale effect, not reversal of rankings), except Red tilapia and O. shiranus. Least squares means showed a large range in the magnitude of body weight differences between sexes across the seven strains. The largest percentage difference between females and males was in O. aureus from Egypt (female body weight was 52.2% that of males at harvest), whereas the smallest difference was observed in the \{GIFT\} strain of O. niloticus (female body weight 84.7% that of males).

In this study, the cDNA encoding a serine proteinase homologue (SPH) with prophenoloxidase activating activity of Penaeus monodon (PmPPAF) was cloned and characterized. PmPPAF cDNA consists of 1444 nucleotides encoding a protein with 394 amino acid residues. The estimated molecular weight of PmPPAF is 43.5 kDa with an isoelectric point of 5.19. PmPPAF consists of a signal peptide, a \{CLIP\} domain and a carboxyl-terminal trypsin-like serine protease domain. It is highly similar to the masquerade-like protein 2A (61% similarity) of the crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus, other serine proteases (42.9–67% identity) of P. monodon, and the \{PPAF\} of the crab (61% similarity). Unlike other \{SPH\} of P. monodon, which express mainly in the hemocytes, PmPPAF transcripts were detected in the hemocytes, eyestalk, hypodermis, gill, swimming leg and brain. Similar to the crab PPAF, PmPPAF transcript level is high in shrimp at the premolt stages and PmPPAF expression is up-regulated in shrimp infected with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Gene silencing of PmPPAF decreased expression of a prophenoloxidase-like gene and injection of Anti-PmPPAF antibody causes a decrease in \{PO\} activity. Taken together, these results provided evidence that PmPPAF is a serine proteinase homologue, and is involved in the pro-PO activation pathway of the shrimp innate immune system. "

European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) was used as a model species at four different ages ranging from 71 to 100 days post fertilization (dpf). Two different methods were tested for non-lethal tissue sampling from each larva for \{DNA\} analysis: 1) using a sterile absorbent paper to sample mucus and/or epithelial cells by rubbing the fish skin and 2) fin-clip of the bottom part of the caudal fin. Whatever the age of the larvae, the genotyping rate (at 12 microsatellite markers) was low with the use of sterile absorbent paper but relatively high with fin-clip sampling at 80 and 87 dpf (on average 17 and 63% of the loci genotyped for sterile paper and fin clips, respectively). Several measurements were performed on digital pictures of sea bass larvae to model body weight. Using area, perimeter, length, height and volume, it was possible to estimate body weight with a coefficient of determination r2 = 0.98 on very small larvae (body weight ranging from 20.0 to 419.3 mg). The present results suggested that individual monitoring of the growth of European sea bass larvae can be achieved by combining image analysis and microsatellite genotyping as early as 87 dpf or 236 mg mean body weight.

In this paper we review the results of a regional study that examined the state of demersal fisheries resources in the coastal areas of Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. In each country time series of scientific trawl survey data (spanning 12–49 years, depending on the area) were used to assess changes in the total biomass of demersal species over time. All countries showed substantial declines in the total biomass. In Malaysia, the declines were greatest in the shallow depths (&lt;50 m) where the biomass declined to 4–20% of the original estimates. In the Gulf of Thailand, by 1995 the total biomass estimates had declined to less than 8% of the 1965 estimates. In the Philippines, changes in the biomass were examined in different bays and fishing areas and the recent estimates of the biomass were 12–64% of the original estimates. These severe declines in the total biomass are thought to be due to over-fishing, compounded by environmental degradation. While over-fishing has been previously documented for selected species or fisheries in these countries, the fishery-independent data analysed here provide the first multi-country evidence of the widespread degradation of demersal coastal resources. Exploitation ratios (fishing mortality:total mortality), calculated from length frequency data, were on average &gt;0.5, suggesting over-fishing. In Thailand a time series of exploitation ratios for 17 species showed increasing fishing pressure over time. Environmental degradation, in terms of changes in water quality and habitat modification and loss, has been documented in all countries and this is likely to be a contributing factor for the declines. The serious declines observed in these three countries are illustrative of a regional trend and highlight the urgent need for countries to reduce and manage their fishing capacity. This regional study also identified a requirement for key interventions, such as strengthening licensing systems, limiting entry to fisheries and increasing gear selectivity. It also highlighted the fact that the strategies developed must take into account the context of the developing countries and the broader socioeconomic role of fisheries. "

Although aquaculture must provide much of the additional fish, it remains to be seen whether restored or enhanced capture fisheries can also help fill the projected gap in supply. The key challenges for capture fisheries involve reducing fishing effort, removing excess fishing capacity and building the institutional arrangements needed to restore spawning biomass to more productive levels, and to reverse degradation of the supporting habitats. Two interventions, based largely on hatchery technology, have the potential to reduce the time needed to rebuild some severely over-exploited fisheries, or improve the productivity of other ‘healthy’ fisheries. These interventions are ‘restocking’, which involves releasing cultured juveniles to restore spawning biomass to levels where the fishery can once again support regular harvests, and ‘stock enhancement’, which involves release of cultured juveniles to overcome recruitment limitation. However, despite the potential of these interventions, few restocking and stock enhancement programmes have met expectations. The main problems have been a pre-occupation with bio-technical research at the expense of objective analysis of the need for the intervention, and failure to integrate the technology within an appropriate management scheme that has the participation and understanding of the users. The papers presented at the Special Symposium on this subject at the Seventh Asian Fisheries Forum provide a series of valuable lessons to guide objective assessment of the potential for restocking and stock enhancement. They also show how to implement these interventions responsibly and effectively where they are deemed to add value to other forms of management. Above all, these studies demonstrate that restocking and stock enhancement programmes are applied in complex human–environment systems, involving dynamic interactions between the resource, the technical intervention and the people who use it.

To this end, founder hybridization between Oreochromis niloticus (with favorable growth traits) and Oreochromis mossambicus (with favorable salinity tolerance traits) was performed and followed by backcrossing with O. mossambicus to develop a strain highly tolerant to saline environments. Genetic selection for growth performance was subsequently conducted. The aim of the present study was to estimate growth performance and survival of the hybrid in two rearing environments following four generations of genetic selection. A comparison between the hybrid and an internal reference line was performed in two distinct environments: one intensive (tanks: feed and high stocking density) and one extensive (fertilized earthen ponds: without feed and low stocking density) system. The selection experiment consisted of a within group or within family selection with a random mating system. The selection criterion was body weight at five months, and salinity tolerance was passively selected by rearing fish in brackish water. After four generations of selection, the average body weight of the hybrid had increased by 50 g compared to the red tilapia internal reference line, which corresponds to a gain of 12.5 g or 7.3% per generation. Average weight in the intensive system was greater than in the extensive system (65.8 and 38.7% at the last generation in male and female, respectively). Realized heritability of body weight was only significant in the intensive system (0.19 ± 0.07 vs. 0.17 ± 0.06 in the extensive system). This selection scheme was performed in brackish water, allowing a passive selection on salinity tolerance, as shown by the improvement of the survival rate according to the generation in intensive and extensive systems.

Average selection response (per generation) in body weight at harvest (transformed to square root) estimated as the difference between the Selection line and the Control group was 7.4% calculated from least squares mean (LSMs), 7.0% from estimated breeding values (EBVs) and 4.4% calculated from \{EBVs\} between two consecutive generations. Favorable correlated selection responses (estimated from LSMs) were found for other body traits including: total length, cephalothorax length, abdominal length, cephalothorax width, and abdominal width (12.1%, 14.5%, 10.4%, 15.5% and 13.3% over three selection generations, respectively). Data in the second generation of selection showed positive correlated responses for carcass weight traits including: abdominal weight, exoskeleton-off weight, and telson-off weight of 8.8%, 8.6% and 8.8%, respectively. We conclude that body weight at harvest responded well to the application of combined (between and within) family selection and correlated responses in carcass weight traits were favorable. "

Variance and covariance components were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood fitting a multi-trait animal model. Across generations, estimates of heritability for body and carcass weight traits were moderate and ranged from 0.14 to 0.19 and 0.17 to 0.21, respectively. Body trait heritabilities estimated for females were significantly higher than for males whereas carcass weight trait heritabilities estimated for females and males were not significantly different (P &gt; 0.05). Maternal effects for body traits accounted for 4 to 5% of the total variance and were greater in females than in males. Genetic correlations among body traits were generally high in the mixed sexes. Genetic correlations between body and carcass weight traits were also high. Although some issues remain regarding the best statistical model to be fitted to \{GFP\} data, our results suggest that selection for high harvest body weight based on breeding values estimated by fitting an animal model to the data can significantly improve mean body and carcass weight in GFP.

Here, we synthesise the fields of progress, current impediments and research opportunities in tropical sea cucumber aquaculture arising from recent studies and an Indo-Pacific symposium. We present novel comparisons of data from hatcheries, earthen ponds and sea pens from published and unpublished studies in various countries. Of the few tropical species to have been cultured, only the sandfish Holothuria scabra has been bred extensively. While risks from hatchery-produced sea cucumbers are recognised, more genetic research is needed in farming and sea-ranching programmes. Advances have been made in the culture and nursery rearing of tropical sea cucumber juveniles but few have been published. Sandfish larvae have now been grown successfully on just one microalga species, but experimental studies to optimise culture conditions are needed urgently. Disease of tropical sea cucumbers in culture is infrequent but the treatment of disease and parasites is understudied. Earthen ponds are currently most effective for nursery rearing of juvenile sandfish to a size for stocking. Growth rates and survival of sandfish in ponds to market size are also favourable, and should improve via studies on stocking density, feeding regimes and pond management. Sea pens confer ownership of released stock and can provide a means of limiting predation in natural habitats but the costs of materials, maintenance and surveillance against poaching can diminish profitability. Sea ranching has minimal material costs but needs a large leased area and may require juveniles to be marked prior to release. Retail prices of sandfish in Hong Kong increased exponentially with body size. A cost-benefit analysis illustrated that labour and utility costs in pond farming will preclude profitability of monoculture in some cases, forcing proponents to look towards co-culture or gamble with uncertain survival in sea ranching. Better governance and consultation regarding the stocking of sea cucumbers have been advocated. We conclude that well-designed experiments and meta-analyses are needed to fill critical knowledge gaps if sea cucumber mariculture is to expand in the tropics as it has in temperate Asia. Co-culture remains a burgeoning frontier despite poor success of initial studies. Sea cucumbers have superb potential to diversify mariculture industries in the tropics and potentially ameliorate the detrimental effects of mariculture on coastal ecosystems. "

Despite the importance of this species very little is known about genetic parameters of commercially important pearl traits. As an initial step towards developing a selective breeding program, site selection effects, donor oyster derived genetic parameters and genotype by environment (G × E)interactions were estimated for pearl quality traits of P. maxima, originating from three populations (Aru, Bali, West Papua), reared at two commercial grow-out locations in Indonesia (Bali and Lombok). Microsatellite-based \{DNA\} parentage analyses were used to assign oysters to families and population of origin. Six pearl traits that are together the major determinants of pearl value (pearl weight (g), size (mm), shape, colour, complexion and lustre) were recorded at harvest. Pearls produced at the Lombok site were bigger and more valuable compared to pearls produced at the Bali site (P &lt; 0.05). G × E interactions were present for size (rg = − 0.22), colour (rg = 0.28), weight (rg = 0.38), shape (rg = 0.56) and lustre (rg = 0.59) due to re-ranking of relative family performances at the two sites, although there were large standard errors associated with these estimates. Complexion was the only trait that showed little evidence for re-ranking (rg = 0.85).

The test environments included earthen ponds (fertilized with inorganic fertilizer, organic manure, or on-farm agricultural residues), cage culture, rice-fish, and ponds at test stations located in different agro-climatic regions. Heritability estimates for harvest body weight within test environments and generation were on average h2 = 0.31 (range 0.06–0.68) and the estimates for effects common to full sibs other than additive genetic effects c2 = 0.09 (range 0.04–0.16). The estimates tended to be higher in cage test environments. After adjusting for heterogeneous variances of harvest body weight across generations, test environments and sexes, the estimates across test environments within generations were on average h2 = 0.23 and c2 = 0.03 over the five generations, while the estimate across all test environments and generations was h2 = 0.16 ± 0.02 and c2 = 0.10 ± 0.01. The genetic correlations (rg) between harvest body weights of sibs in different test environments were in general high (0.53–0.99, mean 0.89) for all environments except for intensive cage culture, implying minor genotype by environment (G × E) interactions. The genetic correlations involving the intensive cage culture environment were lower (0.08–0.43) and not significantly different from zero, suggesting that G × E interactions may occur if test environments differ widely. It is proposed that this G × E interaction may involve effects of sexual maturation on growth in pond environments. The overall heritability for body weight at harvest of females (0.20 ± 0.02) was not significantly different from that of males (0.16 ± 0.02). However, these estimates were lower in ponds than in cages, in particular for male body weight. Estimates of genetic correlations between harvest body weight of sib males and females also suggested a moderate sex by genotype interaction in ponds (rg = 0.78 ± 0.04) that did not occur in cages (rg = 0.97 ± 0.04). These results are consistent with the realization that the \{GIFT\} population responds well to selection for increased body weight at harvest across a wide range of pond farm environments (including rice–fish culture) without the need to develop environment specific selection lines. The benefits of specialized selection for intensive cage farming systems should be investigated further. "

Today, with co-management widely embraced by the research community and adopted as policy by an increasing number of governments, a second-generation perspective has emerged. This perspective is distinguished by efforts to navigate and influence change in the broader institutional and governance context: (a) a more sophisticated appreciation of politics, power relations, and the role of the state, (b) efforts to manage resource competition beyond the fisheries sector, (c) building institutions for adaptation and learning, and (d) recognizing divergent values and goals influencing fisheries management. This paper traces the evolution of this second-generation perspective, noting how it has built on learning from early practice and how it has been cross-fertilized by theoretical innovations in related fields, notably resilience thinking and political ecology. We illustrate this evolution through analysis of experience in the Philippines, with a relatively long experience of learning and adaptation in fisheries co-management practice, and Vietnam, where fisheries co-management policies have been embraced more recently. Characterizing the second-generation perspective helps identify points of convergence in the research and policy community about what needs attention, providing a basis for more systematic cross-country and cross-regional learning.

Surveys by the Malawi Department of Fisheries have shown a decrease in chambo density in the southeast arm of the lake and the annual harvest has dropped substantially since 1985. We conducted a dynamic stock assessment of Oreochromis spp. which included all vessel and gear types and covered the entire southeast arm of Lake Malawi. Chambo biomass peaked in 1982 and then declined continuously through the early 2000s. The biomass is highly correlated with the mean lake height two years prior suggesting that recruitment may be linked to increased nutrient input, and spawning and nursery habitat associated with the flooding of low lying areas. The main driver of chambo biomass, however, was fishing pressure which was above the level that would achieve maximum sustainable yield during the entire time series. This study provides a baseline from which to measure changes due to future management actions or climate variations. "

Malawi lakes are under considerable stress due to high population growth and increasing levels of poverty which have led to overexploitation of fishery resources. High rates of soil erosion in the lake catchments are increasing siltation of shallow lakes, deltas and embayments, affecting water quality and fish breeding habitats, thereby degrading fish production potential. This review further shows that past and current management approaches have focused on maximizing sustainable yield and have failed to adequately incorporate socio-ecological factors and broader lake catchment processes into fisheries management plans. This, in turn, led to the top-down development of fisheries laws and technical regulations which were difficult to enforce, increased conflict between resource users and fisheries managers, and failed to control fisheries over-exploitation and the collapse of the chambo (tilapia) and cyprinid fisheries. The paper recommends that the fisheries policy should be reviewed to focus on resilience of fisheries, environment and livelihoods. Policy makers should adopt integrated management planning to address the diverse interest of stakeholders in lake basins, as well as the ecological, socio-economic and external factors threatening sustainability of lake ecosystems and livelihoods of dependent communities.

The effects of introducing tilapia into existing integrated farming systems on the broader pond-dike system and associated livelihoods in rural and peri-urban settlements in central north (Mymensingh District) of Bangladesh were evaluated. Farmer participatory research carried out during June 2004 to March 2005 showed that production of fish could be substantially increased by increasing nutrient inputs rather than by stocking tilapia as an additional species. However, the ‘improved’ nutrient input applied by farmers was still well below the level required for optimal tilapia performance. Rural households benefited more than peri-urban households through enhanced direct consumption of fish and vegetables. In contrast, peri-urban households benefited more through cash sales of both fish and vegetables than rural households. Households with access to ponds, identified as relatively better-off and worse-off in the researched communities benefited equally selling and consuming fish and vegetable. Similar production levels of vegetable production between groups applying different fish culture practises suggesting that increased investment in fish production is complementary rather than competitive to vegetable production in integrated pond-dike farming systems. It was concluded that considerable potential exists to further develop pond-dike systems, which would improve livelihoods of both better-off and worse-off producers. Reference is made to the potential impacts of such changes in integrated pond-dike management if promoted more widely in Bangladesh. "

Crosses were established over two generations using two wild Vietnamese river populations (Dong Nai and Mekong) domesticated for the study and an introduced Hawaiian strain that had been in culture for many generations. Juveniles from nine strain combinations were produced using single-pair matings. Results after 15 weeks of grow-out in hapas showed that growth performance of the Hawaiian strain was best among the purebred strains and that certain cross combinations grew significantly faster than purebred strains. Mean body weights of specific cross combinations with Dong Nai or Mekong as dams and the introduced strain (Hawaiian) as sires were significantly heavier than those of purebred Dong Nai or Mekong strains. While males reached heavier mean weights than females, male variation among the strains was obscured by social factors that produced different frequencies of male morphotypes (blue claw, orange claw and small males). Results suggest presence of potentially valuable heterosis and possible impact of the direction of cross. From a practical viewpoint this could be exploited upon by either, including different forms of crossbreeding, or alternatively, by creating a composite population for future selection.

In Bangladesh, estimates suggest that the country’s potential rice–fish production system encompasses 2–3 million hectares of land. But despite three decades of research on biophysical and technical aspects of rice–fish systems, this potential has not been fully realized due to insufficient attention given to the social, economic, and policy dimensions of rice–fish system improvement. This paper provides a characterization of the diverse and changing nature of rice–fish systems in Bangladesh to shed new light on the economic viability of different rice–fish systems and recommend policy and investment options to accelerate the development of appropriate rice–fish technologies. Data are drawn from a novel subdistrict-level survey of fishery officers, a household/enterprise survey, focus group discussions, and a meta-review of the literature on aquaculture in the country, all of which were conducted in 2010–2011. Findings indicate that concurrent rice–fish systems, alternating rice–fish systems, and collectively managed systems offer considerable potential for increasing productivity and farm incomes in Bangladesh. Findings also suggest that while innovation in these rice–fish systems is being driven by households and communities, there is need for more supportive government policies and investments to enable further innovation. Policymakers need to develop effective regulations to promote feed and fish quality and quantity, for example. More rigorous analysis of the intended and unintended impacts of these policies and investments is also necessary. "

Fry were produced and reared in hapas suspended in fertilized ponds until time of tagging. In total 1832 fish were tagged with Floy® tags and stocked in two fertilized earthen ponds. During the experiment fish were not fed but relied entirely on natural food available in the ponds. Fish were harvested after a period of 8 months, which included 3 months of over-wintering. Results show that level of inbreeding significantly affected early fry survival and body weight at stocking. Level of inbreeding did not affect survival and body weight at harvest. Pond, weight at stocking, sire and dam had significant effects on body weight and pond survival at harvest. \{FA\} was not significantly affected by the level of inbreeding or sire. However, \{FA\} was significantly affected by dam (which constitutes the combined effects of hapa rearing, age of fish and maternal (genetic) effects), and pond. This suggests that \{FA\} is more influenced by environmental than by genetic factors in the population of Nile tilapia studied. The observed difference in effects of inbreeding on early and later life stages can be explained by strong natural selection on fitness during over-wintering. "

We investigated the effects of sex ratio, relatedness (kinship coefficient) and level of inbreeding on the reproductive success in Nile tilapia under semi-natural mass spawning conditions in two net enclosures (hapas). Fry were collected from the mouth of incubating females on a weekly basis and parentage assignment was done on 1115 offspring from 56 spawnings using seven polymorphic microsatellite markers. Results show that the degree of pairwise relatedness, measured by kinship coefficient, did not have any significant effect on the reproductive success of males. Female total fecundity was significantly affected by the level of inbreeding but not by body weight and gonadosomatic index. Male reproductive success, calculated as the proportion of offspring sired within a single spawning, was significantly affected by the level of inbreeding, body weight, \{GSI\} of males and sex ratio. Effects of inbreeding on male reproductive success were higher in the presence of higher number of males suggesting that the effects of inbreeding are magnified under stronger male–male competition. Our results show that there is no inbreeding avoidance via kin recognition and that accumulation of inbreeding in tilapia populations is counterbalanced by reduced reproductive success of inbred males and females.

This paper takes an empirical approach by focusing on the fundamentals of resilience thinking to evaluate its usefulness in developing relevant management interventions in small-scale fisheries in the Niger River Basin in West Africa. The paper presents the outputs of a participatory assessment exercise where both fishery communities and local experts were involved at two different scales. The resilience frame used was designed to facilitate the identification of socially defined thresholds that help delineate the desirability of the current system configuration and provides a diagnosis framework that tailors management solutions to problems in local context. The analysis highlights some key contributions from resilience thinking to the challenge of diagnosis in small-scale fisheries management in developing countries, as well as important contributions that emerge from taking a pragmatic and critical approach to its application.

To address this failing, we consider how a rights-based approach broadens understanding of adaptive capacity while directing attention towards causes of exclusion and marginalisation. Drawing on human rights principles and lessons from rights-based practice, we develop a novel analytical tool for use with communities that considers adaptive capacity through examination of equality, transparency, accountability and empowerment. We apply this to the illustrative case of aquatic agricultural systems in Timor-Leste. This approach yields a qualitative analysis that unpacks the formal and informal institutions and actors that structure opportunities and barriers to adaptive actions. The rights framing exposes the processes of marginalisation and exclusion that lead to differentiation in adaptive capacity, but at the same time helps identify concrete actions that can be taken as part of a rights-based approach to development support for adaptive capacity. The tool and empirical illustration support an emerging body of thought that adaptive capacity requires development actors to engage not only with the technical challenges of responding to climate change, but also with the social and political context that determines the distribution of costs and benefits.

These provide the opportunity to explore continuing controversies over the production efficiencies and ecological functioning of large tropical lakes. In Lake Malawi these models can provide important insight to the effect of fishing on fish composition, and the potential competition that the lakefly Chaoborus edulis may have with fisheries production. A mass-balanced trophic model developed for the demersal fish community of the southern and western areas of Lake Malawi was integrated with an existing trophic model developed for the open-water pelagic. Input parameters for the demersal model were obtained from a survey of fish distributions, fish food consumption studies, and from additional published quantitative and qualitative information on the various biotic components of the community. The model was constructed using the Ecopath approach and software. The graphically presented demersal food web spanned four trophic levels and was based primarily on consumption of detritus, zooplankton and sedimented diatoms. Zooplankton was imported into the system at trophic levels three and four through fish predation on carnivorous and herbivorous copepods and Chaoborus larvae. It is proposed that the primary consumption of copepods was by fish migrating into the pelagic zone. Chaoborus larvae in the demersal were probably consumed near the lakebed as they conducted a daily migration from the pelagic to seek refuge in the sediments. This evidence for strong benthic–pelagic coupling provided the opportunity for linking the demersal model to the existing model for the pelagic community so producing the first model for the complete ecosystem. Energy fluxes through the resulting combined model demonstrated that the primary import of biomass to the demersal system was detritus of pelagic origin (72.1%) and pelagic zooplankton (10.6%). Only 15.8% of the biomass consumed within the demersal system was of demersal origin. Lakefly production is efficiently utilised by the lake fish community, and any attempt to improve fishery production through introduction of a non-native plantivorous fish species would have a negative impact on the stability and productivity of the lake ecosystem.

Two-way \{ANOVAs\} and \{MANOVA\} were, respectively, used to test the effects of the two factors on individual rice pest injuries, and on the profile of injuries that an individual rice crop experiences over a cropping season. Fourteen injuries were considered, which individually were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) influenced by crop establishment (nine injuries), by water management (11 injuries), or their interaction (nine injuries). Multiple analysis of variance indicated that rice injury profiles, regionally, are altered by both factors. The results suggested that injuries caused by some pests would be enhanced (e.g., brown spot, planthoppers) or reduced (e.g., stem rot, sheath blight, rice whorl maggot) by crop establishment shifting from transplanting to direct-seeding. Water shortages, proxied in our data by poor water management, would favour some injuries (e.g., sheath rot, brown spot, neck blast, whiteheads) or suppress others (e.g., stem rot, sheath blight). Very strong increases in weed infestation were observed with both direct-seeding and poor water management. The results are discussed with respect to pest management in rice. "

However, existing data on the nutrient composition of fish do not reflect the large diversity available and have focused on only a few select nutrients. The purpose of this study was to fill the gaps in existing data on the nutrient profiles of common fish in Bangladesh by analysing the proximate, vitamin, mineral and fatty acid composition of 55 fish, shrimp and prawn species from inland capture, aquaculture and marine capture fisheries. When comparing species, the composition of nutrients of public health significance was diverse. Iron ranged from 0.34 to 19 mg/100 g, zinc from 0.6 to 4.7 mg/100 g, calcium from 8.6 to 1900 mg/100 g, vitamin A from 0 to 2503 μg/100 g and vitamin \{B12\} from 0.50 to 14 μg/100 g. Several species were rich in essential fatty acids, particularly docosohexaenoic acid in capture fisheries species (86–310 mg/100 g). The potential contribution of each species to recommended nutrient intakes (RNIs) for pregnant and lactating women (PLW) and infants was calculated. Seven species for \{PLW\} and six species for infants, all from inland capture, and all typically consumed whole with head and bones, could potentially contribute ≥25% of \{RNIs\} for three or more of these nutrients, simultaneously, from a standard portion. This illustrates the diversity in nutrient content of fish species and in particular the rich nutrient composition of small indigenous species, which should guide policy and programmes to improve food and nutrition security in Bangladesh.

However, indiscriminate fishing of wild postlarvae, with high levels of by-catch, has an impact on biodiversity in coastal ecosystems. This has provoked imposition of restrictions on postlarvae collection. The ban has, however, not been firmly enforced because of the lack of alternative livelihoods for coastal poor. A conceptual framework, drawn from an approach to poverty reduction known as the sustainable livelihoods approach, is applied to understanding the role of prawn postlarvae fishing. Evidence from this study suggests that postlarvae fishers faced a number of livelihood constraints, including poor livelihood assets.

In order to analyze trends in resource exploitation and market dynamics, this paper reviews global production and trade data for these taxa. Sea cucumber capture production has plateaued, but overall production is still increasing because of rising aquaculture, limited public conservation concern and insufficient regulation of fishing and trade. Shark capture production has peaked and is declining, suggesting that one or more of these factors are constraining the shark fin trade. The trade networks for both commodities have been resilient to changing conditions (e.g. stock declines, closed fisheries, regulations, public opinion on conservation) and have become more widespread over the last 10 years. System resilience is evident in dynamic market attributes, such as developing new product forms and absorbing alternative target species, and presents substantial challenges for identifying conservation approaches. For shark fin, a government-led backlash against conspicuous consumption in China, combined with global conservation momentum, appears to have had some impact on traded volumes. Sea cucumbers do not enjoy the same level of attention in the global conservation discourse, despite seven species being endangered. For both taxa, the current regulatory environment is insufficient to safeguard resources and strengthened conservation strategies are required. Better resolution of trade data will improve the ability to evaluate trends and guide management and conservation. "

Economic assessments of coral reef provisioning services afforded to rural communities in Solomon Islands identified a diverse range of fisheries-based (fish, seaweed, clam, trochus, crayfish and shells) and coral-based (sand, rubble, stone, and corals for lime, aquarium and curio trades) products. Fisheries products (in particular reef fish) were important for both village subsistence and cash economies, providing the equivalent of \{US\} $5173 (±515) annually per respondent. In contrast, coral products contributed the equivalent of \{US\} $2213 (±396) annually per respondent, primarily to cash economies, particularly in study villages located in close proximity to national markets. Extractive coral activities have the potential to reduce reef resilience, diminish the viability of fisheries and so compromise the livelihoods of dependent communities.

Worldwide production of aquatic resources has grown rapidly in the past few decades, and aquaculture production in Asia has played a decisive role in this growth. We examine the main forms of coordination found along these value chains and the role that institutional frameworks play in governing them. We observe that negative publicity, driven by \{NGO\} and media campaigns, has led to increased use of third-party certification and the adoption of public and private standards. We find that the most sophisticated aquaculture operations in Asia are found in value chains led by retailers and branded processors and where the quality of domestic institutional frameworks has facilitated compliance with increasing demands from buyers overseas. Finally, we reflect on the sustainability challenges of aquaculture and provide four broad observations on the governance of food value chains. "

An increasingly large proportion of Chinese aquatic product consumption is coming from imported sources, making the market of high significance not only for stakeholders in China, but from around the world. Yet little is understood about the key characteristics of this market. In this paper we surveyed 300 middle-class urban consumers of aquatic products in Beijing and Shanghai about patterns of aquatic product consumption and attitudes towards sustainability. We asked about the major types of aquatic products consumed, the forms of aquatic products consumed, the different types of venues aquatic products are consumed in, the purchasing location of aquatic products, and the different types of motivation behind aquatic product consumption. We also examined awareness of and attitudes towards a range of public awareness campaigns on environmentalism, understandings of the endangered status of different types of aquatic products, and attitudes towards a range of topics related to sustainability and consumption. Our results indicate limited levels of awareness on a range of issues to do with sustainability among urban middle-class Chinese consumers. Education level was closely correlated with support for Marine Stewardship Council concepts and environmental advertisements. Our results highlight some of the opportunities and challenges faced by both government and market actors in improving sustainability in the Chinese consumer market. "

In doing so we evaluate the quality and scientific rigor of that evidence, identify the key conclusions that emerge from the literature, and assess whether these conclusions are consistent across the sources. The results of the assessment show that while some specific topics are consistently and rigorously documented, thus substantiating some of the claims found in the literature, other areas of research still lack the level of disaggregated data or an appropriate methodology to reach consistency and robust conclusions. More specifically, the analysis reveals that while fish contributes undeniably to nutrition and food security, the links between fisheries/aquaculture and poverty alleviation are complex and still unclear. In particular national and household level studies on fisheries’ contributions to poverty alleviation lack good conceptual models and produce inconsistent results. For aquaculture, national and household studies tend to focus on export value chains and use diverse approaches. They suggest some degree of poverty alleviation and possibly other positive outcomes for adopters, but these outcomes also depend on the small-scale farming contexts and on whether adoption was emergent or due to development assistance interventions. Impacts of fish trade on food security and poverty alleviation are ambiguous and confounded by a focus on international trade and a lack of consistent methods. The influences of major drivers (decentralization, climate change, demographic transition) are still insufficiently documented and therefore poorly understood. Finally the evaluation reveals that evidence-based research and policy narratives are often disconnected, with some of the strongest and long-lasting policy narratives lacking any strong and rigorous evidence-based validation. Building on these different results, this paper identifies six key gaps facing policy-makers, development practitioners, and researchers. "

However, our understanding of the effectiveness of co-management on marine resources and socio economic conditions is relatively limited, often due to insufficient resources to support monitoring based on ecological condition or catch landings data. Monitoring programmes based on the perceptions of resource users are often presented as a cost effective alternative to understanding the status and changes in resource and socio economic conditions. Ecological, catch landings and perception-based data, and their collection methods, have different benefits and limitations for community-based programmes. Here we present a study of the first community-based, co-managed area in the Kingdom of Tonga − the small island of ‘O’ua. We examine both perception-based data from interviews and catch landings data to describe fishing activities, catches and changes in resource status and socio economic conditions since the inception of co-management. Landings data were collected by the community over a five year period; perceptions of change and management performance were collected through structured interviews with fishers based on the same time period. The majority of fishing within the ‘O’ua co-managed area was by men, using hand spears in fibreglass vessels &lt;5 m in length powered by an outboard engine. We found that catch per unit effort was high (especially the estimates generated from perception data) compared to other parts of the Pacific. Since the inception of co-management fishers reported improved socio economic conditions, a greater sense of stewardship over resources, active involvement in management and the effective exclusion of ‘outside’ fishers. We compared catch and catch-per-unit-effort estimates generated from landings and perception data. While fishers perceived that catches had improved since the inception of co-management, landings data suggested that catches were either stable or declining. These differences are important as they would suggest very different management responses. We discuss the trade-offs between the catch landings and perception data in terms of accuracy, precision, participation and cost for the purpose of guiding adjustments to co-management. "

Juveniles of approximately 4 g mean weight were released inside 100 m2 sea pens installed within seagrass meadows nearby partner communities, under the care of local ‘wardens’. Within each sea pen, varying levels of protection (free release, 1-day cage and 7-day cage) were provided at release in order to determine if short-term predator exclusion improved survival. Ossicles of juvenile sandfish were tagged with different fluorochromes for each treatment and sandfish survival and growth was recorded after release. A range of biophysical parameters were recorded at the four sites. Contrary to expectations, short-term cage protection did not lead to higher survival at three sites, while a fourth site, despite meeting all considered criteria for suitable release habitat, experienced total loss of juveniles. There were significant differences in mean weight of juveniles between sites after four months. Multivariate analysis of biophysical factors clearly separated the sea pen habitats, strongly differentiating the best-performing site from the others. However, further research is needed to elucidate which biophysical or human factors are most useful in predicting the quality of potential sea ranch sites. Methods developed or refined through these trials could be used to establish pilot test plots at potential ranching sites to assess site suitability and provide guidance on the level of animal husbandry required before commencing community sea ranching operations in New Ireland Province, PNG.

Intuitively, a “common species” is a species that is abundant in a certain area, widespread and at low risk of extinction. Analysing and classifying species commonness can help discovering indicators of ecosystem status and can prevent sudden changes in biodiversity. However, it is challenging to quantitatively define this concept. This paper presents a procedure to automatically characterize species commonness from biological surveys. Our approach uses clustering analysis techniques and is based on a number of numerical parameters extracted from an authoritative source of biodiversity data, i.e. the Ocean Biogeographic Information System. The analysis takes into account abundance, geographical and temporal aspects of species distributions. We apply our model to North Sea fish species and show that the classification agrees with independent expert opinion although sampling biases affect the data. Furthermore, we show that our approach is robust to noise in the data and is promising in classifying new species. Our method can be used in conservation biology, especially to reduce the effects of the sampling biases which affect large biodiversity collections. "

abstract = "AbstractBackground Since 1961, global per capita fish consumption has nearly doubled. Much of the increase has been due to aquaculture. Bangladesh, the world's eighth largest fish producing country, has been part of this transformation. Despite having vitamin A supplementation and fortification programs, the prevalence of inadequate vitamin A intake (IVAI) in Bangladesh is very high, estimated to be 60%. The promotion of a small indigenous fish, high in vitamin A – mola carplet – offers a promising food-based approach to improving vitamin A status of the 98% of Bangladeshis who eat fish. The objective of this paper was to conduct a benefit–cost analysis of a national household pond Mola Promotion Program (MPP) in Bangladesh. Methods Using the 2005 Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) and nutrition and health statistics, we developed baseline estimates of usual vitamin A intake, the prevalence of \{IVAI\} and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to vitamin A deficiency (VAD). Drawing on a WorldFish project and \{HIES\} data, we designed and modeled the implementation of a MPP, and calculated the additional vitamin A intake it would provide, calculated new incidence rates of VAD-related health outcomes and estimated MPP-attributable annual changes in DALYs. The MPP's total health benefits were calculated over the program's 11-year phase-in as the annual sum of \{DALYs\} saved. The MPP's costs were estimated as the sum of the costs of a small fish program of the Fisheries Development Program plus the costs of mola brood stock, other inputs and additional farmer training-related costs. Program costs and benefits were combined to produce estimates of the cost-effectiveness of the program. Results An 11-year, $23 million project would increase average daily vitamin A intakes by 7 μg retinol activity equivalent (RAE), reduce the prevalence of \{IVAI\} by 1.1 percentage points, and save 3000 lives and 100,000 DALYs, at a cost of $194 per \{DALY\} saved. The MPP's impact would be concentrated among homestead pond-fishing households that would consume 60% of the additional mola produced. Among these, it would reduce \{IVAI\} prevalence by 7 percentage points. If the \{MPP\} was implemented for at least 20 years, it would dominate – have higher health benefits and lower total costs – than a national vitamin A wheat flour fortification program. Conclusion By World Bank and World Health Organization criteria, the \{MPP\} is a cost-effective approach to reduce the burden of micronutrient malnutrition in Bangladesh. "

A survey on the use of chemical and biological products was conducted between November 2011 and June 2012 using structured questionnaires administered to operators of nine farm groups, including homestead ponds, carps, tilapias, koi fish, shrimps, shrimps and prawns, prawns, rice and fish, and pangas. Farm type and farm owner characteristics were used as independent variables to explain observed chemical use. Forty-six chemical and biological products (7 water and sediment treatment compounds, 13 disinfectants, 7 antibiotics, 7 pesticides, 8 fertilizers and 4 feed additives and probiotics) were reported to be applied in aquaculture. The use of disinfectants and antibiotics was found to be highest in intensive koi and pangas farms as compared to other farm groups, whereas the use of fertilizers was lowest in these farm groups. A higher percentage of prawn and shrimp/prawn farmers applied pesticides than other farm groups. A multivariate analysis showed that patterns of use of chemical and biological products were significantly different across aquaculture farm groups, with the largest number of chemical compounds used by the intensive koi farm group. The study shows that, despite rapid expansion of commercial aquaculture in Bangladesh, use of chemical and biological products is still relatively low compared to other aquaculture producing countries in Asia. However, despite this finding, the study identified a large number of compounds that are currently in use, and that require further regulation and evaluation regarding their potential environmental and human health impacts, as already done in most developed countries.

The base population for selection was composed of a mixture of various three- and four-way cross individuals descending from four wild African strains and four farmed Asian strains. Methods for single pair mating, separate rearing of full-sib groups and individual tagging and pedigree recording were developed. The parents for a new generation were selected based on a selection index including their own age corrected-body weight at harvest as well as that of their full- and half-sibs. Across generations, a total of 512 males were mated in a nested mating design to 941 females to produce 81,429 tagged progenies. Of those, 56,633 progeny had their body weight recorded at harvest after grow-out testing in a diverse range of farming environments. Estimates of the within generation realized response to selection across farming environments were obtained as the difference between the least squares mean performance of offspring of selected parents and of offspring of parents with average values of the selection index. The average realized response to selection per generation was 13.6% (range 9.0 to 20.1%), resulting in an accumulated response over five generations of 88% relative to the base population. A genetic trend analysis based on \{BLUP\} breeding values estimated across generations after the termination of the project suggested an accumulated response of 67%. The genetic composition of the synthetic population also changed during selection. The proportion of ancestors from three of the wild African founder strains increased from 59.7 to 76.3%. The accumulated coefficient of inbreeding was 7.1%. After the termination of the \{GIFT\} project, selection was continued in the \{GIFT\} population. The population has also been used as a genetic source in a number of similar public and private selection programs. A status review of the presently recorded dissemination of the genetic material and methodology is presented. Statement of relevance The \{GIFT\} project showed that five generations of repeated selection based on testing of individually tagged and pedigreed individuals from a synthetic farmed population of Nile tilapia gradually increased the body weight at harvest. The total increase was 67–88%. Reports from several descending populations shows that the selection response has continued during &gt; 10–15 additional generations. "

Critical fisheries management implications of the observed assemblage patterns are discussed, particularly in terms of the existing spatial management zones. Existing management zones are based on distance from shore and were found to be largely inconsistent with the assemblage patterns observed.

However, considerable planning, monitoring and research is still needed to understand and fulfil the potential of nearshore FADs. Investments are required to (1) identify the locations where \{FADs\} are likely to make the greatest contributions to the food security of rural (coastal) communities, and yield good catches near urban centres; (2) integrate the use of \{FADs\} with other livelihood options available to rural communities and remove any blockages preventing such communities from harnessing the full range of benefits from FADs; (3) assess whether exclusion zones for industrial fishing provide adequate access to tuna for small-scale-fishers; (4) determine if small-scale fishers are able to catch sufficient tuna to meet the protein needs of rural communities; (5) evaluate whether \{FADs\} add value to coral reef management initiatives; and (6) improve the design and placement of nearshore FADs. This paper describes these investments and outlines other steps that governments and their development partners need to take to establish and maintain nearshore \{FADs\} as part of national infrastructure for food security of PICTs.

A base population (G0) was established from six carp stocks using single pair mating. Selection was based on high breeding values for body weight at harvest, with a corresponding control group selected on average breeding values of the population. In the following two selected generations (G1 and G2), families were produced using a partial factorial mating design. Each family in \{G1\} and \{G2\} was split and reared using communal early rearing (CER) or separate early rearing (SER) methods. Molecular markers were used to maintain pedigree information in \{CER\} whereas physical tagging was applied in SER. Both \{CER\} and \{SER\} were managed under otherwise similar conditions. The data for growth traits were analyzed using a univariate mixed model to estimate breeding values, variance components and response to selection. Response to selection was estimated by two different methods: (i) comparing the least squares means of the selection and control lines, and (ii) comparing the estimated breeding values of the selection and control lines. In CER, the response to selection for body weight and length varied from 15.0% to 21.4% and 4.0% to 7.2% per generation, respectively, at final measurement. In SER, the responses to selection were lower for both traits, varying from 7.9% to 8.2% and 3.5% to 4.1% per generation for weight and length, respectively. The estimated responses to selection based on least squares means were in good agreement with those calculated from breeding values. Selection under the \{CER\} rearing system resulted in greater estimated genetic response relative to SER. The reasons why this may have happened are discussed. "

In the main experiment, we reared swim-up fry from 25 full-sib families separately for 42 days at 15 fry/m2 density in hapas suspended in two earthen ponds. Hapas were arranged in two column arrays along the sides of the ponds. Ponds were fertilized daily with chicken manure. In addition, fry in one column in each pond were fed twice daily on 40% protein pelleted feed. Results from the pilot study indicated significant effects of stocking density and treatment. In the main experiment, the dietary treatment effect was not significant but there were large differences in growth between ponds. Mean body weight at 42 days was 1.7 g in pond A and 0.4 g in pond B. Fry heritability (h2) of 42-day fry body weight estimated from the whole data set using a univariate model was 0.01 ± 0.06. The bivariate heritability estimates were 0.59 ± 0.19 in pond A and 0.05 ± 0.11 in pond B. The common environmental/hapa (c2) effects were 0.14 ± 0.06 and 0.29 ± 0.07 in respective ponds. We found significant positive spatial autocorrelation (P = 0.02) indicating resemblance in growth of fry in neighboring hapas. Analysis of environmental variables showed that the two ponds differed significantly in dissolved oxygen. The low genetic correlation (rg = − 0.27 ± 0.69) between body weights of fry in both ponds therefore might suggest genotype by environment interactions for tolerance to low dissolved oxygen in Nile tilapia juveniles.

The imposed irrigation regime and the leaching of light sierosem soils led to the dissolution and subsequent leaching of inherent gypsum and organic matter from the soil profile. Further, the domination of bicarbonate in the irrigation water promoted weathering of the carbonate minerals present as calcite. The higher concentrations of Mg2+ in comparison to Ca2+ in the irrigation water resulted in the replacement of Na+ by Mg2+ on the cation exchange complex. In the lower part of the command area, shallow groundwater has contributed to the accumulation of Na+ and to a large extent of Mg2+ on the cation exchange sites. "

For the analysis, 6429 fully pedigreed experimental fish from G0, \{G1\} and \{G2\} were used. Generations were discrete and therefore parameters were estimated separately for each year. Heritability estimates for body measurements ranged from 0.4–0.6 for standard length to 0.69–0.79 for head length. Phenotypic correlations between body weight and body measurements ranged from 0.64 to 0.89. Genetic correlations were close to unity. The heritability estimate for maturity at harvest (corrected for sex) was 0.13. Heritabilities for carcass traits were estimated from \{G1\} only and were 0.16 for gutted weight and 0.06 for dressing percentage. Phenotypic correlation between body weight and gutted weight was 0.84 and the genetic correlation was 0.20. Heritability estimate for gut length was 0.22. We also estimated a high genetic correlation between gut length index and standard length (0.78) but a low genetic correlation between gut length index and body weight (0.22 ± 0.28). These results suggest that selection for growth on an herbivorous diet could result in a correlated response in gut length. "

Yet efforts to adapt to climate change, as reported in the literature over the last decade and in selected case studies, have not led to substantial rates of implementation of adaptation actions despite substantial investments in adaptation science. Moreover, implemented actions have been mostly incremental and focused on proximate causes; there are far fewer reports of more systemic or transformative actions. We found that the nature and effectiveness of responses was strongly influenced by framing. Recent decision-oriented approaches that aim to overcome this situation are framed within a “pathways” metaphor to emphasise the need for robust decision making within adaptive processes in the face of uncertainty and inter-temporal complexity. However, to date, such “adaptation pathways” approaches have mostly focused on contexts with clearly identified decision-makers and unambiguous goals; as a result, they generally assume prevailing governance regimes are conducive for adaptation and hence constrain responses to proximate causes of vulnerability. In this paper, we explore a broader conceptualisation of “adaptation pathways” that draws on ‘pathways thinking’ in the sustainable development domain to consider the implications of path dependency, interactions between adaptation plans, vested interests and global change, and situations where values, interests, or institutions constrain societal responses to change. This re-conceptualisation of adaptation pathways aims to inform decision makers about integrating incremental actions on proximate causes with the transformative aspects of societal change. Case studies illustrate what this might entail. The paper ends with a call for further exploration of theory, methods and procedures to operationalise this broader conceptualisation of adaptation. "

This study uses the framework of multifunction agriculture to assess the performance of integrated farming systems in Thailand and compares its performance with that of ‘normal-rice’ or non-integrated farming systems. Surveys were conducted in Khon Kaen province of Northeast Thailand using a combination of quantitative and qualitative survey methods. Integrated farming systems were found to outperform the normal or commercial farming systems in all four dimensions of a multifunctional agriculture: food security, environmental functions, economic functions, and social functions. The findings support the notion that diversification and integration of resources on farms is feasible in both economic and ecological terms. The analyses shows that integrated farming does not, however, diminish the need for external inputs. High start-up cost might constrain farmers from switching to integrated farming and from exploiting the benefits of resource integration. "

One of our hypotheses is that resilience does not simply reflect the expected effects of quantifiable factors such as level of assets, or even less quantifiable social processes such as people⬢s experience, but is also determined by more subjective dimensions related to people⬢s perceptions of their ability to cope, adapt or transform in the face of adverse events. Data collected over two years in Fiji, Ghana, Sri Lanka and Vietnam confirms the importance of wealth in the recovery process of households affected by shocks and stressors. However our results challenge the idea that within communities, assets are a systematic differentiator in people⬢s response to adverse events. The findings regarding social capital are mixed and call for more research: social capital had a strong positive influence on resilience at the community level, yet our analysis failed to demonstrate any tangible positive correlation at the household level. Finally, the data confirm that, like vulnerability, resilience is at least in part socially constructed, endogenous to individual and groups, and hence contingent on knowledge, attitudes to risk, culture and subjectivity.

We argue that from the perspective of small-scale producers who are focused on maintaining diversified livelihoods across a range of fisheries, the distinctions between domestic and international fish trade blur locally, and are sometimes of limited relevance when assessing livelihood options and outcomes. Instead, a more important distinction for households is social differentiation based on ownership of fishing assets. We suggest that household asset characteristics strongly influence how households can access a broad range of fisheries (both domestically and internationally traded) that often co-emerge in rural areas of the Philippines. We argue that a better understanding of household diversification and differentiation provides a view of fisheries trade that is more closely aligned with the perspectives and priorities of local fishers, than a focus on whether such trade is (or should be) domestically or internationally oriented.

Yet, few studies have utilized social network analysis in systematic conservation planning initiatives; this, in spite of social network analysis being developed as a structural and relational approach to describe and analyze the characteristics of patterns of relationships that make collaborative efforts more or less effective at solving natural resource management problems. Systematic conservation planning provides a framework for allocating actions in time and space to promote the conservation of biodiversity. Our study discusses three potential contributions of social network analysis to systematic conservation planning: identifying stakeholders and their roles in social networks, and characterizing relationships between them; designing and facilitating strategic networking to strengthen linkages between local and regional conservation initiatives; and prioritizing conservation actions using measures of social connectivity alongside ecological data. We propose that social network analysis has the potential to be a valuable tool to support decision making in conservation planning. We identify challenges and future research questions to be addressed to allow the integration of social network analysis into conservation planning processes. "

This document lists some of the main capabilities that have been recently developed, especially in the area of operational agroclimatology, for an efficient use of natural resources and a better management of climatic risks. Many countries, including the developing world, now benefit from well-trained staff in the use of climate data, physical and biological information and knowledge to reduce negative climate impacts. A significant volume of data and knowledge about climate–agriculture relationships is now available and used by students, scientists, technicians, agronomists, decision-makers and farmers alike, particularly in the areas of climate characterization, land suitability and agroecological zoning, seasonal climate forecasts, drought early warning systems and operational crop forecasting systems. Climate variability has been extensively modelled, capturing important features of the climate through applied statistical procedures, agroclimatic indices derived from raw climatic data and from remote sensing. Predictions of climate at seasonal to interannual timescales are helping decision-makers in the agricultural sector to deal more effectively with the effects of climate variability. Land suitability and agroclimatic zoning have been used in many countries for agricultural planning, thanks to the availability of new and comprehensive methodologies; developments in climate, soil and remote sensing data collection and analysis; and improved applications in geographic information systems (GIS). Drought early warning systems are available worldwide at both national and international levels. These systems are helping decision-makers and farmers to take appropriate decisions to adapt to short-term climatic risks. Also, operational crop forecasting systems are now becoming available at the regional and national levels. In some developed countries, several efficient and well tested tools are now available for optimizing on-farm decisions based on the combination of crop simulation models and seasonal forecasts. However, in developing countries few tools have been developed to efficiently manage crops at the farm level to cope with climate variability and climate risks. Climate change impacts on agriculture and food security have been assessed in international studies using specific and efficient methodologies and tools. Adaptation to climate change and variability can also be facilitated through effective planning and implementation of strategies at the political level. The role of technological progress, risk transfer mechanisms and financial instruments and their easy accessibility to rural people are critical elements of climate risk management. "

The area closed was named the ‘Plaice Box’ (PB) and beam trawl effort fell by over 90%,while the exemption fleets of small flatfish beam trawlers, gill netters targeting sole (Solea solea) and shrimp (Crangon crangon) trawlers increased their effort. Contrary to the expectation, plaice landings and biomass declined. The initial support for the \{PB\} from the fisheries was lost, whereas other stakeholder groups claimed that any failure was due to the fact that fishing had never been completely prohibited in the area. To evaluate whether the \{PB\} has been an effective management measure, the changes in the ecosystem (plaice, demersal fish, benthos) and fisheries are analyzed to test whether the observed changes are due to the \{PB\} or to changes in the environment unrelated to the PB. Juvenile growth rate of plaice decreased and juveniles moved to deeper waters outside the PB. Demersal fish biomass decreased, whereas the abundance of epibenthic predators (Asterias rubens and Cancer pagurus) increased in the PB. Endobenthos, in particular the main food items of plaice (polychaetes and small bivalves) remained stable or decreased both inside and outside the PB. Currently catches of both plaice and sole from within the \{PB\} are lower than in the late 1980s and the exemption fleet often prefers to fish outside the Plaice Box alongside much larger competitors. It is concluded that the observed changes are most likely related to changes in the North Sea ecosystem, which may be related to changes in eutrophication and temperature. It is less likely that they are related to the change in fishing. This case study highlights the importance of setting testable objectives and an appropriate evaluation framework including both ecological and socio-economic indicators when implementing closed areas.

We conclude that meeting current and larger consumption rates is feasible, despite a growing population and the impacts of climate change on potential fisheries production, but only if fish resources are managed sustainably and the animal feeds industry reduces its reliance on wild fish. Ineffective fisheries management and rising fishmeal prices driven by greater demand could, however, compromise future aquaculture production and the availability of fish products. "

AquaMaps is compared with traditional presence-only species distribution modelling methods to determine the quality of outputs under equivalently automated conditions. The effect of the inclusion of expert knowledge to AquaMaps is also investigated. Model outputs were tested internally, through data partitioning, and externally against independent survey data to determine the ability of models to predict presence versus absence. Models were also tested externally by assessing correlation with independent survey estimates of relative species abundance. AquaMaps outputs compare well to the existing methods tested, and inclusion of expert knowledge results in a general improvement in model outputs. The transparency, speed and adaptability of the AquaMaps system, as well as the existing online framework which allows expert review to compensate for sampling biases and thus improve model predictions are proposed as additional benefits for public and research use alike.

Understanding the effect of governance network structures on fishery sustainability can help guide governance to achieve desired outcomes. Data on resource users, fishing methods, governance networks and classifications of stock health were compiled for 17 sea cucumber fisheries in the Indian Ocean. The subjective influence of the actors and the complexity of governance networks on the health of wild stocks were analyzed. The fisheries differed widely in their resource users, fishing methods and governance networks. Little correspondence was found between the number of nodes in the governance networks and the health (exploitation status) of wild stocks. Government entities dominated the networks but neither their relative influence in the networks nor their proportionate contribution to the number of entities in the networks greatly affected stock health. These findings do not refute the benefits of inclusive governance, but rather suggest that multiple other factors (e.g. inadequate regulations, weak enforcement, high number of fishers) are also likely to play a role in influencing sea cucumber fishery sustainability. These factors must be tackled in tandem with good governance. "

Coral reef fisheries are expected to decline with climate and anthropogenic disturbances, which may have significant consequences for food security. The vulnerability measure was composed of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity indicators specific to fisheries, reef management, and food security. The vulnerability index was used to evaluate 27 countries, as data required to fully populate the theoretical framework was limited. Of these, Indonesia and Liberia were identified as most and Malaysia and Sri Lanka as least vulnerable nations. Our analysis revealed two common national vulnerability characterizations: low income countries with low adaptive capacity and middle-income countries with higher adaptive capacity but high sensitivity. These results suggest developing context-specific policies and actions to build adaptive capacity in the low-income countries, and to decrease sensitivity in middle-income countries. Comparing our food security evaluation to a more general vulnerability approach shows that they produce different priority countries and associated policies. "

Lateral line shape was standardized coupling geometric morphometrics with advanced warping procedures based on thin-plate splines. Genetic variation between and within populations was found for lateral line shape, which was also affected by vertebral anomalies to a certain extent. Conversely, no significant genetic variation was found for scale disorientation, either between or within populations. We conclude that the shape of lateral line is probably not a decisive factor to externally evaluate spine anomalies; further, its variation is more likely linked to a general variation of fish shape than to impaired early development, while the cause of scale disorientations is more environmental than genetic.

Until recently, fisheries managers and researchers have struggled to develop effective methods and data for social and economic analysis that can integrate with the predominantly biological approaches to fisheries management. The field is now growing fast, however, and globally, researchers are developing and testing new methods. This paper uses three divergent case studies to demonstrate the value of using qualitative social science approaches to complement more conventional quantitative methods to improve the knowledge base for fisheries management. In all three cases, qualitative interview and document review methods enabled broad surveying to explore the research questions in particular contexts and identified where quantitative tools could be most usefully applied. In the first case (the contribution of commercial fisheries to coastal communities in eastern Australia), a wellbeing analysis identified the social benefits from particular fisheries, which can be used to identify the social impacts of different fisheries management policies. In the second case (a gender analysis of fisheries of small islands in the Pacific), analysis outlined opportunities and constraints along fisheries supply chains, illuminated factors inhibiting community development and identified ecological factors that are typically overlooked in conventional fisheries management. In the third case (sea cucumber fisheries in Papua New Guinea), an interactive governance analysis assessed how well fisheries management tools fit the ecological, social and economic reality of the fishery and the trade in its products, including market influences and stakeholder values. The qualitative approach adopted in these three case studies adds a new dimension to understanding fisheries that is not possible with a focus solely on quantitative data. With the development of new policies on release programs (stock enhancement, restocking) and artificial reefs, and the momentum to use these interventions from recreational fishing groups, the qualitative approach will provide an important contribution to understanding their wider costs and benefits.

Many scientific projects and initiatives publish information on species and biodiversity on the World Wide Web without users needing to pay for it. However, these resources often stagnate when project funding expired. Based on a large pool of experiences worldwide, this article discusses what measures will help such data resources develop beyond the project lifetime. Biodiversity data, just as data in many other disciplines, are often not generated automatically by machines or sensors. Data on for example species are based on human observations and interpretation. This requires continuous data curation to keep these up to date. Creators of online biodiversity databases should consider whether they have the resources to make their database of such value that other scientists and/or institutions would continue to finance its existence. To that end, it may be prudent to engage such partners in the development of the resource from an early stage. Managers of existing biodiversity databases should reflect on the factors being important for sustainability. These include the extent, scope, quality and uniqueness of database content; track record of development; support from scientists; support from institutions, and clarity of Intellectual Property Rights. Science funders should give special attention to the development of scholarly databases with expert-validated content. The science community has to appreciate the efforts of scientists in contributing to open-access databases, including by citing these resources in the Reference lists of publications that use them. Science culture must thus adapt its practices to support online databases as scholarly publications. To sustain such databases, we recommend they should (a) become integrated into larger collaborative databases or information systems with a consequently larger user community and pool of funding opportunities, and (b) be owned and curated by a science organisation, society, or institution with a suitable mandate. Good governance and proactive communication with contributors is important to maintain the team enthusiasm that launched the resource. Experience shows that ‘bigger is better’ in terms of database size because the resource will have more content, more potential and known uses and users of its content, more contributors, be more prestigious to contribute to, and have more funding options. Furthermore, most successful biodiversity databases are managed by a partnership of individuals and organisations. "

FiRST is a data management system for scientific trawl survey data and includes data summary and visualization tools, an analytical routine to estimate biomass, and data import/export modules. The FiRST software has also facilitated the establishment of a regional database, ‘TrawlBase’, which contains more than 20,000 hauls or stations from scientific trawl surveys in 10 countries conducted between 1926 and 1995. The regional database is an important regional resource for coastal fisheries management complementing national fisheries catch statistics. This article describes the refined version of FiRST (version 2004) and provides examples on how the database (‘TrawlBase’) has been used to date for analyses aimed at establishing historic resource baselines and examining the status of coastal fishery resources.

Mirroring the call for a diversification of agricultural research and investment beyond a few staple grains, it is anticipated that productivity gains for a few farmed aquatic species will not suffice. Capture fisheries and aquaculture have a complementary role to play in increasing fish availability and access, and must be promoted in ways that support measurable nutrition and health gains. This paper argues that the lack of a nutrition-sensitive policy focus on capture fisheries and aquaculture represents an untapped opportunity that must be realised for ensuring sustainable healthy diets for all.

abstract = "Abstract The large tuna resources of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean are delivering great economic benefits to Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) through sale of licences to distant water fishing nations and employment in fish processing. However, tuna needs to contribute to Pacific Island societies in another important way—by increasing local access to the fish required for good nutrition to help combat the world’s highest levels of diabetes and obesity. Analyses reported here demonstrate that coastal fisheries in 16 of the 22 \{PICTs\} will not provide the fish recommended for good nutrition of growing Pacific Island populations, and that by 2020 tuna will need to supply 12% of the fish required by \{PICTs\} for food security, increasing to 25% by 2035. In relative terms, the percentages of the region’s tuna catch that will be needed in 2020 and 2035 to fill the gap in domestic fish supply are small, i.e., 2.1% and 5.9% of the average present-day industrial catch, respectively. Interventions based on expanding the use of nearshore fish aggregating devices (FADs) to assist small-scale fishers catch tuna, distributing small tuna and bycatch offloaded by industrial fleets at regional ports, and improving access to canned tuna for inland populations, promise to increase access to fish for sustaining the health of the region’s growing populations. The actions, research and policies required to implement these interventions effectively, and the investments needed to maintain the stocks underpinning the considerable socio-economic benefits that flow from tuna, are described.

abstract = "SummaryBackground The question of how many marine species exist is important because it provides a metric for how much we do and do not know about life in the oceans. We have compiled the first register of the marine species of the world and used this baseline to estimate how many more species, partitioned among all major eukaryotic groups, may be discovered. Results There are ∼226,000 eukaryotic marine species described. More species were described in the past decade (∼20,000) than in any previous one. The number of authors describing new species has been increasing at a faster rate than the number of new species described in the past six decades. We report that there are ∼170,000 synonyms, that 58,000–72,000 species are collected but not yet described, and that 482,000–741,000 more species have yet to be sampled. Molecular methods may add tens of thousands of cryptic species. Thus, there may be 0.7–1.0 million marine species. Past rates of description of new species indicate there may be 0.5 ± 0.2 million marine species. On average 37% (median 31%) of species in over 100 recent field studies around the world might be new to science. Conclusions Currently, between one-third and two-thirds of marine species may be undescribed, and previous estimates of there being well over one million marine species appear highly unlikely. More species than ever before are being described annually by an increasing number of authors. If the current trend continues, most species will be discovered this century. "
