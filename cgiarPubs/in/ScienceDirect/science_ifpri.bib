abstract = "Summary Recent droughts in the Horn of Africa have again raised concerns over the viability of pastoralism. Vulnerability to drought, arguably increasing on the back of climate change and population pressures, provides a compelling justification for encouraging economic diversification. It is less clear, however, which specific social or economic sectors can provide pro-poor economic transformation. In this paper we assess the potential for diversification into both sedentary agricultural and non-farm activities in Ethiopia. We conclude that while irrigation and large farm investments do have sizeable potential to create jobs, education should be the central pillar of diversification strategies in pastoralist areas. "

The paper describes different classes of empirical models – from small, stylized to large, multisectoral applied models; from static equilibrium models to dynamic, perfect-foresight models – and identifies the characteristics of models best suited to address different policy problems in developing countries. The paper then discusses the different ways \{CGE\} models have been and are being used in policy formulation, the types of questions they have addressed, and the lessons learned from past experience. Finally, the paper suggests that, in light of the changing nature of policy making in developing countries, in the future \{CGE\} models should be used differently, moving from a purely technocratic exercise used by policy makers to providing an accessible empirical framework that can contribute to a widespread public debate.

The farm-level analysis of the market effects of the two widely used food genetically modified organisms (GMOs)s, Bt corn and \{GR\} soybeans, suggests that for some farmers, but not all, adoption is profitable. For corn growers, adoption is profitable if expected infestation levels and the output price are together high enough so that the increase in yields offsets the additional price of the \{GMO\} seed. All soybean growers have benefited from increased competition that has driven down the price of competing herbicides. Technology-producing firms, especially Monsanto, have benefited from licensing and technology fees. Monsanto has seen large short-run profits from increased sale of glyphosate. The results indicate that the \{US\} will continue to be the leading exporter of corn and soybean till the year 2010, capturing a significant share of increased imports to rapidly growing developing countries such as China. The continued adoption of Bt corn and \{GR\} soybeans would further enhance \{US\} production and exports. Under the estimated farm-level impacts presented in this study, the impacts of Bt corn and \{GR\} soybeans on global food markets are nevertheless relatively moderate. For consumers of goods made from these two GMOs, there is very little benefit from their adoption, mainly because the \{GMOs\} confer no enhanced consumer characteristics. Even with full adoption, consumers would see little change in prices and the current generation of \{GR\} soybean and Bt corn technology will continue primarily to benefit farmers. "

Results indicate that the extension service provided by the company is necessitated by two key factors: slow withdrawal of the public extension system from the farmers under contract with the company and the need to maintain the quantity of supply to the processing industry. Further, other environmental factors such as moving away from sugarcane by the farmers to cashews and low availability of groundwater have created challenges for cane growers. To entice farmers to stay in sugarcane farming, the company focused on removing these constraints and making sugarcane production hassle free for the farmers. This resulted in a win–win situation for both the farmers and the sugarcane crushing company. "

Five states of India modified \{TPDS\} by reducing targeting, lowering grain prices to Rs.1–3 per kg and tightening its administration. This paper assesses the impact of changes in the \{TPDS\} on household food consumption using data from a repeated cross-section of Indian households from five rounds of representative consumption surveys between 1993–1994 and 2009–2010. We use the Difference-in-Difference (DID) method to identify the policy impact, first on consumption of food-grains, and second, on food expenditure. We find that modifications in \{TPDS\} led not only to an increase in the purchase of subsidized grains from fair-price shops, but also to diversification of the food basket of poor households. We also find evidence for reduction in the diversion of grains from \{TPDS\} to the open market in reform states. Finally, we present suggestive evidence that a food policy reform is likely to fail if price and targeting policy components are not accompanied by effective administrative measures to reduce corruption and improve the logistics of subsidized food distribution. These are important findings for India’s own National Food Security Act (NFSA) and for other food safety-net programs throughout the developing world. "

Accompanying this rapid growth in national accounts have been rapid and widespread reductions in poverty. With these reductions in poverty, however, there has often been observed an increase in income inequality, both between as well as within rural and urban sectors. This rising income gap challenges the notion that economic reforms in China have been as successful as the poverty statistics would suggest. In this paper, we suggest that an alternative view would be to consider the effects of these reforms on changing the chronic nature of poverty and reducing household vulnerability to poverty. Using a balanced panel from rural China from 1991 through 2006, we find that most poverty among our sample has shifted from being chronic in nature to being transient, with households either shifting into a state of being non-poor moving in and out of poverty. Among our sample, vulnerability to poverty has been declining over time, but the declines are not uniform over time or space. We decompose household vulnerability status into two proximate causes: low expected income and high income variability, finding vulnerability increasingly due to income variability. Additionally, we demonstrate that vulnerable households have very different characteristics than non-vulnerable households. "

Similarly, an increase in the stay abroad of intercontinental migrants impacts positively on welfare of the migrant-sending household. Results of these simulations lend support to the introduction of a TMP, which would, in addition to facilitating migration control in host economies, improve the welfare of sending households by allowing for increased engagement in intercontinental migration. The temporary nature of such a program would ensure that “Dutch disease” effects would be mitigated through eventual migrant return. "

The results show that assets both affect and are affected by projects, indicating that it is both feasible and important to consider assets in the design, implementation, and evaluation of projects. All projects were associated with increases in asset levels and other benefits at the household level; however, only four projects documented significant, positive impacts on women’s ownership or control of some types of assets relative to a control group, and of those only one project provided evidence of a reduction in the gender asset gap.

Issues related to the roles of the various partners in livestock research are also considered and modalities to ensure more effective linkage between research and development agencies to improve technology transfer and impact are discussed. The chapter starts discussing the factors affecting livestock development and how these factors interact at different stages in the process of commercialization and development of the livestock sector. This serves as the conceptual framework to analyze trends in livestock demand; structural characteristics of livestock production in developing countries; global trends in productivity, and the evolution of research and development in developing regions. Past trends show that changes in global livestock production are explained by demand and supply changes associated to economic growth mainly in East and Southeast Asia while on the other hand productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa has remained stagnated for most of the past 40 years. National research systems in developing countries have focused mostly on research in ruminants, while research in poultry production has been dominated by the private sector. Despite these research priorities in developing countries, productivity differences in poultry and pig production between high income and some of the fast growing developing countries have been reducing in the past years, while large differences in productivity still persist in the case of milk and beef production with no evidence of developing countries catching-up with most productive countries. Major improvements in livestock productivity are possible and could contribute to economic growth in developing countries, but increased investment in livestock research and a framework for international action to support livestock research and development in developing countries are needed.

It begins with a discussion of a new conceptual framework for monitoring based on resource management domains (RMDs), which defines monitoring units based on resource problems and potential policy interventions. This is followed by a description of steps necessary for effectively implementing a monitoring system and possible flows and use of information in decision-making. Finally, the paper identifies issues relevant to the design of natural resource monitoring systems, and future challenges facing governments, academic institutions, and donor agencies.

abstract = "Summary The limitations of neo-classical growth models have led to a resurgence of interest in dual economy models and structural change. Structural change entails the movement of labor from low productivity sectors like agriculture into more modern sectors of the economy. Because the share of the labor force in agriculture is so high in most of Sub-Saharan Africa, the potential for structural change to lead to growth and poverty alleviation in Africa appears to be enormous. Yet, very little of this new literature on structural change focuses on Africa. This special issue begins to fill that gap. The first half of this special issue contains five original contributions that provide new insights with respect to the nature of Africa’s growth over the past two decades. The second half contains six original contributions that examine opportunities for structural transformation in Africa. "

Declining adult illiteracy is a critical factor in reducing child mortality and increasing life expectancy.

Despite the best efforts of donors and the government, the public distribution of rice and wheat was only 188,000 t more than originally planned for July 1998 to April 1999. However, a major food crisis was averted as private imports, made possible by trade liberalisation in the early 1990s, stabilised market prices and supplies. The government’s direct distribution programs, though small compared to private imports, nonetheless increased access to food by poor households. Household survey data indicate that immediate relief efforts were well targeted to flood-affected households, as were transfers from NGOs. Vulnerable Group Feeding (VGF), a medium-term program, was not targeted well to households directly exposed to the flood, though the program was relatively well targeted to poor households. More broadly, the Bangladesh experience with the 1998 flood shows that in a liberalised trade regime, where private imports respond to price signals, food aid’s contribution to the total availability of food may be minimal. However, foreign assistance in kind or in cash, can provide resources for subsidised, targeted distribution to food-insecure households — assistance not possible otherwise under tight government budget constraints.

Another trend has been the collapse of African agroindustrial exports and the increase of exports from Asia. The paper highlights key trends, and explores possible reasons for the trends, focusing on trade policies in less-developed countries (LDCs) and developed countries (DCs). The paper argues that national trade policies and other economic policies appear to have been relatively supportive of agroindustrial production and exports in Asia. In contrast, policies have had more mixed effects in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), and seem to have been just one component in a larger array of forces inhibiting economic development in Africa. The performance of agroindustrial production and exports from \{LDCs\} may be now more dependent than ever on the completion of reforms in the agricultural trade policies of DCs. For Africa, however, a more supportive international environment and better macroeconomic and trade policies will not be enough to ensure a thriving agroindustrial sector within a broader process of economic development until military confrontations stop.

The odds of being overweight/obese are 80.8% higher for micronutrient deficient mothers than for non-deficient mothers, keeping all other variables constant. These results have at least two interesting policy implications. First, as the potential impact of the interaction between micronutrient deficiency and chronic diseases is not well known, the coexistence of micronutrient deficient and overweight/obese women can raise new and serious public health problems in the country. Second, the Egyptian food subsidy program, which lowers the relative prices of energy-dense, nutrient-poor food items, can be one of the major factors for the emergence of overweight/obese and micronutrient deficient mothers in the country. Changing the orientation of the food subsidy program may help to simultaneously address this double burden of mothers’ malnutrition. "

Migrant remittances are smaller than household incomes earned from self-employment and local non-farm employment. The results of a multinomial probit analysis explaining off-farm participation decisions show that presence of young children in a household restrains participation in migration, while the presence of elderly persons and a higher level of education stimulate migration. Local wage employment and self-employment are not affected by these factors. The gender bias in access to off-farm employment is largest for agricultural employment and local non-agricultural employment. Land scarcity stimulates participation in migration and local non-agricultural employment, while possibilities to rent land out to other farmers stimulate only migration. The paper ends with policy suggestions for promoting off-farm employment within the own region and for altering the criteria for land distribution to rural households. "

To support the illustration of relevant energy–agriculture linkages, the chapter uses empirical results from a global multimarket model to show the magnitude and implications of energy price effects on agricultural production. The most important recommended interventions are improving use and conversion efficiencies, removing distortions to resource prices, and allowing for free movement of goods through liberalized trade. While these goals are often difficult to achieve on their own, the chapter argues that the combined effects can have significant benefits for the environment and welfare. "

Despite their shortcomings, household consumption and expenditures surveys (HCESs) are increasingly being used to address the food and nutrition information gap because they contain a great deal of information about food acquisition and consumption; are done once every 3–5 years in more than 125 countries; have large samples (∼8500 households); are statistically representative at subnational levels; and are much less costly than other dietary assessment data sources. To date, the nutrition community's role has been that of a passive user of \{HCES\} that have already been conducted. Many \{HCES\} shortcomings, however, stem from design and implementation issues. If the nutrition community, with its unique skills and experiences were to get more proactively involved in the design, implementation and analyses of HCES, they could be strengthened substantially as a tool for evidence-based food and nutrition policy. This article describes the evolution in the use of \{HCES\} in addressing food and nutrition issues, identifies \{HCES\} shortcomings and distills a shared agenda and a strategy for the nutrition community to work on, together with already existing \{HCES\} stakeholders, to strengthen HCES. A two-tiered approach and process for implementing this work is described. The first tier of the approach consists of addressing a common set of activities at the global level, while the second tier is more country-level work that builds on a combination of the global-level work—including the adoption and implementation of some of outcome of the first tier activities—but may also include more idiosyncratic, country-specific work. The common global-level activities consist of addressing common, cross country, technical issues of questionnaire and survey design, implementation and data processing activities at the global level. A 115-country assessment of these aspects of \{HCES\} is already being conducted jointly by the World Bank–FAO–International Household Survey Network. This work aims to distill better practices and lessons, recommend alternative ways to address common \{HCES\} shortcomings, and establish a global research agenda for improving understanding and identifying tradeoffs involving critical issues. The second tier of the approach consists of recognizes that \{HCES\} design and methodology has to be adapted to each country's policy needs and strategies, while reflecting each country's technical and financial constraints and building on its own experiences. Second tier activities are country level activities, and they are where the real work of strengthening \{HCES\} has to be done. That work should consist of the merging of the two tiers of the approach to create a partnership for implementing rigorous, experimental studies of the major, unsettled measurement issues confronting HCES, while providing a more sound foundation of evidence for nutrition policy.

In addition, even the spatial scale of many sub-national statistical reporting units remains too coarse to capture patterns of spatial heterogeneity in crop production and performance that are likely important from a policy and investment planning perspective. To fill these spatial data gaps we have developed and applied a meso-scale model for the spatial disaggregation of crop production. Using a cross-entropy approach, our model makes plausible pixel-scale assessments of the spatial distribution of crop production within geopolitical units (e.g. countries or sub-national provinces and districts). The pixel-scale allocations are performed through the compilation and judicious fusion of relevant spatially-explicit data, including: production statistics, land use data, satellite imagery, biophysical crop “suitability” assessments, population density, and distance to urban centers, as wells as any prior knowledge about the spatial distribution of individual crops. The development, application and validation of a prior version of the model in Brazil strongly suggested that our spatial allocation approach shows considerable promise. This paper describes efforts to generate crop distribution maps for Sub-Saharan Africa for the year 2000 using this approach. Apart from the empirical challenge of applying the approach across many countries, the application includes three significant model improvements: (1) the ability to cope with production data sources that provided different degrees of spatial disaggregation for different crops within a single country; (2) the inclusion of a digital map of irrigation intensity as a new input layer; and (3) increased disaggregation of rainfed production systems. Applying the modified spatial allocation model we generated 5 min (approximately 10 km) resolution grid maps for the following 20 major crops across Sub-Saharan Africa: barley, dry beans, cassava, cocoa, coffee, cotton, cow peas, groundnuts, maize, millet, oil palm, plantain, potato, rice, sorghum, soybeans, sugar cane, sweet potato, wheat, and yam. The approach provides plausible results but also highlights the need for much more reliable input data for the region, especially with regard to sub-national production statistics and satellite-based estimates of cropland extent and intensity.

This paper focuses on the linkages between access to credit, savings and insurance services and household food security. What is the role of micro-finance in the overall mix of policy instruments? What types of financial services are demanded by the poor, and which are offered by micro-finance institutions (MFIs)? Hence, which are the gaps in financial products? We present a conceptual framework that addresses these questions, and provide a synthesis of the empirical results of a multi-country research program in ten African and Asian countries. We conclude that insurance can be considered as the missing third of micro-finance during the 1990s, and that the MFI's outreach to the poor can be improved by offering savings, credit and insurance products that enhance the poor's ability to bear risks. Applied research on the poor's preferences as well as bold experimentation with new financial products appear to be particularly promising in making progress towards that goal. Since insurance services are difficult to be offered except for easily observable idiosyncratic risks, precautionary savings services can be a valuable insurance substitute in particular for the poorest.

Demand for cereals, particularly for staple cereals and meats, has fallen significantly even as production and productivity have plummeted. Although agricultural reforms were launched in 1991, the performance of the agricultural sector has been weak across the region. Prospects for food security in Central Asia appear mixed. Projections indicate that a growing and urbanizing population in Central Asia with rising incomes will increase demand for cereals by 32% between 1995 and 2020 to reach 24 million tons, and for meat by 47% to reach 2.9 million tons. Improvements in crop productivity will be essential to meet the increases in demand projected for the region. Cereal production is forecast to keep pace with demand such that Central Asia will be virtually self-sufficient in cereals. However, national food self-sufficiency or food security does not necessarily translate into household or individual food security. Moreover, self-sufficiency comes with a high price-tag of opportunities foregone and inappropriate use made of resources. Given the growing enthusiasm for food self-sufficiency in Central Asia, it is imperative that research be undertaken to assess the full costs and benefits of such a policy. "

Although there is an extensive and growing body of literature on the economic impact of the adoption of \{GM\} crops in both developing and developed economies, there is only scant evidence that the technology has had any specific and distinguishable impact among female and male farmers. In economies where female farmers and female household members have a significant and often differentiated role in agriculture production, it is crucial to be able to answer this question. This paper presents quantitative and qualitative results from a study of the gender-specific adoption and performance effects of insect resistant (Bt) and herbicide-tolerant (HT) maize produced by smallholder farmers in the Kwa Zulu Natal province in South Africa. The findings indicate that women farmers value the labor-saving benefit of \{HT\} maize alongside the stacked varieties which offer both insect control and labor saving. Higher yields are the main reason behind male adoption, while female farmers tend to favor other aspects like taste, quality, and the ease of farming herbicide-tolerant (HT) crops. Women farmers (and also children) saved significant time because less weeding is required, an activity that has traditionally been the responsibility of female farmers. The newer stacked varieties were preferred by both male and female farmers and seemed to be in high demand by both groups. However, lack of \{GM\} seed availability in the region and poor market access were possible limitations to the adoption and spread of the technology. "

abstract = "Publisher Summary Modern agricultural biotechnology, including genetic engineering can contribute to food security in developing countries and form a part of a comprehensive sustainable poverty alleviation strategy focused on broad based agricultural growth. Modern biotechnology, if used in conjunction with traditional knowledge and conventional agricultural research, may offer a powerful poverty reduction tool. It may contribute to increased productivity, lower unit costs and prices for food, preservation of biodiversity, and improved nutrition. Biotechnology research aimed at reducing input requirements and increasing input use efficiency could lead to crops that utilize water more efficiently, fix nitrogen from air, extract phosphate from soil more effectively, and resist pests without synthetic pesticides. Reduced dependence on purchased inputs such as pesticides would make technology more accessible to poor farmers, with environmental and health payoffs. Biotechnology may also help achieve productivity gains needed to feed a growing global population and preserve wild or fragile land from cultivation. Biotechnology may heighten crops' tolerance to adverse weather and soil conditions, enhance crops' durability during harvesting or shipping, and aid development of drought-tolerant maize, insect-resistant cassava, micronutrientdense staples, high protein foods, and edible vaccines, to the benefit of small farmers and poor consumers. This requires increased public sector research for assuring that molecular biology based science serves the needs of poor people, as is increased public–private cooperation, and poor people must be included in debate and decision making about technological change. It is also essential to strengthen regulatory capacity within developing countries. "

It concludes with a discussion of the potential for water policy reform and demand management to minimize adverse impacts when water is reallocated from agriculture. It is argued that comprehensive reforms are required to mitigate the potentially adverse impacts of water transfers for local communities and to sustain crop yield and output growth to meet rising food demands at the global level. Key policy reforms include the establishment of secure water rights to users; the decentralization and privatization of water management functions to appropriate levels; the use of incentives including pricing reform, especially in urban contexts, and markets in tradable property rights; and the introduction of appropriate water-saving technologies.

Yet, world poverty is largely concentrated in the agrarian societies, which have the potential for agricultural productivity growth. This is particularly true for Sub-Saharan African countries, where the gaps between potential and actual yields remain high. Minimizing this gap through the promotion of modern inputs—such as fertilizer and modern seeds—has been at the core of almost all development strategies in Ethiopia. Among other initiatives, the country has promoted microfinance institutions and member-owned financial cooperatives to alleviate credit constraints of the smallholder farmers. This paper analyzes the impacts of these institutions. Using household survey data and a propensity-score-matching technique, we examine the effects that institutional financial services have on farmers’ adoption of agricultural technology in Ethiopia. The results suggest that access to institutional finance has a significant positive impact on both the adoption and extent of technology use. However, when impacts are disaggregated by type of financial institution and farm size, heterogeneities are observed. In particular, financial cooperatives have a greater impact on technology adoption than microfinance institutions, and the results appear to vary depending on farm size and types of inputs. The paper concludes with implications for policies to promote adoption of modern agricultural inputs. "

Little is known about the 19 zones approved so far under this program, or the impact they are likely to have on structural transformation and industrial development in their host countries. This paper identifies the 19 zones and their proposed locations, the process of selection, developers, implementation, and the Chinese incentive regime. It then focuses on the African zones.

abstract = "AbstractIntroduction Biofortification is the breeding of new varieties of staple foods for increased micronutrient content. It is seen primarily as a complementary, rural-targeted strategy for better reaching remote populations. This paper presents an ex ante analysis of HarvestPlus’ provitamin A maize (PVAM) in Zambia and highlights an empirical approach based on the Zambian 2005/06 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey (LCMS). Because more than 115 countries regularly conduct a Household Consumption and Expenditure Survey (HCES), the approach developed in this LCMS-based study can be applied in many other countries to analyze varietal adoption and conduct ex ante studies. Methods Data from the \{LCMS\} and health statistics were used to characterize baseline indicators of vitamin A intake and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost. The introduction and scaling up of \{PVAM\} was modeled based on program plans, expert opinion and data on key adoption parameters. An adoption function was specified and expressed in terms of the percent of farmers expected to adopt \{PVAM\} over the next 30 years. A logistic regression adoption function was estimated and used to identify the specific \{LCMS\} households adopting, producing and consuming \{PVAM\} each year. Information from the \{IFPRI\} International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT) of yearly maize production and demand were used to produce annual estimates of \{PVAM\} planted, harvested and consumed. Taking into account an LCMS-empirically-informed, specified market structure, individuals’ additional vitamin A intake was calculated. The number of \{DALYs\} saved were estimated using the change in vitamin A intake. Combining these estimates with cost data, the cost-effectiveness of \{PVAM\} was calculated. Results Assuming an adoption ceiling of 20% over 30 years, implementation of \{PVAM\} will result in average additional intake of 12% of the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR), a 3 percentage point reduction in the prevalence of inadequate intake, and savings of 23% of total DALYs. Impacts are concentrated among farming households that have adopted \{PVAM\} and consume it from their own production. Their consumption will result in an average additional vitamin A intake of 172 μg/day, more than 3 times the additional 54 μg/day among the entire population. Among this group, the reduction in the prevalence of inadequate intake will be more than 5 times the national average (17.5 percentage points). Valuing a \{DALY\} at $1000, PVAM’s cumulative value of \{DALYs\} saved comes to exceed its cumulative total costs starting in 2019. Over 30 years the cost-effectiveness of \{PVAM\} in Zambia was estimated to be $24 per \{DALY\} saved, making it very cost-effective. Conclusion The methodologies employed in this study provide insights and inputs that can be used to target farmers who are most likely to adopt, to measure their vitamin A intake and to craft messages to promote adoption. \{PVAM\} is a long term investment that shows great promise in becoming a highly cost-effective addition to the public health arsenal for combatting micronutrient deficiencies if the 20% adoption rate can be achieved and maintained. Doing so will require effective marketing strategies, including efforts to couple this nutrition-sensitive intervention with nutrition-specific activities, such as targeted nutrition messaging and education, in order to increase the likelihood that adopting farmers will prioritize production for home consumption.

Results suggest that women’s empowerment is more strongly associated with the quality of infant and young child feeding practices and only weakly associated with child nutrition status. Women’s empowerment in credit decisions is positively and significantly correlated with women’s dietary diversity, but not body mass index. This suggests that improved nutritional status is not necessarily correlated with empowerment across all domains, and that these domains may have different impacts on nutrition. "

Growers of \{HVCs\} need to allocate at least 50% area to \{HVCs\} to escape poverty. Effect of diversification on poverty is in general positive but it withers after a threshold probably because of constraints i.e., capital on smaller farms and labor on larger ones. "

Growth attainment of children is measured by the child weight-for-height, and height-for-age Z-scores, often used by nutritionists as indicators of short-run and long-run nutritional status. Reduced-form regressions are estimated, separately for boys and girls in rural and urban areas, including explanatory variables such as the age of the child, the educational level of the mother and household head, per capita household expenditures, and characteristics of the sanitary environment of the household. Accounting for the influence of unobserved heterogeneity at the cluster (village) level, such as differences in prices, and the quantity and quality of medical services available in the household community, reveals that there are substantial differences across gender and rural and urban areas in the patterns of correlation of socioeconomic, demographic or environmental factors with growth attainment of pre-school children. In rural areas, higher household income appears to have a positive effect on the long-run health status of girls as proxied by height-for age Z-scores, but a negative effect on short-run health status as proxied by weight-for-height Z-scores. In contrast, in the urban areas, both income and the level of education of the father do not appear to be significant correlates of growth attainment of either boys or girls. The education level of the mother is not a significant correlate of height-for-age in rural areas, but it is associated with poor growth attainment of boys and higher growth attainment of girls in urban areas.

With data from 40 households representing 40 models, three C sequestration scenarios were simulated: (i) baseline scenario, (ii) agroforestry with a carbon credit incentive, and (iii) agroforestry with a carbon credit and a seed selling option. Results show that the baseline scenario would sequester on average 3.94 Mg C ha−1. The overall annual mean amount of C sequestered is 103 Mg per year, of which 12% is from soil C. In the second scenario, the annual mean was 239 Mg C translating to 3.92 Mg C ha−1, of which 62% is contribution from agroforestry. In the third scenario, the annual mean C was 393 Mg, translating to 4.17 Mg C ha−1, of which agroforestry's contribution was 39%.

abstract = "Soil nutrient depletion in Uganda is one of the leading environmental degradation problems threatening the livelihoods of most farmers in the region. In order to identify policy options that may be used to address the problem, this study was conducted with an objective of analyzing the determinants of flow and balances of nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) in Uganda. Data for this study were collected from 58 randomly selected farmers who participated in on-farm fertilizer trials and household surveys conducted in 2000 to 2001. Econometric models were used to analyze the determinants of soil nutrient flows and balances. Only 5% of the sample households had positive total \{NPK\} balances implying 95% of the farmers likely used unsustainable land management practices in the 2000/2001 season. If inorganic fertilizer were used to restore the mined nutrients, it would cost an equivalent of a fifth of the farm income. The results confirm the heavy reliance of smallholder farmers to soil fertility mining for their livelihoods. Agricultural potential, size of livestock herd, crop diversity, education, and having non-farm activities improve soil nutrient balances. This implies farmers need to be encouraged to grow crops and keep livestock in order to utilize the crop-livestock synergies. Education and non-farm activities in rural areas also need to be promoted as they contribute to more sustainable land management practices. Contact with extension agents initially accelerates soil nutrient depletion probably due to tendency of farmers to first adopt improved crop varieties without using fertilizer. Hence there is need for extension messages to emphasize adoption of both soil fertility and seed technologies. Farmers in high market access appear to deplete their soils more rapidly, pointing to the need to design policy mechanisms that would reduce soil nutrient depletion in high market access areas. "

Many factors have context-specific impacts and involve trade-offs between increasing production and reducing land degradation. Government agricultural extension and training programs contribute to higher value of crop production in the lowlands, but to soil erosion in the highlands. By contrast, non-governmental organization (NGO) programs focusing on agriculture and environment help to reduce erosion, but have less favourable impacts on production in the lowlands. Education increases household incomes, but also reduces crop production in the lowlands. Poverty has mixed impacts on agricultural production, depending on the nature of poverty: smaller farms obtain higher crop production per hectare, while households with fewer livestock have lower crop production. Population pressure contributes to agricultural intensification, but also to erosion in the densely populated highlands. Several household income strategies contribute to increased value of crop production, without significant impacts on soil erosion. We find little evidence of impact of access to markets, roads and credit, land tenure or title on agricultural intensification and crop production and land degradation. In general, the results imply that the strategies to increase agricultural production and reduce land degradation must be location-specific, and that there are few ‘win-win’ opportunities to simultaneously increase production and reduce land degradation.

The \{OCP\} ran from 1975 to 2002, first spraying rivers to stop transmission and then distributing medicine to help those already infected. Controlling for time and village fixed effects, we find that villages in treated areas acquired larger populations and also had more cropland transactions, fewer permits required for cropland transactions, and more regulation of common property pasture and forest. These effects are robust to numerous controls and tests for heterogeneity across the sample, including time-varying region fixed effects. Descriptive statistics suggest that treated villages also acquired closer access to electricity and telephone service, markets, wells and primary schools, with no difference in several other variables. These results are consistent with both changes in productivity and effects of population size on public institutions. "

Under China’s hierarchical governance structure, a city status can only be determined and awarded by the central government. In the 1980s and 1990s, China adopted a formula-based county-to-city upgrading policy. Based on a large panel dataset covering all counties in China, we find that the formula was not strictly enforced in the practice. Moreover, jurisdictions that were upgraded to cities prior to 1998 do not perform better than their counterparts that remained county status in terms of both economic growth and providing public services. Largely because of these problems, this policy was called off in 1997. Given the strong need for urbanization, more indigenous institutional innovations are needed to find a viable way of creating cities, which would also provide compatible incentives to local governments.

Global climate change is mainly transmitted through rising world food prices. Our simulation results suggest that climate change induced price increases for food will raise agricultural \{GDP\} while decreasing real household incomes and food security. Rural non-farm households are hit hardest as they tend to be net food consumers with high food budget shares, but farm households also experience real income losses given that many of them are net buyers of food. The impacts of local climate change are less clear given the ambiguous predictions of global climate models (GCMs) with respect to future rainfall patterns in Yemen. Local climate change impacts manifest itself in long term yield changes, which differ between two alternative climate scenarios considered. Under the \{MIR\} scenario, agricultural \{GDP\} is somewhat higher than with perfect mitigation and rural incomes rise due to higher yields and lower prices for sorghum and millet. Under the \{CSI\} scenario, positive and negative yield changes cancel each other out. As a result, agricultural \{GDP\} and household incomes hardly change compared to perfect mitigation. "

It also assesses the impacts of food price increases on various household groups. Taking the 2007–2008 global food crisis as an example, we show that prices for domestic grain products are highly correlated with world market prices. This is true both for products for which Ghana is highly import-dependent (e.g., rice) and the products for which Ghana is self-sufficient (e.g., maize). The econometric results also show that price transmission is high between regional producer markets and markets located in the country’s largest cities, and the distance between producer and consumer markets and the size of consumer markets matter in explaining the price transmission. The welfare analysis for households as consumers shows that the effect of world food prices appears relatively modest for the country as a whole due to relatively diverse consumption patterns within country. However, the national average hides important regional differences, both between regions and within different income groups. We find that the poorest of the poor—particularly those living in the urban areas—are hardest hit by high food prices. The negative effect of the food crisis is particularly strong in northern Ghana. The main explanations for this regional variation in the price effect is the different consumption patterns and much lower per capita income levels in the North of Ghana compared to other regions in the country.

Numerous arguments have been proposed to explain overshooting, including financial speculation, depreciation of the United States (US) dollar, low interest rates, and reductions in grain stocks. However, observations that international rice prices surged in response to export restrictions by India and Vietnam suggested that trade-related factors could be an important basis for overshooting, especially given the very tangible link between export volumes and export prices. In this paper, we revisit the trade story by closely examining monthly data from Thailand (the largest exporter of rice), and the United States (the largest exporter of wheat and maize and the third largest exporter of soybeans). In all cases except soybeans, we find that large surges in export volumes preceded the price surges. The presence of these large demand surges, together with back-of-the-envelope estimates of their price impacts, suggests that trade events played a much larger and more pervasive role than previously thought.

Benefits obtained through a growth in export activities are partially outweighed by an increase in crude oil prices. In this context, extreme poverty increases. As in other countries, the increase in food prices affects the already poor population, who become even poorer.

Hence, an improved understanding of the production, utilization, trade, and estimated future economic importance of these crops has potentially far-reaching implications for investments in agricultural research at both the international and, perhaps even more importantly, national levels. Previous projections for the evolution of global supply, demand, and trade into the 21st century, however, have focused on grains, oilseeds, and livestock. This paper presents global projections of supply, demand, and trade for root and tuber crops to the year 2020. According to the baseline scenario, roots and tubers will decline in relative economic importance only marginally vis-à-vis the other major food and feed crops over the next three decades. According to an alternative, high demand and production growth scenario, the economic importance of roots and tubers versus the same commodities will increase slightly. The results of this scenario contrast with earlier projections that predicted a decline in importance for roots and tubers. Policymakers should take cognizance of and act on the growth prospects for these crops. In the past, root and tuber crops have often been overlooked in policy deliberations precisely because their potential was considered more limited than actual growth rates clearly indicate, or that current projections foresee.

We propose screening menus consisting of different instruments (tariff vs. quota) designed to solve this informational issue. We first use a simple model that examines a Cournot duopoly between a domestic firm and a foreign firm with linear demand and cost functions, with both firms supplying a homogeneous good on the domestic market. In this scenario, if the government does not have information regarding the demand parameter, which is known by both firms, a menu consisting of a rent-extracting tariff for a low demand parameter and a rent-extracting quota for a high demand parameter maximizes the government's objective function. This menu leads the domestic firm to reveal private information. We then generalize this framework to a scenario with imperfect information regarding the firms' marginal cost. Finally, we discuss the issue of quotas generating public revenues and study the case of a menu consisting of a tariff and a free quota. "

Some researchers and practitioners advocate for formal, legal recognition of group rights as a way to secure access for drylands resource users. Others, on the other hand, speak against formal, legal protections. They argue that much of Africa's drylands are collectively held, often under customary tenures. Statutory law may undermine the dynamism, flexibility and inclusiveness of such tenures. By reviewing innovative efforts at securing access in different parts of Africa, the paper shows that any attempt to secure access for multiple users in drylands environments needs to identify frameworks for negotiated conflict resolution, crafting rules from the ground upwards, in addition to a more generic identification of rights. Policy-makers can thus focus on process, as well as the content of tenure arrangements, reconciling statutory rights with customary rights. For rights to be meaningfully secured, however, there is need to identify the nature and sources of threats that create insecurities and tailor policy solutions to threats. Elite capture and exclusion of women and young people continue to pose significant challenges in such decentralized processes. "

This helps to ensure that the company receives quality produce for processing. Private extension approach is a win–win situation for the farmers and the company. Lessons from the case study show that nurturing the farmers and keeping their interest in the contract while overcoming the challenges of attrition and side-selling are principal requirements for successful implementation of the private extension system.

However, experiences from other world regions show that countries in transition are at high risk of entering conflicts, which often come at large economic, social and political costs. In order to identify options on how conflict may be prevented in Arab transition countries, this paper assesses the key global drivers of conflicts based on a dataset from 1960 to 2010 and improved cross-country regression techniques. Results show that unlike in other studies where per capita incomes, inequality, and poor governance, among other factors, emerge as the major determinants of conflict, food security at macro and household-levels emerges as the main cause of conflicts in the Arab World. The high exposure of Arab countries to global food price variations proves to be an important source of vulnerability for a peaceful Arab transition. If history is also a guide to the future, improving food security is not only important for improving the lives of rural and urban people; it is also likely to be the key for a peaceful transition. The paper concludes with a set of policy options on how to improve food security at macro and household-levels, including safeguard mechanisms against excessive price volatility, export-led and pro-poor growth, the creation/expansion of social safety nets and targeted nutrition programs.

A conceptual \{GIS\} data model is formulated to integrate the physical and logical components of the modeling problem into an operational framework, based on which, extended \{GIS\} functions are developed to implement a tight linkage between the \{GIS\} and the water resources management model. Through the object-oriented approach, data, models and users interfaces are integrated in the \{GIS\} environment, creating great flexibility for modeling and analysis.

We propose an extension of Neary and Tharakan’s (2012) model, in which firms resort to external funders to finance investments in production capacities. Sectors differ in financial constraint and the cost of capital increases with the level of financial constraint. We first show that a weaker financial constraint allows firms to adopt a Cournot (rather than a Bertrand) pricing scheme and generate a high duopoly profit. Consequently, less financially constrained sectors are more likely to export. We also exhibit a new transmission channel of financial crisis. By increasing the financial cost of exporting and making it more difficult to engage in a Cournot behavior, a financial shock reduces both the intensive and extensive margins of trade. "

However, the prognosis for the socioeconomic wellbeing of inhabitants remains unclear. In an empirical regularity that has been termed the boom–bust pattern or the resource curse, the exploitation of natural resources is associated with short-run gains in welfare that dissipate over time. This “coupling hypothesis” asserts that deforestation and development are correlated such that deforestation leads to only short-term advances in economic welfare that are not sustained once natural forests (along with their mature timber and soil inputs) are exhausted. In contrast, the “decoupling hypothesis” asserts that deforestation and development need not be correlated over time. In this context, growth that is initially based on deforestation may be sustained and translated into prolonged welfare gains, even once the forest is exhausted. Using census and deforestation data from 1991, 2000 and 2010 for municipalities (i.e., counties) in the Amazon region we confirm that this boom–bust pattern appears in cross-sectional data. However, using panel data we show that socioeconomic welfare has become decoupled from environmental factors and is converging to rising national averages. Our findings contradict the conventional wisdom that the exploitation of tropical forests is required to promote Amazonian development. "

We estimate a model of crop and variety choice in a theoretical framework of the farm household model to compare the determinants of crop and variety diversity, revealing some of these policy considerations. Farm physical features and household characteristics such as wealth and labour stocks have large and significant effects on both the diversity among and within cereal crops, varying among crops. Policies designed to encourage variety diversity in one cereal crop may have opposing effects in another crop. Trade-offs between development-related factors and diversity in this resource-poor system are not evident, however. Market-related variables and population density have ambiguous effects. Education positively influences cereal crop diversity. Growing modern varieties of maize or wheat does not detract from the richness or evenness of these cereals on household farms. "

Bangladesh, the world's eighth largest fish producing country, has been part of this transformation. Despite having vitamin A supplementation and fortification programs, the prevalence of inadequate vitamin A intake (IVAI) in Bangladesh is very high, estimated to be 60%. The promotion of a small indigenous fish, high in vitamin A – mola carplet – offers a promising food-based approach to improving vitamin A status of the 98% of Bangladeshis who eat fish. The objective of this paper was to conduct a benefit–cost analysis of a national household pond Mola Promotion Program (MPP) in Bangladesh. Methods Using the 2005 Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) and nutrition and health statistics, we developed baseline estimates of usual vitamin A intake, the prevalence of \{IVAI\} and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to vitamin A deficiency (VAD). Drawing on a WorldFish project and \{HIES\} data, we designed and modeled the implementation of a MPP, and calculated the additional vitamin A intake it would provide, calculated new incidence rates of VAD-related health outcomes and estimated MPP-attributable annual changes in DALYs. The MPP's total health benefits were calculated over the program's 11-year phase-in as the annual sum of \{DALYs\} saved. The MPP's costs were estimated as the sum of the costs of a small fish program of the Fisheries Development Program plus the costs of mola brood stock, other inputs and additional farmer training-related costs. Program costs and benefits were combined to produce estimates of the cost-effectiveness of the program. Results An 11-year, $23 million project would increase average daily vitamin A intakes by 7 μg retinol activity equivalent (RAE), reduce the prevalence of \{IVAI\} by 1.1 percentage points, and save 3000 lives and 100,000 DALYs, at a cost of $194 per \{DALY\} saved. The MPP's impact would be concentrated among homestead pond-fishing households that would consume 60% of the additional mola produced. Among these, it would reduce \{IVAI\} prevalence by 7 percentage points. If the \{MPP\} was implemented for at least 20 years, it would dominate – have higher health benefits and lower total costs – than a national vitamin A wheat flour fortification program. Conclusion By World Bank and World Health Organization criteria, the \{MPP\} is a cost-effective approach to reduce the burden of micronutrient malnutrition in Bangladesh. "

More specifically, the study analyzes the weather extreme which affected maize production in the \{USA\} in 2012; it also estimates the effect of a similar weather extreme in 2050, using future climate scenarios. The secondary impact of the weather extreme on food security in the developing world is also assessed using trend analysis. Many studies have reported on the significant reduction in maize production in the \{USA\} due to the extreme weather event (combined heat wave and drought) that occurred in 2012. However, most of these studies focused on yield and did not assess the potential effect of weather extremes on food prices and security. The overall goal of this study was to use geo-spatial crop modeling and trend analysis to quantify the impact of weather extremes on both yield and, followed food security in the developing world. We used historical weather data for severe extreme events that have occurred in the USA. The data were obtained from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In addition we used five climate scenarios: the baseline climate which is typical of the late 20th century (2000s) and four future climate scenarios which involve a combination of two emission scenarios (A1B and B1) and two global circulation models (CSIRO-Mk3.0 and \{MIROC\} 3.2). \{DSSAT\} 4.5 was combined with \{GRASS\} \{GIS\} for geo-spatial crop modeling. Simulated maize grain yield across all affected regions in the \{USA\} indicates that average grain yield across the \{USA\} Corn Belt would decrease by 29% when the weather extremes occur using the baseline climate. If the weather extreme were to occur under the \{A1B\} emission scenario in the 2050s respectively, average grain yields would decrease by 38% and 57%, under the CSIRO-Mk3.0 and \{MIROC\} 3.2 global climate models, respectively. The weather extremes that occurred in the \{USA\} in 2012 resulted in a sharp increase in the world maize price. In addition, it likely played a role in the reduction in world maize consumption and trade in 2012/13, compared to 2011/12. The most vulnerable countries to the weather extremes are poor countries with high maize import dependency ratios including those countries in the Caribbean, northern Africa and western Asia. Other vulnerable countries include low-income countries with low import dependency ratios but which cannot afford highly-priced maize. The study also highlighted the pathways through which a weather extreme would affect food security, were it to occur in 2050 under climate change. Some of the policies which could help vulnerable countries counter the negative effects of weather extremes consist of social protection and safety net programs. Medium- to long-term adaptation strategies include increasing world food reserves to a level where they can be used to cover the production losses brought by weather extremes. "

Genetic resistance, rather than fungicide application, is the principal means of controlling leaf rust in developing countries. Whereas productivity enhancement is often estimated in terms of yield gains and increased supply, productivity maintenance is measured in terms of the yield losses avoided by the research investment. The internal rate of return on CIMMYT’s research investment was estimated at 41%.

It investigates whether female-headed households are more likely to report experiencing a food price shock, and whether female-headed households experiencing a shock are more (or less) likely to adopt certain coping strategies, controlling for individual, household, and community characteristics. Our findings suggest that female-headed households are more vulnerable to food price changes and are more likely to have experienced a food price shock in 2007–2008. Because female-headed households are also resource poor and have a larger food gap compared with male-headed households, they cope by cutting back on the number of meals they provide their households during good months and eating less preferred foods in general. A combination of short-term measures to protect diet diversity and micronutrient consumption of vulnerable groups and longer-term measures to promote investment in sustainable agriculture, such as strengthening women’s property rights, may increase the ability of poor and vulnerable households to cope better with food price increases.

Migrants make an incentivized decision over how much of a cash windfall to remit, and recipients decide how they will spend a remittance. Migrants strategically send home less when their choice is not revealed to recipients. Recipients make spending choices closer to migrants' preferences when the migrants' preferences are shared, regardless of whether or not the spending choices are revealed to the migrants, suggesting that recipients' choices are inadvertently affected by imperfect information.

Yet, the determinants and rationale of gendered access to land are not well understood. This paper argues that gender relations are more than the outcomes of negotiations within households. It explains the importance of social norms, perceptions, and formal and informal rules shaping access to land for male and female farmers at four levels: (1) the household/family, (2) the community, (3) the state, and (4) the market. The framework is applied to Ghana, using the results from qualitative field work. Norms on household and family organization and on men’s and women’s responsibilities and capabilities play a key role in gendered allocation of resources. However, these norms and perceptions are dynamic and evolve jointly with the development of markets and changes in values of inputs such as labor and land. Theoretical models that represent the gendered distribution of assets as the result of intrahousehold bargaining should be revised, and extrahousehold factors should be included. From a policy perspective, laws that ensure gender equality in terms of inheritance and a more gender-equitable distribution of property upon divorce can play a key role in improving women’s property rights. Yet, their impact may be limited where customary rights dominate and social norms and rules continue to discriminate according to gender. "

We argue that this complex relationship may give rise to multiple equilibria in the dynamics of financial global integration: haphazard capital account liberalization may lead to situations where well integrated nations become increasingly better integrated, while poorly integrated nations are left at the margin. To test this hypothesis, we check whether controlling for the quality of institutions eliminates conditional convergence of global financial integration. Our results confirm that growth in financial integration is non-linear, and that this non-linearity disappears once we control for the quality of institutions. "

Given the importance of rice as staple crop for many of the world's poorest people, this will have implications for the alleviation of poverty, hunger and malnutrition. Thus, policy-makers need to be aware of the potential benefits of \{GM\} rice. We provide an overview of the literature and discuss the evidence on expected agronomic and consumer benefits of genetically engineered rice. We find that while \{GM\} rice with improved agronomic traits could deliver benefits similar to already commercialized biotechnology crops, expected benefits of consumer traits could be higher by an order of magnitude. By aggregating the expected annual benefits, we estimate the global value of \{GM\} rice to be US$64 billion per year. This is only an indicative value, as more \{GM\} varieties will become available in future. Nevertheless, such a figure can help guide policy-makers when deciding on the approval or funding of biotechnology crops and it may also raise awareness among consumers about what is at stake for their societies.

None of these studies have explicitly addressed the reasons behind the decision to seek off-farm employment. Neither have they been able to examine in-depth the important issue of how this major component of the farm sector responds to alternative policies, since most studies have used cross-sectional data for a given region. A comparison between countries would permit the analysis of how multiple job holding responds to differing government policies. The purpose of this paper is to examine the reasons for and factors affecting multiple job holdings of dairy farm families in neighboring regions of two counties, United States and Canada. The bordering regions of New York and Ontario have similar geographic conditions but significantly different farm support and social service policies. The results indicate the importance of farm income on why people work off the farm and provide evidence of multiple job holding as a flexible mechanism for coping with changes in the economic environment facing the household. For operators, the driving characteristics influencing off-farm labor participation is the farm's financial position. The supply-managed milk marketing system ensures higher and more stable returns for Ontario dairy farm labor. In contrast, it is family demographics, educational level and social support policy that appears to largely influence spousal off-farm employment decisions. Free medical care in Ontario lowers the reservation wage for household members. The effect of these farm and social support policies on the relative returns to labor in agriculture and non-farm employment explains the lower participation rate and hours supplied in off-farm work by both operators, and hours supplied in off-farm work by both operators and spouses in Ontario dairy farm household.

It is also recognized that livestock are an essential asset of poor farmers in the mixed crop-livestock systems in this region. One of the major constraints to their productivity is, however, feed availability. A significant proportion of this feed is sourced from maize stover. We engaged in a multi-disciplinary research of dual-purpose maize cultivars with the purpose of contributing to smallholder food security. The specific objective of our endeavor is to better match new maize cultivars to farmers’ needs by including fodder traits in maize improvement programs in Ethiopia, Tanzania and Kenya. We explored a novel approach for targeting maize breeding research. Agricultural development strategies must recognize heterogeneity in bio-physical, economic, socio-cultural, institutional and environmental factors when devising interventions and investments. The research effort into maize as a food and feed resource was, therefore, carried out in a cross-section of bio-physically and socio-economically contrasting areas across the three study countries. To this effect the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre's traditional targeting framework, maize mega-environments (MMEs), was combined with recommendation domains for dual-purpose maize using a Geographical Information System (GIS). The GIS-based approach provided a spatial framework for the structured exploration of opportunities to transfer knowledge and technologies. Results show that maize is potentially an important feed resource in areas with high feed demand. Throughout the different MMEs, a range of different incentives for dual-purpose varieties can be found. The maps with recommendation domains for dual-purpose maize will facilitate better targeting of new maize cultivars. Cultivars with good quality stover can now be preferentially promoted in areas with high demand for stover as feed, while at the same time matched to the bio-physically most suitable mega-environment. This integrated approach is widely applicable and will help increase the impacts from agricultural research. "

Estimates of treatment-effects models show that \{TC\} banana adoption, combined with improved crop management, causes considerable increases in farm and household income. Technology adoption also reduces relative food insecurity in a significant way. These results indicate that \{TC\} technology can be welfare enhancing for adopting farm households.

This is particularly essential in the Aral Sea Basin (ASB) where ineffective water management institutions are the primary reason of intersectoral and inter-state water sharing conflicts and lack of incentives for improving water use efficiency. This study examined market-based water allocation as an alternative option to the traditional administrative allocation to deal with water scarcity issues in the ASB. Potential economic gains of tradable water use rights were analyzed based on a newly constructed integrated hydro-economic river basin management model. The analysis differentiates between inter-catchment and intra-catchment water rights trading. The results show that compared to a baseline with fixed water use rights, inter-catchment water rights trading can increase basin-wide benefits by US$ 373–476 million. Under intra-catchment trading, gains are still US$ 259–339 million, depending on relative water availability. Gains from trade are larger under drier conditions. However, water rights trading carries a series of transaction costs. We find that in case transaction costs exceed US$ 0.05/m3 of water traded there is no additional economic gain from water rights trading. Enforcement of the rule of law, infrastructural improvements, participation of representatives of key water stakeholders in decision making processes, and mutual trust and cooperative relationships among the riparian countries are suggested as means for reducing transaction costs of water rights trading contracts.

We examine the hypothesis that creolization lessens these trade-offs and, hence, is a way of enhancing the benefits that farmers obtain from improved germplasm. Results show that creolized varieties occupy a niche that shifts according to the availability of improved germplasm and the orientation of farmers’ maize production. "

This paper draws on the case studies in this special issue and on other literature to examine the conceptual issues and empirical evidence on the role of collective action institutions in improving market access for the rural poor. Applying insights from studies of collective action in natural resource management, the paper examines what conditions facilitate effective producer organizations for smallholders’ market access, with special attention to the characteristics of user groups, institutional arrangements, types of products (staples, perishables and other commodities), markets (local, domestic and international), and external environment. The paper also identifies policies and interventions that facilitate collective action for market access among smallholders, and examines whether the public sector, private sector and/or civil society is best positioned to provide such interventions.

At the centre of these changes are smallholder coffee producers, responsible for 80% of global coffee production. Although rural households are known to depend on more than agricultural production alone, the literature on specialty coffee and certification has rather narrowly focused on coffee income and production. In this study, broader impacts are explicitly taken into account. Household income was decomposed into categories corresponding to specific income-generating activities and coffee income was broken down into price, yield and area effects. Results show that coffee certification encourages farmers to specialise in coffee production, increasing coffee income but not total household income, at least not in the short run. The time and effort required to attain the higher coffee income offered by certified production means farmers have to give up other activities. This substitution effect cancels out the income effect, such that there is no increase in total household income. The lack of an effect on total household income suggests the return to the additional labour effort required for certified coffee production is not higher than in other activities, questioning the benefits of certification for small-scale producers.

Two gaps have hindered the incorporation of natural enemies into pest management decision rules: 1) insufficient knowledge of pest and predator population dynamics and 2) lack of a decision framework for the economic tradeoffs among pest control options. Using a new intra-seasonal, dynamic bioeconomic optimization model, this study assesses how predation by natural enemies contributes to profit-maximizing pest management strategies. The model is applied to the management of the invasive soybean aphid, the most significant serious insect threat to soybean production in North America. The resulting lower bound estimate of the value of natural pest control ecosystem services was estimated at $84 million for the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan and Minnesota in 2005. "

abstract = "The control of pests by their natural enemies represents an important regulating ecosystem service that helps maintain the stability of crop ecosystems. These services, however, are often ignored in pest management decision making. In addition, the use of broad-spectrum insecticides can damage the populations of natural enemies, reducing the cost-effectiveness of insecticide investment if unaccounted for in treatment decisions. The existing literature on modeling of biological control of insect pests has generally focused on simulations of the population dynamics of pest and natural enemy species and the processes underlying pest control. But agriculture is a managed ecosystem where predator–prey relationships are heavily influenced by human managers. In modeling managerial choices, this study develops an intra-seasonal dynamic bioeconomic optimization model for insecticide-based pest management that explicitly takes into account both the biological control effect of natural enemies on pest density and the nontarget mortality effect of insecticides on the level of natural pest control supplied. The model captures predator–prey interactions, linking them to crop growth and yield damage functions, which in turn are evaluated in a dynamic optimization framework. We introduce a new decision rule for judicious insecticide decisions using a natural enemy-adjusted economic threshold. This threshold represents the pest population density at which insecticide control becomes optimal in spite of the opportunity cost of injury to natural enemies of the target pest. Using field data from Michigan, the model is applied to the case of soybean aphid (Aphis glycines, Matsumura), a recent invasive pest of soybean (Glycine max), whose management is of both economic and environmental importance to the North Central region of the United States. As illustrated by the numerical examples, such natural enemy-adjusted threshold is likely to lead to fewer recommendations for insecticide use than naïve models that ignore natural enemies, resulting in less insecticide use, while maintaining profitability for farmers that rely on chemical pest control methods. The bioeconomic model developed in this study can be used to conduct a wide variety of analyses such as identifying dynamically optimal spray strategies and estimating the implied economic value of natural control services. Furthermore, with the incorporation of inter-year carry-over factors, such as overwintering of pests and natural enemies, the current model can contribute to building multi-year models for studying long-term pest management.

Today these concerns are particularly relevant to Africa, with its rapid population growth, very small farms, and chronic food insecurity. In this paper we examine adaptation to falling land-labor ratios using a comprehensive theoretical framework in which households faced with binding land constraints can respond in three ways: intensifying agricultural production, diversifying out of agriculture, and reducing fertility rates. Using cross-country data and drawing upon the existing literature, we reach three conclusions. First, population density is associated with reduced fallows and more intensive use of land but not fertilizer use or irrigation, indicating major challenges in achieving sustainable intensification or agricultural productivity growth. Second, there is little evidence of successful non-farm diversification in response to land pressures in Africa from domestic or international income sources. Third, rural Africans in land constrained countries desire smaller families, but have thus far benefited little from family planning policies. These findings underscore the need for a coordinated multi-sectoral approach to sustainably reduce poverty in the region. "

Building on earlier literature that tries to assess the fiscal response effects of \{HIPC\} debt relief, we extend this assessment by explicitly including the fiscal response effects of \{MDRI\} debt relief, and by using an extended dataset and alternative econometric techniques, in order to have sufficient hindsight and better tackle methodological issues such as country-specific effects. We confirm earlier findings that debt relief, and especially the enhanced \{HIPC\} initiative, has had a positive impact on recipient country total domestic revenue and public investment (as percentage of GDP). Additionally, thanks to our large observation span, we also observe that the \{MDRI\} led to a significant increase in current primary expenditures and domestic revenue ratios, although these effects are on average smaller than the \{HIPC\} Initiative ones.

Since migrants self-select into migration, an instrumental variable approach is taken to analyze the relationship between migration and total food expenditures per capita, food expenditures across a range of food categories and shares of food expenditures across these categories. Overall, the results indicate that migration does not substantially affect total food expenditures per capita, and has minimal noticeable effect on food expenditure patterns. Looking at results in different settings, the analysis indicates that only in high migration regions does migration appear to increase overall food expenditures resulting in a shift towards the consumption of potentially less nutritious categories of food, such as sugar and beverages and eating out of the home. The results raise questions about the value of migration for improving the food consumption of migrant sending households. "

L’évaluation de ces composantes comprend quatre bras (SNACK ; \{SNACK\} + CASH ; \{SNACK\} + SUPP ; \{SNACK\} + \{CASH\} + SUPP). L’objet de ce travail est d’étudier l’influence des disparités économiques entre districts lors de l’enquête de base sur la comparabilité des bras d’intervention. Méthode Les centres de santé de l’intervention ont été randomisés par bloc de quatre au sein de chaque district. L’échantillon aléatoire a comptabilisé 5057 enfants âgés de 12–42 mois. À partir des caractéristiques des ménages, un indice économique (/100) a été construit par analyse factorielle. Des mesures anthropométriques chez les enfants, effectuées selon les recommandations OMS, ont permis de calculer leur indice taille-pour-âge (TA) selon la référence WHO-2006. Résultats L’indice économique moyen des ménages est de 29,5/100. Il diffère selon les districts (Bafoulabé : 25/100, Diéma : 27/100, Yélimané : 37/100, p &lt; 0,001) mais pas selon les bras d’intervention (p = 0,77). L’indice \{TA\} moyen est de −1,51 z-scores. Il diffère selon les districts (Bafoulabé : −1,61, Diéma : −1,54, Yélimané : −1,33 ; p &lt; 0,001) et aussi selon les bras (p = 0,04). Discussion Alors que la randomisation par blocs suivant les districts permet d’assurer la comparabilité des quatre bras sur le plan économique, elle ne conduit pas à un équilibre des bras sur le plan anthropométrique. Des ajustements complémentaires seront probablement nécessaires. "

Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. The three core determinants of food security are food availability, food access, and food utilization. This chapter explores the definition and measurement of food security to provide a conceptual foundation to food security policy analysis. First, it introduces a widely used and well-accepted definition along with three core determinants of food security. Second, it explains the measurement of these determinants with examples of global, national, and regional data sets that provide information on these determinants. Finally, this chapter explores some alternative approaches to measuring food security indicators. The food and nutrition policy–focused conceptual framework identifies the causal factors of nutrition security and the food policy linkages to them. It also identifies the points of entry for direct and indirect nutrition programs and policy interventions as well as the capacity gaps for analysis and evaluation of food and nutrition policies and programs.

abstract = "Publisher Summary Technological change in agriculture has long been accepted as a necessary condition for accelerating growth in food production. The desired benefits of technological change, such as increased agricultural or food production and income, are expected to have a positive influence on household food consumption and nutritional adequacy. It is typically assumed that this income-mediated effect on food security and nutritional improvement operates through two main ways. First, increased income can be used for greater food expenditures that directly increase food consumption, which, in turn, improves nutritional status by higher intake of energy and other nutrients. Second, increased income can result in higher nonfood expenditures such as health and sanitation that, along with food consumption, could indirectly have positive nutrition and health effects. In this chapter, a statistical analysis has been introduced using the t-test to examine whether hybrid maize adopters and nonadopters are different with respect to their food security status. In other words, it examines whether food security differs between the two groups (adopters and nonadopters) and whether this difference is statistically significant. This test is most commonly used for assessing group differences. "

The method is useful for predicting membership in naturally occurring groups and thus addresses whether a combination of variables (such as women's status, household income, and other community variables) can be used to predict group membership (such as child nutritional status). The method automatically determines some optimal combination of variables so the function can provide the overall discrimination between groups. An important advantage of this method is that the functions will be independent or orthogonal, so that their contribution to the discrimination between groups does not overlap. Women's status in the society has been one of the socioeconomic variables that have gained recognition as a good predictor of child nutritional status. This chapter provides a conceptual framework for briefly studying whether women's status is important for predicting child nutritional status. It also reviews some studies that attempt to identify good predictors of child nutrition status. In addition, there is a discussion of issues, data sets, and analytical methods, and results of these studies serve as a motivation for understanding the use and application of discriminant analysis. Last, this chapter provides concluding remarks and some implications of the results. "

This chapter discusses the changes in food consumption pattern. The study of consumption patterns is important for a number of reasons. First, since total consumption accounts for more than two-thirds of national income in many countries, it is the largest macroeconomic aggregate, having great significance for the state of the economy as a whole and business conditions. Second, the pattern of consumption contains useful information regarding economic welfare and living standards and, thus, is an objective way of measuring and assessing economic performance. Finally, understanding the price responsiveness of consumption is critical for a number of microeconomic policy issues, which include the measurement of distortions, optimal taxation, and the treatment of externalities.

This issue is critically important, since an efficient marketing system can play an important role in supplying yield-enhancing modern inputs at reasonable prices and in ensuring remunerative prices for farmers. There is a broader consensus that agriculture in these countries is responsive to economic incentives, yet incentives fail when the risks are quite high. In this chapter, a multivariate statistical technique is used called “factor analysis using principal components” to study the impact of market access on food security. The main purpose of using the factor analysis approach is to reduce a large number of variables, which are the main determinants of food security, to a smaller set of underlying components or factors that summarize the essential information in the variables. The derived factors thus are linear combinations of sets of original, highly correlated variables. "

In this chapter, a cluster analysis method is undertaken to group households on the basis of food security and poverty dimensions. Clustering is a process of grouping data into classes so that objects within a class have high similarity in comparison to one another but are very dissimilar with respect to objects in other clusters. This chapter critically examines the different theoretical approaches to cluster analysis. It reviews some studies that highlight the linkages between food insecurity and poverty using cluster analysis. It also points outs some studies that have used this method to analyze dietary patterns and determinants of child health.

The literature on the welfare of children in developing countries emphasizes the importance of having literate parents and, in particular, of having a literate mother. The nutritional status of children is enhanced by having better-educated parents, especially the mother. There are both immediate causes of poor health and nutrition, such as lack of access to food, low utilization of health facilities or the poor quality of these facilities, and the underlying factors such as family income and educational status that cause it. The mechanism through which maternal education affects child health is quite complex (whether through higher wages, better health knowledge, greater child care, or improving the health environment in reducing mortality rates) and thus it requires a thorough analysis. The purpose of this chapter is to examine the pathways through which maternal education improves child health and to understand the impact of community characteristics (such as presence of hospitals and better water and sanitation conditions) on weight for age and height for age using a multivariate regression model that controls for other individual characteristics such as child's age.

One of the strongest and most consistent findings in the health economics literature is the positive relationship between maternal schooling and child health. This empirical relationship has been confirmed across different time periods, countries, and measures of child health. This chapter uses an instrumental variable estimation technique since child-care practices are essentially endogenous. In other words, child-care practices are determined by a set of independent variables and the instrumental variables. This approach is appropriate since child-care practices need to be instrumented out by a set of exogenous variables that are correlated with child-care practices, but are not correlated with the child outcome variable—namely, weight for age. Along with this, there is a discussion on the literature of how child-care and maternal nutritional knowledge are critically important in determining children nutritional outcomes such as weight for age. It also provides the empirical model and discusses the results and presents some concluding remarks and research agendas on child-care practices on child nutritional outcomes. "

abstract = "Publisher Summary Poverty is defined as “pronounced deprivation in well-being,” where well-being can be measured by individual or households' possession of income, health, education, assets, and certain rights in a society such as freedom of speech. Poverty is usually referred to as “whether individuals or households have enough resources or abilities to meet their needs.” Poverty reduction is considered to be one of the most important goals of development and of development policy. This chapter introduces concepts and methods for measuring and understanding poverty and its causes. It further addresses the various dimensions of poverty and the causes of poverty and justifies the rationale for measuring poverty. In addition, this chapter explains the steps in measuring poverty and the various indicators that are widely used to measure it. The chapter discusses how poverty lines are constructed after a suitable indicator is chosen. The derivation of the poverty line based on the cost of basic needs approach is also described. Along with this, various measures of poverty, such as the headcount ratio, poverty gap squared, and so on, are briefly discussed. "

It is a powerful tool for analyzing the cost of a nutritionally adequate ration prepared from different locally available foods. The sensitivity of linear programming to selected constraints is its major weakness. The food consumption constraints should be derived from the food consumption data collected in the community of interest. This chapter reviews some of the recent case studies that used the linear programming approach for achieving an optimal diet. It further illustrates the principles of the linear programming model along with its underlying assumptions and demonstrates the use of the Excel solver to determine the least expensive food combination that respects multiple nutritional constraints. The method shows how modern computer applications can be used to answer very practical questions. "

Effects of this shift, known as commercialization of agriculture, on food consumption and nutrition vary—a number of studies have documented disastrous effects, while others found a positive or neutral effect. Critics of commercialization of agriculture contend that if the resources that are used to produce agricultural export crops were used instead to produce food for the local economy, the problem of malnutrition in many countries can be reduced. This chapter examines the relationship between cash crops growing and household food security and nutrition situation, using a chi-square statistical technique. The purpose of a chi-square test is to compare the observed frequencies with the expected frequencies derived under the hypothesis of independence. The chi-square procedure can be legitimately applied only if the categories in which the observations are sorted are independent of each other—i.e., only if the placement of each observation into a particular category does not depend on the placement of any other observations.

This chapter examines the impact of maternal education and child care on children's nutritional status as measured by height-for-age and weight-for-height Z-scores, using a two-way \{ANOVA\} approach.

Throughout the history of agriculture, biotechnological processes have been used in the creation of agricultural products. Food and agriculture are biological by nature and are the result of biological applications. Early examples include bread making and the fermentation of fruits and grains to make wine and beer. Farmers have taken advantage of the natural processes of genetic exchange through sexual reproduction to produce varieties of organisms that display desired biological traits. The genetic variation experienced today in agriculture comes for the most part from mutations that occurred long ago in natural populations or during cultivation. Genetic improvements have resulted from a lengthy process of research and scientific discoveries that occurred throughout the 20th century. Biotechnology has also been applied with some success in the livestock sector. The importance of biotechnology for future agricultural productivity can also be considerable. The steady increases in agricultural productivity that occurred over the past several decades are beginning to level off as the possibilities of present methods of production are exhausted. The impending completion of several genome sequences adds excitement to the possibilities in agricultural genomics and biotechnology. Both are still in their infancy but further technological improvements present significant opportunities for agriculture, including reduced reliance on chemical use, increased flexibility in crops planted, and yield increases in some cases.

The results show that group members are able to obtain and to use locally available information about the applicant's creditworthiness in much the same way as informal lenders do. Both types of lenders use the applicant's debt-servicing obligations and income as the main criteria for credit rationing. This paper therefore empirically confirms theoretical arguments that community-based groups have an information advantage over distant formal bank agents. "

This change was significant at the 95% confidence level. This outcome is consistent with income-maximizing behavior on the part of the agency, since it expands billable area and revenue potential.

An analysis of potential capital and management costs vis-á-vis increased potential production of local and hybrid maize shows that investments in tree planting are most favorable when they involve low costs and low risks. In order to reduce the farmer's costs of tree planting, government introduced a Tree Planting Bonus scheme which has provided cash payments as an incentive for farmers to plant trees. The program has been costly to administer and has had a limited impact. Survey data suggest that existing markets for poles and other wood products probably provide better tree planting incentives. Planners need to carefully consider household resource allocation processes with regard to trees and tree based products before they can expect to achieve a significant impact in encouraging rural afforestation.

This paper presents evidence that this trade, made possible by separate trade liberalizations in India and Bangladesh in the early 1990s, augmented domestic supplies and stabilized prices in Bangladesh at import parity levels. Letters of credit data indicating the participation of hundreds of importers, and a close correlation of price movements across the two countries suggest that the trade was competitive. A risk of co-incident crop shortfalls in the two countries remains, though these have occurred rarely in the past two decades. Bangladesh imports from alternative sources would also enhance food availability if another production shortfall occurs, but these imports face higher transport costs and would involve far fewer importing firms given the economies of scale of shipments by sea. The positive contribution of trade liberalization to short-run food security in Bangladesh in recent years does not minimize the importance of increased agricultural productivity and rural economic growth to provide rural poor households with sufficient incomes to acquire food. Nonetheless, the Bangladesh experience shows that trade liberalization offers potential benefits for national food security by enabling a rapid increase of food supplies following domestic production shortfalls.

Over the two-year period, the number of households who have fallen into poverty is over twice as large as the number of households who have climbed out of poverty. About two-thirds of overall poverty is chronic (average consumption over time is below the poverty line), and almost half of all poor are always poor. We use quantile regression methods to identify the factors that explain total, chronic, and transitory poverty. While our analysis is able to document the extent of transitory poverty, it performs relatively poorly in explaining the determinants of this type of poverty.

Causal relationships and the magnitude of impact of new information on price discovery between geographic markets during different policy regimes are determined by the Granger causality test and dynamic multipliers, respectively. Our findings show that intervention policies impair the efficiency of arbitrage in integrating spatial markets. Price adjustments between regional markets are slower during periods of government regulation than during periods of decontrol. Highly volatile prices and a longer \{ARCH\} process also tend to characterize the former more than the latter. These findings for the Philippine copra markets support the importance of taking heteroskedasticity into account in testing spatial integration. "

To avail of this opportunity requires an understanding of the close connection between food supplies and purchasing power to purchase food. Massive investment in rural infrastructure is a major component of long-term food security. Since infrastructure is efficiently produced by labor-intensive processes, food as a wage good is an important input, and the global economy would appear to be under-using it from an efficiency point of view. In the short run, food-for-work offers opportunity for immediate increase in food security, as do food subsidy programs. It is essential that a large complex of institutions be developed if the current global scene is to result in increased food security. It will take time to develop those structures, even though food is available now. "

The seasonal pattern of stock drawdown is linked with those for food consumption, nutrition, and labor input in this unimodal agricultural cycle. It is found that low levels of food stocks in the post-harvest period and their availability during the heavy work period in the rainy season can reduce the area planted as well as the use of non-household agricultural labor by households. The significance of food as wage good, possibly as a result of public policies that have reduced the growth of rural food markets, is also a factor in this process. It is argued that small farmers with low food stocks may be unable to adopt labor-intensive agricultural technologies unless they can increase their effective demand for labor, possibly through dry season food-for-work programs or consumption credit schemes.

At the same time, in addition to food quantity, increased attention is being given to food quality attributes, in particular nutrition and safety. This is especially evident in China, where concerns are on the rise regarding the ability of China's food production systems to deliver nutritious and safe food to a growing, urbanizing and more affluent population. These food and nutrition concerns come at a time when China is an increasingly influential actor within the global food security network through activities such as production, consumption and trade. We argue that China has the opportunity to increase food and nutrition security both nationally and globally through a comprehensive policy agenda that focuses on institutional reforms, investments for and in agriculture, productive social safety nets, mutually beneficial trade, and the exchange of know-how and technologies among developing countries and donors. This agenda will help China adapt its food production systems to the changing face of agriculture and to play a vital role in addressing the emerging challenges facing food and nutrition security within and beyond China in the coming decades.

This paper discusses the link between food policy researchers and one group of clients—food policy decisionmakers. The paper first reviews the role of research and clients in the policymaking process and proposes a conceptual framework that integrates clients into the research process. Case studies utilizing client consultation in Ghana, India, Kenya, and Mali illustrate the hypothesis that integration of all client groups, including policy decisionmakers and in-country researchers, beginning at the priority-setting stage of the research process, may best influence ultimate policy decisions.

The major increase in foreign assistance, coupled with deficit spending, enabled the government to undertake the ambitious infrastructure projects that stimulated demand. However, this policy change had deleterious consequences for the poor. Rapid inflation which resulted in a decline of real wages, coupled with dramatic decreases in the value of the food stamp scheme, brought about a decline in calorie consumption for lower expenditure groups. In addition, levels of malnutrition, as measured by acute wasting, were higher after the policy change. "

The more a new technology increased labor productivity in rice, the more there was a takeover of the rice production technology by male producers, and the more the crop became a “communal” crop for household food security. Household income increased substantially. (2) Much of the increased income is spent on increased calorie consumption. It makes no difference for the degree of change in calorie consumption levels if change in real income is in the form of cash or subsistence food. (3) Technological change effects mediated through income are traced to increased food consumption (calories) at the household level where it is found to significantly improve children's nutritional status, especially in the “rainy” season.

The paper also investigates whether irrigation has secondary impacts on risk-mitigating strategies by reducing covariate risk and reinforcing informal food sharing networks that allow households to insure against idiosyncratic risk. We find that households with irrigation save between 4.5 and 6.4 more tropical livestock units and are 20% more likely to engage in informal food sharing with non-irrigators. This finding suggests that impact estimates that rely on consumption, may underestimate welfare gains by ignoring the household’s savings behavior and informal insurance network. "

Estimation of consumer demand in such a market is presented here. Heckman's approach to truncated sample estimation has been employed. The approach allows modelling of time costs as a two-part tariff. The results confirm that consumer's response to waiting time is measurable and in the same order of magnitude as expected from response to changes in prices.

In this approach, the parameters in a \{CGE\} model are treated as fixed but unobserved, which we represent as prior mean values with prior error mass functions. Estimation of the parameters involves using an informationtheoretic Bayesian approach to exploit additional information in the form of new data from a series of Social Accounting Matrices (SAMs), which we assume were measured with error. The estimation procedure is "efficient" in the sense that it uses all available information and makes no assumptions about unavailable information. As illustration, we apply the methodology to estimate the parameters of a \{CGE\} model using alternative data sets for South Korea and for Sub-Saharan Africa. "

This “dual economy” perspective overlooks the heterogeneity within and synergies between these two broad sectors. Recent studies decompose agriculture into subsectors and find that agricultural growth led by smallholder farmers is even more effective at reducing poverty than larger-scale estate farms. In contrast, few studies estimate subsectoral growth–poverty linkages for non-agriculture. Yet we strongly expect, for example, that growth led by informal traders or foreign-owned mining companies will have quite different implications for poverty reduction. Different perspectives on what constitutes “non-agriculture” might therefore explain divergent views on its relative importance for poverty reduction. To address this gap in our understanding, we estimate sectoral poverty–growth elasticities using economy-wide models for five African countries. While our estimated elasticities are higher for agriculture than for non-agriculture as a whole, the extent to which this is true varies considerably across nonagricultural subsectors (and across countries). We find that the poverty–growth elasticities for trade and transport services and manufacturing, especially agro-processing, are often close to, and sometimes exceed, agriculture’s. This means that growth led by these nonagricultural subsectors might be as effective as agriculture at reaching the poor. This confirms the need for a more nuanced treatment of non-agriculture in Africa’s policy debate, and may explain conflicting perspectives on agriculture’s role vis-à-vis non-agriculture. "

To do so, we first outline a simple conceptual model to identify the different impacts that productivity growth in a food staple(s) might have on child nutrition outcomes, with a particular focus on changes in diets at the household and child level. We then apply this framework to a descriptive overview of the evolution of Bangladesh's food system in recent decades. We show that this evolution is characterized rapid growth in yields and calorie availability, but relatively sluggish diversification in both food production and consumption, despite increasing reliance on imports for dietary diversification. Next, we create a multi-round district level panel that links changes in nutrition survey data with agricultural sample survey data over 1996–2011, a period in which rice yields rose by more than 70%. We then use this panel to more rigorously test for associations between yield growth and various anthropometric and child feeding indicators. Consistent with our descriptive evidence on dietary changes, we find that rice yields predict the earlier introduction of complementary foods to young children (most frequently rice) as well as increases in their weight-for-height, but no improvements in their dietary diversity or height-for-age. Since Bangladesh has one of the highest rates of child wasting in the world, these significant associations between yields and child weight gain are encouraging, but the lack of discernible effects on children's dietary diversity or linear growth is cause for concern. Indeed, it suggests that further nutritional impacts will require diversifying the Bangladeshi food basket through both supply and demand-side interventions. "

In recent decades, downstream water shortages have become increasingly common and inflows into the Aral Sea have become very limited. Meanwhile, water losses are enormous both at conveyance and field levels because of outdated infrastructure and the dominance of highly inefficient basin and furrow irrigation methods. Intensification and modernization of irrigation systems, while requiring investment of scarce capital resources, could thus substantially reduce non-beneficial water consumption and help in coping with increasing water scarcity. This study applies a hydro-economic model that solves for the investment in improved irrigation efficiency across the various irrigation sites in the \{ASB\} that delivers the highest economic gains. Improvement of the efficiency of irrigation canals and implementation of field efficiency investments and practices, such as drip irrigation, and alternate dry or short furrow irrigation (for rice), would substantially improve economic outcomes. Conveyance efficiency investments are particularly worthwhile in downstream regions where sandy soils are common and return flows largely feed saline lakes in tail-end depressions. Meanwhile, field-level efficiency should be fully upgraded in all rice-producing regions through the use of drip and alternate wet and dry irrigation, as well as with drip irrigation in the cotton-producing Ferghana Valley of the Syr Darya Basin. The value of these improvements increases with reduced water availability. Implementation of an optimal set of investments could increase basinwide benefits by 20% (from US$ 3.2 to 3.8 billion) under normal water availability and by 40% (from US$ 2.5 to 3.5 billion) under dry conditions (80% of normal supply).

We first outline the debate between the proponents of agriculture and its skeptics before presenting a series of case studies reflecting the heterogeneity of initial conditions facing low-income African countries. Drawing on economy-wide modeling, these case studies contrast the effectiveness of alternative growth strategies in reducing poverty. The findings indicate that while Africa does face many new challenges unlike those faced by Asian countries, there is little evidence to suggest that these countries can bypass a broad-based agricultural revolution to successfully launch their economic transformations.

The papers herein revisit the issue of Boserupian agricultural intensification as an important response to land constraints, but they also go further than Boserup and her followers to explore broader responses to land constraints, including non-farm diversification, migration, and reduced fertility rates. Agricultural and rural development strategies in the region will need to more fully anticipate the implications of Africa’s rapidly changing land and demographic situation, and the immense challenges that mounting land pressures pose in the context of current evidence of unsustainable agricultural intensification, a rapidly rising labor force associated with the region’s current demographic conditions, and limited nonfarm job creation. These challenges are manageable but will require explicit policy actions to address the unique development challenges in densely populated rural areas. "

The study also quantifies the potential effects of a similar weather extreme occurring in 2050 under climate change. The study results indicate that weather extremes that affect maize productivity in key grain baskets can negatively affect food security in vulnerable countries. The 2012 weather extreme which occurred in the \{USA\} reduced \{US\} and global maize production by 29% compared to trend; maize consumption in the country decreased by 5% only and this resulted in less surplus maize for exports from the largest maize exporter in the world. Global maize production decreased by 6% compared to trend. The decrease in global maize production coupled with a reduction in the volume of global maize exports worsened food insecurity in eastern Africa, the Caribbean and Central America and India. The effects of the weather extreme on global food security would be worse, if the latter were to occur under climate change in 2050, assuming no climate change adaptation worldwide over the years. In addition, the hardest-hit regions would remain the same, whether the weather extreme occurs in 2012 instead of 2050: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), South Asia and the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region. However, sustained growth in per capita income across world economies between 2000 and 2050 would allow few countries in \{SSA\} and the \{LAC\} region to virtually eliminate hunger within their borders. In these countries, per capita income would be high enough by 2050 to completely offset the negative effect of the weather extreme. The study results are also consistent with USDA׳s estimates on \{US\} and global maize production and consumption in 2012 after the weather extreme. Some discrepancy is found on the volume of global maize trade; this implies that the bio-economic model likely overestimates the effect of the weather extreme on food insecurity. However, the trends from the analysis are likely to be valid. Further research would involve using a \{CGE\} model that can capture the net effects of weather extremes. "

The objective of this research is to guide crop improvement efforts by prioritizing areas of high poverty, the key problem of high drought risk and the crops grown and consumed in these areas. Global spatial data on crop production, climate and poverty (as proxied by child stunting) were used to identify geographic areas of high priority for crop improvement. The analysis employed spatial overlay, drought modelling and descriptive statistics to identify where best to target technology generation to achieve its intended human welfare goals. Analysis showed that drought coincides with high levels of poverty in 15 major farming systems, especially in South Asia, the Sahel and eastern and southern Africa, where high diversity in drought frequency characterizes the environments. Thirteen crops make up the bulk of food production in these areas. A database was developed for use in agricultural research and development targeting and priority setting to raise the productivity of crops on which the poor in marginal environments depend. "

Three key features of the experiment are (1) inclusion of all farmers as target beneficiaries, (2) effective identification of farmers' extension service needs, and (3) an accountability system to provide better agricultural extension services to farmers. This paper describes design of the reform initiative and examines its effect on farmers' access to extension services.

This paper provides a selective overview and synthesis of the issues involved in the commercialization and diversification process of agriculture, drawing in significant part from the papers in this volume. Based on an assessment of the process observed in selected countries, we show that the commercialization process should not be expected to be a frictionless process, and significant equity and environmental consequences may occur, at least in the short to medium term, particularly when inappropriate policies are followed. However, we highlight that appropriate government policies including investment in rural infrastructure and crop improvement research and extension, establishment of secure rights to land and water, and development and liberalization of capital markets, can help alleviate many of the possible adverse transitional consequences.

We capture individual racial information using the approach of Ñopo, Saavedra, and Torero (2007), enabling a richer exploration of racial differences. Overall, the study finds discriminatory treatment in hiring only when comparing groups with extremely different observable racial characteristics. We detect discriminatory treatment for female Indigenous applicants in secretarial positions. In terms of aimed wages, females tend to ask for wages 7% below those of males with comparable skills (although this has no negative impact on wages at hiring). "

Increasing agricultural productivity is the key to agricultural growth, and one strategy for increasing agricultural productivity is to use improved seeds. This study investigates the impact of contract farming (CF) in high yielding varieties (HYV) of paddy seed production on costs, yield, and profits of smallholder farms in Nepal. Using farm-level data and a non-parametric propensity score matching estimator, the study finds a significant positive impact of contract \{HYV\} seed farming on revenues, profits, and yield, and a significant negative impact on total costs of production. Additionally, very small farms (⩽0.43 ha) with \{CF\} in \{HYV\} paddy seeds tend to gain the most when it comes to yield per hectare. Our estimates reveal that the average smallholder household in Nepal engaged in \{CF\} with input conditions receives higher profits. However, farmers engaged in \{CF\} with output conditions tend to have higher yields but smaller profits. Finally, farmers engaged in \{CF\} in \{HYV\} paddy seeds with both input and output conditions have the highest yield gains and significantly higher profits. "

Encouraging this population of men to get circumcised maximizes the benefit that can be achieved through the scale-up of circumcision programs. This paper examines how the price of circumcision affects the risk profile of men who receive a voluntary medical circumcision. Methods In 2010, 1649 uncircumcised adult men in urban Malawi were interviewed and provided a voucher for a subsidized voluntary medical male circumcision, at randomly assigned prices. Clinical data were collected indicating whether the men in the study received a circumcision. Results Men who took-up circumcision with a zero-priced voucher were 25 percentage points less likely than those who took-up with a positive-price voucher, to be from a tribe that traditionally circumcises (p = 0.101). Zero-priced vouchers also brought in men with more sexual partners in the past year (p = 0.075) and past month (p = 0.003). None of the men who were most at risk of \{HIV\} at baseline (those with multiple partners and who did not use a condom the last time they had sex) received a circumcision if they were offered a positive-priced voucher. Lowering the price to zero increased circumcision take-up to 25% for men of this risk group. The effect of price on take-up was largest among those at highest risk (p = 0.096). Conclusions Reducing the price of circumcision surgery to zero can increase take-up among those who are most at risk of \{HIV\} infection. "

Not only is household food security influenced by total household income but the proportion of income controlled by women has a positive and significant influence on household caloric intake. Households were disaggregated not simply in male- and female-headed households but female-headed households were further disaggregated into de jure (legal head of household is a woman) and de facto female-headed households (male head of household is absent more than 50% of the time). In both Kenya and Malawi, the de facto female-headed households had the lowest income; despite this low income, preschoolers' nutritional status was significantly better than in the higher income male-headed and de jure female-headed households. The ability to improve nutritional status in a low-income environment in the de facto female-headed households is related to a combination of child feeding practices and other nurturing behavior. The findings suggest that interventions that exploit incentives to invest in children can provide more immediate improvements in child health and nutrition where sustained income growth is possible only in the long term.

This study develops a spatial optimization model to explore economically optimal spatial configuration of natural enemy habitat in agricultural landscapes. The model is applied to the management of soybean aphid (Aphis glycines), a recent invasive pest species of soybean production systems in the North Central region of the United States. Results indicate that non-crop habitat management can be a promising pest management option for organic cropping systems. Under current prices, however, habitat management tends to reduce net returns for conventional farms.

Eight income-earning strategies were distinguished that reflect differences in comparative advantage between communities. We explain the choice of income earning strategy using a multinomial logit model that includes biophysical, economic, social and institutional variables. We use a probit model to show that adoption of conservation practices is determined by the type of income earning strategy, population density, market access, and organizational variables. Our results have some important policy implications. First, given the higher profitability of cash crops compared to staple foods, significant investments in road infrastructure are needed to better integrate hillside communities into the market economy. Second, while the potential of profitable conservation practices depends on the type of income earning strategy pursued, population density, market access and assistance from community-based and external organizations play an important role as well. The positive impact of population density on the adoption of many conservation technologies and investments becomes only effective at relatively high levels of population density which most communities in the rural hillsides of Honduras have not yet reached. Finally, given the limited coverage of basic public services such as public health, education, electricity, communication facilities and extension services in many hillside regions, it is imperative to substantially increase the low current levels of public expenditures in these areas. Subsequent research based on detailed household and plot level data from the same communities suggests that investments geared towards improved access to land, education, market access and extension with a focus on soil fertility maintenance have particular potential to raise incomes.

We conclude that peri-urban vegetable production, even though currently economically viable, is unlikely to be able to compete in the long run for scarce land and labour resources, unless alternative production technologies become available and the positive externalities generated by peri-urban agriculture become internalised. There is thus an urgent need for interdisciplinary research aimed at developing such technologies as well as for integrated economic and environmental analyses that take explicit account of interactions between peri-urban producers, the urban waste management sector, municipal planners and consumers.

To this end, it distinguishes between root, conditional, and internal drivers of price changes using three empirical models: (1) a price spike model where monthly food price returns (spikes) are estimated against oil prices, supply and demand shocks, and excessive speculative activity; (2) a volatility model where annualized monthly variability of food prices is estimated against the same set of variables plus a financial crises index; and (3) a trigger model that estimates extreme values of price spikes and volatility using quantile regressions. The results point to the increasing linkages among food, energy, and financial markets, which explain much of the observed food price spikes and volatility. While financial speculation amplifies short-term price spikes, oil price volatility intensifies medium-term price volatility. "

In contrast, the home \{NVs\} of appointed Communist Party secretaries do not receive disproportionately more resources, on average. This pattern of resource allocation is compatible with the interest of village heads and suggests that as elected leaders, village heads have some true power in resource distribution. "

abstract = "SummaryBackground One of the most important consequences of climate change could be its effects on agriculture. Although much research has focused on questions of food security, less has been devoted to assessing the wider health impacts of future changes in agricultural production. In this modelling study, we estimate excess mortality attributable to agriculturally mediated changes in dietary and weight-related risk factors by cause of death for 155 world regions in the year 2050. Methods For this modelling study, we linked a detailed agricultural modelling framework, the International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT), to a comparative risk assessment of changes in fruit and vegetable consumption, red meat consumption, and bodyweight for deaths from coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, and an aggregate of other causes. We calculated the change in the number of deaths attributable to climate-related changes in weight and diets for the combination of four emissions pathways (a high emissions pathway, two medium emissions pathways, and a low emissions pathway) and three socioeconomic pathways (sustainable development, middle of the road, and more fragmented development), which each included six scenarios with variable climatic inputs. Findings The model projects that by 2050, climate change will lead to per-person reductions of 3·2% (SD 0·4%) in global food availability, 4·0% (0·7%) in fruit and vegetable consumption, and 0·7% (0·1%) in red meat consumption. These changes will be associated with 529 000 climate-related deaths worldwide (95% \{CI\} 314 000–736 000), representing a 28% (95% \{CI\} 26–33) reduction in the number of deaths that would be avoided because of changes in dietary and weight-related risk factors between 2010 and 2050. Twice as many climate-related deaths were associated with reductions in fruit and vegetable consumption than with climate-related increases in the prevalence of underweight, and most climate-related deaths were projected to occur in south and east Asia. Adoption of climate-stabilisation pathways would reduce the number of climate-related deaths by 29–71%, depending on their stringency. Interpretation The health effects of climate change from changes in dietary and weight-related risk factors could be substantial, and exceed other climate-related health impacts that have been estimated. Climate change mitigation could prevent many climate-related deaths. Strengthening of public health programmes aimed at preventing and treating diet and weight-related risk factors could be a suitable climate change adaptation strategy.

Schooling was found to respond to a broad range of determinants, including child's age and nutrition status, as well as on household consumption, on farm labour, teacher availability, and village level remoteness. Interestingly, no significant gender differences were found in terms of primary education. School meals were found to be associated with increased enrolment, attendance and attainment. The scale of the problem in Mali strongly suggests the need for investments in education and social protection to be prioritised and funded as part of national education policy and development strategies.

We found that environmental adaptability and yield stability are important attributes for farmers' choice of crop varieties. Farmers are willing to forego some extra income or yield to obtain a more stable and environmentally adaptable crop variety. Among other things, household resource endowments (particularly land holdings and livestock ownership), years of farming experience, and contact with extension services are the major factors causing household heterogeneity of crop variety preferences. Based on our experimental results, we derived important policy implications for on-farm conservation, breeding priority setting, and improved variety adoption in Ethiopia. "

However, when we account for model uncertainty, we find no evidence to suggest that the relationship between aid and growth is nonlinear.

This suggests that social spending is either positional in nature (i.e., motivated by status concerns) or subject to herding behavior. We also document systematic relations between social spending and changes in higher order terms of the income distribution. We find that the implications of status seeking for spending are not unidimensional—they vary across income groups and expenditure categories. In particular, and consistent with theories of rank-based status seeking, we find that the poor increase spending on funerals and gifts as competition for status intensifies. In addition, poor families of grooms expend more for wedding ceremonies as local income competition increases, while the families of brides do not. The welfare implications of spending in order to "keep up with the Joneses" are potentially large, particularly for poor households. "

The Scaling Up Nutrition movement has both driven, and been driven by, this developing momentum. Harmonisation has increased among stakeholders, with regard to their understanding of the main causes of malnutrition and to the various options for addressing it. The main challenges are to enhance and expand the quality and coverage of nutrition-specific interventions, and to maximise the nutrition sensitivity of more distal interventions, such as agriculture, social protection, and water and sanitation. But a crucial third level of action exists, which relates to the environments and processes that underpin and shape political and policy processes. We focus on this neglected level. We address several fundamental questions: how can enabling environments and processes be cultivated, sustained, and ultimately translated into results on the ground? How has high-level political momentum been generated? What needs to happen to turn this momentum into results? How can we ensure that high-quality, well-resourced interventions for nutrition are available to those who need them, and that agriculture, social protection, and water and sanitation systems and programmes are proactively reoriented to support nutrition goals? We use a six-cell framework to discuss the ways in which three domains (knowledge and evidence, politics and governance, and capacity and resources) are pivotal to create and sustain political momentum, and to translate momentum into results in high-burden countries.

The paper argues that while \{AET\} is conventionally viewed in terms of its role in building human and scientific capital, its also has a vital role to play in building the capacity of organisations and individuals to transmit and adapt new applications of existing information, new products and processes, and new organisational cultures and behaviours. The paper emphasizes the importance of improving \{AET\} systems by strengthening the innovative capabilities of \{AET\} organisations and professionals; changing organisational cultures, behaviours, and incentives; and building innovation networks and linkages. Specific recommendations in support of this include aligning the mandates of \{AET\} organisations with national development aspirations by promoting new educational programs that are more strategically attuned to the different needs of society; inducing change in the cultures of \{AET\} organisations through the introduction of educational programs and linkages beyond the formal \{AET\} system; and strengthening individual and organisational capacity by improving the incentives to forge stronger linkages between \{AET\} and diverse user communities, knowledge sources, and private industry.

We examine methods that address three key issues: (a) how agents interact in the production, exchange, and use of knowledge and information; (b) how agents respond individually and collectively to technological, institutional, or organizational opportunities and constraints; and (c) how policy changes can enhance the welfare effects of these interactions and responses.

Consequently, relatively well-defined sets of data need to be compiled and types of analyses used by government to generate the information needed to broadly guide efforts to prevent food price increases from becoming crises and to derive any possible benefits. International joint action can be employed profitably both to collect this data and to build national capacity to conduct the analyses needed to guide policy formulation and general program design in the face of the risks and the opportunities of higher food prices and to evaluate the effectiveness of those policy responses.

Instead it engaged in more gradual and sequenced reforms characterized by institutional innovations and partial privatization. But while the reforms coincided with a threefold increase in cotton exports in the space of a decade, there is heated debate about whether the reforms truly induced sustainable growth. In addition to reviewing existing evidence, this paper develops a counterfactual analysis to more rigorously assess the reform’s impacts after accounting for the confounding influence of exogenous shocks and centrally administered farmgate prices. The paper shows that while many elements of the reform process did achieve important economic objectives, return migration from Côte d’Ivoire explains around a third of production growth, financial elements of the reforms were not fully sustainable, and institutional arrangements failed to fully empower cotton farmers.

abstract = "Abstract Land use change in rural areas often result from the decision-making of individual farming households. It is a complex process that operates at different temporal and spatial scales through the interactions between diverse drivers. Main drivers of wetland conversion for agricultural production in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and those influencing its land use change have been explored in the past. But often the factors have not been explicitly considered in these studies. Tools and concepts that consider the decision-making processes of farmers have become common approaches used in studies to understand and explore changes in land use. This paper describes an empirical model framework to analyse land development and use processes as a result of individual farmer’s decision-making in small wetlands in SSA. The model framework uses information on the drivers of land use change, landscape classification, and household typologies. Processes of land conversion, as well as of probabilistic and heuristic decision-making were integrated in the framework. The model framework was applied to a case study on a sub-humid lowland floodplain in Tanzania, where land conversion, fallow, and use change processes are shaping the structure of the wetland. The scenario of increasing land scarcity on upland was simulated to explore how defined processes will respond to the rising pressure exerted on the wetland. Land conversion increased by 10 percent, fallow practices decreased by one-third to half. Wetland fields were defragmented due to increasing demand for crop production in the wetland. Shifts in relative distributions of farm types were simulated within and between wetland cluster groups, where all upland dependent crop-based farmers disappeared. The application revealed the potential of including individual decision-making in understanding the heterogeneity and functioning of such systems. The application possibilities and limitations of the model as well as challenges to model complex interactions in land use systems are discussed. The study raised the need to improve the means by which socio-environmental systems are anticipated and managed in the face of likely or projected changes in demography, economics, and resources at different scales.

Undernutrition is assessed with a spatial resolution of 30 arc-minutes by investigating anthropometric data on weight and length of individuals. The impact of climate change on production of six major crops (cassava, maize, wheat, sorghum, rice and millet) is analyzed with a GIS-based Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (GEPIC) model with the same spatial resolution. Future hotspots of hunger are projected in the context of the anticipated climate, social, economic, and bio-physical changes. The results show that some regions in northern and southwestern Nigeria, Sudan and Angola with a currently high number of people with undernutrition might be able to improve their food security situation mainly through increasing purchasing power. In the near future, regions located in Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, southwestern Niger, and Madagascar are likely to remain hotspots of food insecurity, while regions located in Tanzania, Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Congo might face more serious undernutrition. It is likely that both the groups of regions will suffer from lower capacity of importing food as well as lower per capita calorie availability, while the latter group will probably have sharper reduction in per capita calorie availability. Special attention must be paid to the hotspot areas in order to meet the hunger alleviation goals in SSA. "

Perhaps no country was more affected by these disruptions than Bangladesh. Our analysis shows that prior to the 2007 crisis, when Bangladesh imported an average of nearly 1 million tons of rice per year from India, domestic wholesale prices of rice in Bangladesh were co-integrated with import parity prices of subsidized Below Poverty Line (BPL) rice. When in mid-2007, India sharply curtailed exports, rice prices surged in Bangladesh. Model simulations show that a relatively small increase in private consumer stocks equivalent to about 2 weeks of normal consumption could account for the large surge in domestic prices in Bangladesh and that an additional 300,000 tons (in addition to approximately 700,000 tons of net rice distribution that actually occurred) would have been sufficient to stabilize prices in the November 2007–April 2008 period. The Bangladesh analysis thus shows that in spite of the uncertainty in international markets, careful planning, timely interventions and openness to trade can substantially reduce requirements for public stockholding.

In a program involving multiple stakeholders the information needs are diverse as are the contexts and points of decision making. For these situations a single multi-stakeholder monitoring system would be large, unwieldy and unlikely to provide timely information outputs. A practical alternative may be a network of nested monitoring systems, each owned and managed by independent agents but each selectively contributing to and accessing a common information stream and collective decision-making fora. Experience from India demonstrates that structurally such a system is dependent on nodal points for analysis and re-presentation, and niches or platforms for multi-stakeholder reaction and decision making.

The Mexican social sector is of this type, with land under individual jurisdiction allocated to either crops or pastures: the product of land in crops is privately appropriated, while land in pastures is collectively grazed. We develop a model that shows that, when cooperation fails in the management of collectively grazed pastures, more land is allocated to crops than under successful cooperation and less to pastures, while the stocking rate on pastures is increased. This results in too much land in extensive crops and too many animals per hectare of pasture—a well-known observation for Mexico. This prediction is confirmed by analysis of data from a sample of Mexican social sector households. "

Such efforts, however, have largely focused on production potential and have underemphasized economic profitability and other constraints to expansion. This paper re-estimates \{PAC\} for Africa in a more explicit economic framework that emphasizes the returns to agricultural production under a variety of assumptions, using recent geospatial data. Existing \{PAC\} estimates for Africa are shown to be highly sensitive to assumptions about land productivity and market access, and are moderately influenced by the use of alternative data sources. The region’s underutilized land resources are concentrated in relatively few countries, many of which are fragile states. Between one-half and two-thirds of the region’s surplus land is currently under forest cover; conversion of forests to cropland would entail major environmental costs. Most of the continent’s unexploited land resources are located far from input and output markets, limiting their economic attractiveness. In the long run, improvements in infrastructure and agricultural productivity and the growth of hinterland towns will enhance the economic returns to cropland expansion. In the short to medium term, however, the potential for profitable smallholder-based cropland expansion in most African countries is likely to be much more limited than it is typically perceived to be.

They are, however, largely unlicensed and unregulated leading to concern that they provide ineffective and, in some cases, even harmful care. A new and controversial policy tool that has been proposed to alter household health seeking behavior is an outright ban on these informal providers. The theoretical effects of such a ban are ambiguous. In this paper, we study the effect of a ban on informal (traditional) birth attendants imposed by the Malawi government in 2007. To measure the effect of the ban, we use a difference-in-difference strategy exploiting variation across time and space in the intensity of exposure to the ban. Our most conservative estimates suggest that the ban decreased use of traditional attendants by about 15 percentage points. Approximately three quarters of this decline can be attributed to an increase in use of the formal sector and the remainder is accounted for by an increase in relative/friend-attended births. Despite the rather large shift from the informal to the formal sector, we do not find any evidence of a statistically significant reduction in newborn mortality on average. The results are robust to a triple difference specification using young children as a control group. We examine several explanations for this result and find evidence consistent with quality of formal care acting as a constraint on improvements in newborn health. "

Study design This was designed as a substudy of a randomized, placebo-controlled, 2 × 2 factorial trial of the effects of daily supplementation with iron (12.5 mg) + folic acid (50 μg) (FeFA) with or without zinc (10 mg) (Zn) on child mortality. Subjects Zanzibari children aged 5–9 mo (n = 106) and 10–14 mo (n = 141) at baseline were included in this sub study. Outcome measures Longitudinal data on children's hemoglobin, growth, malaria infection, motor development, motor activity, and language development and caregiver behavior were used to test the fit of the theoretical model for two age groups and to examine the direct and indirect relationships among the variables in the model. Results The theoretical models were a good fit to the data for both age groups and revealed that FeFA with or without Zn had positive effects on motor development. FeFA alone had negative effects on language development in both age groups and Zn alone had negative effects on language development in children aged 10–14 mo. The incidence of malaria had negative effects on the majority of health and development outcomes in children aged 5–9 mo, and on motor development and hemoglobin in children aged 10–14 mo. Conclusions These findings illustrate how nutrition and health factors can affect different domains of development and how these changes can precipitate changes in other domains. More work is needed to better understand the multiple impacts of internal and external factors on children's development and how changes in developmental domains interact with each other over time to determine children's overall developmental trajectory.

This paper explores the socioeconomic determinants of chronic illness in Jamaica, a middle-income country where chronic diseases are the primary source of the nation's disease burden. Econometric results from a national household survey indicate that additional education significantly reduces the reporting incidence of chronic illness, with the impact especially strong among adults aged 14–49. Moreover, this relationship persists after controlling for household resources, suggesting even greater health related social benefits to education than previously considered. Finally, as in other parts of the world and for other health measures, Jamaican women report earlier and higher incidences of chronic illness, but these differences cannot be explained by differences in the level or impact of education, nor are they likely to reflect mortality selection.

The incorporation of water resources modeling into integrated assessment models (IAMs) to study climate–hydrology processes, related water impacts and adaptation options is thus an area of interest, yet it poses a number of methodological challenges. In particular, models of economic activity, climate, water availability and use, and adaptation are developed at differing temporal and spatial scales and with different goals. This makes their integration highly complex and computationally demanding. In this review we highlight a set of modeling challenges in water resource systems, describe the state of the art of approaches to integrating water resources modeling with \{IAMs\} and economic modeling, and identify constraints and opportunities moving forward in the development of water resources modeling within the \{IAM\} frameworks.

We reviewed evidence of nutritional effects of programmes in four sectors—agriculture, social safety nets, early child development, and schooling. The need for investments to boost agricultural production, keep prices low, and increase incomes is undisputable; targeted agricultural programmes can complement these investments by supporting livelihoods, enhancing access to diverse diets in poor populations, and fostering women's empowerment. However, evidence of the nutritional effect of agricultural programmes is inconclusive—except for vitamin A from biofortification of orange sweet potatoes—largely because of poor quality evaluations. Social safety nets currently provide cash or food transfers to a billion poor people and victims of shocks (eg, natural disasters). Individual studies show some effects on younger children exposed for longer durations, but weaknesses in nutrition goals and actions, and poor service quality probably explain the scarcity of overall nutritional benefits. Combined early child development and nutrition interventions show promising additive or synergistic effects on child development—and in some cases nutrition—and could lead to substantial gains in cost, efficiency, and effectiveness, but these programmes have yet to be tested at scale. Parental schooling is strongly associated with child nutrition, and the effectiveness of emerging school nutrition education programmes needs to be tested. Many of the programmes reviewed were not originally designed to improve nutrition yet have great potential to do so. Ways to enhance programme nutrition-sensitivity include: improve targeting; use conditions to stimulate participation; strengthen nutrition goals and actions; and optimise women's nutrition, time, physical and mental health, and empowerment. Nutrition-sensitive programmes can help scale up nutrition-specific interventions and create a stimulating environment in which young children can grow and develop to their full potential. "

Studies have identified linkages between the usage of feedstocks in biofuel production and international food price increases. In addition, these studies indicate that food prices are expected to continue to rise over the next decade in response to biofuel consumption targets adopted in the U.S. and E.U. Despite these indications, some countries for whom food security and poverty reduction are still an issue have initiated crop-based biofuel development and set forth national blending targets for energy use within the transportation sector. As a result, a broader examination of the tradeoffs concerning welfare and food security related to biofuel development merit consideration. Opportunities to generate income and expand agricultural production technology through biofuel development may provide welfare gains that can improve purchasing power and decrease vulnerability to price shocks for food and energy. In addition, biofuel production schemes that promote alternative energy sources for household uses can improve productivity and health, especially for women and children. To assist with the sector development that maximizes welfare gains, we suggest a number of key indicators that might be useful in constructing a typology that can be applied across countries to characterize their energy needs and better target the types of bioenergy uses that might be best suited for them. In addition, biofuel production models are reviewed and best-practices identified that can expand welfare gains for smallholders and the poor. Through these examples, we demonstrate a basis upon which policymakers might approach the prioritization of their national strategies towards developing renewable energy sources, such that they can have the maximum impact upon important goals of human welfare and development.

Such re-aggregations are typically made using expert judgments or simple area-weighting rules. We describe a new, entropy-based approach to making spatially disaggregated assessments of the distribution of crop production. Using this approach, tabular crop production statistics are blended judiciously with an array of other secondary data to assess the production of specific crops within individual ‘pixels’ – typically 25–100 square kilometers in size. The information utilized includes crop production statistics, farming system characteristics, satellite-derived land cover data, biophysical crop suitability assessments, and population density. An application is presented in which Brazilian state level production statistics are used to generate pixel level crop production data for eight crops. To validate the spatial allocation we aggregated the pixel estimates to obtain synthetic estimates of municipality level production in Brazil, and compared those estimates with actual municipality statistics. The approach produced extremely promising results. We then examined the robustness of these results compared to short-cut approaches to allocating crop production statistics and showed that, while computationally intensive, the cross-entropy method does provide more reliable estimates of crop production patterns.

The current crisis involving traditional control/eradication methods has broadened the search for feasible and effective malaria control strategies—a search that necessarily includes an investigation of the roles of a series of individual and community-level socioeconomic characteristics in determining malaria prevalence rates, and the proper methods of estimating these links. In addition, social scientists and policy makers alike know very little about the economic costs associated with malarial infections. In this paper, I use survey data from several Brazilian gold mining areas to (a) test the general reliability of malaria-related questionnaire response data, and suggest categorization methods to minimize the statistical influence of exaggerated responses, (b) estimate three statistical models aimed at detecting the socioeconomic determinants of individual malaria prevalence rates, and (c) calculate estimates of the average cost of a single bout of malaria. The results support the general reliability of survey response data gathered in conjunction with malaria research. Once the effects of vector exposure were controlled for, individual socioeconomic characteristics were only weakly linked to malaria prevalence rates in these very special miners' communities. Moreover, the socioeconomic and exposure links that were significant did not depend on the measure of malaria adopted. Finally, individual costs associated with malarial infections were found to be a significant portion of miners' incomes. "

Results show that no individual sector's growth acceleration is sufficient for Ghana to reach \{MIC\} status by 2015. Manufacturing growth is constrained by its high dependency on agricultural inputs indicating the need for diversification. Services can support rather than drive economy-wide growth. Agriculture must remain the mainstay of economy-wide growth. While this will delay structural change in sectoral composition, it demonstrates that emphasizing agriculture is a viable option for some countries to reach \{MIC\} status. "

Using econometric approaches, we observed that achievement of zero net degradation is possible, even in developing regions, if land users are provided with good market access and secure land rights and if institutions are strengthened to regulate land use. Such achievement is possible, even in densely populated and severely impoverished areas. The probability of achieving zero net land degradation is greater in drylands – especially among communities with pastoral and other livestock-based livelihoods. "

This article presents a framework for understanding the role of property rights for effective irrigation systems and then explores the complexity of property rights to land, water, and infrastructure and their underlying institutions. Understanding property rights in practice requires acknowledging legal pluralism—the coexistence of many types and sources of law, which can be used as the basis for claiming rights over the resources. Property rights do not necessarily imply full ownership, but are composed of different bundles of rights that may be held by different claimants—the state, user groups, families, or individuals. These rights are critical for the authority, incentives, and resources for irrigation operation and maintenance. As resources become more scarce, property rights systems need to adapt to reduce conflict and provide incentives for saving water. However, efforts to improve irrigation by changing property rights systems have often failed because they have not recognized the difficulty of transplanting property rights systems from one place to another. Institutional change needs to be seen as an organic process, building on existing norms and practices, rather than as an exercise in social engineering. "

Second, school quality, measured by the learner–educator ratio, improves as school fee and government subsidy increase. In this sense, school fee can be decreased with an increase in government subsidy to maintain school quality. It is also shown that government subsidy is allocated to schools with lower quality and fees, increasing the number of subsidized teachers. To address the current imbalance, financial support to disadvantaged locales and schools should be strengthened further. "

We apply an endogenous double hurdle model to a pseudo-panel and cross-section data of farm households. The methodology accounts for potential endogeneity of commercial fertilizer price with subsidy. Our specification is also appropriate where few farmers report the use of both subsidized and commercial fertilizer. We find that 100 kg of subsidized fertilizer supplied to a farm household reduced the probability of its participation into commercial fertilizer market by 10–21% points, while not affecting fertilizer use upon participation.

Comparing historical evidence from the Green Revolution with recent evidence from the emerging era of agricultural biotechnology, this review argues that a more pluralistic international system for agricultural research will be more responsive to poverty only if the strategic leadership role of the public sector is strengthened, certain research functions are reallocated to the private sector, and new policy and organizational mechanisms are used to stimulate pro-poor research in and for developing-country agriculture.

There is scope for better targeting these food subsidies, in particular for targeting cooking oil and sugar ration cards, both because reforms in this area are perceived to be far less politically sensitive than adjusting subsidy policy for bread and wheat flour and because higher income groups presently receive a significant percentage of the benefits. Targeting the high-subsidy green ration cards to the poor and the low-subsidy red ration cards to the nonpoor will require identification of both poor and nonpoor households. An International Food Policy Research Institute research team in Egypt, in collaboration with the Egyptian Ministry of Trade and Supply, developed a proxy means test for targeting ration cards. The paper describes the process of moving from the optimal income-predicting model to the final model that was both administratively and politically feasible. An ex-ante evaluation of the levels of accuracy of the proxy means testing model indicates that the model performs quite well in predicting the needy and nonneedy households. An effective and full implementation of this targeting method would increase the equity in the ration card food subsidy system, and, at the same time, the total budgetary costs of rationed food subsidies would decline. Moreover, the experience gained under this reform would facilitate targeting future social interventions to reduce and prevent poverty in Egypt. "

In the past, government has targeted their resources mostly to the high-potential or irrigated areas. These investments have generated rapid growth in agricultural production (for example, the so-called green revolution in South and Southeast Asia in the 1970s and 1980s), which in turn has helped to alleviate rural and urban poverty. However, as investments continue to increase in these favored areas, their marginal returns have begun to decline, and environmental problems are emerging. Evidence shows that it is in the marginal areas (or less-favored areas) where many investments may have higher returns today. These investments may have even larger impacts on poverty reduction and environmental protection, as poor people are increasingly concentrated in the marginal areas, where natural resources have already been severely degraded. This study synthesizes some recent studies from India and China on the relative returns to investments in favored and less-favored areas, and presents some preliminary evidence from Uganda, and offers some policy implications for Africa on how governments and international donors can reprioritize their investment portfolio in order to achieve multiple goals of growth, poverty reduction, and environmental protection.

These include expanding or intensifying cereal crop production, mixed cereals/livestock, cereals/perennials, cereals/perishable annuals, cereals/non-farm employment, and in Honduras, cereals/forestry activities. These pathways were largely determined by four types of factors affecting local comparative advantages: agricultural potential, access to markets and roads, population density, and presence of programs and organizations. Adoption of improved land management was higher and productivity, resource and welfare outcomes were better in the pathways associated with higher value crop production or non-farm employment. In less-favored environments where such pathways have less potential, other development pathways should be facilitated and improved. Opportunities for socially profitable investments have been shown to exist even in less-favored environments, but these need to be tailored to the different comparative advantages of these areas. "

I find that there are almost no \{GM\} labelled products in France and non-GM labelled products in Canada. Each policy tends to crowd out the targeted label attribute. However, Canadian consumers can choose between \{GM\} and non-GM organic products, whereas there are only non-GM products in French supermarkets.

We used these to develop global and local models of poverty prevalence. In our global spatial error model, only eight of 24 determinants selected for analysis proved significant. In contrast, all determinants considered were significant in at least some of the local models developed using geographically weighted regression. Moreover, these models provided strong evidence of the spatial non-stationarity of the relationship between poverty and its determinants.

However, the dependence of modern seed-fertilizer technology on irrigation and fertilizer, which are subject to unreliable supply, may contribute to increased variability in production. This paper examines this issue using an irrigation system simulation model to analyze the impact of irrigation on the variability in area, yield, production, and farm income in diversion irrigation systems in the Philippines. The results show that irrigation more than doubles crop-year rice production and income. However, because of the dependence of diversion irrigation systems on highly variable dry-season streamflow, irrigated dry-season production and income are highly variable compared with those of wet-season rainfed production. On a crop-year basis, production and income variability under irrigated conditions are slightly higher than under rainfed conditions. Although improved management of irrigation systems can reduce income and production disparities among farmers within the system, it has little impact on system-wide variability. Investments in irrigation infrastructure and management are not substitutes for other policies that will offset the adverse effects of production instability, such as buffer stock or import management.

Capture could be successfully constrained through a combination of media programs and monitoring. Intensive monitoring and access to media reduce capture. However, the impact of media is conditional on characteristics of the population. With high illiteracy in poor regions, the effectiveness of newspaper and poster campaigns is limited, and radio and television programs are more important to reduce capture. "

This paper sets out to answer this controversial question using panel data from 63 developing countries over 1970–1996. This paper gives evidence in support of a statistically significant and strong positive impact of national food availability on child nutrition, finding that increased food supplies have resulted in significant reductions in malnutrition since the 1970s despite population increases over the period. However, per-capita food supplies have a declining marginal impact: their effect is quite strong for countries with very low food availability (e.g., most countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia), but weak or non-existent for those with high levels (e.g., most countries in the Near East and North Africa). Further, non-food factors, such as women’s education and status and the quality of health environments, are also important determinants of children’s nutritional status. Depending on the state of food availability in any particular geographic area and relative costs, these factors may merit greater priority in policies to reduce malnutrition. "

As development of technology, infrastructure, or markets increase the relative return to investment in man-made capital over natural capital, resource depletion occurs as man-made capital is substituted for lower return natural capital. Once returns are equalized, both man-made and natural capital are accumulated. If labor and these forms of capital are complementary, the output effects outweigh the substitution effects in the long run, leading to net accumulation of natural as well as man-made capital as a result of such technological or market development. Population growth also induces investment in both man-made and natural resource capital in the long run by increasing their marginal products. However, population growth causes declining per capita levels of both natural and man-made capital and production per capita in the long run, if technology is fixed and decreasing returns to scale. The model thus supports the Boserupian argument of induced intensification and resource improvement, as well as the Malthusian argument of the impoverishing effects of population growth. However, population growth may also induce development of infrastructure, markets, and technological or institutional innovation by reducing the fixed costs per capita of these changes, though these developments may not occur automatically. Government policies can play a large role in affecting whether these potential benefits of population growth are realized. In addition, credit policies may reduce resource degradation caused by substitution of man-made for natural capital, by allowing farmers to accumulate man-made capital (such as fertilizers) without depleting their natural capital. Policies to internalize the external environmental costs of using man-made capital will reduce both types of capital and production, indicating a clear trade-off between addressing environmental concerns on the one hand and reducing poverty and promoting resource conservation investments on the other. By contrast, internalizing the external benefits of investments in resources increases wealth and production per capita in the long run. The `intertemporal externality' due to a higher private than social rate of time preference does not justify interventions to promote investments in resource capital; rather it argues for the promotion of savings and investment in general.

The achievements of Asian developing countries under the adverse external conditions of the 1980s are discussed in terms of their macroeconomic and agricultural growth, the commodity structure of agricultural growth, their food production and trade, the expansion and diversification of their agricultural exports, and the policy and nonpolicy factors affecting them. Special attention is given to the role of policy reforms implemented in China and the South Asian countries, following similar policy developments in Northeast and Southeast Asia in the 1960s and 1970s, toward greater openness in their trade regime and increased private-sector participation in the economy. These reforms have contributed to the observed acceleration in GDP, agricultural, and export growth in the 1980s. However, macroeconomic imbalances have emerged that threaten the sustainability of economic liberalization in those countries. The major challenges for the 1990s also differ among the Asian developing countries. In the industrially advanced Northeast economics of Taiwan and South Korea, the primary need is to ease the transition of the remaining rural population as farm incomes continue to fall and workers move to industrial and service activities.

It estimates the magnitude of the impact of these reforms on rice production, the most important crop in Bangladesh agriculture. It is estimated that the production of rice could have been 20–32% lower than the level of 1992/1993, depending on the rice price that would have prevailed under alternative scenarios. The 20% credit to market reform relates to a real rice price level 19% higher than the actual 1992/1993 prices. The 32% credit to reform relates to the actual 1992/1993 price levels. The lower contribution of reform (20%) to increased production implies a loss to consumers not accounted for in the production benefit of reform, while the higher contribution (32%) of reform entails no loss to consumers. The bottom-line conclusion is that Bangladesh, without the market reforms described in the paper, would have reverted back to the situation of regular food crisis and high rice prices, as was the case historically. The analysis of the process of reform provides interesting lessons for developing countries. A gradual process based on a well-designed sequencing of various steps of market reform, particularly in the case of fertilizer, was a crucial factor for success. Careful monitoring during the period of transition is another crucial factor that has to be institutionalized in the system. Second generation problems of market reforms, particularly the emergence of an oligopolistic market structure, are possible and warrant a cautionary watch. "

This paper considers how the provision of financial audit services for agricultural cooperatives can be strengthened. We assess the current status of agricultural cooperatives in the country and the demand and supply of financial audit services for them. We then review the approaches taken in 11 other countries for providing financial audit services to agricultural cooperatives in order to identify approaches Ethiopian agricultural cooperatives might consider. Insights are gained on the need for capacity building within cooperatives on financial oversight, building internal incentives for cooperatives to have conducted regular financial audits on their accounts, addressing the deficit of auditors within Ethiopia, and creating reporting mechanisms so that any emerging financial problems within a cooperative are made known and addressed in a timely manner.

The formalization of property rights has historically led to a cutting of this web, creating more exclusive forms of rights over the resource.

By collapsing all rights within individuals, such programs have negated the distinct multiple claims by women, youths, and seasonal users, among others.

This finding derives from the confluence of several complementary factors:• Rates of micronutrient malnutrition are high in developing countries, as are the consequent costs to human welfare and economic productivity. • Because staple foods are eaten in large quantities every day by the malnourished poor, delivery of enriched staple foods (fortified by the plants themselves during growth) can rely on existing consumer behavior. • A significant percentage of the soils in which these staple foods are grown are `deficient' in these micronutrient metals, which has kept crop yields low. In general, these soils in fact contain relatively high total amounts of micronutrient metals. However, because of binding to soil constituents, these nutrients have poor soil availability to staple crop varieties that are currently available to farmers. • Adoption and spread of nutritionally-improved varieties by farmers can rely on profit incentives, either because of agronomic advantages on trace mineral-deficient soils or incorporation of nutritional improvements in the most productive varieties being released by agricultural research stations. • Benefits to relatively small investments in agricultural research may be disseminated widely, potentially accruing to hundreds of millions of people and millions of hectares of cropland. • Benefits from breeding advances, derived from initial, fixed costs, typically do not involve high recurring costs, and thus tend to be highly sustainable as long as an effective domestic agricultural research infrastructure is maintained.

Despite best practices intending to standardize the definition of the household, it is unclear which types of definitions or which intersections of keywords in a definition result in different household compositions. This paper conducts a randomized survey experiment of four different household definitions in Mali to examine the implications for household-level statistics. This approach permits analysis of the trade-offs between alternative definition types. We find that additional keywords in definitions increase rather than decrease household size and significantly alters household composition. Definitions emphasizing common consumption or joint production increase estimates of the levels of household assets and consumption statistics, but not on per adult equivalency asset and consumption statistics, relative to open-ended definitions of the household. In contrast, definition type did not affect production statistics in levels, though we observe significant differences in per adult equivalency terms. Our findings suggest that variations in household definition have implications for measuring household welfare and production. "

In documenting the impact of an external shock to observed reciprocity, this paper shows that small increases in non-reciprocal behavior result in an unraveling of the norm of reciprocity. Survey data is used to explore mechanisms by which this occurred. Results are not consistent with learning effects, suggesting that preferences may be changed by observing others deviating from a norm of reciprocity.

We exploit the fact that some beneficiaries who received transfers did not receive the forms needed to monitor the attendance of their children at school. We use a variety of techniques, including nearest neighbor matching and household fixed effects regressions, to show that the absence of these forms reduced the likelihood that children attended school with this effect most pronounced when children are transitioning to lower secondary school.

We randomized the content of training provided to group leaders, with some sessions focusing on the benefits of informally sharing idiosyncratic basis risk. Consistent with learning informed by the theoretical results, we found that members of groups whose leaders had received training that emphasized risk-sharing had considerably higher uptake. We find that this effect can be explained either by a more careful selection of training participants by leaders or a direct impact of the treatment on insurance demand. "

The main results of the simulations are: (1) the 1990 liberalization has had a beneficial impact on the incomes of small farmers who adopted a `vegetable pathway'; (2) the shift from extensive production to intensive vegetable production does not reduce erosion, as the greater opportunity cost of labor increased the cost of investing in land conservation; and (3) small farmers are more likely than ranchers to erode soils, because they are more likely to produce vegetables during the rainy season and usually cultivate steeper slopes.

Relief was provided by the government as well as local and international aid agencies. Aid was more likely in areas with a higher need for relief, in more easily accessible communes and in cyclone-affected communes with higher radio coverage and stronger political support for the government. Compared to relief provided by the government, aid by agencies was less affected by media or political factors, but more likely to go to poorer and more easily accessible communes, unconditional on impact.

We find that elimination of agricultural import tariffs hurts both agricultural and non-agricultural households, via adverse factor-market effects, but impacts vary substantially by workers’ gender and country of origin.

The subsidies enhance food security but are nontargeted and have substantial leakages. This paper uses a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to simulate the short-run effects of alternative food-subsidy scenarios. Government savings from reduced spending finance uniform cuts in direct tax rates across all household types. The model uses a 1996/97 database with detailed household information. The targeting of cooking oil and sugar subsidies to “the needy” (the bottom two quintiles in rural and urban areas) has a progressive effect while elimination of this subsidy is regressive. Disaggregated household consumption changes are small (±0.3 percent). The targeting of all food subsidies is pro-needy, partly due to important indirect effects. The consumption of the needy increases by 0.5 percent with little change for the nonneedy. Food subsidy elimination is regressive: the needy suffer a consumption loss of 1.1 percent. If the government savings instead are transferred to the needy, the impact is reversed: consumption increases by 4.2 percent for needy households while the nonneedy register a small loss. The overall policy implication is that food subsidy reform can benefit the needy with at worst only a modest negative impact on the nonneedy. If the subsidy is entirely eliminated, targeted government programs would be necessary to protect the needy from the negative impact. "

Such re-aggregations are typically made using expert judgments or simple area-weighting rules. We describe a new, entropy-based approach to the plausible estimates of the spatial distribution of crop areas. Using this approach tabular crop production statistics are blended judiciously with an array of other secondary data to assess the areas of specific crops within individual ‘pixels’—typically 25–100 km2 in size. The information utilized includes crop production statistics, farming system characterization, satellite-based interpretation of land cover, biophysical crop suitability assessments, and population density. An application is presented in which Brazilian state level production statistics are used to generate pixel level crop area data for eight crops. To validate the spatial allocation we aggregated the pixel estimates to obtain synthetic estimates of municipality level areas in Brazil, and compared those estimates with actual municipality statistics. The approach produced extremely promising results. We then examined the robustness of these results compared to simplified approaches to spatializing crop production statistics and showed that, while computationally intensive, the cross-entropy method does provide more reliable spatial allocations.

However, a severe and long-lasting Asian crisis can have a relatively large impact on world livestock markets with China and several Southeast Asian countries shifting from import to export positions in livestock.

If these trends continue unabated, the world will not be a pleasant place to live for most of humanity. The International Food Policy Research Institute has developed a 2020 Vision of a world where every person has economic and physical access to sufficient food to sustain a healthy and productive life, where malnutrition is absent, and where food originates from efficient, effective, and low-cost food and agricultural systems that are compatible with sustainable use and management of natural resources. With foresight and decisive action, we can create the conditions that will permit this vision to be realized by 2020. There are several challenges to assuring food security and sustainable use of natural resources: (i) widespread poverty and inadequate human resource development, which inhibit people's capacity to grow and/or purchase the needed food; (ii) large increases in developing-country populations, especially in urban areas, which will substantially increase food needs; (iii) gross under-investment in agricultural research in developing countries and inadequacies in availability of and access to agricultural inputs–such as water, fertilizer, pesticides, energy, research, and technology, which leads to lagging yield increases in more-favored areas and low and variable yields in less-favored areas; (iv) degradation of natural resources—such as soils, forests, marine fisheries, and water—which undermines production capacity; (v) inefficient functioning of markets and inadequate infrastructure as well as weakened capacity of developing-country governments to perform their appropriate functions; and (vi) insufficient domestic resource mobilization—savings and investment—and declining international assistance, which restrains economic growth and development. These challenges can be overcome and the 2020 Vision of food security and sustainable use of natural resources realized if all relevant parties—individuals, households, farmers, local communities, civil society, private sector, national governments, and the international community—take appropriate action and change their behavior, priorities, and policies. Priority actions include investing more in poor people, accelerating agricultural productivity, assuring sound management of natural resources, strengthening the capacity of developing-country governments to perform appropriate functions, and expanding and realigning international development assistance. The world's natural resources are capable of supporting the 2020 Vision, if current rates of degradation are reduced and replaced by appropriate technological change and sustainable use of natural resources.

The types identified in the lab also behave differently at home. For those who behave opportunistically in the lab, greater knowledge about finances at home is associated with worse opportunism in the lab, suggesting that for these couples complete information at home is not due to trust but rather is an endogenous response to non-cooperative behavior. The paper highlights that allowing for heterogeneous types changes the conclusions we draw about appropriate models of the household and suggests that laboratory games can be used to identify household types useful in the interpretation of field data.

The path toward sustainable food security and nutrition is often riddled with inaccurate and oversimplified beliefs regarding the requirements and impacts of such a strategy. This includes the belief that trade-offs are inevitable when linking environmental sustainability with food security and nutrition strategies—which means that stakeholders have to prioritize one area at the expense of the other. Likewise, policymakers and researchers alike often make inaccurate assumptions about technological innovations, gender, biofuels, and smallholder farming. Such sustainable food security and nutrition “myths” pose a significant challenge to the effective design and promotion of more environmentally-friendly agricultural and food systems. This paper will explore the myths and realities surrounding the relationship between environmental sustainability, food security, and nutrition. It will focus on debunking some of the common myths that hamper sustainable food security and nutrition efforts and will highlight actions that can mutually reinforce food security, nutrition, and environmental sustainability. Providing the world's growing population with a more secure and sustainable supply of nutritious food is possible but not automatic and requires an accurate and comprehensive understanding of the dynamics surrounding sustainable food security and nutrition pathways.

Public, private, and civil society actors involved in shaping policy designs have, in turn, developed competing narratives around how best to build an innovative and sustainable seed system, each with varying goals, values, and levels of influence. Efforts to strike a balance between these narratives have often played out in passionate discourses surrounding seed rules and regulations. As a result, however, policymakers in many countries have expressed impatience with the slow progress on enhancing the contribution of a modern seed industry to the overarching goal of increasing agricultural productivity growth. One reason for this slow progress may be that policymakers are insufficiently cognizant of the trade-offs associated with rules and regulations required to effectively govern a modern seed industry. This suggests the need for new data and analysis to improve the understanding of how seed systems function. This paper explores these issues in the context of Asia's rapidly growing seed industry, with illustrations from seed markets for maize and several other crops, to highlight current gaps in the metrics used to analyze performance, competition, and innovation. The paper provides a finite set of indicators to inform policymaking on seed system design and monitoring, and explores how these indicators can be used to inform current policy debates in the region.

The debate on \{GMO\} is intense as there are significant economic stakes for private firms that market this technology and significant political stakes for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that oppose its use. Government agencies and scientific researchers also have considerable interest in the outcome of the debate, and one would not expect them to be neutral observers. The main protagonists in the debate include the firms which are developing and introducing the new technology, the corporations that market and process the crops, and those that sell the food at retail. They are joined by a various consumer and environmental groups, who often pool ideas and collaborate to slow down their implementation. Government departments and food and environmental agencies are also players in the game, as are international bureaucrats. Somewhere caught in the middle are farmers, cautious about growing crops that some consumers mistrust but eager to adopt cost-saving technology, particularly if it is available to competitors; consumers bewildered by the variety of opinions emanating from public and private agencies; and developing country governments concerned with the perceived over-regulation or oligopolistic control of the technology.

abstract = "Summary As countries experience economic growth and choose among available development pathways, they are in a favorable position to adopt natural resource use technologies and production practices that favor efficient use of inputs, healthy soils, and ecosystems. Current emphasis on increasing resilience to climate change and reducing agricultural greenhouse gasses (GHG) emissions strengthens the support for sustainable agricultural production. In fact, reducing losses in soil fertility, reclaiming degraded lands, and promoting synergistic interaction between crop production and forests are generally seen as good climate change policies. In order for decision-makers to develop long-term policies that address these issues, they must have tools at their disposal that evaluate trade-offs, opportunities, and repercussions of the options considered. In this paper, the authors combine and reconcile the output of three models widely accessible to the public to analyze the impacts of policies that target emission reduction in the agricultural sector. We present an application to Colombia which reveals the importance of considering the full scope of interactions among the various land uses. Results indicate that investments in increasing the efficiency and productivity of the livestock sector and reducing land allocated to pasture are preferable to policies that target deforestation alone or target a reduction of emissions in crop production. Investments in livestock productivity and land-carrying capacity would reduce deforestation and provide sufficient gains in carbon stock to offset greater emissions from increased crop production while generating higher revenues.

Participation in cash crop schemes resulted in increases in household income. Short-term increases in household income did not result in a decrease in the incidence of illness in preschool-aged children nor in the total time that preschoolers were ill. Increases in household income did result in increases in the preschooler's energy consumption; however, the income/calorie consumption links, although significant, were weak. The household income gains did not have an immediate or large impact on preschooler nutritional status. While, in the longer term, increases in income may bring about improvements in preschooler health, in the short term, it appears that increases in income must be accompanied by improvements in the health environment in order to have a significant effect in reducing preschooler morbidity and improving child nutritional status.

We address two key questions: (a) How well does PROGRESA's targeting perform; and (b) How does the program perform in terms of its impact on poverty alleviation relative to other feasible methods and transfer schemes. The first question is accomplished by comparing PROGRESA's method to an alternative selection method based on household consumption, which is our preferred measure of welfare. We employ the concepts of undercoverage and leakage and find that \{PROGRESA\} selection method is more effective in identifying the extremely poor localities or households but less so when it comes to distinguishing among localities or households in the middle of the scale. To address the second question, we compare the potential impact of \{PROGRESA\} on poverty alleviation against uniform transfers that involve no targeting at all, targeting based on consumption, and geographic targeting (i.e., targeting at the locality level rather than at the household level). We find that PROGRESA's method of targeting households outperforms uniform coverage and targeting at the locality level in terms of reducing the poverty gap and severity of poverty indices, even after taking into account the economic costs of targeting. But, the closeness of PROGRESA's performance to what could be achieved by geographic targeting alone raises some serious questions about the costs and benefits associated with the practice of household targeting within poor localities.

This paper asks whether these changes are linked to the development of dietary patterns associated with cardiovascular and other diet-related chronic diseases. Methods Data on agricultural production are collated and presented, and the literature on agricultural policy in Latin America reviewed and synthesized. Results Globally, agricultural production has risen for all major food groups in the past 25 years, but the rate of increase has been much faster for foods associated with cardiovascular and other diet-related chronic diseases, both in negative and positive directions. Latin America is a major producer of vegetable oils, meat and fish, and also of sugar and fruit. Agricultural policy in the region underwent a major paradigm shift in the early 1990s, moving from production-led to market-led policies as part of globalization. The food-consuming industries (distributors, manufacturers, processors and retailers) played a key role in this dynamic. Case studies from Brazil, Colombia and Chile show that these agricultural policy changes are linked to changing consumption patterns of soybean oil, chicken and beef, and fruit. Thus by facilitating greater consumption of specific foods, these changes in agricultural production and policy can be linked with the “nutrition transition”. They also reflect a response to changing food demand. Conclusions Agricultural policies can affect the relative availability and price of different foods relative to others. Changes in agricultural production and policies can therefore be associated with dietary changes; historically, these have had both positive and negative implications for cardiovascular health. Governments in Latin America could use agricultural and food policies to promote cardiovascular health by creating incentives for the agricultural sector and the food-consuming industries to produce a food supply aligned with dietary guidelines.

The analysis is based on data from eight different national household surveys that used a two-stage sampling design (households within clusters). Spatial clustering was assessed using the intracluster correlation coefficient (ρ), which may be interpreted as the expected correlation between any randomly selected pair of observations drawn from the same cluster. In general, per capita expenditure and the share of the household budget spent on food showed relatively high spatial clustering across the seven cities, but the magnitude of this clustering varied markedly from city to city. Spatial clustering in the provision of basic services also varied greatly. There was consistently little evidence of spatial clustering of infectious disease, childhood mortality, or the weight-based nutrition indicators. Age-standardized height, on the other hand, showed a little more spatial clustering, with a median intracluster correlation of ρ=0.12. Some cities showed relatively higher levels of spatial clustering on several measures of deprivation simultaneously, while other cities showed consistently lower levels of clustering. Many nutrition interventions are intrinsically geographically targeted. While geographical targeting tends to be administratively simpler than individual targeting and can be politically convenient, the current analysis suggests that where nutrition interventions are focused on stunting (low height-for-age), targeting by neighborhood may often lead to unacceptably high rates of undercoverage and leakage of benefits to the non-needy.

In addition to an array of public policy instruments, the analysis evaluates the impact of two key private sector responses in moderating food consumption volatility – private cross-border maize trade and consumer substitution of an alternate food staple (cassava) for maize. The analysis suggests that, given a favorable policy environment, private imports and increased cassava consumption together could fill roughly two-thirds of the maize consumption shortfall facing vulnerable households during drought years.

Because of low entry barriers, the number of firms in the cluster has risen, driving down profits and bidding up wages, particularly since the year 2000.

As a result, African governments are often provided conflicting recommendations on the importance of rural agriculture or urban industry. We develop dynamic economywide models for Ethiopia and Uganda that capture both traditional aspects of the debate (growth linkages and foreign trade) and benefits from urbanization (internal migration and agglomeration effects). Simulations suggest that urban agglomeration is an important source of long-term growth and structural transformation, but that investing in cities does not greatly reduce national poverty over the short-term. In this regard, agricultural growth is more effective, albeit with slower national growth. Given these trade-offs, we conclude that, while urbanization’s benefits argue against an “agro-fundamentalist” approach to African development, the short-term imperative of reducing poverty necessitates further agricultural investment.

Coffee markets in Ethiopia present an interesting case study due to the high price and quality differentiation linked to a number of both easily and not so easily observable characteristics. Moreover, modern marketing practices, such as modern retail, branding and packaging, are becoming increasingly common in Ethiopia’s urban coffee markets. When we define and examine trustworthiness in the Addis Ababa coffee market as a function of weights and quality, we find that traditional traders are relatively trustworthy on observable quality characteristics and weights. However, there is a consistent pattern of over-representation of not so easily verifiable quality characteristics. We further find that modern marketing outlets or formats, including modern domestic retail and branded packaged products, deliver higher quality at a higher price, but are not more trustworthy than traditional marketing arrangements in terms of these dimensions of trade transactions.

As a consequence, the potential payoffs to economy-wide reforms, even defined narrowly in terms of domestic food availability, dwarf more targeted attempts to raise agricultural productivity. To many, this finding—that a famine might be better addressed by the export of manufactures than the recovery of flood-damaged lands—is a striking and counterintuitive result.

Agricultural growth has been driven by larger-scale farmers who are less likely to be poor; and has been concentrated among crops grown in specific regions of the country. Slow expansion of food crops and livestock also explain the weak relationship between agricultural growth and nutrition outcomes. We find that accelerating agricultural growth, particularly in maize, strengthens the growth–poverty relationship and enhances households’ caloric availability, while also contributing significantly to growth itself.

Growth decomposition analysis identifies technology adoption as the most important determinant of rice yield growth during 1978–1984, accounting for nearly 40 percent the change; institutional reform accounted for 35 percent of the growth. In 1985–1990, technology accounts for all of the increase in rice yields. The study demonstrates earlier studies may have over-estimated the impact of decollectivization. "

No quantitative evidence on the relationship between land use diversity and natural enemies has been reported from developing countries, where fields and farms are much smaller than in modernized agriculture in the west, and where insecticide use is often high and indiscriminate. This paper examines the effects of land use and farmers’ insecticide application on natural enemies of aphids in cotton production, based on a unique dataset that links household and cotton field surveys to a detailed assessment of land uses in the landscapes surrounding the cotton fields in the North China Plain (NCP), a major grain and cotton production region in China. Our results show that, in the \{NCP\} where farms are small and landscape is dominated by a few crops, Shannon or Simpson land use diversity index is not a good indicator for explaining the relationship between land use and densities of aphid natural enemies. Instead, the types and proportions of cropland habitat mattered. Landscapes with more maize and grassland have higher ladybeetle populations in cotton fields. Farmers’ pest management practices such as the amount and timing of insecticide use significantly affect ladybeetle densities. These results imply that there is a need to recognize the potential positive role of cropland use in pest management and call for more judicious insecticide use strategies by smallholder farmers in the North China Plain.

More than 70% of Africa’s poor live in rural areas and mostly depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. As a result, agricultural development is key to ending poverty on the continent. Many development organizations have recently proposed to significantly increase investments in irrigation in the region. However, the potential for irrigation investments in Africa is highly dependent upon geographic, hydrologic, agronomic, and economic factors that need to be taken into account when assessing the long-term viability and sustainability of planned projects. This paper analyzes the large, dam-based and small-scale irrigation investment potential in Africa based on agronomic, hydrologic, and economic factors. We find significant profitable irrigation potential for both small-scale and large-scale systems. This type of regional analysis can guide distribution of investment funds across countries and should be a first step prior to in-depth country- and local-level assessment of irrigation potential, which will be important to agricultural and economic development in Africa.

Analyzing case studies of six Asian countries, which have tried to tackle the task in different ways with varying degrees of success, eight key lessons can be learned from the more than three decades of food price stabilization in Asia. Times have changed: policies and public agencies that may have been appropriate 30 years ago are not optimal today.

Through applying the theories of farming systems evolution and of induced innovation in technical change, this paper shows that demand for certain mechanized farming operations particularly plowing has emerged even among smallholders, suggesting that supply issues may now be the main constraint to successful mechanization. We therefore adopt a supply chain approach to analyze two types of mechanization practices in Ghana, i.e., a recent state-led mechanization program and the private sector-led service hiring market, against an international perspective by drawing on three Asian supply models. We identify two major flaws in existing policies. First, the agricultural mechanization service centers that the government promotes fail to use tractors services with sufficient intensity. Second, direct importation of agricultural machinery by the government inhibits imports of appropriate and affordable machinery. In contrast, the development of mechanized service hiring market in which medium and large scale farmers who are tractor owners provide hiring-out services to small-scale farmers represents a promising model for sustainable mechanization in Ghana. This private sector-led second model is consistent with international experiences. "

Since it is costly to monitor hired labourers in agriculture, small-scale farms dependent on family labour are more efficient than large farms relying on hired labour. This leads to the inverse relationship between farm size and productivity, if land markets do not reallocate land. When the wage rate increases, labour-saving and machine-using production methods become efficient. If machinery and land are complementary and machines are indivisible to some extent, large-scale mechanized farms become more efficient, which tends to weaken the inverse farm size-productivity relationship. This article argues that if small-scale farms continue to dominate in the face of the increasing wage rate in Asia, many countries in this region will lose their comparative advantage in agriculture.

Our bargaining script secures that only the seller can change prices and terminate negotiations, thus we are able to examine differences in the seller's entire path of negotiation and in the reservation price at which they are willing to trade. We find that male and female passengers who use the same bargaining script are not treated equally. Men face higher initial prices, final prices, and rejection rates. These differences are consistent with male drivers being more reluctant to give-in to demanding negotiations by male passengers, and with male passengers being perceived as having high valuations. To identify whether taste-based or statistical discrimination drives the inferior treatment of men we conduct an experiment where passengers send a signal on valuation before negotiating. The signal eliminates gender differences and the response is shown only to be consistent with statistical discrimination. Thus in the limiting case of a highly competitive market with experienced traders, we do not find evidence of taste-based discrimination, the differential observed is however consistent with statistical discrimination.

Better understanding the response of these ecological systems, it is argued, will enable society to better ameliorate, adapt to, and even benefit from, the forces of global change. The argument presented in this paper, however, is that the response of managed ecosystems can only be understood by treating likely human response to global change as an integral part of the research agenda. Linking science and policy research matters because the adoption of technologies for improved natural resource management, or of other interventions that scientific research may help design, is conditioned by socio-economic factors that policy research is better equipped to articulate. The paper first discusses how natural resource management and technology adoption are influenced by policy factors. It then explores why science — including \{GCTE\} — research needs to be linked to policy research. The reasons include: (a) that understanding biophysical processes is necessary but insufficient to understanding the socio-economic consequences of global change; (b) that the design of interventions to ameliorate negative and foster positive change at a global scale depends on gauging the likely human behavioral responses to change; (c) that although global impacts arise from an accumulation of local changes, interventions are often best coordinated in an international forum where the interests of potential “winners” and “losers” can best be matched. Different (winner and loser) nations have different policy stances on the underlying promoters of change, e.g., population growth, carbon emissions, biodiversity loss, etc. Failure to understand the (often economic) incentives underlying the “business-as-usual” position of many countries can hamper progress, even if the scientific arguments are compelling. The paper also assesses how best to link \{GCTE\} science research and policy research. Researchers need to be: (a) concerned at many scales, from local to global; (b) able to predict and allow for the influences of technical change; (c) able to model biophysical processes and behavioral norms and responses in an integrated way. Interactive models in which biophysical processes impact on human behavioral response and vice versa are increasingly required. Even where land use and socio-economic models are not formally linked, significant gains may be made from multidisciplinary approaches and information exchange that develop common scenarios under which biophysical and economic analyses are made separately, but at least in complementary ways.

Investments in infrastructure improvements (about annualized \{US\} $299 million) and crop pattern change will be necessary to sustain the irrigated agriculture and the associated environment in the region. Moreover, a penalty tax on salt discharge less than 50 US$ per ton as an economic incentive may help address environmental problems, while having only a small effect on irrigation profit. "

The dominant theoretical perspective on technical change and innovation in small-scale agriculture (choice under constrained maximization) is argued to be highly effective in identifying problems with small-scale agriculture. But its reliance on equilibrium notions renders it silent on solutions, i.e. each component of an equilibrium affirms the others, very often none more or less critically than the rest. Left vague are the processes through which the low-level technologies that purportedly underpin small-scale agriculture’s problems actually come to be chosen, time and again. An alternative view is proposed, focusing on learning, adaptation, and problem-solving. Scope is thus identified for “out-of-equilibrium” improvements in smallholder production and trading systems, with important implications for policy. "

In this paper, we examine the patterns and trends in food price volatility using an unusually rich database of African staple food prices. We find that international grain prices have become more volatile in recent years (2007–2010) but no evidence that food price volatility has increased in the region. This contrasts with the widespread view that food prices have become more volatile in the region since the global food crisis of 2007–2008. In addition, the results suggest that price volatility is lower for processed and tradable food than for nontradable food, that volatility is lower in the major cities than in secondary cities, and that maize price volatility is actually higher in countries with the most active intervention to stabilize maize prices. These findings suggest that greater attention should be given to the (high) level of food prices in the region rather than volatility per se, that regional and international trade can play a useful role in reducing food price volatility, and that traditional food price stabilization efforts may be counterproductive.

The study reveals that agriculture can play a central role in decreasing poverty and increasing growth in Ethiopia. Within the agriculture, growth in cereals and other staple crops should receive priority. Agricultural growth also requires concurrent investments in roads and other market conditions. At the subnational level, similar growth rates within agricultural subsectors have different effects on poverty, necessitating regionally based strategies for growth and poverty reduction. "

The macro economic evidence yields similar findings.

A simple theoretical model is used to develop hypotheses about the determinants of investment under alternative factor market conditions, and these are tested using data on conservation investment from three villages. We find that conservation investment is significantly lower on leased land in two of the study villages and lower on plots that are subject to sales restrictions in one village, suggesting the potential for land market reforms to increase conservation investment. In one village, households with more adult males, more farm servants, and less land invest more in conservation, as predicted by the model of imperfect labor markets; and households with more debt and off-farm income invest more, consistent with the model of imperfect credit markets. Evidence that conservation investment is affected by factor market imperfections is weaker in the other villages, where investments are much larger, suggesting transaction costs as the source of the differences between villages. Other factors that have a significant effect on investment include the farmer's education and caste, characteristics of the plot (size, slope, irrigation status, and quality ranking) and the presence of existing land investments. The results suggest the importance of accounting for differences across communities and households in factor market and agroclimatic conditions in designing programs to promote investments in soil and water conservation.

In addition, the number of firms is growing faster in clustered areas than non-clustered ones. Together these patterns suggest that China's industrialization process is largely cluster-based—a phenomenon in which a large number of highly interconnected firms are located within a well-defined geographic region.

The method combines a recursive and dynamic linear programming model with a biophysical model of soil condition and plant growth that predicts yields and land degradation for different type of land, land use and cropping patterns. The linear programming model simulates farmers' plans aggregated at the village level under constraints of risk aversion, food consumption, land area, soil fertility, soil depth, labor and cash availability. Detailed agroecological factors determine the main processes of land degradation. A large number of technological alternatives, representing different degrees of labor and/or land-saving techniques available in the study areas, are introduced, taking into account their respective constraints, costs and advantages. The method has been calibrated for a village located in the sub-humid region of Burkina Faso. Several simulations are carried out to the Year 2030. The results show that population pressure leads to intensification and investment in land conservation practices but not necessarily to better farm incomes. Increasing market opportunities can play a more positive role in boosting productivity, but for the next decades the best way to increase production per farmer is to let farmers migrate from the high-population-density areas to the low-population-density areas because, under the current economic conditions of most Sahelian countries, intensification per hectare is stil more expensive than the fallow system.

In particular, the footwear industry in Wenzhou has grown from a negligible market share to the largest in China. Here, we report a survey of 140 Wenzhou-based footwear enterprises of various scales, and use this information to examine the driving forces behind the dramatic rural industrial growth seen in this region. Our results show that clustering deepens the division of labor in the production process and makes it possible for small entrepreneurial firms to enter the industry by focusing on a narrowly defined stage of production. Therefore, Wenzhou represents an example of how clustering plays a significant role in helping fledgling rural industries overcome the growth constraints of capital and technology in the incipient stage of industrialization.

In an environment suffering from biomass and water shortages, erosion and land degradation, fast growing and resilient eucalyptus perform better than most indigenous tree species. Smallholders show a clear preference for eucalyptus poles, which are useful for farm implements and constructing dwellings and fences. In addition, the sale of eucalyptus poles and products has the potential to raise farm incomes, reduce poverty, increase food security and diversify smallholder-farming systems in less-favored areas of Tigray. Despite the potential for eucalyptus to improve rural livelihoods, in 1997 the regional government of Tigray imposed a ban on eucalyptus tree planting on farmlands. The ban was precipitated by concerns about the potential negative environmental externalities associated with eucalyptus, and the desire to reserve farmland for crop production. However, the regional government promotes the planting of eucalyptus in community woodlots, and has recently begun to allow private planting of eucalyptus on community wasteland and steep hillsides. In this paper, we review the ecological debate surrounding the planting of eucalyptus trees. In addition, the economic factors that influence smallholders to invest in tree production are considered. Ex ante benefit–cost analysis based on community and village level survey data from Tigray illustrates that planting eucalyptus yields high rates of return, well above 20% in most circumstances. The effect of variable harvest rates, and the potential costs of decreased crop production when eucalyptus trees are planted on or near farmlands are considered relative to our base case scenario. Based upon the review of the ecological and economic impacts of eucalyptus, we conclude that a policy option favoring the allocation of wastelands for private tree planting offers the greatest opportunity for rural smallholders.

The resulting improvements in the trade balance and national income, among other macroeconomic variables, are also relatively significant.

Moreover, most of the water reaching plants in irrigated systems also stems from precipitation.

This paper analyzes alternative water futures using a combined green and blue water accounting framework embedded within the water simulation components of IFPRI’s International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT). Recently developed future scenarios for the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) and other work are assessed with this adjusted green/blue water accounting framework. Accounting explicitly for green water resources broadens the scope of options for decision-makers trying to improve agricultural production in the face of rising food and energy prices and a degrading water and land resource base in the face of increasing demands. Results highlight the importance of green/blue water accounting presenting a wider range of agricultural science and technology policy options for increasing global crop productivity across a span of potential futures.

It compares poverty measures for males and females, and for male- and female-headed households, and investigates the sensitivity of these measures to the use of per capita and per adult equivalent units and different definitions of the poverty line. While poverty measures are higher for female-headed households and for females, the differences are significant in only a fifth to a third of the datasets. The contribution of female-headed households to aggregate poverty is less than that of females, due to the low population share of the former. Stochastic dominance analysis reveals that differences between male- and female-headed households, and between males and females, are often insignificant, except for Ghana and Bangladesh, where females are consistently worse-off. These results suggest that cultural and institutional factors may be responsible for higher poverty among women in these countries. Our results point to the need to analyze determinants of household income and consumption using multivariate methods, and to give greater attention to the processes underlying female headship. "

This paper presents the results from a randomized survey experiment in Tanzania focusing on two survey design choices: different questionnaire design to classify children work and proxy response versus self-reporting. Use of a short module compared with a more detailed questionnaire has a statistically significant effect, especially on child labor force participation rates, and, to a lesser extent, on working hours. Proxy reports do not differ significantly from a child's self-report. Further analysis demonstrates that survey design choices affect the coefficient estimates of some determinants of child labor in a child labor supply equation. The results suggest that low-cost changes to questionnaire design will potentially clarify the concept of work for respondents. "

These cases are based on two generally misleading premises: the belief that Europe or Japan represents the only market for exports, and the perception that non-GM segregation is infeasible or prohibitively costly in all situations. Our study also demonstrates the importance of information asymmetries across countries and agents and the role of risk aversion in seemingly irrational decision-making.

A unique feature of this experiment is that it includes a large subsample of husband and wife pairs. After exploring correlations between husband and wife preferences, we explicitly test whether preferences follow the constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility function, and whether farmers follow expected utility theory or rank dependent utility theory in generating their preferences. We reject the null hypothesis that farmers' preferences follow the \{CRRA\} utility function, in favor of the more flexible power risk aversion preferences. If we make the common \{CRRA\} assumption in our sample, we poorly predict risk preferences among those who are less risk averse. "

The recent literature on Dutch disease describes alternative policy rules to manage the income flow from the expected natural resource revenue, which can either be spent to raise immediate consumption or on public infrastructure to increase future productivity. We simulate four strategies. As a conservative strategy, Niger can spend only the interest earned on revenue in a sovereign wealth fund (bird-in-hand strategy); alternatively, it can borrow to spend now and repay with expected natural resource revenue. The key to the benefits of significant mineral revenue lies with the productivity and supply responses of spending. If significant output gain is assured, the different spending strategies have very similar effects on real consumption. Dutch disease, the overshooting of relative prices of non-tradable sector or the shrinking share of traded sectors in the economy, is also ameliorated with greater supply flexibility. Growth paths of alternative spending strategies differ markedly in timing and pattern, however, when spending does not raise productivity. The more aggressive spending plan may result in a boom–bust cycle if fiscal adjustments and debt repayments are necessary for any significant borrowing against future revenue and productivity gains are not realized.

However, this is a generic prediction and depends on maintained assumptions about industries, factor markets, and trade patterns that may not fit well for developing countries. Using firm-level data from Ghana, Kenya, and Tanzania during the 1990s, a period of fairly rapid trade policy liberalization, we estimate productivity effects of trade. Our analysis confirms the well-known association between export intensity and higher productivity of the firm; however, the evidence for “learning by exporting,” or an increase in productivity associated with greater exports, is mixed, with several instances of negative average \{TFP\} growth among exporters. Our analysis indicates that such declines are likely attributable to the effects of lower external tariffs, because the firm-level productivity margin below which exporting is unprofitable moves down as the external tariff rate is reduced. We also find that sales to the rest of the world and sales to other African economies have differential effects on productivity growth rates, and that for country-specific reasons, these effects are not uniform. Controlling for initial productivity and the destination of exports (within or outside Africa) helps us understand why in some cases, export participation is associated with negative rates of \{TFP\} growth.

Our analysis confirms previous findings that CFPR-TUP increased household asset ownership, but shows complex effects on targeted women. Women appear to retain ownership over transferred livestock, but new investments from mobilized resources are largely owned by men. CFPR-TUP also reduces women's movement outside the home and control over income, consistent with transferred livestock requiring maintenance at home. However, beneficiary women also report “intangible” benefits such as increased social capital and, even with limited mobility, a preference for work inside the home given a hostile environment outside the home.

We estimate two-stage, instrumental variables, Poisson, and ordered logit regression models to test the association between hybrid seed use and four indicators of dietary diversity: food group diversity (24-h), vitamin A diversity (7-day), food frequency (7-day), and frequency of consuming foods fortified with vitamin A (7-day).

This paper notes that, hampered by chronic fiscal problems and restrictions that will be imposed when it joins the World Trade Organization, China can meet its food supply goals by increasing reliance on international markets, establishing stable trading relationships with the rest of the world, and by exploiting its agricultural comparative advantage. However, the most likely scenario is for China to continue producing most of its own food while gradually increasing food imports without exerting severe upward pressure on the world markets. The paper concludes that China needs to prioritize investments in agricultural research for new technologies raising agricultural productivity, and mitigating rural environmental problems. "

abstract = "Publisher Summary This chapter reviews the domestic and regional regulatory environments related to genetically modified organisms (GMO). Regulation typically occurs at four levels of activity – technology patenting, field-testing of the crop, animal and human consumption trials, and approval for commercial use as a crop and for human and animal consumption. Regulations differ greatly in scale and implementation, varying from extremely restrictive in some industrialized countries to nonexistent in some developing countries. The study shows that food safety aspects of GMO's generally have been grafted onto the responsibility of ministries of health. These agencies have started from existing food safety regulations and modified them somewhat to deal with specific \{GMO\} issues. Environmental regulatory authority has more often been split between ministries of agriculture and ministries of the environment and natural resources. Agriculture ministries traditionally regulate development and release of new varieties, so it was a natural fit to add release of \{GM\} varieties. The role of environment ministries, have however been less clear. The potential for duplicative regulation is obvious, as is the potential for non-market effects to escape regulation by falling between the cracks. Perhaps the most important point to emphasize is that regulatory efforts are rapidly changing, both in response to consumer and environmental groups and to keep up with technology. "

To improve the utility of these systems for decision making more attention needs to be given to defining the uses and users of food security and nutrition monitoring systems from the onset, in addition to identifying the factors within the political economy of a country which may affect the way in which decisions are made on food security and nutrition issues.

We compare these results with the rural sample of the Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) from Kenya and Zambia.

With the roll-out of anti-retroviral drugs it is likely that the relationship between mortality and \{HIV\} status is no longer straight forward.

In this paper, China's position along the Lewis continuum is examined though primary surveys of wage rates, a more reliable statistic than employment data.

In the context of a recent wave of new nationally-representative household food consumption and expenditure surveys, this paper examines the estimation methodology underlying the food insecurity measure, which relies on national aggregate measures of food availability and distribution. The paper finds that the measure largely reflects national food availabilities and does not adequately capture people's ability to gain access to food – the ultimate key to food security. The implications for the indicator's use by policy makers in geographical targeting and tracking changes in food insecurity over time are drawn out. The paper concludes by arguing that the time has come to review the potential for employing the new household survey data, along with new methods, to strengthen the empirical foundations of FAO's measure.

Results indicate that when risk averse farmers are modeled as risk-neutral agents, the size of the incentives needed to induce participation to a carbon sequestration program is miscalculated with serious implications either for the success for projects that aim at compensating for climate change mitigation services or for the economic efficiency of such projects.

This paper shows that (i) the learner–educator ratios significantly differ between formerly Black and White primary and secondary schools in 1996 and 2000, and (ii) in the dynamic adjustment of educators in response to changes in learner size in this period, there are significant differences between formely Black and non-Black (White, Coloured and Indian) primary schools. The opportunities for education quality in public schools are still unequal between Black and White children even after the abolition of Apartheid, and given that school quality affects returns to schooling and earnings opportunities in labour markets, the inequality causes income inequality between Black and White. Our empirical result calls for stronger policy intervention to support Black schools and children in South Africa. "

In terms of poverty reduction, low-grade roads raise far more rural and urban poor above the poverty line per yuan invested than do high-grade roads.

Many of the industrial policies affecting the cluster—including leveling land, developing better varieties, establishing a potato trade association, lobbying for increasing freight car quotas, and attracting processing firms—were implemented at the local level, highlighting the need for discussion of local industrial policymaking as a major determinant of cluster development. As the case study demonstrates, economic development is a continuous process with constantly evolving binding supply-side and demand-side constraints. Often, after a local policy helps remove one binding constraint, a new one emerges that, in turn, may require a new set of policies. Therefore, the success of clusters depends upon local industrial policies that respond to emerging binding constraints at different stages of the cluster’s development. "

This article examines the aggregate level trends in production and consumption of coarse grains and non-traditional grains. Household level data sets from urban and rural Burkina Faso and from Southwestern Kenya are used to identify the determinants of shifting consumption patterns. Results from the two countries suggest that the shift to rice in urban Burkina Faso and wheat in the form of bread in rural Kenya is related to the extent of women working outside the home. Results also suggest that women level factors are more important than household income alone in explaining the transition in consumption patterns. "

The authors conclude that substantial recent cutbacks in public investment are largely appropriate, but that modestly higher shadow prices for rice and wheat should be utilized in evaluating investments. Other policy implications include the importance of considering a wider range of performance improvement options and of greater selectivity in project design, the need for more fundamental reform in many public irrigation institutions, and the undervalued importance of private investment in irrigation development coupled with greater public investment in supporting infrastructure and institutions.

We consider an environment with complementarity in upstream and downstream efforts to provide quality, imperfect, lagged signals of intermediate and final quality, and repeated interaction. It is demonstrated that in deciding whether to maintain information about product origin, firms face a trade-off. On one hand, the downstream firm is tempted to condone limited upstream shirking when products are not traceable to their firm of origin. On the other hand, the downstream firm is tempted to vertically coordinate shirking in the provision of quality when products are traceable. Perfect traceability is not optimal if (1) the ratio of the cost savings from upstream and downstream shirking is neither too high nor too low or (2) the downstream firm sufficiently infrequently detects input defects or (3) the consumer experience is a sufficiently noisy signal of quality.

While the results are consistent with earlier findings that seasonality influences variation in the intake of nutrients, it is shown that subsistence agricultural households recover faster from poor crop yields than market oriented agricultural households in terms of nutrient intake. Agricultural labour households consumed lowest quantities of energy and protein in all seasons with the highest degree of gender bias. The gender bias is more in terms of protein intake compared to energy intake for all the households. The non-agricultural households are least affected due to variability in crop yields and seasonality. While nutritional intake of the rural households is positively correlated with crop yields, the variations in yields worsen the gender bias. It is argued that reducing dependency of rural households on agriculture may reduce malnutrition and the gender bias associated with it. "

However, mapping the density of poverty reveals that most poor people do not live in the poorest districts but in the two lowland deltas, where poverty incidence is intermediate. The policy implications of these findings present an important trade-off between targeting poor areas and poor people that can only be resolved with better information on the relative costs of delivering different programmes and their expected impact. Existing government estimates of poverty at the district level are not closely correlated with our poverty estimates, perhaps because of regional variation in their methods of collecting poverty data.

The approach is designed to simultaneously address the shortcomings and maintain the attractive features of detailed energy sector and general equilibrium models. It also reflects common country-level energy planning processes. We illustrate the capabilities of this integrated bottom-up approach by analyzing the implications of (i) a carbon tax, (ii) liberalization of import supply restrictions in order to exploit regional hydropower potential, and (iii) a combined policy where both carbon taxes and import liberalization are pursued. For the combined scenario, our results suggest substantial emissions reductions relative to Baseline at essentially no cost to economic growth but about a one percent reduction in employment. We conclude that a regional energy strategy, anchored in hydropower, represents a potentially inexpensive approach to decarbonizing the South African economy. The strategy also has political economy attractions in that the combined approach reduces the burden of adjustment of politically sensitive sectors. "

The model includes a specification of the rice market and the government price-support, stocking, and trade policies for rice. Using a mixed complementarity approach, the model incorporates inequalities and changes in policy regime as prices and/or stocks move within specified bands. The model is used to examine the impact on the Indonesian economy of changes in rice yield and exchange rates given different assumptions about the operations of \{BULOG\} (National Logistic Agency). An important result is that there is inefficient allocation of resources within agriculture and the rest of the economy if \{BULOG\} operates to maintain the rice price when there are significant increases in rice productivity or changes in the exchange rate. With increased productivity in rice, the price support scheme retains resources in rice production that would be better used in other, high value, agriculture. With devaluation, maintaining a low rice price discriminates against rice producers and hence slows the process of structural adjustment. In addition, the price support program is costly and strains the government accounts, even if the administrative costs of operating the program are ignored. "

The severity of droughts, however, has reduced. An assessment of their impact reveals a decline in drought-induced losses in rice yield, in absolute as well as relative terms. The weakening effect of droughts is attributed to improvements in farmers’ adaptive capacity due to expansion of irrigation facilities and increased availability of improved varieties for the rainfed production systems, along with other coping strategies.

One-third of the households surveyed are headed by women. For all households, women's labor force participation is high with 75% of all households having at least one working woman. The high number of female-headed households and the large percentage of working women in the sample provide a good backdrop for looking at how women earn and spend income differently than men in an urban area. Livelihood strategies for both men and women are predominantly labor based and dependent on social networks. For all households in the sample, food is still the single most important item in the total budget. Yet, important and striking differences between men's and women's livelihoods and expenditure patterns exist. Compared to men, women are less likely to be employed as wage earners, and more likely to work as street food vendors or petty traders. Women earn lower incomes, but tend to allocate more of their budget to basic goods for themselves and their children, while men spend more on entertainment for themselves only. Despite lower incomes and additional demands on their time as housewives and mothers, female-headed households, petty traders and street food vendors have the largest percentage of food-secure households. Women may be achieving household food security, but at what cost? This paper explores differences in income, expenditure and consumption patterns in an effort to answer this question, and suggests ways that urban planners and policy makers can address special concerns to working women in urban areas.

Given the profile of the typical part-time student at UWI, the paper suggests that lower motivation and greater time constraints account for the poor performance of these students, and proposes two solutions to reduce the social cost of high failure associated with part-time students [JEL: I22, I28].

In Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Turkey, ethnographic methods were used, involving between 87 and 120 households per country, and in Mexico, focus groups were conducted with 230 people. Key informant interviews were conducted with health care providers in all countries. While \{CCTs\} operate primarily on the assumption that a cash incentive will produce behaviour change, we found multiple sociocultural and structural influences on health care decisions that compete with cash. These include beliefs around traditional and modern biomedical practices, sociocultural norms, gender relations, and the quotidian experience of poverty in many dimensions. We conclude that impacts can be increased through a better understanding of multiple contextual influences on health care decisions, and greater attention to the health education components and complementary interventions.

This paper discusses the potential of such substitution through an empirical analysis based on a multiple-input crop production function at the field and farm scales complemented with a numerical modeling exercise at the basin scale. Results from the crop production function analysis show that under both crop yield and net profit maximization, water is a substitute to other crop inputs for high-value crops, and is a complement to water for low-valued crops. At the basin scale, an integrated economic–hydrologic river basin model is used to analyze the role of other factors in crop input substitution, including the spatial connections among water sources and demands, hydro-agronomic conditions, and institutional settings for water allocation. Results show that in the case study area, the Maipo River basin in Chile, where water is very scarce, moving from the current, input-constrained, situation to full optimization of water resources leads to an increase in all crop inputs, including water. In that case, 301 million m3 of additional water use results in additional net profits of \{USD\} 11 million. However, if the water fee is raised by a factor of eight while overall basin irrigation profits are maintained at the original, baseline level, a reduction of water withdrawals by 326 million m3 is traded off with costs of \{USD\} 43.2 million for other inputs. Irrigation districts with a high share of low-value crops have a low potential for substituting water with other crop inputs. Therefore, investments for water substitution should also be kept low in these areas. "

Second, the negative effect on non-producers’ real incomes was smaller in spatially well-connected areas, where, to mitigate the impact, private transfers (such as remittances) as well as employment incomes increased among non-producers.

The analysis of small-scale irrigation expansion shows that the potential for investment in small-scale projects in Kenya ranges from 54,000 ha to 241,000 hectares, with an internal rate of return from 17% to 32%. For the dam-based investment analysis, under low-cost assumption, 58 dams of 73 are profitable (IRR &gt; 0). At high cost level, the number is 52. If we raise the \{IRR\} cutoff value to 12%, 32 dams are economically feasible. We showed that there is considerable scope for the expansion of both dam-based and small-scale irrigation in Kenya, and we also provided a strategic prioritization for investments in irrigation schemes and projects.

In order to formulate effective policies for reaching this goal, a thorough understanding of the location and causes of food insecurity is needed. This paper provides a broad overview of the current character of food insecurity in developing countries, focusing on two questions: (1) Why are they food insecure? and (2) Why are the food insecure? To answer the latter question data from 58 developing countries with high prevalences of food insecurity are employed to examine the relative importance of two of food insecurity’s most basic causes: national food availability and the inability of people to access food due to poverty. Using child malnutrition as a proxy (along with descriptive controls for non-food determinants of malnutrition), the paper finds little correlation between national food availabilities and food insecurity. The group of countries that exhibit the highest severity of food insecurity are those with high poverty and food (dietary energy) surpluses, consistent with the view that poverty is the most widespread cause of food insecurity in the 1990s. The paper concludes by considering the implications of the analysis for appropriate geographical and policy targeting to improve food security for the greatest numbers of people at the fastest pace, now and into the 21st century.

Our analysis indicates that, in China, rice yields have converged over time and rice production has become increasingly homogeneous.

Three hypothetical explanations may account for the different behaviors of rice yields in Brazil and China, namely: 1) differences in production systems (i.e. irrigated in China vs. upland in Brazil); 2) changes in rainfall patterns; and 3) bias in agricultural research and development (R&amp;D) towards irrigated rice. Our empirical analysis supports the first two hypotheses by establishing that: 1) upland rice shows much more variation in yields compared to irrigated rice; and 2) changing rainfall patterns have primarily affected upland rice. We also provide evidence of the bias towards irrigated systems by looking at the patterns of varietal release. "

We maintain a (2 × 2) design in which the remittance budget has a value of $400 or $200, and the remitted funds arrive as cash or grocery vouchers that are non-transferable and applicable to basic necessities that do not include alcohol and cigarettes. Each migrant is randomly allocated to one of the resulting four treatments. We test across these treatments whether control over remittance spending in the form of grocery vouchers affects remittance behavior. We find the following. Our quantitative findings suggest that migrants prefer a remittance to arrive as cash than as groceries when stakes are high. This result is robust to inclusion of a wide set of covariates and is consistent with a conceptual framework in which migrants have preferences over how recipients spend remittances. Our qualitative findings suggest that migrants integrate amounts sent in the experiment with the external environment for sending remittances. We explore the mechanisms underlying the main effect and find that migrants who more recently sent a remittance and, in certain specifications, male migrants exhibit a greater preference for cash. Some implications of our findings are discussed. "

An assessment was undertaken of the food and nonfood risk factors of poor health and growth failure in children of different age groups in the central highlands of Guatemala. The aim was to identify high risk factors in under-five and school-age children. Under-five children at high risk of being ill tended to come from households with: high needs of child care, a lack of access to a private well or piped water, and no sewage connection. Women's illiteracy constituted an additional risk factor for diarrheal disease in under-five children. Growth failure in under-five children was mainly due to chronic factors: 74% were stunted, 6% were wasted and 44% were weight deficient. These prevalence rates were lower among school-age children. Low per capita food availability, and particularly the absence in the household of self-produced staple foods, was the most significant risk factor of growth failure in under-five children, followed by high risk of being ill, and participation by women in farm production. The latter was particularly a risk factor of wasting. Nonfood risk factors were most important for growth failure in school-age children. These factors included: sanitation, housing conditions, women's literacy status, and adult women's body mass index. Participation in farm production by school-age children was associated with a higher risk of growth failure in younger siblings. It is concluded that multisectoral programs need to reduce the impact of various risk factors of poor health and growth failure in children, and be careful not to introduce new risk factors. Depending on which age group is targeted, such programs should either prioritize improvements in household food availability, or nonfood interventions that reduce women's illiteracy and improve sanitary and housing conditions.

We take advantage of the randomized roll-out of Ecuador's cash transfer program to mothers to investigate how an exogenous increase in a woman's income affects domestic violence. We find that the effect of a cash transfer depends on a woman's education and on her education relative to her partner's. Our results show that for women with greater than primary school education a cash transfer significantly decreases psychological violence from her partner. For women with primary school education or less, however, the effect of a cash transfer depends on her education relative to her partner's. Specifically, the cash transfer significantly increases emotional violence in households where the woman's education is equal to or more than her partner's. "

We find substantial deviation from the protocol, i.e., cheating. We study the mis-allocation of the vouchers to gain some insight into motivations for dishonesty. In our main result we find that the field staff were significantly more likely to allocate the higher value vouchers (those representing a greater subsidy) to the poorest beneficiaries. While we are not able to definitively establish the motivations for this observed pro-social behavior, we argue that this result is consistent with a model of social preferences and less consistent with a pure self-interest motive.

On the other hand, reforming trade policy alone can make farmers growing crops protected pre-reform worse off. Using an intertemporal, applied general equilibrium model, we find that trade reform actually creates an opportunity to pursue water policy reform. Creating a water user-rights market post trade reform not only compensates for the decline in farmers’ profits caused by the trade reform, but also raises the efficiency of water allocation and hence benefits the economy as a whole.

The analysis using a Ramsey model shows how prolonged growth in Thailand can be explained by this learning mechanism and structural shift from agriculture to exportables. The relationship between exports and productivity is studied in a counterfactual experiment where protection serves as a barrier to exports learning and thereby reduces growth.

We show that the price-adjustment process in a local market is determined by the degree of interdependence between that market and the central market in which a price-shock originates, and estimate the intertemporal and interspatial dynamics of the price adjustment process. Using data from wholesale maize markets in Ghana we find that reductions in local prices and local price variance following the introduction of economic reforms in 1983 can be traced to both local and central market forces, but that differences in the degree of market integration have important implications for long-run changes in transport costs and the evolution of prices in outlying markets.

The paper also summarizes attempts to measure the various dimensions of care. The concept of care is extended in two directions: first, we define resources needed by the caregiver for care and, second, we show that the child's own characteristics play a role in the kind of care that he or she receives. The literature summary and methodological recommendations are made for six types of resources for care and for two of the least studied care practices: complementary feeding and psychosocial care. The other care practices are care for women, breast-feeding, food preparation, hygiene, and home health practices. Feeding practices that affect a child's nutritional status include adaptation of feeding to the child's abilities (offering finger foods, for example); responsiveness of the caregiver to the child (perhaps offering additional or different foods); and selection of an appropriate feeding context. Psychosocial care is the provision of affection and attention to the child and responsiveness to the child's cues. It includes physical, visual, and verbal interactions. "

Almost 10,000 farmers in the Highlands of Madagascar produce vegetables for supermarkets in Europe. In this global supply chain, small farmers’ micro-contracts are combined with intensive farm assistance and supervision programs to fulfill complex quality requirements and phyto-sanitary standards of supermarkets. Small farmers that participate in these contracts have higher welfare, more income stability and shorter lean periods. We also find significant effects on improved technology adoption, better resource management and spillovers on the productivity of the staple crop rice.

abstract = "Among South Asian countries, Nepal liberalized most extensively during the 1980s and 1990s on both domestic and external fronts. In South Asia, Nepal has the lowest per capita income, highest dependence of population on agriculture and second highest poverty rate. At the same time, Nepal has the lowest average tariffs in South Asia and has taken several steps to downsize its public food distribution system and remove a host of agricultural subsidies. The outcomes from these policy reforms in Nepal are mixed. Aggregate indicators of food sufficiency and security (per capita food availability, extent of malnourishment) show improvement in Nepal since liberalization. Relative to other South Asian countries, Nepal is doing better on some indicators, like extent of undernourished population, while on other indicators, like stunting of children, Nepal is actually doing the worst. More importantly, the gains from liberalization across regions in Nepal have been uneven. The reason for such an uneven outcome is lack of complementary policies from the government that would lead to spatial integration of markets (e.g. the creation of physical and marketing infrastructure). Liberalization has in effect reinforced the ex-ante hierarchy across regions in Nepal. The paper then reviews the role and reform of the Nepal Food Corporation (NFC) within this broader context. "

We use hedonic and panel data methods to examine the returns to different types of rural public investments including roads, irrigation and extension advice. The use of diverse identification strategies reduces the risk of using a narrower set of results driven primarily by a particular methodology. We find that rural roads and irrigation are one of the most productive public expenditures according to the benefit-cost ratio calculations, though the magnitudes of these ratios depend on methodology.

To understand the consequences of population growth in a general equilibrium setting, we examine the dynamics of population density and its impacts on household outcomes using panel data from Indonesia, combined with district-level demographic data. Historically, Indonesia has adapted to land constraints through a mix of agricultural intensification, expansion of the land frontier, and non-farm diversification, with public policies playing a role in catalyzing all of these responses. In contemporary Indonesia we find that human capital determines the effect of increased population density on per capita household consumption expenditure. The effect of population density is positive if the average educational attainment is high (above junior high school), while it is negative otherwise. On the other hand, farmers with larger holdings maintain their advantage in farming regardless of population density. The paper concludes with some potential lessons for African countries from Indonesia’s more successful rural development experiences. "

Through descriptive analysis combined with empirical assessment of the economic efficiency of agriculture in different production systems and agroecologies we are able assess the relevance of Green Revolution technologies for agricultural production in Ghana. In particular, we analyze whether fertilizer use in Ghana is associated with high population density and intensive cereal production and whether land-intensive innovations are associated with more efficient production practices. Overall, we do not find evidence of Asian-style Green Revolution agricultural intensification in Ghana; in fact, we find no correlation between population density and input intensity. We also find that labor costs still play a major role in Ghanaian agricultural development in limiting the adoption of labor-intensive technologies even in relatively high population density areas.

In this paper, we use four waves of a primary panel household survey conducted in 17 remote natural villages in China to study how road access shapes farmers’ production patterns, input use, and rural poverty. We adopt a difference-in-difference approach by comparing the outcomes of the households in villages with and without road access, before and after the introduction of each road. Our results show that access to roads facilitates specialization in agricultural production. In natural villages with better road access, farmers plant fewer numbers of crops, purchase more fertilizer, and hire more labor. Consequently, road connections improve household agricultural income and reduce poverty. In addition, road access significantly increases local nonfarm income for the relatively poor households, but not the rich. Overall, our research provides empirical justification on the importance of rural road on agricultural specialization and poverty reduction, especially in isolated and impoverished regions. "

These findings are generally robust to alternative estimation methods and data sources. We further observe a larger decline among firms with lower average wages and a lower capital–labor ratio.

We use a unique transaction dataset for new apartment units in the affected area. We find that the relative price of low to high floor units, particularly units located in the first and second floor, considerably increased for several months after the earthquake and then returned back to the levels observed prior to the tremor. This temporal increase in relative prices is in line with a higher risk perception and fear, triggered after the earthquake, of living in upper floors, which gradually dissipated over time.

In our study, community members pool resources to provide environmental education material for local schools. We find that voluntary contributions increase when democratically elected local authorities lead by example. The results are driven by two factors: (1) authorities, like other individuals, give more when they are called upon to lead than when they give in private, and (2) high leader contributions increase the likelihood that others follow. Both effects are stronger when authorities, as compared to randomly selected community members, lead by example. We explore two underlying sources of leadership influence. First, we provide evidence that the effect of a leader's contribution is not limited to signaling the value of the public good. Second, we examine how leader characteristics affect the likelihood that others follow. Specifically, our study shows that authority influence is driven by a combination of formal leadership status, observable characteristics, and the amount that authorities contribute when they give publicly before others.

In many settings, married women cultivate plots separated from those of other family members. They face different challenges to productivity, such as deficiencies in inputs, weak property rights, and time constraints. It has long been argued that traditionally male-dominated extension services may also contribute to a gender bias in adoption of new agricultural techniques. If this is true, placing women in extension positions may help other women overcome barriers to adoption posed by inequitable access to agricultural extension services or exposure to inapt information. To better understand the role of gender in the dissemination of sustainable land management (SLM) techniques, this study uses a randomized policy experiment conducted in 200 communities in Mozambique. We examine the impact of training female messengers of \{SLM\} techniques on the awareness, knowledge, and adoption of \{SLM\} practices by other female farmers. Communities were randomly selected in 2010 to have a female messenger trained in \{SLM\} who was encouraged to teach other women the techniques. Using data from panel surveys collected in the experimental areas, we find women’s awareness of pit planting farming techniques increased by 9 percentage points in 2012 and adoption of the technology by 5 percentage points in 2013 in communities with female messengers.

One such approach is through Conservation Agriculture (CA), which improves soil quality through a suite of farming practices that reduce soil disturbance, increase soil cover through retained crop residues, and increase crop diversification. We use discrete choice experiments to study farmers’ preferences for these different \{CA\} practices, and assess willingness to adopt CA. Despite many long-term agronomic benefits, some farmers are not willing to adopt \{CA\} without incentives. Our results suggest that farmers perceive that \{CA\} practices interact with one another differently, sometimes complementing and sometimes degrading the benefits of the other practices. But our results also indicate that preferences are a function of experiences with CA, such that current farm level practices influence willingness to adopt the full \{CA\} package. Further, exposure to various risks such as flooding and insect infestations often constrains adoption. Providing subsidies can increase likely adoption of a full \{CA\} package, but may generate some perverse incentives that can result in subsequent disadoption. "

L’objet du présent travail est de préciser le niveau de diversité alimentaire de jeunes enfants pour deux saisons distinctes, compte tenu du statut économique de leur ménage en milieu rural au Mali. Méthode Dans la région de Kayes (Mali), deux échantillons aléatoires d’enfants de 12–24 mois ont été enquêtés, l’un en novembre 2013, en fin de saison des récoltes (n = 2138) et l’autre en avril 2015, en fin de saison sèche (n = 1732). Pour chaque enfant, un score de diversité alimentaire (SDA) en sept groupes (« céréales/tubercules », « légumineuses », « produits laitiers », « viandes/poissons », « œufs », « fruits/légumes », « produits riches en vitamine A ») a été compilé à partir de la consommation alimentaire de la veille. Un indice économique en terciles a été construit par analyse factorielle à partir des caractéristiques des ménages. Résultats Le \{SDA\} moyen diffère selon les saisons (p &lt; 0,01) allant de 3,07 groupes alimentaires en fin de saison des récoltes à 2,89 groupes en fin de saison sèche. Cette diminution s’explique par une plus faible disponibilité de certains groupes en fin de saison sèche comme les « légumineuses » ou « fruits/légumes » (p = 0,01). Aux deux saisons, le \{SDA\} augmente avec le statut économique (respectivement de 3,00 à 3,19 [p &lt; 0,01] et 2,71 à 2,91 [p = 0,04]). Ceci s’explique par la consommation de « viandes/poissons » et de « fruits/légumes », plus importante chez les plus riches (p &lt; 0,01 et p = 0,04). Les variations saisonnières du \{SDA\} sont similaires pour chaque tercile économique (p[saison*tercile économique] = 0,53). Ces résultats restent identiques avec un \{SDA\} dichotomisé au seuil de quatre groupes, comme recommandé par l’Organisation mondiale de la santé.

International experience in addressing food safety provides two general kinds of lessons. First, a middle-income country such as China needs to develop the capacity to carry out risk analysis in order to better focus public resources on the most important risks. Second, it will be important to leverage market incentives so as to make the best use of limited public capacity to enforce standards. International experiences show that food safety management is feasible where market incentives exist, and that public-private partnerships can support the process of improving food safety management. Market incentives require effective consumer or buyer demand, mechanisms to identify and reward quality, and supply chain coordination. Public efforts can be targeted to supporting these market developments for the risks that are the greatest burden to public health. "

Similar to other developing countries and those in the Pacific, they are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change more so because of their geographic location, socioeconomic conditions and political instability. Nonetheless, there are approaches to alleviate the damaging effects of climate change in the region's fisheries sector. Using economic modeling, this paper estimates the economic costs of potential climate change adaptation strategies for the fisheries sector in Vanuatu and Timor-Leste through assessment of alternative future scenarios. Strategies include aquaculture development, natural resource management through establishment and/or expansion of marine protected areas, and deployment of low-cost inshore fish aggregating devices. Modeling results demonstrate that the above innovations will enable the two countries to significantly improve coastal and freshwater fish production in the medium-term (2035) and long-term (2050). Fish consumption is projected to grow due to population and income improvements; yet considerable increases in production will augment demand. Furthermore, national-level gains are projected from these adaptation strategies through fish exports. Improved production under climate change will require significant investments from the national governments of Vanuatu and Timor-Leste and/or private sectors. "

abstract = "Agricultural production in India has become increasingly reliant on groundwater and this has resulted in depletion of groundwater resources. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) for groundwater recharge is seen as one of the solutions to solve the groundwater problem. This is reflected in an increase in watershed development programs, in which \{RWH\} is an important structural component. Understanding the net effect of these development programs is crucial to ensure that net effect on groundwater is positive both locally and within a watershed. Hence, this review focuses on the hydrological impacts of \{RWH\} for recharge at the local (individual structure) and watershed scale in rural areas. Surprisingly little field evidence of the stated positive impacts at the local scale is available, and there are several potential negative impacts at the watershed scale. The watershed scale is underrepresented in the field studies and is mainly approached through modelling. Modelling is seen as a possible tool to extend limited field data and scenario studies can be used to examine potential impacts. However, many past modelling studies examining \{RWH\} have either had limited focus or have been based on insufficient data. Development of new modelling tools is needed in combination with increased field data collection. Increased use of remote sensing and advanced statistical techniques are suggested as possible new opportunities. In addition, some evaluation criteria are proposed to assess the local and watershed scale hydrological, and other, impacts of \{RWH\} as part of watershed development. "

Land degradation, population growth, stagnant technology, and drought necessitates development of non-farm employment opportunities in the area. The model has been used to assess the impact of improved access to non-farm income on household welfare, agricultural production, conservation investments and land degradation in form of soil erosion. The model simulations indicate that access to low-wage off-farm income is restricted by lack of employment opportunities since households otherwise would have engaged in more off-farm wage employment than observed. The simulations show that better (unconstrained) access to low-wage non-farm income has a substantial positive effect on household income. Total agricultural production (crop and livestock production) and farm inputs used are reduced when access to non-farm employment is improved and thus increases the need to import food to the area. Access to non-farm income reduces farm households’ incentives to invest in conservation and this leads to more overall soil erosion and more rapid land degradation even though intensity of production is reduced. Special policies are therefore needed to ensure land conservation and to sustain local food production. "

This paper explores the race between these two countervailing forces, with the goal of inform two important policy questions. First, how do rural Ethiopians adapt to land constraints? And second, do land constraints significantly influence welfare outcomes in rural Ethiopia? To answer these questions we use a recent household survey of high-potential areas. We first show that farm sizes are generally very small in the Ethiopian highlands and declining over time, with young rural households facing particularly severe land constraints. We then ask whether smaller and declining farm sizes are inducing agricultural intensification, and if so, how. We find strong evidence in favor of the Boserupian hypothesis that land-constrained villages typically use significantly more purchased input costs per hectare and more family labor, and achieve higher maize and teff yields and higher gross income per hectare. However, although these higher inputs raise gross revenue, we find no substantial impact of greater land constraints on net farm income per hectare once family labor costs are accounted for. Moreover, farm sizes are strongly positively correlated with net farm income, suggesting that land constraints are an important cause of rural poverty. We conclude with some broad policy implications of our results. "

Some of the actors directly responsible for forest conversion fell trees to meet food security needs and alleviate poverty—issues of urgent interest to them and also to national policymakers. This multiplicity of groups with differing (often conflicting) interests in the multifarious goods and services produced by tropical forests complicates the search for alternative agricultural activities for forest margins since these alternatives must satisfy such divergent objectives. This paper sets out a conceptual framework for comparing the impacts of different land use systems and agricultural practices at the margins of tropical rainforests in terms of the concerns and objectives of two key interest groups: small-scale farmers seeking livelihoods at the forest margins and the `international' interests in the global public goods and services supplied by tropical rainforests. This framework should be useful to a third key group, the national and regional policymakers who must consider these and other policy objectives and then decide on courses of action. The paper identifies data needs and analytical methods capable of supplying an empirical base for this conceptual framework, based on quantifiable indicators. It then presents preliminary results of the application of this conceptual framework in Indonesia and Brazil in association with a global, collaborative, multidisciplinary research program. Even using preliminary order-of-magnitude estimates (to be replaced by more precise measurements as they become available), this conceptual framework presents results in ways that allow researchers and policymakers to select clear `best bets' for development, when they exist, and to assess tradeoffs and options for complementary policy action and research efforts, when they do not.

A framed field experiment with credit groups in Tanzania, eliciting demand for group versus individual insurance, attributes this to a social dilemma. In a context of joint liability, insurance is a public good because clients can rely on contributions from group members to cope with health shocks. We hypothesize that clients have a private incentive to free-ride and forgo individual insurance even when full enrollment optimizes group welfare. The binding nature of group insurance eliminates such free-riding. Our experiment yields substantial support for this hypothesis. Whereas the demand for group insurance is high, a substantial share of clients forgoes individual insurance and relies on peers to repay their loan when falling ill. Group insurance can potentially increase low take-up rates. "

The alternative simulations confirm the importance of investment in agricultural research, extension, and irrigation for future growth in the crop and livestock sectors. Interventions in input and output prices, on the other hand, can be costly. The projections also provide strong evidence that fertilizer subsidies should be eliminated. Removal of these subsidies will have very little impact on future food production, and transfer of the fiscal savings from elimination of the subsidy into productive investments would have large benefits. The results indicate that the economic crisis could severely slow the process of diversification of Indonesian diets and growth in food consumption if income effects are prolonged into the next century.

Our test statistic is based on an appropriately centered and standardized nonparametric \{R2\} estimator, which is obtained from a local linear regression. We establish the asymptotic normality of the test statistic under the null hypothesis that relevant variables are not present and a sequence of Pitman local alternatives. We also prove the consistency of the test, and show that the Wild bootstrap/bootstrap method can be used to approximate the null distribution of the test statistic. Under the alternative hypothesis, we establish the asymptotic normality of the nonparametric \{R2\} estimator at rate n , which facilitates inference using the nonparametric measure of goodness-of-fit. We illustrate the finite sample performance of the tests with a Monte Carlo study and the bootstrap tests perform well relative to other alternatives. "

The problem is significantly complicated if there are heterogeneously distributed measurement errors on the observed values of X used in estimation and prediction. Carroll et al. (2009) have recently proposed a kernel deconvolution estimator and obtained its consistency. In this paper we use the kernels proposed in Mynbaev and Martins-Filho (2010) to define a class of deconvolution estimators for prediction that contains their estimator as one of its elements. First, we obtain consistency of the estimators under much less restrictive conditions. Specifically, contrary to what is routinely assumed in the extant literature, the Fourier transform of the underlying kernels is not required to have compact support, higher-order restrictions on the kernel can be avoided and fractional smoothness of the involved densities is allowed. Second, we obtain asymptotic normality of the estimators under the assumption that there are two types of measurement errors on the observed values of X . It is apparent from our study that even in this simplified setting there are multiple cases exhibiting different asymptotic behavior. Our proof focuses on the case where measurement errors are super-smooth and we use it to discuss other possibilities. The results of a Monte Carlo simulation are provided to compare the performance of the estimator using traditional kernels and those proposed in Mynbaev and Martins-Filho (2010). "

Unless addressed, it may undermine global food security and negatively affect the livelihoods of billions of people, especially of the poor. Addressing land degradation requires public, community and private actions informed and supported by evidence-based research. The current paper reviews the recent economic literature on land degradation and improvement with the purpose of highlighting major new insights and continuing gaps. Drawing conclusions from the recent research under the Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative, we find that action against land degradation has considerably higher economic, environmental and social returns than inaction. The drivers of land degradation are numerous and often context-specific, so addressing them requires targeting not some individual driver in isolation, but through comprehensive and mutually consistent packages of policy actions. We suggest the following conceptual, methodological and empirical areas for future research on economics of land degradation. Firstly, more interdisciplinary conceptual frameworks are required to connect land degradation and other intricately related issues such as climate change, water scarcity, loss of biodiversity, energy and food security. In this regard, Water-Energy-Food Security (WEF) Nexus concept can be highly useful as one of such nexus platforms for future trans-disciplinary research on economics of land degradation. Secondly, more rigorous methodologies are needed on the incorporation of the value of ecosystem services into economic calculations. Finally, there is a need for empirical studies tracing the dynamic economic and social impacts of land degradation across scales: from household to global level. "

Because agricultural production remains the main source of income for most rural communities in the region, adaptation of the agricultural sector is imperative to protect the livelihoods of the poor and to ensure food security. A better understanding of farmers’ perceptions of climate change, ongoing adaptation measures, and the decision-making process is important to inform policies aimed at promoting successful adaptation strategies for the agricultural sector. Using data from a survey of 1800 farm households in South Africa and Ethiopia, this study presents the adaptation strategies used by farmers in both countries and analyzes the factors influencing the decision to adapt. We find that the most common adaptation strategies include: use of different crops or crop varieties, planting trees, soil conservation, changing planting dates, and irrigation. However, despite having perceived changes in temperature and rainfall, a large percentage of farmers did not make any adjustments to their farming practices. The main barriers to adaptation cited by farmers were lack of access to credit in South Africa and lack of access to land, information, and credit in Ethiopia. A probit model is used to examine the factors influencing farmers’ decision to adapt to perceived climate changes. Factors influencing farmers’ decision to adapt include wealth, and access to extension, credit, and climate information in Ethiopia; and wealth, government farm support, and access to fertile land and credit in South Africa. Using a pooled dataset, an analysis of the factors affecting the decision to adapt to perceived climate change across both countries reveals that farmers were more likely to adapt if they had access to extension, credit, and land. Food aid, extension services, and information on climate change were found to facilitate adaptation among the poorest farmers. We conclude that policy-makers must create an enabling environment to support adaptation by increasing access to information, credit and markets, and make a particular effort to reach small-scale subsistence farmers, with limited resources to confront climate change.

We employed propensity score matching with a difference-in-difference estimator to control for endogeneity of mortality to the outcomes of interest. Households losing a productive adult did not replenish the lost labor, regardless of economic status, sex or status of the deceased adult. With the exception of non-poor households, adult mortality resulted in increased dependency ratios, but did not adversely affect households’ expenditure patterns (total, food and non-food expenditures) regardless of the sex and position of the deceased and the economic status of the households. Although food expenditures were protected, a decline in dietary diversity, especially among the poorest households, reflected increased nutrition insecurity associated with adult mortality. "

Using a modification of the \{GTAP\} modeling platform to account for the global interactions of regional biofuel and food markets, the analysis shows that biofuel production levels depend on the assumption about the future price of energy and the nature of the substitutability between biofuels and petroleum-based transport fuels. Low energy prices reduce the demand for biofuels and thus require greater government support to meet the desired production targets. At the other extreme, when prices are high and there is scope for substituting biofuels for petroleum-based fuels, the volume of biofuels produced will exceed the mandates. Even when biofuels are being mainly produced in developed countries, our results indicate that there are impact pathways that extend far beyond the borders of the US, Brazil and the EU. Prices of feedstock and non-feedstock commodities rise in developing countries. There is also a rise in value added from the agricultural sector—a gain that is enjoyed by the owners of land and labor, including unskilled. Hence, to the extent that agriculture is a key sector in getting growth started and addressing poverty needs, the emergence of biofuels can (in this way at least) be a positive force. "

This paper utilizes recent hydrological and meteorological data collected from the Mizewa watershed in the Blue Nile Basin of Ethiopia, as well as household survey data on farmer preferences and investments, in order to better understand the physical impact of sustainable land management activities. The effectiveness of the simulated conservation practices (terraces, bunds, and residue management) is evaluated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool taking into account investment decisions on different terrain types. Simulations include terracing on steep and mid-range hillsides; a mix of terracing and bunds on varying slope gradients; and a mix of terraces and residue management on varying terrain. Simulated conservation practices are evaluated at the outlet of the Mizewa watershed by comparing model simulations that take into account the limited investments that currently exist (status quo) with simulations of increased terracing and residue management activities within the watershed. Results suggest that a mixed strategy of terracing on steep slopes and residue management on flat and middle slopes dramatically decrease surface runoff and erosion. A landscape-wide investment of terraces and bunds throughout the watershed landscape provides the greatest reduction in surface flow and erosion. However, the type and amount of investment in sustainable land management activities have different implications with respect to labor input and may be cost-prohibitive in the medium term. "

Methods We first explored the relationship between serum aflatoxin level and a number of household, farm, and individual characteristics using cross-sectional data on 884 mothers (pregnant or with a child under 24 months). We then used regression analyses to estimate the extent to which the combined characteristics could predict serum aflatoxin levels. We finally used the estimated regression models to predict changes in \{AF\} level when changing a women's characteristics from the most disadvantaged group (setting all socio-economic characteristics to the lowest tertile) to the most advantaged group (highest tertile). Results \{AF\} was detected in all women. The median level of serum AB1-lysine adduct was 7.47 pg/mg albumin. Higher exposure levels were significantly associated with poverty: predicted serum aflatoxin levels in women living in the worst socio-economic conditions were 4.7–7.1 times higher than those with the best socio-economic status.

However, serious challenges continue to plague the agriculture sector, including scarcity of land due to high population density, unbalanced use of fertilizers and pesticides, and great variation in water supply across seasons – from drought to stagnant flood conditions. Further expansion of irrigated area – including through the continued development and improvement of surface water systems – is being eyed by Bangladesh’s Ministry of Agriculture to address many of the remaining challenges facing the country. However, such expansion is not without risks or consequences, and a careful analysis of who benefits from irrigation, and how, must guide development priorities. We examine plot-level data for rice production during Bangladesh’s three rice seasons – aus, boro, and aman – across a nationally-representative household survey in Bangladesh. While rainfall is the most important determinant of rice yield during aus and chemical inputs are most important during aman, access to irrigation has the greatest influence on boro rice yield during the dry season, particularly for the coastal south. The government of Bangladesh is planning massive investments in the southern region for the improved provision of surface water irrigation. The expected decline in groundwater, coupled with our econometric findings, suggests that expanding boro production in the south may not be a good strategy to promote, for the region. Whether brackish shrimp aquaculture can provide an equitable and sustainable livelihood alternative should continue to be a focus of research. "

A conceptual water balance model, based on field data from the Arvari River catchment, was developed to study and understand catchment-scale trade-offs of rainwater harvesting (RWH). The model incorporates an effective representation of \{RWH\} function and impact, and works on a daily time step. Catchment spatial variability is captured through sub-basins. Within each sub-basin hydrological response units (HRUs) describe the different land use/soil combinations associated with the case study catchment, including irrigated agriculture. Sustainability indices, based on irrigated agriculture water demand, were used to compare conceptual management scenarios. The results show that as \{RWH\} area increases, it reaches a limiting capacity from where additional \{RWH\} structures do not increase the benefit to groundwater stores, but reduces stream flow. If the irrigation area is increased at the optimal level of RWH, where the sustainability indices were greatest, the resilience of the system actually decreased. Nevertheless \{RWH\} in a system increased the overall sustainability of the water resource for irrigated agriculture, compared to a system without RWH. Also \{RWH\} provided a slight buffer in the groundwater store when drought occurred. The conceptual analysis highlights the important link between irrigation area and \{RWH\} area, and the impact of \{RWH\} on the catchment water balance. "

However, hydrological impacts of \{RWH\} in India are not well understood, particularly at the larger catchment-scale. A key element to grasping \{RWH\} impact involves understanding the generated recharge variability in time and space, which is the result of variability in rainfall-runoff and efficiency of \{RWH\} structures. Yet there are very few reported empirical studies of the impact of RWH. Catchment-scale impacts are best studied using a water balance model, which would require a basic level of field data and understanding of the variability. This study reports the results of a 2-year field study in the 476 km2 semi-arid Arvari River catchment, where over 366 \{RWH\} structures have been built since 1985. Difficulties associated with working in semi-arid regions include data scarcity. Potential recharge estimates from seven \{RWH\} storages, across three different types and in six landscape positions, were calculated using the water balance method. These estimates were compared with recharge estimates from monitored water levels in 29 dug wells using the water table fluctuation method. The average daily potential recharge from \{RWH\} structures varied between 12 and 52 mm/day, while estimated actual recharge reaching the groundwater ranged from 3 to 7 mm/day. The large difference between recharge estimates could be explained through soil storage, local groundwater mounding beneath structures and a large lateral transmissivity in the aquifer. Overall, approximately 7% of rainfall is recharged by \{RWH\} in the catchment, which was similar in the comparatively wet and dry years of the field analysis. There were key differences between \{RWH\} structures, due to engineering design and location. These results indicate that recharge from \{RWH\} affects the local groundwater table, but also has potential to move laterally and impact surrounding areas. However, the greatest weakness in such analysis is the lack of information available on aquifer characteristics, in addition to geology and soil type. "

Hog farmers that implement better biosecurity practices are more likely to seek high-quality vaccines or buy into hog insurance schemes, but not both. For those households with hog insurance, better biosecurity status, better management practices, and higher-quality vaccines significantly help to reduce loss ratios. However, we also find a moral hazard effect in that higher premium expenditures by the insured households might induce larger loss ratios. "

The case study under consideration is the implementation of a water-resource management plan in a water-scarce region of the world, namely Cyprus. Specifically, this plan proposes to replenish a depleting aquifer with treated wastewater. The proposed methodology first identifies the key stakeholder groups (farmers and the general public) who are hypothesized to derive economic values (benefits) from implementation of this plan, and then uses stated-preference methods to capture the total economic value of these benefits. Benefits are aggregated over the relevant populations of these stakeholder groups and weighed against the total costs of implementing the plan in a long-run cost-benefit analysis (CBA). An econometrically estimated time-declining trajectory of discount rates is used for the \{CBA\} in order to assess the long-run sustainability of the plan. The results reveal that the net benefit trajectory estimated with the time-declining discount rate takes one and a half to three times as long to come to a plateau compared to the constant discount rates of 3.5 and 6%, emphasizing the importance of using declining discount rates and capturing the entirety of the benefits generated by such plans. This methodology is particularly recommended for providing much needed information to support the implementation of the \{EU\} Water Framework Directive, which advocates the use of \{CBA\} with consideration of the notion of sustainability for achieving the “good water status” for all European waters.

This literature assumes that the true point of censoring in the data is zero and, when this is not the case, imparts a bias to parameter estimates of the censored regression model. We conjecture that this bias can be significant; affirm this from experiments; and suggest techniques for mitigating this bias using Bayesian procedures. The bias-mitigating procedures are based on modifications of the key step that facilitates Bayesian estimation of the censored regression model; are easy to implement; work well in both small and large samples; and lead to significantly improved inference in the censored regression model.

In Latin America, some governments have been trying to increase demand for health interventions by making direct payments to poor households contingent on them keeping up-to-date with preventive health services. We undertook a public health programme effectiveness trial in Honduras to assess this approach, contrasting it with a direct transfer of resources to local health teams. Methods 70 municipalities were selected because they had the country's highest prevalence of malnutrition. They were allocated at random to four groups: money to households; resources to local health teams combined with a community-based nutrition intervention; both packages; and neither. Evaluation surveys of about 5600 households were undertaken at baseline and roughly 2 years later. Pregnant women and mothers of children younger than 3 years old were asked about use of health services (primary outcome) and coverage of interventions such as immunisation and growth monitoring (secondary outcome). Reports were supplemented with data from children's health cards and government service utilisation data. Analysis was by mixed effects regression, accounting for the municipality-level randomisation. Findings The household-level intervention had a large impact (15–20 percentage points; p&lt;0·01) on the reported coverage of antenatal care and well-child check-ups. Childhood immunisation series could thus be started more opportunely, and the coverage of growth monitoring was markedly increased (15–21 percentage points; p&lt;0·01. Measles and tetanus toxoid immunisation were not affected. The transfer of resources to local health teams could not be implemented properly because of legal complications.

The new situation is not linear and easily predictable, but there remains the need to act – by both the private and public sectors – in this rapidly changing environment.

We apply duration analysis to identify the factors that shorten the time until a farmer replaces one modern variety by another, and test hypotheses concerning two recurring themes of the Green Revolution: farm size differences and the role of information sources in seed diffusion. We find that time to adoption averages only 4 years, but is shorter on larger farms. Factors that speed variety change also differ by farm size. Extension and media sources of information significantly influence adoption among larger farmers relative to information gained through social relationships, but this is not the case for marginal farmers. Traits related to consumption quality speed adoption on smaller wheat farms, where families both sell and consume their wheat; higher yields drive adoption for the most subsistence-oriented, marginal group.

Evidence shows that cassava-based ethanol production is more profitable than other feedstock options. Cassava also generates more “pro-poor” growth than sugarcane-based systems. However, if smallholder yields can be improved rather than expanding cultivated land, then both sugarcane and cassava out-grower schemes generate similar pro-poor outcomes. We conclude that, in so far as the public investments needed to establish a biofuels industry are consistent with other development needs, then producing biofuels will enhance economic development in countries like Tanzania.

Both have been selected as modeling tools to support decision and policy making in management of the Illinois River Basin, the United States. This paper reports results calibrating and evaluating \{SWAT\} and \{HSPF\} model to hydrologic data in the Illinois River Basin, with relative performance of two models in hydrologic simulation and model behaviors under calibration being further compared. In this study, two different calibration approaches, the multi-criteria and the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) method, were used to quantify uncertainties originated from the use of multi-site discharge observations and the presence of equifinal solutions. It is concluded that both models achieved satisfactory performance after the calibration, and the parameter identification of each model was subject to considerable uncertainties. Furthermore, there exist parameter sets that enable the \{HSPF\} model to generate more accurate predictions of the discharges in the main stem of the Illinois River than the \{SWAT\} model does, but when the two models were run in un-calibrated mode the distributions of the model fit summary statistics for \{HSPF\} observed in the Monte Carlo sampling during \{GLUE\} calibration are more varied than those for \{SWAT\} with heavier tails on the inferior side and \{SWAT\} would have comparable performance to \{HSPF\} on average. This finding implies that the accuracy that the \{HSPF\} model can achieve in a modeling exercise may have more reliance on the efficacy of the calibration procedure, and the application of \{SWAT\} may have some advantage when calibration data are lacking or scarce.

These impacts are likely to become more pressing as a consequence of rising demands for meat, eggs and dairy products. Theoretically, these impacts could be reduced by making the global food system more efficient or by dietary changes, as recent studies suggest. However, multiple feedbacks exist in the agricultural system, which may reduce the effectiveness of any promising change. Estimation of these effects is highly uncertain and depends on the tools applied. In this study, we used two different economic models (IMPACT and LEITAP), coupled to the integrated assessment model IMAGE, to examine different options to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture: dietary changes (less meat and dairy), increased production efficiency, and reduced food waste. In a detailed model comparison, we assessed the model results on consumption, agricultural production, commodity prices, land-use change and greenhouse gas emissions, and identified feedbacks in the global agricultural system. In both models, all options resulted in a reduction in agricultural land use and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as in agricultural commodity prices. The model results show that for most options less than the theoretical environmental gains would actually be achieved, due to price feedbacks leading to increased consumption and less intensive production. On the other hand, larger than expected effects could occur as a result of reduced European consumption. However, large differences were found between the \{IMPACT\} and \{LEITAP\} model calculations. We attribute these differences to model design and parameterisation, discuss implications and sketch ways forward to improve studies of future dynamics in the global agricultural system. The most pertinent discrepancies between the model results were related to the models’ implementation of international trade, determining to what extent current trade patterns are retained, the assumptions on technological change, which have major implications for future price developments, and the treatment of agricultural expansion, which strongly affects how agricultural land use reacts under certain policy options. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to compare different economic models in a consistent scenario study, and the results indicate the need for model improvements and show that data harmonisation and more extensive model comparisons are needed.

Building on an approach suggested in a 1996 article, this paper constructs a series of alternative food-security indicators based on the frequency and severity of consumption-related coping strategies. These alternative indicators are then compared with more standard measures, including a consumption benchmark, a poverty benchmark and a nutritional benchmark using data from the 1997 Accra Urban Food and Nutrition Study. Against these more traditional indicators, the coping strategy indicators are best at ruling out cases—that is, minimizing the risk of classifying a food-insecure household as food-secure. They also help to identify sources of vulnerability and the trade-offs made with other basic needs to acquire sufficient food. The measures outlined here are much less time-consuming and less expensive in terms of data collection and analysis, and therefore perhaps offer a pragmatic alternative to food and livelihood program managers. However, the comparative analysis of conventional benchmarks with the coping strategies indicator reveals some shortcomings with the benchmark indicators as well—a sign that perhaps the indicators of food security proposed here are both alternative and complementary measures.

A dynamic model is specified and estimated using pooled time-series and cross-section (state- level) data for the USA. Changes in demand parameters over time are examined by using successive, over-lapping ten-year sample periods for data from 1955–78 for parameter estimation. The results show that there have been significant structural changes in demand elasticities for several independent variables. These changes can be best explained by changes in household stocks of major electric appliances as new technologies have been developed, improved, and ingrained in consumer lifestyles and preference functions over time. Further inquiry shows no strong evidence of structural changes associated with either the reversal of the declining trend of electricity prices or the 1973 oil embargo. However, more data after the oil embargo may be needed to validate the existence of price asymmetries in electricity demand. "

In this article, we determine the effects of an innovative \{SSB\} tax on weight and obesity in New York City adults. Methods Dynamic weight loss models were used to estimate the effects of an expected 5800-calorie reduction resulting from an \{SSB\} tax on weight and obesity. Baseline data were derived from the New York City Community Health Survey. One, five, and 10-year simulations of weight loss were performed. Results Calorie reductions resulted in a per-person weight loss of 0.46 kg in year 1 and 0.92 kg in year 10. A total of 5,531,059 kg was expected to be lost over 10 years when weighted to the full New York City adult population. Approximately 50% of overall bodyweight loss occurred within the first year, and 95% within 5 years. Results showed consistent but nonsignificant decreases in obesity prevalence. Conclusions \{SSB\} taxes may be viable strategies to reduce obesity when combined with other interventions to maximize effects in the population. "

abstract = "SummaryBackground Food-assisted maternal and child health and nutrition programmes usually target underweight children younger than 5 years of age. Previous evidence suggests that targeting nutrition interventions earlier in life, before children become undernourished, might be more effective for reduction of childhood undernutrition. Methods We used a cluster randomised trial to compare two World Vision programmes for maternal and child health and nutrition, which included a behaviour change and communication component: a preventive model, targeting all children aged 6–23 months; and a recuperative model, targeting underweight (weight-for-age Z score &lt;−2) children aged 6–60 months. Both models also targeted pregnant and lactating women. Clusters of communities (n=20) were paired on access to services and other factors and were randomly assigned to each model. Using two cross-sectional surveys (at baseline and 3 years later), we tested differences in undernutrition in children aged 12–41 months (roughly 1500 children per survey). Analyses were by intention to treat, both by pair-wise community-level comparisons and by child-level analyses adjusting for the clustering effect and child age and sex. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00210418. Findings There were no differences between programme groups at baseline. At follow-up, stunting, underweight, and wasting (using \{WHO\} 2006 reference data) were 4–6 percentage points lower in preventive than in recuperative communities; and mean anthropometric indicators were higher by +0·14 Z scores (height for age; p=0·07), and +0·24 Z scores (weight for age and weight for height; p&lt;0·0001). The effect was greater in children exposed to the preventive programme for the full span between 6 and 23 months of age than in children exposed for shorter durations during this period. The quality of implementation did not differ between the two programmes; nor did use of services for maternal and child health and nutrition. Interpretation The preventive programme was more effective for the reduction of childhood undernutrition than the traditional recuperative model. "

First, rigidities in domestic output supply responses could preclude significant export growth. Second, external demand-side constraints could impede export revenue growth if a jointly promoted export-led strategy resulted in world market price deterioration. Analysis reveals that in the case of sub-Saharan Africa neither of the above factors should cause a failure of structural adjustment policies.

The phytate reduction (80–86%) in these sorghums significantly increased zinc availability. The Caco-2 cell method, but not the dialysability assay, proved useful in estimating zinc absorption. The measured increase in iron availability differed between the methods, possibly due to the effect of varying mineral (Ca, Fe, Zn, P) contents of the sorghums. This effect was most prominent in the iron uptake results.

Our data show that, although the potential is high, the insufficient supply of irrigation water, excessively expensive chemical fertilizer, and moderately costly labor hinder the scheme from achieving that potential. First of all, an improvement in irrigation is crucial as it increases yield not only directly but also indirectly through its complementary relationship to chemical fertilizer. We also find that an improvement in credit access is important as it can increase the application of chemical fertilizer and labor by making the acquisition of these expensive inputs through markets possible. The unavailability of hired and exchange labor during peak seasons is another constraint to the intensive use of labor. The introduction of rice varieties with a shorter maturity duration would relax the timing of transplanting and thus spread out the peak seasons’ labor demand. "

In the Indus River Basin, local scale water productivity decisions are affected by international and intra-national scale water governance. Water availability and productivity is modulated by the Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan, and within Pakistan by the agreements governing water allocation between and within provinces. Much of the literature on governance at multiple scales in the Indus basin, and others, has employed qualitative methods of institutional analysis. This paper extends that approach with quantitative modeling of surface water allocation rules at multiple scales and the consequent economic impact on water use and productivity in the Indus River of Pakistan. The effects of the existing water allocation mechanisms on the ability to adapt to possible future climate conditions are examined. The study is conducted using the Indus Basin Model Revised – Multi-Year (IBMR–MY), a hydro-agro-economic model of the Indus River within Pakistan that simulates river and canal flows, groundwater pumping, water use and economic activities with a distributed, partial equilibrium model of the local scale agro-economic activities in the basin. Results suggest that without changes in response to changing conditions, the current governance mechanisms impede the provinces’ ability to adapt to changing climate conditions, in ways that are significant, inflicting economic costs under both high and low flow conditions. However surface water allocation between the provinces does not appear to hinder adaptation. The greatest gains for economic water allocation are achieved at the sub-provincial level. The results imply that adaptive mechanisms for water allocation that allow response to changing climate conditions within provinces may be a promising adaptive response in the Indus Basin. "

The reason is not always because these practices are uneconomical but sometimes it is because resource poverty prevents farmers from taking advantage of yield and income enhancing agricultural practices. In this study we examine the relative merits of using a carbon payment scheme compared to a subsidy policy to help reduce the cost of specific land management practices with productivity and ecosystem benefits such as carbon sequestration. Using a 30-year crop simulation model, we examine the impacts of different soil fertility management treatments (SFTs) on yields and soil carbon and proceed to compute discounted incremental revenue streams over the same period. We find that the \{SFTs\} simulated are on average profitable given the conditions assumed in our \{DSSAT\} simulations. When carbon was priced at $8 or $12/t CO2e, the increase in incremental incomes generated from a carbon payment were invariably higher than those imputed from a 50% fertilizer subsidy. When carbon was priced at $4/Co2e, the increase was almost similar and sometimes higher than that from the imputed income transfer from a 50% subsidy. If these indications hold in further research, it could imply that using fertilizer subsidies as the sole mechanism for stimulating adoption of improved soil fertility management practices may unnecessarily forgo other complementary and possibly superior alternatives. Depending on the specific economic equity considerations, we conclude that either of these instruments can be used to help farmers break through resource barriers that prevent them from adopting productivity-enhancing and environmentally beneficial agricultural practices. However, given the fiscal burden on public finances and possible opportunity costs of any substantial subsidy program, it is possible that a carbon payment system can be a reasonable alternative assuming the range of carbon prices used in this study and especially if accompanied by measures to ameliorate the costs of fertilizer to farmers.

Available cost estimates for adaptation investments are employed to explore adaptation strategies. The simulation analysis suggests that in the absence of policy-led adaptation investments, real \{GDP\} towards the middle of the century will be 6.5% lower than in a hypothetical baseline without climate change. A combination of adaptation measures, that include coastal protection investments for vulnerable sections along the low-lying Nile delta, support for changes in crop management practices and investments to raise irrigation efficiency, could reduce the \{GDP\} loss in 2050 to around 2.6%. Further work along these lines for developing countries in climate change hotspot regions deserves a high priority on the research agenda in economic modelling. "

Therefore, we test the impact of both nutrition information, and branding and certification, as well as the nature of the brand and of the certifying authority (state level versus international), on consumer demand for HIPM. We find that even in the absence of nutrition information, consumers assign a small but significant premium to the \{HIPM\} variety relative to the local variety. This is consistent with consumers’ more favorable rating of the sensory characteristics of the high-iron variety. Nutrition information on the health benefits of \{HIPM\} increases this premium substantially, and regression analysis reveals that consumers prefer international branding and international certification authority to their state-level counterparts.

With expansion of arable land and resultant decline in grazing resources, crop residues are becoming an increasingly important component of livestock feeds. This demand for livestock feeds has implications for the long-term sustainability of such systems since failure to return biomass to soils has implications for soil quality and the capacity of soils to support long-term productivity. Biomass allocation patterns are likely to vary with overall level of productivity and hence availability. In this study we used a household survey to quantify crop residue allocation patterns across a gradient of productivity in Eastern Africa focusing on two sites in Ethiopia and one in Kenya. We assessed the underlying determinants of crop residue allocation patterns with a view to understanding how productivity increases through intensification will influence biomass allocation in Eastern Africa and how livelihood and natural resource management objectives could be optimized. Results showed that farmers strongly favour allocation of residues to livestock feeding but that allocation to soil increases along the productivity gradient. This reduced feeding to livestock and increased allocation to soil fertility is associated with smaller farm sizes leading to reduced animal traction needs for tillage, increased overall livestock productivity, increased use of inputs and a reduced reliance on farm-based activities in overall livelihood strategies. The implications of these trends are that productivity increases in smallholder systems are likely to reduce pressure on biomass in the long term and that measures that enhance the prospects for farmers to intensify their production systems are likely to increase soil health and sustainability objectives in general. A key conclusion of the work is that intensification of livestock production could reduce crop residue allocation to soils with long term implications for soil productivity. "

Obesity strongly predicted gross mobility (GM) disability, and the number of chronic conditions strongly predicted all outcomes, especially in women.

abstract = "This paper develops a unified empirical framework for describing the relative contribution of rural–urban and inland–coastal inequality to overall regional inequality in China during the 1980's and 1990's. The framework assesses rural–urban and inland–coastal inequalities from the same data set, presents results for a sufficiently long time period to transcend short-term fluctuations, allows for differential price changes, and applies a consistent notion of the contribution to inequality using a decomposition analysis. While the contribution of rural–urban inequality is much higher than that of inland–coastal inequality in terms of levels, the trend is very different. The rural–urban contribution has not changed very much over time, but the inland–coastal contribution has increased by several fold. The paper ends by investigating the role of labor migration in this outcome. J. Comp. Econom., December 1999, 27(4), pp. 686–701.

This review focuses particularly on those changes in which children are the victims and which induce new threats for them, rather than on problems such as child disability or mental illness. The outcome variables of interest in this paper are dimensions of children's psychosocial development, including cognitive development, psychological adjustment and aggression, whereas the companion paper in this issue (Caldwell P., Child survival: vulnerability and resilience in adversity in the European past and the contemporary Third World, Soc. Sci. Med.) [1] focuses on physical aspects of children's development. The risks that are hurdles in the process of development of a young child begin from conception and carry on into later life. To address them all would be impossible; thus, in order to do justice to the issues at hand, we have chosen those risks that, in our view, are important in a child's psychosocial development in developing countries. This paper will thus provide a discussion of the concepts of risk and resilience, then apply these concepts to the analysis of three examples of risk faced by children today: nutritional threats (e.g. malnutrition due to decline in breastfeeding); family dynamics and types of family forms (e.g. child fostering and non-traditional families); and experiences of violence (domestic or political). In each case, the same four questions will be addressed: what are the consequences of the risk factor for children, what are the etiologies and conditions of risk, are there any children who seem to cope with the risk factor successfully and what are some of the protective factors, and what interventions or programs would help support these children?

In order to mitigate the global food commodity price pressure on domestic markets, several major exporting and importing countries, mostly developing economies, adopted trade policy changes such as export bans (or raising export restrictions) or reducing import tariffs during the same period. This paper estimates the potential impacts of these policies on the world prices and trade of major agricultural commodities using a set of multi-country, multi-commodity, and partial-equilibrium models. Our findings suggest that over all, the trade policy responses in various countries increased the prices of all agricultural commodities, although the impact on the total net trade varies by commodity. The simulation results show that the overall impact of trade policy distortions on the world rice price is most significant at 24%, followed by wheat (14%) and barley (9%). In general, the poorer food-deficit countries/regions, which have limited power to manipulate their trade policies, experienced higher price increases compared to those major trading countries that adopted policy interventions. Also, the developing countries that are net importers which did not implement trade policy interventions experienced significant welfare losses resulting from interventions implemented by other major trading countries.

Attention is focussed on the possibilities for simultaneously addressing poverty alleviation and sustainable natural resource management.

We investigated the direct effect of a nutrition intervention in early childhood on adult economic productivity. Methods We obtained economic data from 1424 Guatemalan individuals (aged 25–42 years) between 2002 and 2004. They accounted for 60% of the 2392 children (aged 0–7 years) who had been enrolled in a nutrition intervention study during 1969–77. In this initial study, two villages were randomly assigned a nutritious supplement (atole) for all children and two villages a less nutritious one (fresco). We estimated annual income, hours worked, and average hourly wages from all economic activities. We used linear regression models, adjusting for potentially confounding factors, to assess the relation between economic variables and exposure to atole or fresco at specific ages between birth and 7 years. Findings Exposure to atole before, but not after, age 3 years was associated with higher hourly wages, but only for men. For exposure to atole from 0 to 2 years, the increase was US$0·67 per hour (95% \{CI\} 0·16–1·17), which meant a 46% increase in average wages. There was a non-significant tendency for hours worked to be reduced and for annual incomes to be greater for those exposed to atole from 0 to 2 years. Interpretation Improving nutrition in early childhood led to substantial increases in wage rates for men, which suggests that investments in early childhood nutrition can be long-term drivers of economic growth.

Trends in cooperative organization in east-African dairy are evaluated. Empirical work focuses on alternative techniques for effecting participation among a representative sample of peri-urban milk producers in the Ethiopian highlands. The variables considered are a modern production practice (cross-bred cow use), a traditional production practice (indigenous-cow use), three intellectual-capital-forming variables (experience, education, and extension), and the provision of infrastructure (as measured by time to transport milk to market). A Tobit analysis of marketable surplus generates precise estimates of non-participants’ ‘distances’ to market and their reservation levels of the covariates — measures of the inputs necessary to sustain and enhance the market. Policy implications focus on the availability of cross-bred stock and the level of market infrastructure, both of which have marked effects on participation, the velocity of transactions in the local community and, inevitably, the social returns to agroindustrialization.

The mismatch between the mainly annual funding support for this conservation effort and its very long-term nature and intent is a serious concern. Using the results of five \{CGIAR\} genebank case studies (accounting for 87% of the total \{CGIAR\} genebank holdings), we estimate the size of an endowment or trust fund that would be required to assure a funding stream to conserve this genetic material for future generations. The annual cost (in year 2000 US$) of conserving and distributing the genetic material presently held in all 11 \{CGIAR\} genebanks is estimated to be 5.7 million US$ (mUS$), which could be maintained for all future generations by setting aside a fund of 149 mUS$ (invested at a real rate of interest of 4% per annum). This would be sufficient to underwrite the costs for the CGIAR’s current conservation activities in perpetuity (estimated to be 61 mUS$), as well as the cost of maintaining the distribution activities (88 mUS$) that provide germplasm to breeders, scientists, farmers and others world wide.

However, little is known about the larger-scale implications of future irrigation shortfalls for global trade and economic welfare, as well as of the potential buffering impacts of international trade on the local impacts of irrigation shortage. In this paper, we utilize a recently developed model, GTAP-BIO-W, to study the economic effects of changes in irrigation outlook for 126 river basins, globally by 2030. Projected irrigation availability is obtained from the IMPACT-WATER model, and imposed upon the present-day economy. Irrigation availability in 2030 is expected to drop by 30–60% in several key rivers basins, including: Hai He, Indus, Luni, and the Eastern Mediterranean basin, leading to significant output declines in China, South Asia, and the Middle East. We find that the regional production impacts of future irrigation water shortages are quite heterogeneous, depending on the size of the shortfall, the irrigation intensity of crop production, the possibility of expanding rainfed areas, as well as the crop mix. These changes in regional output significantly alter the geography of international trade. To compensate for the loss of productivity caused by the irrigation constraint, an estimated 7.6 million hectares of cropland expansion is needed to meet the demand for food. In spite of the remarkable reduction of irrigation in some basins, the resulting welfare impact is relatively modest as a result of the buffering capacity of global markets. The global welfare loss amounts to $3.7 billion (2001 prices) and results from a combination of the reduction in irrigation availability as well as the interplay with agricultural support policies.

In this paper, we use data from the 2008 National Livestock Census to develop a better understanding of where in Uganda there might be potential for significant investment to intensify the production of livestock and, conversely, where there are important challenges that need to be addressed, such as conflicts between human populations and livestock. This analysis is done by developing a quantitative model to predict mean livestock stocking rates at sub-county level (n = 929) that uses population density, agroecological factors, and market access as explanatory variables. A mapping of model residuals approach is then used to identify areas in Uganda that are relatively understocked and those that are potentially overstocked. This information is used to suggest approaches to livestock development in both types of areas. "

Sources of change are associated with each region's international competitiveness, the relative openness of the \{EC\} market, the degree of trade preference enjoyed by the region, and the \{EC\} global import growth. The main contribution to the \{LDC\} export growth of fruit and vegetables to \{EC\} between 1975–79 and 1985–89 is found to be attributable to the global import growth effect. However, it has been significantly counteracted by the negative effect of a declining share of non-EC suppliers as a group. Marked interregional differences in changes in regional preferences show a lack of a strong correlation between \{LDC\} export performance and the existence of preferential trade agreements with EC. While the potential for \{LDC\} export growth to \{EC\} is clear, the results seem to indicate that in general \{EC\} protection policies have adversely affected import growth from LDCs. Various factors influencing \{LDC\} export performance in horticultural products are discussed. Apart from \{EC\} protection policies and changes in trade preferences, domestic supply factors are of significance in explaining export growth, including a liberal trading environment, but also specific policies to promote exports of horticultural products. While non-price competition weakens the discriminatory effect of preferential tariffs, there is a pressing need for developing countries to adapt to the demands of the European distribution system relating to quality, grades, and regularity of supplies.

It is demonstrated that transportation costs explain most of the differences in food prices between producer regions and that road quality is an important factor in the transportation costs.

However, in large and highly nonlinear models, these algorithms can fail to find feasible solutions, or converge to local solutions which are not global. Evolutionary search procedures in general, and genetic algorithms (GAs) specifically, are less susceptible to the presence of local solutions. However, they often exhibit slow convergence, especially when there are many variables, and have problems finding feasible solutions in constrained problems with “narrow” feasible regions. In this paper, we describe strategies for solving large nonlinear water resources models management, which combine \{GAs\} with linear programming. The key idea is to identify a set of complicating variables in the model which, when fixed, render the problem linear in the remaining variables. The complicating variables are then varied by a GA. This GA&amp;LP approach is applied to two nonlinear models: a reservoir operation model with nonlinear hydropower generation equations and nonlinear reservoir topologic equations, and a long-term dynamic river basin planning model with a large number of nonlinear relationships. For smaller instances of the reservoir model, the \{CONOPT2\} nonlinear solver is more accurate and faster, but for larger instances, the GA&amp;LP approach finds solutions with significantly better objective values. The multiperiod river basin model is much too large to be solved in its entirety. The complicating variables are chosen here so that, when they are fixed, each period's model is linear, and these models can be solved sequentially. This approach allows sufficient model detail to be retained so that long-term sustainability issues can be explored. "

Based on survey data from 178 charcoal traders, this paper studies the regulated charcoal trade in Madagascar and tests if regulatory control through a licensing system leads to rents (i.e., excess payments above those required to induce or provide for production) in charcoal trade. Two main findings were made. First, annual gross margins are significantly higher for traders in the regulated low-value charcoal industry compared to traders in the unregulated agricultural sector. Moreover, differences in transaction characteristics cannot explain the disparities in margins. This evidence suggests that at least part of rents is captured by intermediaries (e.g. traders), and that these rents are not trivial (gross margins in charcoal trade are more than twice as large as in agricultural trade). Second, traders in the charcoal sector with more government connections have greater access to the rents that stem from charcoal regulation. A significant portion of charcoal trade circumvents regulation suggesting that traders' margins are increasing in rent-specific social capital (i.e. number of government officials known). This is in stark contrast to the agricultural sector where no such effect is found. Efforts to design or reform policies intended to prevent deforestation and forest degradation through licensing, must clearly take this into account. "

The model presented in the paper provides a framework for analysing various afforestation and technology policies to increase the sustainable use of forest tree resources. The optimal conditions for choosing the levels of land clearing for various uses of refugee population are derived. The model parameters are used to identify the optimal timing and rate of afforestation that will attain a dynamic equilibrium of forest tree resources. Several policy implications are derived from the model results for reducing the environmental degradation of forest resources due to the presence of refugees. It is argued that the general environmental regulation policies based on user-pay principles may not be appropriate under the refugee situation and that additional intervention is needed by the host government and international relief agencies for reversing the trends in deforestation.

Our results suggest that the fertilizer subsidy program had very small effects on the growth rates of grain prices between the post-planting and post-harvesting seasons. We also find that political influence played a role in the distribution of subsidized fertilizer. We discuss how the weak effects on the price growth rates may be caused by low market orientation, output market structures, greater focus on farmers’ incomes, low marginal productivity of fertilizer, and politically influenced targeting.

Study design We used prospective data on maternal body size and composition collected from women who participated in a randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of preconceptional micronutrient supplements (PRECONCEPT) on birth outcomes in Thai Nguyen province, Vietnam (n = 1436). Anthropometric measurements were obtained before conception through delivery by trained health workers. The relationship between prepregnancy nutritional status indicators, gestational weight gain (GWG) and birth outcomes were examined using generalized linear models, adjusting for potential confounding factors. Results Maternal prepregnancy weight (PPW) was the strongest anthropometric indicator predicting infant birth size. A 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in \{PPW\} (5.4 kg) was associated with a 283 g (95%CI: 279–286) increase in birthweight. A similar and independent association was observed with birthweight for an increase of 1 \{SD\} in gestational weight gain (4 kg) (250 g; 95% CI: 245–255). Women with a \{PPW\} &lt;43 kg or who gained &lt;8 kg during their pregnancy were more likely to give birth to a \{SGA\} (OR 2.9: 95%CI 1.9–4.5, \{OR\} 3.3: 95%CI 2.2–5.1) or \{LBW\} infant (OR 3.1: 95%CI 1.5–6.2, \{OR\} 3.4: 95%CI 1.6–7.2), respectively. Conclusions These findings indicate that clinical care and programs aimed at improving birth outcomes will have the greatest impact if they address maternal nutrition both before and during pregnancy. Women with a \{PPW\} &lt;43 kg or a \{GWG\} &lt;8 kg are at greatest risk for poor birth outcomes in this setting. Preconception counseling and clinical care to obtain a healthy weight prior to pregnancy along with routine obstetric care on gestational weight gain is critical to improve birth outcomes.

However, barriers to adoption may include low levels of knowledge regarding pests and natural enemies, and the difficulties associated with coordinating among community members. The acts of practicing cautious spraying and of leaving aside land as non-crop habitat (NCH) for natural enemies incur private costs for benefits shared by the community. In this study we tie together several objectives within the analysis of a framed field experiment built around pest management decisions in a smallholder agricultural context. We present results from a within-subjects design (multiple treatments per game group) that estimates a decision model which links behavior back to characteristics of the game, the players, and their group. We examine the relative role these sets of characteristics have in explaining variations in the modeled decisions, including how farmers respond to a nudge (a flat subsidy for allowing land to sit as non-crop habitat) to promote natural enemy services on the land. We observe that group-level characteristics appear to have the greatest roles in explaining how decisions by individuals are made. That is to say, the decision of whether to adopt greater use of \{NCH\} has more to do with those around the farmer than the traits of the farmer him or herself. From a policy point of view, it is a signal that (if such game outcomes have any bearing on farm-level decisions) conventional data tools (such as household-level data products from household surveys or censuses) may be inadequate in evaluating appropriate incentives, and newer approaches that identify social networks and neighbor/community interactions may be important.

Crop residues are used for mulch, livestock feed, and fuel material in crop-livestock farming systems. In this article, we conducted long-term simulation modelling to compare the economic effects of different crop residue retention practices for a crop-livestock agricultural household in semi-arid China. We calculated the average profit and net present value (and associated variability) of different crop residue retention practices using planning horizons of 3, 6, 10, and 20 years. Crop residue retention increased grain production, reduced forage production leading to smaller livestock flock sizes, and increased family heating and cooking costs. The net effect was that retaining minimal crop residues gave the highest profits using the three year planning horizon. Full crop residue retention provided the highest profit when the planning horizon exceeded 10 years. Relatively flat economic payoffs associated with changing crop residue usage around the maximum economic payoff existed. Calls for comprehensive crop residue retention are unlikely to be attractive when farmers discount future profits, and when crop residues have significant value as a fuel and feed source. The economic benefits of crop residue retention can take numerous years to eventuate and retaining crop residues also increased simulated ground cover and this positive environmental impact extends beyond individual farm boundaries. Because of these time lags and external environmental benefits, providing financial incentives to retain crop residues during the initial transition years could be a policy option. "

Meanwhile, the flow at the watershed outlet, which was recorded when the discharge at the perennial stream head diminishes to zero, is identified for each recession event. As evidenced by a correlation coefficient of 0.90, these two characteristic flows are found to be highly correlated, suggesting a fundamental linkage between the transition of base flow recession from early stage to late stage and the drying up of ephemeral streams. During the early stage, the contraction of ephemeral streams largely controls the recession behavior, whereas in the late stage when perennial streams dominate the flowing streams, the contraction of flowing streams is minimal and groundwater hydraulics governs the recession behavior.

The univariate return period for three drought characteristics (duration, severity and peak intensity) is examined regarding whether drought has occurred with longer duration, higher severity and/or larger peak intensity. The spatial variation of those changes is analyzed through eight areas in the study region. The temporal and spatial comparisons based on the univariate return period show different change patterns of duration, severity and peak intensity in different areas. Generally, in the areas which plant wheat more than rice (areas 1 and 2), drought has been alleviated in duration and intensity after 1955; while in the areas which plant more rice than wheat (areas 3–8), drought have been aggravated in duration, severity and intensity (except for area 8, a coastal area). This spatial change pattern may imply potential crop pattern change, for example, switching from rice to wheat in areas 3–7. Furthermore, the bivariate return period for pairs of drought characteristics based on the copulas and considering correlation between the drought characteristics is examined to understand how bivariate return periods change over time and space. Finally, it is also found that one data set (Sheffield et al.) results in more severe, longer and more intense drought in most of the areas, especially for the drought events with long-return-periods than the other (Dai).

But climate change may place substantial stress on these sectors within this archipelago. This paper assesses the potential economic impact of two important climate change adaptation strategies in Fiji, natural resource management (NRM) and aquaculture, using a market fish supply–demand model. The model undertakes a comparative analysis of alternative fisheries development scenarios for 2035 and 2050, while taking account of the impact of climate change on the fisheries sector. The modeling and scenario analyses show that promoting aquaculture can help raise aggregate fish production, consumption, and trade. However, the required increases in aquaculture could be massive. While aquaculture development alone is unlikely to meet the growing excess demand for fish in Fiji, it will be an important component in adapting to the negative effects of climate change on capture fisheries. Various \{NRM\} strategies, such as marine protected areas (MPAs) and locally managed marine areas (LMMAs), are projected to have positive impacts in Fiji, expanding the stock and catch of fish. But current efforts on various \{NRM\} strategies are too small to have any meaningful impact to reverse the declining trends of coastal fisheries catch. Efforts would need to be greatly scaled-up to achieve significant production gains. "

The modeling approach used in this paper represents climate change in terms of supply shocks, and works out its economic consequences using the microeconomic tools of supply and demand. The analysis has considered three time periods: current (represented by the average data of the three most recent available years 2006–2009), medium term (2035), and long term (2050). The study covers all fisheries and aquaculture species, grouped into six key subsectors: tuna, other oceanic finfish, coastal finfish, coastal invertebrates, freshwater finfish, and freshwater invertebrates. Results of the baseline model indicate that with rising per capita income and population, fish demand is expected to increase substantially up to 2050. In contrast to significant growth in fish demand, growth in domestic fish production is projected to be slow due to climate change and other constraints. There is a strong likelihood that many Pacific countries will become large net importers of fish under the baseline scenario (i.e., without implementing climate change adaptation strategies). Likewise, per capita consumption of domestically produced fish is projected to decline under the baseline scenario. "

The knowledge, perceptions and attitudes regarding the law among local Land Administration Committee (LAC) members, local conflict mediators and a sample of rural households are investigated. We find that the rented area restriction is commonly violated and not enforced. The law is circumvented by framing sharecropping as something other than land rental, although sharecropping is the dominant land rental contract in the region. When it is made clear that the law may hurt weak and vulnerable (often female-headed) households that are unable to farm their land themselves and therefore rent it out, the large majority of \{LAC\} members, conflict mediators and rural households are against the law.

We review and analyze the literature on this structural approach and present a case study that follows this methodology, explicitly modeling drought and heat tolerant crop varieties. We show that yield gains from adoption of these varieties differ by technology and region, but are generally comparable in scale to (and thus able to offset) adverse effects of climate change. However, yield increases over the projection period are dominated by the effects of growth in population, income, and general productivity, highlighting the importance of joint assessment of biophysical and socioeconomic drivers to better understand climate impacts and responses.

The results show that households face considerable challenges in adapting to climate change. While many households have made small adjustments to their farming practices in response to climate change (in particular, changing planting decisions), few households are able to make more costly investments, for example in agroforestry or irrigation, although there is a desire to invest in such measures.

Based on a unique dataset from a large-scale village and farm survey in five provinces in the NCP, an econometric model of farmers’ adaptation practices is estimated. Results show that when faced with a more severe drought, farmers change their management practices to mitigate its effects by adjusting seeding or harvesting dates and enhancing irrigation intensity. The provisions of early warning and prevention information and policy supports against drought facilitate farmers to make farm management adaptations. However, the effectiveness of early warning and prevention information or policy supports differs by their provision channels or types. The findings of this study have policy implications in coping with the rising frequency and seriousness of extreme weather events in China as a whole and in ecologically more vulnerable \{NCP\} in particular.

The steady water supply sustained by the High Aswan Dam increased transport productivity, and year round availability of predictable and adequate water sustained a shift towards more valuable summer crops. These static effects are worth \{EGP\} 4.9 billion. Investments in transport and agriculture increased as a consequence; these investments, assuming that Egypt is a small open economy, added another \{EGP\} 1.1 billion to the value of the Dam.

The literature on modern trade and growth theory spell out conditions of sustained economic growth that are, nearly by definition, opposite to the conditions that hold for LFAs. Although the institutional economics literature is very much focused at the country level, it is clear that for \{LFAs\} with inadequate institutions and infrastructure, the effects of trade-led growth is often irrelevant. Further trade liberalisation will entail small or even detrimental effects for LFAs, with an exception for products suffering from tariff escalation and/or peak tariffs. The prevailing problem seems to be the lacking supply response to (international) price changes. The literature contains evidence that long-term growth strategies for less-favoured areas require the development of institutions and infrastructure. "

While the consensus within the literature is that biofuel emergence is likely to have some effect on future world agricultural market, there is a considerable range in the estimated size of the impact. Despite the importance of this topic to policy makers, there has been no study that has tried to reconcile the differences among various outlook studies. This paper undertakes an in-depth review of some key outlook studies which quantify the impacts of biofuels on agricultural commodities, and which are based on either general-equilibrium (GE) or partial-equilibrium (PE) modeling approaches. We attempt to reconcile the systematic differences in the estimated impacts of biofuel production growth on the prospective prices and production of three major feedstock commodities, maize, sugar cane, and oilseeds across these studies. Despite the fact that all models predict positive impacts on prices and production, there are large differences among the studies. Our findings point to a number of key assumptions and structural differences that seem to jointly drive the variations we observe, across these studies. The differences among the \{PE\} models are mainly due to differences in the design of scenarios, the presence or absence of biofuel trade, and the structural way in which agricultural and energy market linkages are modeled. The differences among the \{GE\} models are likely to be driven by model assumptions on agricultural land supply, the inclusion of the byproducts, and assumptions on crude oil prices and the elasticity of substitution between petroleum and biofuels.

Carotenoid content and hence vitamin A activity of the gari products decreased markedly with time and temperature. Trans-β-carotene degradation fitted well the kinetics predicted by the Arrhenius model, in particular for BG. Activation energies for trans-β-carotene were 60.4 and 81.0 kJ mol−1 for \{BG\} and \{RPG\} respectively (R2 = 0.998 and 0.997, respectively); hence the minimum energy to cause degradation of trans-β-carotene in gari was lower with BG. Rates of degradation of 9-cis-β-carotene in gari were of the same order as with trans-β-carotene. Although the initial content of trans-β-carotene was twice as high in the \{BG\} compared to RPG, trans-β-carotene in \{BG\} degraded much faster. Results showed that the average shelf life at ambient temperature for \{BG\} was significantly shorter than for \{RPG\} and therefore carotenoids in \{BG\} were less stable than in RPG. "

In many developing countries, water is a major factor constraining agricultural output, and income of the world's rural poor. Improved agricultural water management can contribute to poverty reduction through several pathways. First, access to reliable water improves production and productivity, enhances employment opportunities and stabilizes income and consumption. Secondly, it encourages the utilization of other yield-enhancing inputs and allows diversification into high-value products, enhances nonfarm outputs and employment, and fulfils multiple needs of households. Third, it may contribute either negatively or positively to nutritional status, health, societal equity and environment. The net impact of agricultural water management interventions on poverty may depend individually and/or synergistically on the working of these pathways. Improved access to water is essential, but not sufficient for sustained poverty reduction. Investments are needed in agricultural science and technology, policies and institutions, economic reform, addressing global agricultural trade inequities, etc. But how best to match the agricultural water management technologies, institutions and policies to the needs of the heterogeneous poor living in diverse agro-ecological settings remains unclear. This article provides a menu of promising pathways through which agricultural water management can contribute to sustained poverty reduction. "

While Bangladesh has almost achieved accepted bacteriological drinking water standards for water supply, high rates of diarrheal disease morbidity indicate that pathogen transmission continues through water supply chain (and other modes). This paper investigates the association between water quality and selected management practices by users at both the supply and household levels in rural Bangladesh. Two hundred and seventy tube-well water samples and 300 water samples from household storage containers were tested for fecal coliform (FC) concentrations over three surveys (during different seasons). The tube-well water samples were tested for arsenic concentration during the first survey. Overall, the \{FC\} was low (the median value ranged from 0 to 4 cfu/100 ml) in water at the supply point (tube-well water samples) but significantly higher in water samples stored in households. At the supply point, 61% of tube-well water samples met the Bangladesh and \{WHO\} standards of FC; however, only 37% of stored water samples met the standards during the first survey. When arsenic contamination was also taken into account, only 52% of the samples met both the minimum microbiological and arsenic content standards of safety. The contamination rate for water samples from covered household storage containers was significantly lower than that of uncovered containers. The rate of water contamination in storage containers was highest during the February–May period. It is shown that safe drinking water was achieved by a combination of a protected and high quality source at the initial point and maintaining quality from the initial supply (source) point through to final consumption. It is recommended that the government and other relevant actors in Bangladesh establish a comprehensive drinking water system that integrates water supply, quality, handling and related educational programs in order to ensure the safety of drinking water supplies.

To date, however, their usefulness for informing climate risk and variability in policy and social applications has been understudied. Here, we apply tree-ring based reconstructions of drought for the last 700 years in a climate index insurance framework to show that additional information from long climate reconstructions significantly improves our understanding of the underlying climate distributions and variability. We further show that this added information can be used to better characterize risk to insurance providers, in many cases providing meaningful reductions in long-term contract costs to farmers in stand-alone policies. The impact of uncertainty on insurance premiums can also be reduced when insurers diversify portfolios, and the availability of long-term climate information from tree rings across a broad geographic range provides an opportunity to characterize spatial correlation in climate risk across geographic regions. Our results are robust to the range of climate variability experienced over the last 400 years and in model simulations of the twenty-first century, even within the context of changing baselines due to low frequency variability and secular climate trends. These results demonstrate the utility of longer-term climate histories in index insurance applications. Furthermore, they make the case from a climate-variability perspective for the continued importance of such approaches to improving the instrumental climate record, even into a non-stationary climate future.

Given limited opportunities for area expansion, the high cost of further irrigation infrastructure development, and the almost complete exploitation of technological potential in the high-potential environments, it is highly unlikely that rice output in Vietnam will grow to the extent of satisfying rising domestic demands while at the same time leading to an expansion in exports. As for sustaining current export levels, the prospects are moderate to good over the long term, but are quite dependent on further policy and institutional reforms, infrastructural investments, and technological progress. Therefore, rice productivity and exports can be sustained only if government policy is favorable in terms of improving producer incentives, dismantling export barriers, streamlining input and output marketing systems, and enhancing research and infrastructural investments.

The paper then analyses the implications of climate and global environmental change and biofuel production for food security and nutrition, addressing strategies for adaptation and mitigation. This analysis includes a number of important socio-economic factors, besides climate change and biofuel production, that are currently impacting food and nutrition security, and that will likely contribute to future effects. The paper concludes with a series of policy proposals and recommendations to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate and global environmental change placing human rights in the centre of decision making. These proposals include a number of options for improving sustainability and food and nutrition security while addressing the links between climate change and bioenergy demand. "

Based on four climate change scenarios from two general circulation models (CSIRO and MIROC) and two \{IPCC\} \{SRES\} emission scenarios (A1B, B1), this study assesses the potential impacts of climate change on global agriculture and explores two alternative adaptation scenarios for South Africa. The analysis uses an updated GTAP-W model, which distinguishes between rainfed and irrigated agriculture and implements water as an explicit factor of production for irrigated agriculture. For South Africa to adapt to the adverse consequences of global climate change, it would require yield improvements of more than 20 percent over baseline investments in agricultural research and development. A doubling of irrigation development, on the other hand, will not be sufficient to reverse adverse impacts from climate change in the country. "

This analysis examines the structures of these industries, their potential effects on competition and innovation, and the policies that may improve both industry performance and the delivery of new productivity-enhancing technologies to India’s cereal production systems. Our findings suggest that more substantive policy reforms are needed to encourage further innovation, reduce regulatory uncertainty, and encourage firm- and industry-level growth, while continued public spending on agricultural research is needed to support technological change.

The β-carotene content of medium-sized \{OFSP\} from the same harvest batch ranged from 132 to 194 μg/g. True retention (TR) was assessed using paired samples and a formula that compensated for loss or gain of moisture and soluble solids. \{TR\} was 92% when medium-sized \{OFSP\} covered with water was boiled for 20 min in a pot with the lid on; without the lid, boiling took 30 min and \{TR\} was 88%. When \{OFSP\} of different sizes were boiled 30 min, covered with water in a pot with the lid on, \{TR\} was 70–80%.

Solutions to produce more food with fewer resources while minimizing adverse environmental and ecological consequences require sustainable agricultural land use practices as supplementary to advanced biotechnology and agronomy. This review paper, from a land system perspective, systematically proposed and analyzed three interactive strategies that could possibly raise future food production under global change. By reviewing the current literatures, we suggest that cropland expansion is less possible amid fierce land competition, and it is likely to do less in increasing food production. Moreover, properly allocating crops in space and time is a practical way to ensure food production. Climate change, dietary shifts, and other socio-economic drivers, which would shape the demand and supply side of food systems, should be taken into consideration during the decision-making on rational land management in respect of sustainable crop choice and allocation. And finally, crop-specific agricultural intensification would play a bigger role in raising future food production either by increasing the yield per unit area of individual crops or by increasing the number of crops sown on a particular area of land. Yet, only when it is done sustainably is this a much more effective strategy to maximize food production by closing yield and harvest gaps. "

In the particular case-study area, the policy has been implemented through institutional linkages between a corporation and the government with the aim of sharing responsibilities for finances, planning, implementation and monitoring, the end goal being to enhance the livelihoods of rural households. The analysis focuses specifically on how the ‘Guidelines’ have affected the livelihoods of Rajasthani women, drawing upon findings from focus groups with men and women in the project catchment area, as well as interviews with key actors at public and private sector institutions. Findings reveal that there are significant gaps between policy objectives and the realities on the ground, particularly in the context of women's accessibilities and entitlements. The paper also broadens understanding of how PPPs, if implemented properly, could empower women in the area of watershed management across rural South Asia. "

In this Series paper, we propose a new way to understand how food policies could be made to work more effectively for obesity prevention. Our approach draws on evidence from a range of disciplines (psychology, economics, and public health nutrition) to develop a theory of change to understand how food policies work. We focus on one of the key determinants of obesity: diet. The evidence we review suggests that the interaction between human food preferences and the environment in which those preferences are learned, expressed, and reassessed has a central role. We identify four mechanisms through which food policies can affect diet: providing an enabling environment for learning of healthy preferences, overcoming barriers to the expression of healthy preferences, encouraging people to reassess existing unhealthy preferences at the point-of-purchase, and stimulating a food-systems response. We explore how actions in three specific policy areas (school settings, economic instruments, and nutrition labelling) work through these mechanisms, and draw implications for more effective policy design. We find that effective food-policy actions are those that lead to positive changes to food, social, and information environments and the systems that underpin them. Effective food-policy actions are tailored to the preference, behavioural, socioeconomic, and demographic characteristics of the people they seek to support, are designed to work through the mechanisms through which they have greatest effect, and are implemented as part of a combination of mutually reinforcing actions. Moving forward, priorities should include comprehensive policy actions that create an enabling environment for infants and children to learn healthy food preferences and targeted actions that enable disadvantaged populations to overcome barriers to meeting healthy preferences. Policy assessments should be carefully designed on the basis of a theory of change, using indicators of progress along the various pathways towards the long-term goal of reducing obesity rates. "

abstract = "Abstract Fisheries resources play a major role in the national economy and to food security in Solomon Islands. Climate change is likely to have a substantial impact on fish production that can lead to a fragile food security condition in the country. This paper assesses the potential economic impact of three important climate change adaptation strategies – natural resource management (NRM), fish aggregating devices (FAD) and aquaculture – in Solomon Islands. The study used a country-specific partial equilibrium economic model with six fish sub-sectors and analyzed potential impact of alternate climate change adaptation strategies for 2035 and 2050. The modeling and scenario analyses show that total fish demand is likely to surpass domestic fish production in 2050. Without appropriate climate adaptation strategy, per capita consumption of domestically produced fish will decline, which has serious negative food security implications for the country. The economic (welfare) analysis conducted based on modeling results show that the national level net economic gains due to climate change adaptation strategies are substantial. If cost and topographic conditions permit, low-cost inshore \{FADs\} are expected to be a good mechanism for augmenting domestic supplies of tuna and similar species in Solomon Islands. "

In addition to these threats, profound social and land-use changes are complicating the livelihoods of resource users in the region, including the introduction of aquaculture and increasing competition for ground and surface water sources. The government of Bangladesh has targeted this region for investment with irrigation expansion. This paper uses a sustainable livelihood lens to understand the role of investments in water management and irrigation in driving and shaping livelihood changes and transitions over the past ten years and offers recommendations for investments. We find that while water infrastructure development has greatly enhanced the role of agriculture in coastal livelihoods over the last 10 years, further development of irrigation infrastructure should only be prioritized after issues of water governance and inequity across agricultural and aquacultural livelihoods are addressed.

With only modest imports, China has succeeded in feeding 22% of the world's population on only 7% of its land. However, a high price has been paid for this enormous achievement. Increase in grain yields, in particular in rice, as the main source of production growth, relied heavily on intensive use of physical inputs and increasing intensity of farming systems. Soil degradation, water scarcity, and severe pollution were among the consequences as well as declining efficiency of fertilizer application. Using county-level panel data from 1980 to 2003 and graphical (GIS-based) analysis, this paper first looks at the spatial change of the major grain production across regions over the past two decades, towards the northern and northeastern provinces. The analysis is complemented by using a random panel data model, which underscores the significant influence of land availability, degree of urbanization, and government policy on grain production. Finally, this analysis addresses environmental stress which includes both soil degradation and water shortage. The latter is already severe in many of the traditional grain producing areas, but will now become a bigger problem in the “new” grain producing areas, as these have traditionally much less water resources. Hence, while the economic rational of the “grain shift” towards the northern and northeastern regions is understandable, its sustainability is not guaranteed. "

Empirical results indicate that specific physical quality characteristics and purity standards are important factors influencing the price of chickpea in India. Thus, there may be an incentive for domestic producers and sellers of chickpea—and exporting countries—to improve the quality of their product, if improvements in specific physical characteristics and purity can be obtained cost effectively. As trade prospects grow for regionally important food crops like chickpea and other pulses, it is essential that food managers, commodity exporters, and crop breeders have access to critical market information in order to assess the relative economic importance of preferred quality traits and plan their strategies accordingly.

The model comprises the estimates of crop area, yield and production for 20 major crops under four rainfed and irrigated production systems across a global 5 arc minute grid. The new model builds on prior work by the authors (and published in this journal) in developing regional downscaled databases for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and encompasses notions of comparative advantage and potential economic worth as factors influencing the geographic distribution of crop production. This is done through a downscaling approach that accounts for spatial variation in the biophysical conditions influencing the productivity of individual crops within the cropland extent, and that uses crop prices to weigh the gross revenue potential of alternate crops when considering how to prioritize the allocation of specific crops to individual grid cells. The proposed methodology also allows for the inclusion of partial, existing sources of evidence and feedback on local crop distribution patterns through the use of spatial allocation priors that are then subjected to an entropy-based optimization procedure that imposes a range of consistency and aggregation constraints. We compare the global datasets and summarize factors that give rise to systematic differences amongst them and how such differences might influence the fitness for purpose of each dataset. We conclude with some recommendations on priorities for further work in improving the reliability, utility and periodic repeatability of generating crop production distribution data. "

Income inequality should have modest effects on individual health. First, norms of sharing and reciprocity should reduce the adverse effects of income inequality on individual health. Second, with sharing and reciprocity, personal income will spill over to the rest of the community, attenuating the protective role of individual income on individual health found in industrial nations. We test these ideas with data from Tsimane’ Amerindians, a foraging and farming society in the Bolivian Amazon. Subjects included 479 household heads (13+ years of age) from 58 villages. Dependent variables included anthropometric indices of short-run nutritional status (body-mass index (BMI), and age- and sex-standardized z-scores of mid-arm muscle area and skinfolds). Proxies for income included area deforested per person the previous year and earnings per person in the last 2 weeks. Village income inequality was measured with the Gini coefficient. Income inequality did not correlate with anthropometric indices, most likely because of negative indirect effects from the omission of social-capital variables, which would lower the estimated impact of income inequality on health. The link between \{BMI\} and income and between skinfolds and income resembled a U and an inverted U; income did not correlate with mid-arm muscle area. The use of an experimental research design might allow for better estimates of how income inequality affects social capital and individual health. "

Using Chinese household data, we find that the owners of more efficient stoves (i.e., clean-fuel and improved-biomass stoves, as compared with traditional-biomass and coal stoves) live in less healthy counties and differ, across and within counties, in terms of household characteristics such as various assets. On net, that caused efficient stoves to look worse for health than they actually are. We control for counties and household characteristics in testing stove impacts. Unlike tests that lack controls, our preferred tests with controls suggest health benefits from clean-fuel versus traditional-biomass stoves. Also, they eliminate surprising estimates of health benefits from coal, found without using controls. Our results show the value, for learning, of tracking who gets which intervention. "

Large crop fields and center-pivot irrigation have been established in the last 10 years across Mongolia's “Breadbasket”: the Bulgan, Selenge and Tov aimags of northcentral Mongolia. Since meteorological records are typically short and spatially diffuse, little is known about the frequency and scale of past droughts in this region. We use six chronologies from the eastern portion of the breadbasket region to reconstruct streamflow of the Yeruu River. These chronologies accounted for 60.8% of May–September streamflow from 1959 to 1987 and 74.1% from 1988 to 2001. All split, calibration-verification statistics were positive, indicating significant model reconstruction. Reconstructed Yeruu River streamflow indicates the 20th century to be wetter than the two prior centuries. When comparing the new reconstruction to an earlier reconstruction of Selenge River streamflow, representing the western portion of the breadbasket region, both records document more pluvial events of greater intensity during 20th century versus prior centuries and indicate that the recent decade of drought that lead to greater aridity across the landscape is not unusual in the context of the last 300 years. Most interestingly, variability analyses indicate that the larger river basin in the western breadbasket (the Selenge basin) experiences greater swings in hydroclimate at multi-decadal to centennial time scales while the smaller basin in the eastern portion of the breadbasket (the Yeruu basin) is more stable. From this comparison, there would be less risk in agricultural productivity in the eastern breadbasket region, although the western breadbasket region can potentially be enormously productive for decades at a time before becoming quite dry for an equally long period of time. These results indicate that farmers and water managers need to prepare for both pluvial conditions like those in the late-1700s, and drier conditions like those during the early and mid-1800s. Recent studies have indicated that cultures with plentiful resources are more vulnerable when these resources become diminished. Thus, the instrumental records of the 20th century should not be used as a model of moisture availability. Most importantly, the geographic mismatch between precipitation, infrastructure, and water demand could turn out to be particularly acute for countries like Mongolia, especially as these patterns can switch in space through time.

Today, with co-management widely embraced by the research community and adopted as policy by an increasing number of governments, a second-generation perspective has emerged. This perspective is distinguished by efforts to navigate and influence change in the broader institutional and governance context: (a) a more sophisticated appreciation of politics, power relations, and the role of the state, (b) efforts to manage resource competition beyond the fisheries sector, (c) building institutions for adaptation and learning, and (d) recognizing divergent values and goals influencing fisheries management. This paper traces the evolution of this second-generation perspective, noting how it has built on learning from early practice and how it has been cross-fertilized by theoretical innovations in related fields, notably resilience thinking and political ecology. We illustrate this evolution through analysis of experience in the Philippines, with a relatively long experience of learning and adaptation in fisheries co-management practice, and Vietnam, where fisheries co-management policies have been embraced more recently. Characterizing the second-generation perspective helps identify points of convergence in the research and policy community about what needs attention, providing a basis for more systematic cross-country and cross-regional learning.

The spatial variability of \{WPI\} and \{WRR\} is analyzed with regard to water and energy factors. Results show that although irrigated corn and soybean yields are significantly higher than rainfed yields in different regions of the YRB, \{WPI\} is slightly lower than \{WPR\} for these two crops. This can be explained by the seasonal coincidence of precipitation and solar energy patterns in the YRB. However, as expected, irrigation stabilizes crop production per unit of water consumption over space. \{WPI\} and \{WPR\} vary spatially from upstream to downstream in the \{YRB\} as a result of varying climate and water supply conditions. The water factor has stronger effects on both crop yield and \{WP\} than the energy factor in the upper and middle basin, whereas energy matters more in the lower basin. Moreover, \{WP\} in terms of crop yield is compared to that in terms of agricultural \{GDP\} and the results are not consistent. This paper contributes to the \{WP\} studies by a basin context, a comparison between \{WPI\} and WPR, a comparison of \{WP\} in terms of crop yield and economic value, and insights on the water and energy factors on WP.

In Bangladesh, estimates suggest that the country’s potential rice–fish production system encompasses 2–3 million hectares of land. But despite three decades of research on biophysical and technical aspects of rice–fish systems, this potential has not been fully realized due to insufficient attention given to the social, economic, and policy dimensions of rice–fish system improvement. This paper provides a characterization of the diverse and changing nature of rice–fish systems in Bangladesh to shed new light on the economic viability of different rice–fish systems and recommend policy and investment options to accelerate the development of appropriate rice–fish technologies. Data are drawn from a novel subdistrict-level survey of fishery officers, a household/enterprise survey, focus group discussions, and a meta-review of the literature on aquaculture in the country, all of which were conducted in 2010–2011. Findings indicate that concurrent rice–fish systems, alternating rice–fish systems, and collectively managed systems offer considerable potential for increasing productivity and farm incomes in Bangladesh. Findings also suggest that while innovation in these rice–fish systems is being driven by households and communities, there is need for more supportive government policies and investments to enable further innovation. Policymakers need to develop effective regulations to promote feed and fish quality and quantity, for example. More rigorous analysis of the intended and unintended impacts of these policies and investments is also necessary. "

This study analyses the factors contributing to land fragmentation, and uses household- and village-level data from 11 villages in Jiangxi Province to test these factors empirically. Our analysis shows that land fragmentation in China is caused to a large extent by the egalitarian principles used in distributing and reallocating land use rights to households. Land within each village is classified into different classes, with each household receiving land from each class. Moreover, land is basically assigned on the basis of household size, with large households receiving substantially more (and slightly bigger) plots than small households. We further find that incomes from off-farm employment and land rental markets are associated with lower land fragmentation. Limited market access does not induce land fragmentation. Instead, we find that landholdings in suburban areas are more fragmented, probably because farmers cultivate a wider range of (high value-added) crops in these areas. We conclude that, although land fragmentation has slightly declined during the 1990s, it is likely to remain high in China if the current principles underlying land distribution within villages are maintained. Three policy options for reducing land fragmentation are suggested. "

We found that there has been a structural shift of household income away from farm in favor of nonfarm labor income sources. This finding indicates that rural development is being led by nonfarm sectors. Such a shift has resulted in an increase in household income inequality as the distribution of nonfarm income has become less equal over time and was markedly more unequal than that of farm income in 1998.

Motivated by our fieldwork, and using a spatial–temporal model, we focus on the paths of forest degradation and regeneration and villagers' utility before and after an access restriction is introduced. Our paper illustrates a number of key points for policy makers. First, the benefits of forest conservation tend to be greatest in the first few periods after an access restriction is introduced, after which the overall forest quality often declines. Second, villagers may displace their \{NTFP\} collection into more distant forests that may have been completely protected by distance alone before access to a closer forest was restricted. Third, permitting villagers to collect limited amounts of \{NTFPs\} for a fee, or alternatively fining villagers caught collecting illegally from the protected forest, and returning the fee or fine revenue to the villagers, can improve both forest quality and villagers' livelihoods.

Similarly, we find that smokers who hold employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) receive significantly lower wages than their non-smoking peers, while smokers who are not insured through their employer endure no such wage penalty. Our results have two implications: first, the incidence of smokers’ elevated medical costs appears to be borne by smokers themselves in the form of lower wages. Second, differences in healthcare costs between smokers and non-smokers are a significant source of the smoker's wage gap. "

Both direct and indirect effects of these interventions are identified. The top-down (macro-to-micro) links are of a trade reform type. The bottom-up (micro-to-macro) links pertain to changes in farm water assignments and the possibility of water trading. We find that water productivity is strongly influenced by these policies, with the general equilibrium (indirect) effects modifying and sometimes reversing the partial equilibrium (direct) effects. We also find that the impacts of the two reforms we assessed are different, with trade reform having an absolute impact of a higher magnitude than the water reform. Finally, we show that the sequence of introducing the policy reforms matters. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our model approach in the case of the Water Directive Framework and the Common Agricultural Policy, both applied in \{EU\} countries in an antagonistic manner.

Useful genetic variation to exploit was needed. The traits needed to be manageable in a breeding program (simple screening and high heritability), and stable across a wide range of environments if impact was to be large. Above all, the traits needed to be combinable with traits for high yield to ensure that farmers chose the improved lines. Finally, it was necessary to show that the new types actually improved the health of humans of low nutrient status representing the target populations. The extra nutrients needed to be bioavailable to the gut. Today, only this last essential criterion remains to be fully satisfied. All other criteria are met to levels that lead us to claim that breeding for nutritional quality is a viable, practicable, and cost-effective strategy to complement existing interventionist strategies. Subject to satisfying the last criterion, and results are encouraging, we call for a major funding initiative, and the installation of a new paradigm for 21st century agriculture: one espousing food systems that are highly productive, sustainable, and nutritious.

In particular, government authorities in western China focus on improving farmer livestock profits through greater forage crop production. We examined the whole-farm profit, downside risk, labour-use efficiency and feed balance effects of forage crop intensification on two simulated crop–livestock farm types in western China. Our methodology combined crop and livestock simulation modelling with whole-farm stochastic budgeting to capture both price and climate variability. We modelled the whole-farm effects of (1) introducing either forage vetch (Vicia sativa), forage oats (Avena sativa), or grain soybean (Glycine max) into current wheat (Triticum aestivum)-maize (Zea mays) systems and (2) replacing maize in current wheat-maize systems with either forage wheat, forage maize, or forage soybean. System intensification through incorporating a forage crop into current grain-cropping systems can increase average simulated profits without increasing downside risk on the simulated farms. As opposed to adding a forage crop into current grain-cropping systems, replacing a grain crop with a forage crop in current grain-cropping systems had a negative effect on profits, downside risk, and labour-use efficiency. Trade-offs existed between labour-use efficiency and profit as forage intensification increased labour demands. These effects were context specific, with greater positive profit effects of forage intensification for the higher-rainfall farm type. Overall, forage intensification in these systems benefited the households, but adoption will depend on household preferences and local agro-ecological and market factors. We demonstrated the importance of exploring proposed intensification options across different locations to capture impacts across diverse contexts. Providing these context-specific insights and exploring trade-offs within systems can help better understand livelihood improvement pathways. In locations with strong competing uses for labour, developing labour-saving practices appears critical. "

We measure adaptation responses in terms of adaptive capacity, which includes technical, institutional, social and financial capacity. We find that the uncertainty of the impact of stressors plays a role in shaping the extent of adaptive capacity. We also find that the adaptive response may depend on a river basin organization's pre-existing capacity to address the stressor. Finally, our research suggests that investments in new capacity can create a feedback mechanism that helps reduce uncertainty and foster further adaptation. "

Study design Twenty-one patients with Down syndrome aged 13-26 years with a body mass index ≥85th percentile were enrolled and randomized to a 6-month nutrition and activity education intervention (n = 10) or to a nutrition and activity education+behaviorial intervention (n = 11), and followed for 6 months after the active intervention period (1-year follow-up). The primary outcome measure was body weight; secondary outcomes included percentage body fat by bioelectric impedance; intake of fruits, vegetables, and energy-dense low-nutrient snack food (treats) by 3-day food record; and moderate/vigorous physical activity by accelerometry. Results At 6 months, mean body weight in the nutrition and activity education+behavioral intervention group was 3.2 kg lower than that in the nutrition and activity education group (95% CI, 1.0-5.5 kg; P = .005). Mean group differences were sustained at 1 year (3.6 kg; 95% CI, 1.4-5.9 kg; P = .002). At 6 months, moderate/vigorous physical activity time increased by an average of 18 minutes/day compared with baseline in the nutrition and activity education+behavioral intervention group (P = .01) and decreased by 7 minutes/day in the nutrition and activity education group (P = .30). These changes were largely maintained at 1 year, but were not statistically significant. Vegetable intake in the nutrition and activity education+behavioral intervention group exceeded that in the nutrition and activity education group by a mean of 1.6 servings at 1 year (P = .009), but not at 6 months. No between-group differences were observed for percentage body fat or consumption of fruits or treats. Conclusion Parent-supported behavioral intervention appears to be a successful adjunct to a 6-month nutrition education intervention in achieving weight loss in adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome.

For the tourism sector, the services given by operators (unregistered and/or underreporting) operate in the shadow economy will ultimately wiped off the map of high quality tourist destinations and destroyed the development of the tourism industry itself. This study examines the short-run and long-run relationships between international tourism receipts and shadow economy for 149 countries over the period 1995-2008. We use a generalized one-step error-correction model (ECM) in combination with a system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) to explore the long-run relationship between these two variables. Our results suggest that tourism receipts and shadow economy are cointegrated. This implies that shadow economy and the tourism industry worldwide are related in the long-run.

For wasting, we assess children under 59 months of age and relate growth to \{NDVI\} averages for the current and most recent growing periods. Correlations between short-run indicators of child growth and intensity of green vegetation are generally positive. Regressions that control for a range of child-, mother- and household-specific characteristics produce mixed evidence regarding the role of \{NDVI\} anomalies during critical periods in a child's early life and the subsequent probability of stunting and wasting. Overall findings suggest that the relationship between environmental conditions and child growth are heterogeneous across the landscape in Nepal and, in many cases, highly non-linear and sensitive to departures from normality.

Thus, the soil reanalysis database tailors dynamic crop models such as the Cropping System Model (CSM) of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). During the reanalysis, the physical and chemical parameters of the soil profiles were revised and estimated, where necessary and possible, using pre-established ranges given by the literature and correlations among other more stable variable. To evaluate each of the 3404 reanalyzed soil profiles, the CSM-CERES-Maize model was run for a standard crop management scenario using both the original and the new improved soil databases. Nine hundred seventy-eight soil profiles were considered to be not useful during the reanalysis due to missing values for one or more critical variables and were, therefore, not considered for quality control procedures. A pre-diagnostic for only nitrogen and soil organic carbon in the original dataset showed 70% and 5% of missing values respectively. A sensitivity analysis based on crop simulations comparing the original and the reanalyzed soil databases, showed that 1294 soil profiles yielded different results due to improvement of either the original data or improved conversion procedures. The details and considerations for detecting missing and erroneous values and for estimating soil variable values are presented in this paper for further use.

Technology benefits vary, and network effects are completely conditional on benefits. Having a benefiting adopter in one's network increased demand by over 50%, whereas having a non-benefiting adopter had no effect. These effects are strong enough to bring average demand in line with expected benefits. For many farmers, however, demand remains below the market price, suggesting that network effects will lead to increased—but not rapid widespread—adoption. "

We discuss methods for data integration. In general, household determinants explain more variation than environmental factors, perhaps partly due to more error-prone measurement at the community level. Among individual children, some measures of agricultural capacity are related to lower incidence of child hunger, while among regions, measures relating to urbanness and population density show a stronger relationship. We give recommendations for further study, data collection and policy making. "

We find significant uncertainty in future emissions with and without climate policy. This uncertainty is due to differences in a variety of assumptions including (1) the role of bioenergy, (2) where and how bioenergy is produced, (3) the availability of afforestation options in climate mitigation policy, and (4) \{N2O\} and \{CH4\} emission intensity. With climate policy, these differences in assumptions can lead to significant variance in mitigation potential, with three models indicating reductions in \{AFOLU\} \{GHG\} emissions and one model indicating modest increases in \{AFOLU\} \{GHG\} emissions.

DC. cv.-group utilis) is widely promoted in tropical and sub-tropical regions as a green manure cover crop that can reduce weed growth and soil erosion and enhance soil fertility. To provide these benefits, the crop must attain rapid ground cover and develop substantial aboveground biomass. To assist biophysical targeting of the crop to environments that can provide adequate growth conditions, the \{CROPGRO\} model was adapted to simulate velvet bean growth and development. This paper evaluates the performance of the model for phenology, growth, senescence and N accumulation for multiple locations that represent a range of environmental and agronomic management scenarios. Vegetative development, as described by main stem leaf appearance rate, varied linearly with thermal time. Time to flowering showed departures from the linear photoperiod response used in the model. Additional research is required to determine whether the crop is influenced by factors besides photoperiod and air temperature, especially water and nutrient deficits. The linear response to photoperiod did, however, provide reasonable values for partitioning to vegetative, reproductive and senesced materials. Simulation of nitrogen concentration for various plant components matched observed data. Sensitivity analyses evaluating the ability of the crop to provide ground cover, intercept light and develop adequate growth for soil protection and weed suppression indicated that a mean temperature of over 22 °C and a soil moisture holding capacity of at least 100 mm are required. The \{CROPGRO\} model proved to be a reliable decision support tool for guiding analyses of velvet bean response to crop management and environmental conditions. Further research, however, is warranted to improve its predictive capability, especially for phenology. "

Although food fortification and supplementation programmes have been effective in some countries, their overall success remains limited. Biofortification, that is, breeding food crops for higher micronutrient content, is a relatively new approach, which has been gaining international attention recently. We propose a methodology for ex ante impact assessment of iron biofortification, building on a disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) framework. This methodology is applied in an Indian context. Using a large and representative data set of household food consumption, the likely effects of iron-rich rice and wheat varieties are simulated for different target groups and regions. These varieties, which are being developed by an international public research consortium, based on conventional breeding techniques, might be ready for local distribution within the next couple of years. The results indicate sizeable potential health benefits. Depending on the underlying assumptions, the disease burden associated with iron deficiency could be reduced by 19–58%. Due to the relatively low institutional cost to reach the target population, the expected cost-effectiveness of iron biofortification compares favourably with other micronutrient interventions. Nonetheless, biofortification should not be seen as a substitute for other interventions. Each approach has its particular strengths, so they complement one another. "

Nevertheless, the challenge of increasing food production in the \{IGP\} in line with demand grows ever greater; any perturbation in agriculture will considerably affect the food systems of the region and increase the vulnerability of the resource-poor population. Increasing regional production is already complicated by increasing competition for land resources by non-agricultural sectors and by the deterioration of agri-environments and water resources. Global environmental change (GEC), especially changes in climate mean values and variability, will further complicate the agricultural situation and will therefore, have serious implications for food systems of the region. Strategies to reduce the vulnerability of the region's food systems to \{GEC\} need to be based on a combination of technical and policy options, and developed in recognition of the concurrent changes in socioeconomic stresses. Adaptation options need to be assessed with regard to their socioeconomic and environmental efficacy, but a greater understanding of the interactions of food systems with \{GEC\} is needed to be able to do this with confidence. This paper discusses information needs relating to resource management and policy support to guide the development of research planning for increasing the robustness of \{IGP\} food systems to GEC. Further information is needed to develop a range of adaptation strategies including augmenting production and its sustainability, increasing income from agricultural enterprises, diversification from rice–wheat systems, improving land use and natural resource management, and instigating more flexible policies and institutions.

From a survey of 35 randomly sampled villages and 338 households in two provinces (Hebei and Henan Provinces) in 2001 and 2004, we show that when farmers access water from markets for irrigation services, they significantly reduce water use, compared with farmers who have their own tubewells. However, there is no significant difference between the volume of water used by farmers who access irrigation services provided by the village, and the volume used by farmers who access water from markets for irrigation services. Importantly, although water use decreases, we find little effect on either agricultural productivity (yields) or income. "

Survey-based data (presents farmers' personal perceptions and adaptations to climate change) associated with external biophysical-socioeconomic data (presents real-world climate change) were used to develop a farmer-centered framework to explore climate change impacts and agricultural adaptations at a local level. A case study at Bin County (1980s–2010s), Northeast China, suggested that increased annual average temperature (0.6°C per decade) and decreased annual precipitation (46 mm per decade, both from meteorological datasets) were correctly perceived by 76 and 66.9%, respectively, of farmers from the survey, and that a longer growing season was confirmed by 70% of them. These reasonably correct perceptions enabled local farmers to make appropriate adaptations to cope with climate change: Longer season alternative varieties were found for maize and rice, which led to a significant yield increase for both crops. The longer season also affected crop choice: More farmers selected maize instead of soybean, as implicated from survey results by a large increase in the maize growing area. Comparing warming-related factors, we found that precipitation and agricultural disasters were the least likely causes for farmers' agricultural decisions. As a result, crop and variety selection, rather than disaster prevention and infrastructure improvement, was the most common ways for farmers to adapt to the notable warming trend in the study region.

The first scenario doubles the irrigated area in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2050, compared to the baseline, but keeps total crop area constant. The second scenario increases both rainfed and irrigated crop yields by 25% for all Sub-Saharan African countries. The two adaptation scenarios are analyzed with IMPACT, a partial equilibrium agricultural sector model combined with a water simulation module, and with GTAP-W, a general equilibrium model including water resources. The methodology combines the advantages of a partial equilibrium approach, which considers detailed water-agriculture linkages, with a general equilibrium approach, which takes into account linkages between agriculture and nonagricultural sectors and includes a full treatment of factor markets. The efficacy of the two scenarios as adaptation measures to cope with climate change is discussed. Due to the limited initial irrigated area in the region, an increase in agricultural productivity achieves better outcomes than an expansion of irrigated area. Even though Sub-Saharan Africa is not a key contributor to global food production (rainfed, irrigated or total), both scenarios help lower world food prices, stimulating national and international food markets.

We compared the effectiveness of protected areas, a logging ban, and sacred areas to protect forests from logging in Northwest Yunnan, China, a global biodiversity hotspot. We combined Mahalanobis matching and panel regression techniques to measure effectiveness of these three protection strategies paying special attention to old growth forest communities. We found that protected areas had no impact on total forest cover, but effectively conserved old-growth forests relative to non-protected areas. The implementation of the logging ban resulted in positive forest conservation outcomes over most of the landscape. The exception was that logging in old-growth forests inside sacred areas accelerated following the implementation of the logging ban, suggesting that local institutions may have been weakened by official policies. Our research finds little evidence that overlapping conservation policies decrease deforestation and suggests that the implementation of official policies may displace local forms of protection. Our results further highlight that relying on total forest cover as a single indicator of conservation outcomes can lead to misleading conclusions about the impacts of forest protection strategies.

With the intensification of water scarcity, China's future water conservancy development is facing tremendous challenge of supporting the continuous economic development while protecting the water resources and the dependent ecosystems. This paper provides an overview of China's water conservancy development, and illustrates the socioeconomic, environmental and ecological impacts. A narrative of attitude changes of the central government towards water conservancy, as well as key measures since the 1950s is presented. The strategic water resources management plan set by the central government in its Document No. 1 of 2011 is elaborated with focus on the three stringent controlling “redlines” concerning national water use, water use efficiency and water pollution and the huge investments poised to finance their implementation. We emphasize that realizing the goals set in the strategic plan requires paradigm shifts of the water conservancy development towards maximizing economic and natural capitals, prioritizing investment to preserve intact ecosystems and to restore degraded ecosystems, adapting climate change, balancing construction of new water projects and rejuvenation of existing projects, and managing both “blue” (surface/groundwater) and “green” water (soil water).

To overcome these challenges we have applied explorative scenarios and normative back-casting with stakeholders from different sectors at the regional level in East Africa. We then applied lessons about appropriate scope, enabling adaptation pathways, and developing strategic planning capacity to scenarios processes in multiple global regions. Scenarios were created to have a broad enough scope to be relevant to diverse actors, and then adapted by different actor groups to ensure their salience in specific decision contexts. The initial strategy for using the scenarios by bringing a range of actors together to explore new collaborative proposals had limitations as well as strengths versus the application of scenarios for specific actor groups and existing decision pathways. Scenarios development and use transitioned from an intervention-based process to an embedded process characterized by continuous engagement. Feasibility and long-term sustainability could be ensured by having decision makers own the process and focusing on developing strategic planning capacity within their home organizations. "

We compare two carbon tax scenarios with a business-as-usual scenario of anticipated future energy demand. In the short term, with carbon prices reaching around $15/tCO2 by 2030, most models agree that the reduction in consumer spending, as a proxy for welfare, is limited to about 0.3%. By 2050, at carbon prices of $165/tCO2, there is much more divergence in the estimated impact on consumer spending as well as \{GDP\} across models and regions, which reflects uncertainties about technology costs and substitution opportunities between technologies. We observe that the consequences of increasingly higher carbon prices, in terms of reduced consumer spending and GDP, tend to be fairly linear with the carbon price in our \{CGE\} models. However, the consequences are divergent and nonlinear in our econometric model, that is linked to an energy system model that simulates step-changes in technology substitution. The results of one model show that climate policy measures can have positive effects on consumer spending and GDP, which results from an investment stimulus and the redistribution of carbon price revenues to consumers.

abstract = "Food is fundamental to human wellbeing and development. Increased food production remains a cornerstone strategy in the effort to alleviate global food insecurity. But despite the fact that global food production over the past half century has kept ahead of demand, today around one billion people do not have enough to eat, and a further billion lack adequate nutrition. Food insecurity is facing mounting supply-side and demand-side pressures; key among these are climate change, urbanisation, globalisation, population increases, disease, as well as a number of other factors that are changing patterns of food consumption. Many of the challenges to equitable food access are concentrated in developing countries where environmental pressures – including climate change, population growth and other socio-economic issues – are concentrated. Together these factors impede people's access to sufficient, nutritious food; chiefly through affecting livelihoods, income and food prices. Food security and human development go hand in hand, and their outcomes are co-determined to a significant degree. The challenge of food security is multi-scalar and cross-sector in nature. Addressing it will require the work of diverse actors to bring sustained improvements inhuman development and to reduce pressure on the environment. Unless there is investment in future food systems that are similarly cross-level, cross-scale and cross-sector, sustained improvements in human wellbeing together with reduced environmental risks and scarcities will not be achieved. This paper reviews current thinking, and outlines these challenges. It suggests that essential elements in a successfully adaptive and proactive food system include: learning – through connectivity between scales to local experience and technologies – high levels of interaction between diverse actors and sectors ranging from primary producers to retailers and consumers, and use of frontier technologies.

In addition, it would foreseeably lead to high and unaffordable medicine prices and inaccessibility to essential medicines. Objective To quantify the impact on medicine expense and medicine accessibility. Methods Based on 2000 to 2003 Thai Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s and the Drug &amp; Medical Supply Information Center (DMSIC), costs and accessibility were estimated upon the price and quantity costing between innovative drugs and their generics plus some parameters found from their competitive behaviour. Thereafter, we simulated the 10-year potential additional expense on the 2003 unit price of the patented and monopolized non-patented medicines. Results In 2003, the availability of generics helped to save 104.5% of actual expense and the accessibility would increase by 53.6%. By extension of market exclusivity, given that there were 60 new items approved annually, the cumulative potential expense was projected to be $US 6.2 million for the first year to $US 5215.8 million in tenth year. Conclusion The TRIPs-Plus proposal would result in a significant increase in the medicine expense; and a delay in the increase in drug accessibility via generics. Several options as well as other related mechanisms to help reduce the negative impact are proposed. "

The use of standard data formats for documenting experiments and modeling crop growth and development can facilitate exchanges of information and software, allowing researchers to focus on research per se rather than on converting and re-formatting data or trying to estimate or otherwise compensate for missing information. The standards developed by the International Benchmark Sites Network for Agrotechnology Transfer (IBSNAT) project and subsequently revised by the International Consortium for Agricultural Systems Applications (ICASA) were of considerable value for describing experiments. However, the resulting \{ICASA\} Version 1 standards did not consider important management practices such as tillage and use of mulches, lacked descriptors for certain soil and plant traits (especially related to nutrient levels), and contained minor logical inconsistencies. The \{ICASA\} standards have evolved to allow description of additional management practices and traits of soils and plants and to provide greater emphasis on standardizing vocabularies, clarifying relations among variables, and expanding formats beyond the original plain text file format. This paper provides an overview of the \{ICASA\} Version 2.0 standards. The foundation of the standards is a master list variables that is organized in a hierarchical arrangement with major separations among descriptions of management practices or treatments, environmental conditions (soil and weather data), and measurements of crop responses. The plain text implementation is described in detail. Implementations in other digital formats (databases, spreadsheets, and data interchange formats) are also reviewed. Areas for further improvement and development are noted, particularly as related to describing pest damage, data quality and appropriate use of datasets.

Three meta-analyses evaluated the effects of soy isoflavones on lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter BMD. Soy isoflavones significantly improved lumbar spine \{BMD\} in a moderate manner, but did not affect total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter \{BMD\} in menopausal women. Ingestion of soy isoflavones for six months appeared to be enough to exert a beneficial effect on lumbar spine BMD. Two meta-analyses evaluated the effects of soy isoflavones on a bone resorption marker (urine deoxypyridinoline) and two formation markers (serum alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin). Soy isoflavones significantly decreased urine deoxypyridinoline in a moderate manner, but did not affect serum alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin in menopausal women. Soy isoflavones may prevent postmenopausal osteoporosis and improve bone strength thus decreasing risk of fracture in menopausal women by increasing lumbar spine \{BMD\} and decreasing bone resorption marker urine deoxypyridinoline. Further studies are needed to address factors affecting the magnitude of the beneficial effects of soy isoflavones and to assess the possible interactions between soy isoflavones and anti-osteoporosis drugs, and to verify effects on \{BMD\} of other skeletal sites and other bone turnover markers.

The goals of AgMIP are to improve substantially the characterization of world food security due to climate change and to enhance adaptation capacity in both developing and developed countries. Analyses of the agricultural impacts of climate variability and change require a transdisciplinary effort to consistently link state-of-the-art climate scenarios to crop and economic models. Crop model outputs are aggregated as inputs to regional and global economic models to determine regional vulnerabilities, changes in comparative advantage, price effects, and potential adaptation strategies in the agricultural sector. Climate, Crop Modeling, Economics, and Information Technology Team Protocols are presented to guide coordinated climate, crop modeling, economics, and information technology research activities around the world, along with AgMIP Cross-Cutting Themes that address uncertainty, aggregation and scaling, and the development of Representative Agricultural Pathways (RAPs) to enable testing of climate change adaptations in the context of other regional and global trends. The organization of research activities by geographic region and specific crops is described, along with project milestones. Pilot results demonstrate AgMIP's role in assessing climate impacts with explicit representation of uncertainties in climate scenarios and simulations using crop and economic models. An intercomparison of wheat model simulations near Obregón, Mexico reveals inter-model differences in yield sensitivity to [CO2] with model uncertainty holding approximately steady as concentrations rise, while uncertainty related to choice of crop model increases with rising temperatures. Wheat model simulations with mid-century climate scenarios project a slight decline in absolute yields that is more sensitive to selection of crop model than to global climate model, emissions scenario, or climate scenario downscaling method. A comparison of regional and national-scale economic simulations finds a large sensitivity of projected yield changes to the simulations’ resolved scales. Finally, a global economic model intercomparison example demonstrates that improvements in the understanding of agriculture futures arise from integration of the range of uncertainty in crop, climate, and economic modeling results in multi-model assessments.

Using species distribution models, we assess possible future changes in the diversity and climatic niche size of an unprecedented number of species for the region. We modeled a broad range of taxa (11,012 species of birds and vascular plants), including both endemic and widespread species and provide a comprehensive estimation of climate change impacts on the Andes. We find that if no dispersal is assumed, by 2050s, more than 50% of the species studied are projected to undergo reductions of at least 45% in their climatic niche, whilst 10% of species could be extinct. Even assuming unlimited dispersal, most of the Andean endemics (comprising ∼5% of our dataset) would become severely threatened (&gt;50% climatic niche loss). While some areas appear to be climatically stable (e.g. Pichincha and Imbabura in Ecuador; and Nariño, Cauca, Valle del Cauca and Putumayo in Colombia) and hence depict little diversity loss and/or potential species gains, major negative impacts were also observed. Tropical high Andean grasslands (páramos and punas) and evergreen montane forests, two key ecosystems for the provision of environmental services in the region, are projected to experience negative changes in species richness and high rates of species turnover. Adapting to these impacts would require a landscape-network based approach to conservation, including protected areas, their buffer zones and corridors. A central aspect of such network is the implementation of an integrated landscape management approach based on sustainable management and restoration practices covering wider areas than currently contemplated.

Abatement potential in Latin America, among other things, is influenced by its development status, the large contributions of non-CO2 and land use change \{CO2\} emissions, and energy endowments. In most scenarios in this study, the economic potential to reduce fossil fuel \{CO2\} as well as non-CO2 emissions in Latin America in 2050 is lower than in the rest of the world (in total) when measured against 2010 emissions, due largely to higher emission growth in Latin America than in the rest of the world in the absence of abatement. The potential to reduce land use change \{CO2\} emissions is complicated by a wide range of factors and is not addressed in this paper (land use emissions are largely addressed in a companion paper). The study confirms the results of previous research that the variation in abatement costs across models may vary by an order of magnitude or more, limiting the value of these assessments and supporting continued calls for research on the degree to which models are effectively representing key local circumstances that influence costs and available abatement options. Finally, a review of policies in place in several Latin American countries at the time of this writing finds that they would be of varying success in meeting the emission levels proposed by the most recent \{IPCC\} reports to limit global temperature change to 2 °C.

Agricultural production is highly vulnerable even to 2C (low-end) predictions for global mean temperatures in 2100, with major implications for rural poverty and for both rural and urban food security. Agriculture also presents untapped opportunities for mitigation, given the large land area under crops and rangeland, and the additional mitigation potential of aquaculture. This paper presents a summary of current knowledge on options to support farmers, particularly smallholder farmers, in achieving food security through agriculture under climate change. Actions towards adaptation fall into two broad overlapping areas: (1) accelerated adaptation to progressive climate change over decadal time scales, for example integrated packages of technology, agronomy and policy options for farmers and food systems, and (2) better management of agricultural risks associated with increasing climate variability and extreme events, for example improved climate information services and safety nets. Maximization of agriculture's mitigation potential will require investments in technological innovation and agricultural intensification linked to increased efficiency of inputs, and creation of incentives and monitoring systems that are inclusive of smallholder farmers. Food systems faced with climate change need urgent, broad-based action in spite of uncertainties. "

In this study, parameters were developed for modern cultivars representing all 17 \{CIMMYT\} wheat Mega Environments (MEs) using field experimental data and genetic cultivar relationships for the CROPSIM-CERES model in \{DSSAT\} v 4.5 (Decision-Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer). Cultivar performance was tested with independent \{CIMMYT\} breeding trial field experiments across several locations. Then crop simulations were carried out at 0.5 × 0.5 ° pixels for global wheat-growing areas, using cultivars representing MEs, soil information, region-specific crop management, and initial soil conditions. Aggregated simulated wheat yields and production were compared to reported country yields and production from Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) statistics, resulting in a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.3 t/ha for yield and 2.2 M t/country for country production. Some of the simulated errors are relatively large at country level because of uncertainties in pixel information for climate, soil, and crop management input and partly because of crop model uncertainties. In addition, \{FAO\} yield statistics have uncertainties because of incomplete farm reports or poor estimates. Nevertheless, this new cultivar-specific, partially-validated global baseline simulation enables new studies on issues of food security, agricultural technology, and breeding advancement impacts combined with climate change at a global scale.

Second, the scope of the risk assessment is expanded to include the assessment of health and environmental benefits as well as risks, and the explicit consideration of economic- and social-impacts of risk management action and their distribution. Moreover approaches were developed for deriving improved information from genomic, proteomic and metabolomic profiling methods and for probabilistic modelling of health impacts for risk assessment purposes. Third, in an added evaluation stage, interested parties, experts, and officials may compare and weigh the risks, costs, and benefits and their distribution. As part of a set of recommendations on risk communication, we propose that reports on each stage should be made public. "

Other promising interventions for the promotion of early child development include children's educational media, interventions with children at high risk, and combining the promotion of early child development with conditional cash transfer programmes. Effective investments in early child development have the potential to reduce inequalities perpetuated by poverty, poor nutrition, and restricted learning opportunities. A simulation model of the potential long-term economic effects of increasing preschool enrolment to 25% or 50% in every low-income and middle-income country showed a benefit-to-cost ratio ranging from 6·4 to 17·6, depending on preschool enrolment rate and discount rate.

Frequently, however, insufficient attention is paid to the historical development of \{NRM\} institutions. Instead, discussion largely focuses on models of economic efficiency at the expense of the cultural, historical, and ecological contexts within which institutions develop. Here we use the research program of historical ecology to explore the development, maintenance, and change of two contemporary fire management institutions in northern Australia and Colorado, USA, to demonstrate how social institutions and ecological systems change and resist change over time and how institutions interact across scales to negotiate contrasting goals and motivations. We argue that these \{NRM\} institutions are not strictly speaking evolutionary or adaptive, and that historical context is critical when evaluating how and why particular institutions and institutional relationships develop. As with ecosystems, the present characteristics of the \{NRM\} institutions are dependent on what has happened before and their efficacy can only be evaluated retrospectively. Therefore, an understanding of history is essential to questions of the desirability and feasibility of institutional change where such shifts are required from an ecological, social, or economic perspective. We further propose that institutional conflict arises from the differing goals and motives of resource management institutions at different scales. Our cases reveal that larger-scale institutions can be successful at achieving narrowly defined goals but often fall short of achieving socially desirable sustainable outcomes. Our findings support the use of narratives of community history, place, and being in considering the resilience and sustainability of social-ecological systems. We offer that historical ecology is complementary with institutional and economic approaches to the analysis of \{NRM\} institutions, and possesses a particular strength in linking ecology to the values and norms of small social groups.

Energy from other macronutrients, however, does not have a robust relation with these two anthropometric measures. Our estimates indicate that in contexts with substantial child undernutrition, increases in protein-rich food intake in the first 24 months can have important growth effects, which previous studies indicate are related significantly to a range of outcomes over the life cycle.

We assessed the effect of a voluntary health insurance program, including quality improvement of healthcare facilities, on blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive adults in rural Nigeria. Methods We compared changes in outcomes from baseline (2009) to midline (2011) and endline (2013) between non-pregnant hypertensive adults in the insurance program area (PA) and a control area (CA), through household surveys. The primary outcome was the difference between the \{PA\} and \{CA\} in change in BP, using difference-in-differences analysis. Results Of 1500 eligible households, 1450 (96.7%) participated, including 559 (20.8%) hypertensive individuals, of which 332 (59.4%) had follow-up data. Insurance coverage increased from 0% at baseline to 41.8% at endline in the \{PA\} and remained under 1% in the CA. The \{PA\} showed a 4.97 mm Hg (95% CI: − 0.76 to + 10.71 mm Hg) greater decrease in systolic \{BP\} and a 1.81 mm Hg (− 1.06 to + 4.68 mm Hg) greater decrease in diastolic \{BP\} from baseline to endline compared to the CA. Respondents with stage 2 hypertension showed an 11.43 mm Hg (95% CI: 1.62 to 21.23 mm Hg) greater reduction in systolic \{BP\} and 3.15 mm Hg (− 1.22 to + 7.53 mm Hg) greater reduction in diastolic \{BP\} in the \{PA\} compared to the CA. Attrition did not affect the results. Conclusion Access to improved quality healthcare through an insurance program in rural Nigeria was associated with a significant longer-term reduction in systolic \{BP\} in subjects with moderate or severe hypertension.

However, coordinated action is largely absent, especially at the political level, both nationally and internationally. Antibiotics paved the way for unprecedented medical and societal developments, and are today indispensible in all health systems. Achievements in modern medicine, such as major surgery, organ transplantation, treatment of preterm babies, and cancer chemotherapy, which we today take for granted, would not be possible without access to effective treatment for bacterial infections. Within just a few years, we might be faced with dire setbacks, medically, socially, and economically, unless real and unprecedented global coordinated actions are immediately taken.

The workshop concluded that although fisheries managers and biodiversity conservation agencies may give differing and sometimes opposing weights to the many objectives that could be set for MPAs, only 25% of fisheries objectives and 30% of biodiversity objectives were considered to be potential sources of conflict. \{MPAs\} that segregate activities in space could contribute to resolving all but one of the potential conflicts over objectives associated with desired ecological outcomes. Conflicts over social or economic objectives could be improved, made worse, or not be affected by MPAs, depending on how the \{MPAs\} were developed and managed. Seven features of planning processes and six features of the governance processes for \{MPAs\} were identified that could help find broadly supported solutions to the conflicts that did occur. Once established, the management of the \{MPA\} should be inclusive and participatory, as well as continuously learning and adaptive. Approaches to ensure management had those properties were identified, including twelve specific mechanisms that should be available to the \{MPA\} managers. On the basis of these conclusions about objectives, planning, and management, a general framework for the governance of \{MPAs\} for both fisheries and biodiversity conservation was developed. Its ten general characteristics and twelve steps necessary for progress were identified. We discuss the special challenges of establishing and managing \{MPAs\} for fisheries and biodiversity conservation on the high seas that deserve further attention include information-sharing, coordination and defining jurisdictions and stake-holding.

The framework incorporates the interactions between agricultural and energy markets at the macro-level, and an assessment of production practices and environmental impacts at the micro (field)-level. For macro-level analysis, we use two existing modeling frameworks: the \{CARD\} U.S. agricultural markets model and the \{MARKAL\} energy systems model. The integrated modeling of agricultural and energy markets will be useful in analyzing a range of scenarios regarding the role of biomass feedstocks from the agricultural sector in an expanding market for biomass-based fuels and energy. Moreover, by linking the macro-level analysis to the micro-scale (field-level) analysis, we can represent shifts in farming practices, average productivity, and costs of production, as well as the environmental consequences of farmers' decisions resulting from the expansion of biomass feedstock production.

The evolution of biofuel markets over the next 10–20 years and the implications for energy, agriculture, and the environment are uncertain. Building on an integrated agriculture–energy modeling framework, this study analyzes a baseline and three alternative scenarios: two scenarios based on energy prices (crude oil and natural gas) and one based on assumptions regarding cellulosic biomass availability. By examining the impact of scenarios driven by (a) changes in the energy sector and (b) changes in the agricultural sector, we can compare the differential effects on biofuels markets, commodity prices and quantities in each sector, and \{CO2\} emissions. Scenario comparisons show biofuel markets affected more by crude oil prices than natural gas prices. However, higher natural gas prices shift the biofuel production mix away from corn-grain based to more cellulosic ethanol via multiple mechanisms. Alternatively, the scenario with no cellulosic feedstock lowers total ethanol production and raises ethanol and corn prices. In terms of environmental impacts, higher ethanol levels driven by higher oil prices lead to lower \{CO2\} emissions. In comparison, the no cellulosic scenario results in the highest \{CO2\} trajectory relative to the baseline. "

Structured questionnaires were used for primary data collection. The sample consisted of 186 bank branch managers and 77 regional superintendents of the Bank of Brazil in the banking retail segment. It also used secondary data on branch performance regarding six dimensions: financial results, strategy and operations, society, customers, processes and organizational behavior. Standard regression analyses were conducted to test the investigation model. The competencies relating to strategic management and financial management turned out to be predictors of different dimensions of branch performance. Other competencies (process management and socio-environmental management), number of hours dedicated to training and managers’ perceptions of the company’s performance management practices (a dimension of organizational support) appeared to have more modest effects. Once the effects of the control variables had been isolated, the percentage of variance explained by these predictors ranged from 2.2% to 6.8%. Regarding branch performance, the lowest percentage of explanation came from the customer perspective, whereas the greatest variance was explained by the financial results, strategy and operations perspectives.

Each model simulated 1981–2010 grain yield, and we evaluate results against the interannual variability of growing season temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation. The amount of information used for calibration has only a minor effect on most models' climate response, and even small multi-model ensembles prove beneficial. Wheat model clusters reveal common characteristics of yield response to climate; however models rarely share the same cluster at all four sites indicating substantial independence. Only a weak relationship (R2 ≤ 0.24) was found between the models' sensitivities to interannual temperature variability and their response to long-term warming, suggesting that additional processes differentiate climate change impacts from observed climate variability analogs and motivating continuing analysis and model development efforts.

This report, which is based on the outcome of an \{ECVAM\} (European Centre for Validation of Alternative Methods, Institute for Health and Consumer Protection, European Commission Joint Research Centre, Ispra, Italy) workshop, discusses the concept of consistency testing as an alternative approach for lot release testing. The consistency approach for the routine release of vaccines is based upon the principle that the quality of vaccines is a consequence of a quality system and of consistent production of lots with similar characteristics to those lots that have been shown to be safe and effective in humans or the target species. The report indicates why and under which circumstances this approach can be applied, the role of the different stakeholders, and the need for international harmonization. It also gives recommendations for its implementation. "

abstract = "Abstract Projected global warming and population growth will reduce future water availability for agriculture. Thus, it is essential to increase the efficiency in using water to ensure crop productivity. Quantifying crop water use (WU; i.e. actual evapotranspiration) is a critical step towards this goal. Here, sixteen wheat simulation models were used to quantify sources of model uncertainty and to estimate the relative changes and variability between models for simulated WU, water use efficiency (WUE, \{WU\} per unit of grain dry mass produced), transpiration efficiency (Teff, transpiration per kg of unit of grain yield dry mass produced), grain yield, crop transpiration and soil evaporation at increased temperatures and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations ([CO2]). The greatest uncertainty in simulating water use, potential evapotranspiration, crop transpiration and soil evaporation was due to differences in how crop transpiration was modelled and accounted for 50% of the total variability among models. The simulation results for the sensitivity to temperature indicated that crop \{WU\} will decline with increasing temperature due to reduced growing seasons. The uncertainties in simulated crop WU, and in particularly due to uncertainties in simulating crop transpiration, were greater under conditions of increased temperatures and with high temperatures in combination with elevated atmospheric [CO2] concentrations. Hence the simulation of crop WU, and in particularly crop transpiration under higher temperature, needs to be improved and evaluated with field measurements before models can be used to simulate climate change impacts on future crop water demand.

Methods The \{ESCEO\} expert working group met to discuss the epidemiological and economic evidence that justifies the increasing concern of the impact of this disease and reviewed the current state-of-the-art in health economic studies in this field. Results \{OA\} is a debilitating disease; it is increasing in frequency and is associated with a substantial and growing burden on society, in terms of both burden of illness and cost of illness. Economic evaluations in this field are relatively rare, and those that do exist, show considerable heterogeneity of methodological approach (such as indicated population, comparator, decision context and perspective, time horizon, modeling and outcome measures used). This heterogeneity makes comparisons between studies problematic. Conclusions Better adherence to guidelines for economic evaluations is needed. There was strong support for the definition of a reference case and for what might constitute “standard optimal care” in terms of best clinical practice, for the control arms of interventional studies.

Because the focus on co-construction of integrative knowledge is shared by an increasing number of initiatives worldwide, this framework should be useful beyond IPBES, for the wider research and knowledge-policy communities working on the links between nature and people, such as natural, social and engineering scientists, policy-makers at different levels, and decision-makers in different sectors of society.

abstract = "SummaryBackground The eastern Mediterranean region is comprised of 22 countries: Afghanistan, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Since our Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010), the region has faced unrest as a result of revolutions, wars, and the so-called Arab uprisings. The objective of this study was to present the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors in the eastern Mediterranean region as of 2013. Methods \{GBD\} 2013 includes an annual assessment covering 188 countries from 1990 to 2013. The study covers 306 diseases and injuries, 1233 sequelae, and 79 risk factors. Our \{GBD\} 2013 analyses included the addition of new data through updated systematic reviews and through the contribution of unpublished data sources from collaborators, an updated version of modelling software, and several improvements in our methods. In this systematic analysis, we use data from \{GBD\} 2013 to analyse the burden of disease and injuries in the eastern Mediterranean region specifically. Findings The leading cause of death in the region in 2013 was ischaemic heart disease (90·3 deaths per 100 000 people), which increased by 17·2% since 1990. However, diarrhoeal diseases were the leading cause of death in Somalia (186·7 deaths per 100 000 people) in 2013, which decreased by 26·9% since 1990. The leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) was ischaemic heart disease for males and lower respiratory infection for females. High blood pressure was the leading risk factor for \{DALYs\} in 2013, with an increase of 83·3% since 1990. Risk factors for \{DALYs\} varied by country. In low-income countries, childhood wasting was the leading cause of \{DALYs\} in Afghanistan, Somalia, and Yemen, whereas unsafe sex was the leading cause in Djibouti. Non-communicable risk factors were the leading cause of \{DALYs\} in high-income and middle-income countries in the region. \{DALY\} risk factors varied by age, with child and maternal malnutrition affecting the younger age groups (aged 28 days to 4 years), whereas high bodyweight and systolic blood pressure affected older people (aged 60–80 years). The proportion of \{DALYs\} attributed to high body-mass index increased from 3·7% to 7·5% between 1990 and 2013. Burden of mental health problems and drug use increased. Most increases in DALYs, especially from non-communicable diseases, were due to population growth. The crises in Egypt, Yemen, Libya, and Syria have resulted in a reduction in life expectancy; life expectancy in Syria would have been 5 years higher than that recorded for females and 6 years higher for males had the crisis not occurred. Interpretation Our study shows that the eastern Mediterranean region is going through a crucial health phase. The Arab uprisings and the wars that followed, coupled with ageing and population growth, will have a major impact on the region's health and resources. The region has historically seen improvements in life expectancy and other health indicators, even under stress. However, the current situation will cause deteriorating health conditions for many countries and for many years and will have an impact on the region and the rest of the world. Based on our findings, we call for increased investment in health in the region in addition to reducing the conflicts. Funding Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. "
