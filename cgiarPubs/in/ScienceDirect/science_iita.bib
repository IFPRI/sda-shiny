Walp.). Instead of forming appressoria, which are necessary for penetration of plant tissues, most of the germinating spores developed long undifferentiated germ tubes. However, the addition of maize pollen to conidial inoculum of C. lindemuthianum increased the severity of anthracnose in cowpea seedlings, possibly through an effect of pollen on host resistance mechanisms. Maize pollen inhibited the development of necrotic local lesions in cowpea cv. ‘Early Red’ which possesses hypersensitive resistance to cowpea (yellow) mosaic virus (CYMV). Since we obtained no evidence that systematic infection with \{CMYV\} increased in pollen-treated seedlings, it is probable that pollen had an inhibitory effect on virus infection. "

Soil under forest was included as a control. Chloride (Cl−) appeared in the effluent at 0.1 pore volume after its application to the surface of undisturbed soil columns taken from plots cleared manually, with shear blade, or with tree pusher. In columns fron forest and traditional farming plots, no Cl− appeared in the effluent until 0.2 pore volume of solution had passed through the columns. The pore volume required to attain 0.5 relative Cl− concentration was 0.60, 0.60, 0.40, 0.40, and 0.26 for the columns from forest control, traditional farming, shear-blade, tree-pusher and manually cleared plots, respectively. This indicates preferential water flow in the columns from manually cleared plots as compared to others. Nitrate leaching in the undisturbed columns was nearly identical to chloride. Phosphorus appeared in the effluent after the passage of 0.34 pore volume of solution through the columns of forest control and manually cleared treatments, and of 0.7 pore volume in the shear blade treatment. The increase in the relative phosphate concentration was considerably slower than chloride and nitrate. Chloride appeared later in the repacked columns than in the undisturbed columns, indicating the absence of preferential flow pathways in the disturbed columns. In the field, less than 100% Cl− and water were retained in the 0–70 cm depth, indicating some flow of chloride solution to below 70 cm depth. "

Cowpea grains rich in protein are consumed in different forms in several parts of the tropics. The average grain yield of cowpea in West Africa is approximately 492 kg/ha, which is much lower than its potential yields. This low productivity is due to a host of diseases, insects, pests, parasitic weeds, drought, poor soils and low plant population density in farmers’ fields. Ex situ collection of over 15,000 accessions of cowpea and wild Vigna germplasm from different parts of the world were assembled in the \{IITA\} gene bank. These genetic resources have been explored to identify new traits and to develop elite cowpea varieties. Many cowpea varieties with high yield potential have been developed and adopted by the farmers. Efforts are continuing to develop better performing varieties using conventional breeding procedures, while molecular tools are being developed to facilitate progress in cowpea breeding. "

A positive correlation was observed between decomposition rate constant and mesh-size of litterbag (P &lt; 0.057).

Nutrient release differed with quality of plant residues and litterbag mesh-size. Total N, P, Ca and Mg contents of plant residues decreased with time for Gliricidia and Leucaena prunings, maize stover, and rice straw, and increased with time for Acioa prunings. There was some indication of N immobilization in maize stover and rice straw; P immobilization in Leucaena prunings and rice straw; and Ca immobilization in maize stover, rice straw and Gliricidia and Leucaena prunings.

After dry matter determination, casts were either returned or not returned to the sampled area to assess changes in casting activity as a consequence of cast removal. To assess the proportion of casts destroyed by rain between samplings, in a second experiment, the soil surface was either protected by screen or cotton cloth from direct impact of rain or left open for full impact of rain. Shading increased casting activity by up to 88%. Significant shading effects occurred at a light interception of 24% and above. The continuous removal of casts did not significantly change casting activity. Average casting dropped by 0.28 Mg ha−1 or 2.25% when casts were removed. Cast destruction by rain was estimated to be 21.7%. The difference between amounts of casts recovered under permanent protection from rain and from plots exposed to full impact of rain was not significant. There was no correlation between the amount of cast material detached by rain and the amount of rain fallen between samplings. The continuous sampling technique, used to assess the contribution of earthworms to nutrient cycling, top soil formation and soil organic matter dynamics, can produce valid data without significant disturbance to the system.

Maize grain yield was highest in the previously not cropped bush control and lowest in the previous Flemingia system. Grain yield in the previous Pueraria and natural regrowth systems were not different from control. Maize grain yield was highest when tillage was combined with fertilizer application, significantly higher from individual tillage or fertilizer application. Tilled only and fertilized only produced higher yields than no-till and no fertilizer. Soil physical properties were affected by tillage but did not remain different until the end of the maize growing phase. N fertilizer application had no effect on soil physical properties.

Productivity growth is again shown to raise per capita incomes, with income increases finally having significant poverty-reducing effects. With an aggregate rate of return of 55%, the payoffs to agricultural research are also impressive. Agricultural research currently reduces the number of poor by 2.3 million or 0.8% annually. While the actual impacts are not large enough to more than offset the poverty-increasing effects of population growth and environmental degradation, the potential impacts of agricultural research are far greater. Apart from low research investments, \{SSA\} faces several constraints outside the research system that hinder realization of potential research benefits. The results show that doubling research investments in \{SSA\} would reduce poverty by 9% annually. However, this would not be realized without more efficient extension, credit, and input supply systems. "

Its vegetative propagation through stem cuttings has many advantages, but deleteriously it means that pathogens are passed from one generation to the next and can easily accumulate, threatening cassava production. Cassava-growing continents are characterized by specific suites of viruses that affect cassava and pose particular threats. Of major concern, causing large and increasing economic impact in Africa and Asia are the cassava mosaic geminiviruses that cause cassava mosaic disease in Africa and Asia and cassava brown streak viruses causing cassava brown streak disease in Africa. Latin America, the center of origin and domestication of the crop, hosts a diverse set of virus species, of which the most economically important give rise to cassava frog skin disease syndrome. Here, we review current knowledge on the biology, epidemiology, and control of the most economically important groups of viruses in relation to both farming and cultural practices. Components of virus control strategies examined include: diagnostics and surveillance, prevention and control of infection using phytosanitation, and control of disease through the breeding and promotion of varieties that inhibit virus replication and/or movement. We highlight areas that need further research attention and conclude by examining the likely future global outlook for virus disease management in cassava. "

In both experiments benomyl fungicide was applied (1 g/l) to four cultivars of contrasting storability as a foliar spray weekly from mid-flowering to maturity. The seeds were harvested at maturity or after a delay of two weeks. Plants in Experiment 1 matured under dry conditions and low fungi incidence. Harvest delay and benomyl treatment had little effect on seed pathogen incidence or germination at harvest. In Experiment 2, Which matured in moist conditions, delayed harvest reduced viability by 25%, with significant cultivar × harvest time interactions. Seeds from plants treated with benomyl had higher viability than seed from untreated plants, and significantly lower incidence of Phomopsis species, Macrophomina phaseoli, Fusarium species and Colletotrichum truncatum. Pathogens seem to be important in seed deterioration prior to harvest. To determine the effect of benomyl treatment on rate of decline in seed viability in storage, seeds from Experiment 1 and 2 were stored at 80% relative humidity and 28 or 35°C and sampled periodically. Seeds from benomyl-treated and untreated plants declined in viability at equal rates. Dusting of benomyl on seed of Bossier soybean equilibrated to 10, 13 or 16% moisture content before the start of storage at 28°C completely inhibited surface fungal growth, but did not influence rate of viability decline. Rate of viability decline varied directly with seed moisture content. Extracted embryos from freshly harvested Bossier seed grew on agar and were free from fungal pathogens, while embryos from seed stored for 9 months failed to grow even though little infection (0–5%) was observed. These results strongly suggest that the role of pathogens in seed deterioration during storage may frequently be secondary to that played by physiological factors. "

abstract = "Fifty soybean lines of Southeast Asian or of U.S. origin were field-planted in four successive seasons after periods of seed storage ranging from 2 to 9 months under ambient (27 ± 2 °C, 80% relative humidity) conditions to identity soybean lines that maintain good germinability after prolonged storage. In two seasons seed was harvested both at maturity and after a delay of 2 weeks to determine varietal differences in pre-harvest seed deterioration and the relationship between resistance to pre-harvest and to post-harvest deterioration. Consistent differences in storability were found among lines. Some small-seeded lines of Southeast Asian origin (TGm 737, \{TGm\} 685 and \{TGm\} 693) maintained more than 50% germinability after 8 months of adverse ambient storage. Lines able to withstand field-weathering of seed best were not necessarily the same as those that maintained good germinability following storage. Accelerated ageing (40°C, 100% relative humidity (RH) for 3 days, followed by germination test) did not correlate well with germination of lines following ambient storage, because of fungal growth and subsequent cross-contamination. Lowering the relative humidity in the accelerated ageing test from 100% to about 75% reduced fungal growth. Lines of differential storability could be identified by emergence tests after 6 weeks of storage at 40°C and 75% RH. Seed of \{F3\} and subsequent generations from crosses of high-yielding parents with those of outstanding storability are being screened with the modified ageing procedure to combine good seed storability and high yield.

Straw mulch @ 6 t/ha was spread immediately after planting of crops in September 1980. Irrigation equal to pan evaporation was applied during the dry season of 1980/81. Unmulched and/or nonirrigated plants of both crops had lower leaf water potential than mulched and/or irrigated. Averaged over all the treatments and cultivars, cassava had 15.00 h leaf water potential of −3.6 bars as compared to −9.6 bars of sweet potato. The daytime leaf diffusion resistance of cassava was similar (2–5 s cm−1) in unirrigated mulched and irrigated mulched and unmulched plots. But in unirrigated unmulched plots, the resistance increased to 19 s cm−1 at 15.00 h. Mulching did not affect leaf diffusion resistance (2–8 s cm−1) of both cultivars of sweet potato in irrigated plots. But in nonirrigated plots, leaf resistance increased with time during the day; the increase was less in mulched (from 2 to 40 s cm−1 in \{TIS\} 2148 and 3 to 13 s cm−1 in \{TIS\} 2295) than in unmulched (from 3 to 54 s cm−1 in \{TIS\} 2148 and 2 to 20 s cm−1 in \{TIS\} 2295) treatments. At harvest, the yields of cassava and sweet potato were not significantly affected by mulching.

This study uses data from three on-station fertilizer trials (5–6 cycles) in Central and Southwest Uganda to quantify the effect of drought stress on banana production and explore possible interactions with nutrient availability. Production data were collected at individual plant basis from 1996 to 2002 in one trial and from 2004 to 2009 in two trials. Cumulative rainfall in the 12 months before harvest (CRF12) was computed per plant from daily rainfall measurements. Average bunch weight ranged from 8.0 to 21.9 kg between trials and cycles and was 8–28% less in dry (CRF12 ≤ 905 mm) than in normal (905 &lt; \{CRF12\} ≤ 1365 mm) rainfall periods. Linear relations were observed between \{CRF12\} and maximum bunch weight over the whole range of observed \{CRF12\} (500–1750 mm), whereby every 100 mm decline in rainfall caused maximum bunch weight losses of 1.5–3.1 kg or 8–10%. Optimum annual rainfall for East African highland bananas may thus be well above 1200–1300 mm yr−1 as suggested earlier. Relative drought-induced yield losses were independent of soil fertility. Absolute losses on fertile/fertilized soils were similar to those recorded in well fertilized irrigation studies in Latin America. Our study suggests that drought-induced yield losses in areas of the East African highlands with annual rainfall &lt; 1100 mm are perhaps as high as 20–65% compared to the wetter areas in this region. To improve productivity of smallholder banana farmers in Africa, more attention should be given to research geared towards improved water/drought stress management. "

Five cm of water tagged with chloride was applied to the soil surface by sprinkling and flood irrigation. Soil samples for water and chloride determinations were obtained immediately after infiltration and at 5, 24 and 48 h after infiltration initiation. Depending on the mean initial soil moisture content (θi) and method of water application, mean infiltration rate ranged from 4.6 to 42.9 cm h−1 for plowed compared to a range of 15 to 120 cm h−1 for the no-till treatment. In the conventionally plowed soil at θi = 0.077 cm3 cm−3, water penetrated toa depth of 30 cm immediately after infiltration for both sprinkling and flood application. Within 5 h of infiltration initiation, the profile was wetted to 80 cm depth and most of the applied water was retained in the 0–80 cm layer. Samples obtained at subsequent times did not indicate appreciable additional percolation. At θi = 0.195 cm3 cm−3, however, water penetrated to 80 cm depth immediately after infiltration and about 57% of the applied water was retained for sprinkling as well as flood application. At 24 h, retentions were reduced to 17 and 25% for sprinkling and flood application, respectively. Similar results were obtained in no-till fallow or no-till soil cultivated to maize. Percolation in soil under both systems was rapid during the first 5 h after infiltration initiation but decreased rapidly afterwards. After 24 h, however, soil under no-till had more mean water content over the 0–80 cm depth than conventionally plowed treatment. Chloride profile indicated that a large percentage of the added water percolated beyond 80 cm depth without displacing the initially present water. More chloride recovery than water in profiles at high θi also indicated some adsorption of chloride in these soils. Adsorption seemed more in the no-till system than in tilled soil. "

Worm casts composed of finer soil particles had higher pH values, higher mineral element concentrations and more water-stable aggregates than the corresponding soils. Their higher humic acid (HA) fulvic acid (FA) contents, and HA: \{FA\} ratio, suggested that worm casting activity accelerates the humification process. Numbers of denitrifying microorganisms or cowpea rhizobia were the same in both casts and soils from each site, but worm casts contained more nitrifiers, had a larger biomass-C content and a higher percent of stress-labile N than the corresponding soils. Enzyme activities were also higher in casts than they were in the corresponding topsoils. Granular casts had similar properties as turret-shaped casts collected at the same site. In general, no microbiological and enzymatic differences were found among samples of casts or soils from different sites, but soil and the corresponding casts collected under T. africana were relatively low in organic-C, total N, mineral N, fulvic and humic acids, biomass-C content, nitrifiers and acid phosphatase activity.

Resistance and yield performance of three hybrids were evaluated and compared with the maternal triploid plantain cultivar Obino l'Ewai with and without fungicide treatment. Plantain yield loss from black sigatoka was 33%, as calculated from the difference in yield between the fungicide-treated and non-treated plantain (23.5 and 15.7 t ha−1, respectively). Yield loss ensued from a reduction in the number of fruits per bunch and lower fruit weight. Black sigatoka also caused delayed flowering and harvest, and premature fruit ripening. Sigatoka evaluation at flowering indicated significantly less leaf spot damage in the three hybrids (TMPx 548-4, 548-9 and 597-4) as compared with the susceptible plantain. At harvest, however, hybrid \{TMPx\} 597-4 displayed a susceptible response, whereas hybrids \{TMPx\} 548-4 and 548-9 still showed field resistance.

Yield of \{TMPx\} 548-9 (33.5 t ha−1) was 43% higher than that of the fungicide-treated and twice that of the non-treated plantain, suggesting that its higher yield was due not only to black sigatoka resistance, but also to heterosis. \{TMPx\} 597-4 had poor yield performance (12.7 t ha−1), indicating that tetraploidy per se does not increase yield.

It was found that excised pieces of both root and stem of maize (hybrid var 8338-1), cowpea (var IT81D-994) and soybean (var \{TGx\} 1448-2E) stimulated the germination of S. hermonthica seeds. Germination percentages obtained with maize and cowpea stem pieces were significantly higher than those produced by root pieces.

Pot and field experiments were carried out to examine variation among potential herbaceous and shrub legumes for their ability to nodulate and to use P efficiently. These legumes were grown at two P levels (0 and 7 kg P ha−1) in soils collected from two fields with different cropping histories (compound and degraded fields) at Yamrat in the northern Guinea savanna of Nigeria. In the compound field, animal manure and household residues are applied annually whereas in the degraded field, cereals are grown continuously with minimal organic inputs. Significant differences in growth, P content and mycorrhizal infection rate occurred among the different legumes as affected by P and cropping history. Legumes grown in soil from the degraded field responded more to P application than those grown in soil from the compound field. Phosphorus responsive legume species e.g. Mucuna pruriens var. utilis (black seed) and Crotolaria ochroleuca, had a low mycorrhizal infection rate compared to lower P responsive species such as Lablab purpureus and Cajanus cajan. A significant relationship was found between mycorrhizal infection rate and plant growth but not with nodulation of these legumes. All legumes nodulated naturally and the proportion of N derived from atmospheric \{N2\} ranged from 38% for Centrosema brasilianum to 90% for L. purpureus.

The latter was expressed as a pod evaluation index, Ipe, which uses the degree of pod production or pod load (PL) and pod damage (PD). The different spray treatments included a monocrotophos spray which does not control the pod borer, one or two sprays of a protective mixture of cypermethrin and dimethoate at different stages in the crop phenology, and full protection with the same mixture. Unsprayed cowpea produces very few pods so it was not included as a treatment. None of the tested varieties was resistant to flower damage, and apart from \{TVnu\} 72, the resistant control, none were highly resistant to the borer. Some varieties e.g. \{MRx\} nos. 2-85F, 10-85S, 17-85S, 48-85S, 58-85S, 66-85S, 67-85S and Zonkwa Local had relatively high Ipe values, after receiving only one protective spray, and were considered to be moderately resistant. These varieties can either be grown under minimum insecticide protection (i.e. one insecticide spray) to exploit their potential, in the appropriate cropping or agronomic systems which reduce pest densities, or in locations where borer infestation is low. The Ipe statistic is related to larval counts in flowers (Re = 0.74–0.79), thus if larval counts in flowers were not taken, it would suffice as an indirect estimate of the M. testulalis load. This can be done in conjunction with the rapid visual estimate (RVE) of flower infestation and/or damage which is also more time efficient, even if slightly less accurate than direct larval counts.

Between-and within-clones differences in seed set were observed. \{ABB\} cooking bananas had the highest rates of seed production followed by \{AAB\} French plantains. Plantains produced more diploid than tetraploid offsprings after triploid-diploid crosses, which suggests that meiosis resulted in the production of balanced haploid gametes (n = x) due to normal chromosome behaviour between homologous genomes. Seed set variation within clones was influenced by both the production of 2n (= 3x) gametes in the triploid parent and climatic factors. Indeed, seed production, embryo and seed germination success, and euploid and tetraploid hybrid production followed a pattern of seasonal variation reaching a peak in September. High frequency of seed with tetraploid embryos was obtained in the period from January to mid-March. The results demonstrate that production of desirable tetraploids would be more efficient when hand pollinations are done under high temperature, high solar radiation and low relative humidity. These seem to be the most convenient conditions for relatively high production of 2n eggs as compared to haploid gametes. "

In vitro germination of pollen from numerous genotypes demonstrated varied viability (0.3–85.0%). However, pollen from bisexual flowers on monoecious plants was inferior to pollen from unisexual flowers from dioecious plants. Natural pollination by thrips is inefficient, such that populations with higher ratios of male to female plants set more fruits. To improve fruit set, hand pollinations should be made with pollen from diverse genotypes, early in the flowering period when net water balance is positive. In crossing-blocks, male plants should be closely interpositioned with female plants to reduce pollination distance, thereby improving pollination and fruit set. "

P. truncatus populations were significantly higher in PICS-A reaching 98.66 ± 7.21 individuals/kg at the end of storage, compared to 92.66 ± 4.71 in PICS-N and 100.55 ± 3.56 in WPP.

The number of holes on chips and weight losses also increased with storage duration in all three treatments, but were significantly higher in WPP. Holes created by insects were noticed in \{PICS\} bags and were more important in the inner \{HDPE\} (high-density polyethylene) layer than in the outer \{HDPE\} layer. Up to 1913.00 ± 114.13 holes were observed on the inner \{HDPE\} layer of \{PICS\} bags and 1039.00 ± 29.40 in the outer \{HDPE\} layer. Hermetic storage bags prolong the storability of chips by approximately 1 month. \{PICS\} efficacy was probably affected by the large size of traditional cassava chips with large airspaces between individual chips, leading to a large oxygen store for insects which could not be used up through biotic activity, so that bags were not hermetic. In conclusion, \{PICS\} bags cannot be recommended for the storage of large sized traditional cassava chips. "

However, in last three decades, rice productivity per unit area has stagnated due to abiotic and biotic factors, hence the need for the application of Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) principles. Farmyard manure, crop residues are central to improving soil fertility in rice systems. Compared to mineral fertilizer, organic manure use results in higher rice yield gains. Symbiotic biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) by grain legumes has been successfully applied to improve rice yields. However, only a few legumes are suitable for use under flooded conditions. Application of Azolla sp. improves rice yields though drought and the need for inoculum limit widespread adoption. Poor quality organic fertilizers limit their effectiveness as macronutrient sources. Where soils are P deficient, \{BNF\} and animal manure technologies seem to be of little value. In conclusion, combinations of mineral fertilizers, farmyard manure, and short seasoned legumes have the potential of improving rice yields. Further research on the application of ecology specific \{ISFM\} technologies is required in view of land degradation and climate variability. Research is needed on suitable legumes, fertilizer equivalency values of organics, fortification of organic fertilizers, and effectiveness of combinations of mineral and organic fertility inputs. We propose a step-by-step innovative approach to improving rice productivity by incorporating the components of \{ISFM\} at different stages. Decision guides essential to improved adoption and increased investment on rice production systems are required. "

The success of alley farming depends on a number of technical factors—choice of suitable woody species, successful establishment of the hedgerows, and appropriate management of the hedgerows. The alley farming technique being a scale-neutral system is flexible enough for use both by smallholder farmers and in mechanized farming. It has the potential for providing the linkage between the extensive traditional farming practice and intensive farming. Alley farming allows for longer cropping period with increased land use intensity, rapid and effective soil fertility regeneration by inclusion of selective MPTs, and more intensive cropping with reduced requirements for external inputs.

Single-output measures of productivity and efficiency may thus underestimate resource use efficiency of intercropping systems. Based on the geometric mean technical efficiency predictions for each data point using the preferred \{PDF\} and \{DEA\} approaches, the sample farmers in southern Ethiopia have an average technical efficiency of 91%.

The seed size of selections was below the original mid-parent value and the levels of disease susceptibility were higher than in the improved parent.

This resulted in selection with large seed size over 20 g/100; however, both yield potential and disease resistance tended to be less than the improved parents. Recovery of white seed, as a simple inherited recessive character, was greater in backcrosses to the large white seeded parent, and a rough testa was found to be governed by at least three recessive genes and to be linked to the allele for white seed.

Several cassava cultivars with different branching patterns and varying susceptibility to the cassava mealybug were planted on a sandy loamy and a sandy soil, respectively. Four to seven months after application of the soil treatments, differences in N, P, K in the first 50 cm of the soil had mostly disappeared, indicating that the soil nutrients had been taken up by the plant and/or had leached to deeper layers of the soil. The effect on leaf nutrient contents was still visible, however. Differences in response to soil nutrients and dry matter allocation pattern were found between late and early branching cassava. The former was more efficient in utilizing soil nutrients for root production whereas in the latter, harvest indices decreased with increasing soil fertility. With increasing soil fertility, the nutritional status of the plants increased. This led to larger mealybugs, which in turn resulted in a higher proportion of female Apoanagyrus lopezi. The overall effect was an enhancement of biological control activity leading to low \{CM\} population densities in plots with high soil fertility. Hyperparasitism had no effect on parasitism of A. lopezi, and was positively related to both \{CM\} and A. lopezi numbers. Generally, the infestations were too low to have an effect on growth of cassava leaves or roots. This study shows the beneficial effect that soil fertility can have on the efficiency of a biological control agent. "

Despite the wide recognition of the importance of these services, drivers of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics across various land uses in East Africa are poorly understood. The objectives of this study were threefold: to quantify \{SOC\} stocks across Tanzania; assess the effect of land cover and erosion on SOC; and investigate the relationship between inherent and dynamic soil properties under diverse land uses. The Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF) was used to assess the variability of ecological metrics at different spatial scales. \{SOC\} was quantified within and between different land cover types (forest, woodland, shrubland, grassland and cropland) in Tanzania. A total of 2052 soil samples from 1082–1000 m2 plots were collected from seven 100-km2 sentinel sites in 2010. Composite soil samples were collected at each plot from two depths (0–20 and 20–50 cm) and cumulative soil mass samples were collected to 100 cm. Soil samples were analyzed using a combination of traditional analytical laboratory methods and mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR). Model performance of \{MIR\} spectral predictions for carbon was good, with an \{R2\} of &gt; 0.95 and \{RMSEP\} of 4.3 g kg− 1, when using an independent validation datasets. Woodland and cropland were the most frequently occurring vegetation structure types in the sampled sites, with 388 and 246 plots, respectively. Average topsoil \{OC\} (and range) was 12.4 (1.5–81.4) g C kg− 1 (n = 1082) and average subsoil \{OC\} (and range) was 7.3 (0.64–53.8) g C kg− 1 (n = 970) for the seven sites. Forested plots had the highest mean topsoil organic carbon concentrations (17.3 g C kg− 1) followed by cropland (13.3 g C kg− 1), for all sites included in the study, but with high levels of variability between sites. Soil mass at 30 cm was measured and these data were used to calculate carbon stocks for the different land cover types. An approach based on remote sensing was explored for the mapping of \{SOC\} stocks at 30 cm for Tanzania using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery from 2012. Results indicate that the use of image reflectance for the mapping of \{SOC\} stocks has promising potential, with \{R2\} values ranging from 0.77 to 0.81 and \{RMSEP\} values from 0.90 to 1.03 kg m− 2 for the three validation datasets. There is high utility of these maps for strategic land management interventions that prioritize ecosystem services. "

We find that: 1) contrary to expectation, maximum dry season temperatures are projected to become as or more limiting for cocoa as dry season water availability; 2) to reduce the vulnerability of cocoa to excessive dry season temperatures, the systematic use of adaptation strategies like shade trees in cocoa farms will be necessary, in reversal of the current trend of shade reduction; 3) there is a strong differentiation of climate vulnerability within the cocoa belt, with the most vulnerable areas near the forest-savanna transition in Nigeria and eastern Côte d'Ivoire, and the least vulnerable areas in the southern parts of Cameroon, Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire and Liberia; 4) this spatial differentiation of climate vulnerability may lead to future shifts in cocoa production within the region, with the opportunity of partially compensating losses and gains, but also the risk of local production expansion leading to new deforestation. We conclude that adaptation strategies for cocoa in West Africa need to focus at several levels, from the consideration of tolerance to high temperatures in cocoa breeding programs, the promotion of shade trees in cocoa farms, to policies incentivizing the intensification of cocoa production on existing farms where future climate conditions permit and the establishment of new farms in already deforested areas.

There was a negative but significant relationship between soil temperature and combined leaf area index (L) of crops grown in mixture with sparse-canopy cassava (r = −0.91∗∗) and with dense-canopy cassava (r = −0.93∗∗). This work has shown that, for effective soil temperature reduction under cassava, associated intercrops must attain L of atleast 1.5 within the first eight weeks of growth. Since the L of cassava is below 0.5 during the first eight weeks of growth, intercrops such as egusi melon and maize would help in reducing supra-optimal temperatures under cassava. "

While education and extension contact have significant effects on overall maize supply and input demand, only extension contact has significant effects among women farmers.

Different levels of disease intensity were generated by treatment with benomyl using two different methods of application: varying the frequency of application from 4- to 35-day intervals resulted in grain losses ranging between 25–70% in 1989 and 35–50% in 1990. When the concentration of benomyl was varied at a 10-day interval, crop losses ranged between 10 and 71% in 1989 and 9–70% in 1990. Grain yield was significantly negatively correlated with leaf, stem, peduncle, flowering cushion and pod scab severities. The linear regression of grain yield on disease was computed using the critical point model. The results indicate that a weekly spray of benomyl at 0.5 kg/400 l−1 will prevent abscission of flowers, reduce heavy scabbing of young pods which in all interact to play an important role in crop loss due to cowpea scab. Cowpea scab can cause up to 71% crop loss in susceptible varieties if uncontrolled. "

The objective of this study was to determine if maize performance and Striga emergence, both indices of resistance, were influenced by the interval between Striga seed infestation and maize planting, under high parasite inoculum (3000–6000 germinable seeds) as practiced in maize resistance breeding field nurseries. Four conditioning treatments were investigated: maize planted immediately after Striga seed infestation, and maize planted after one, two and three weeks after infestation. Experimental design was randomized complete block with four replications. Differences among the four conditioning treatments were not significant for maize damage score, height, stalk lodging, number of ears harvested, grain yield and number of emerged Striga plants. Thus, maize planted on the same day as Striga infestation showed similar response as maize planted one to three weeks after infestation. Using high seed inoculum, maize can be planted immediately after Striga infestation in maize breeding nurseries. Combining Striga seed infestation and maize planting into a single field operation is convenient and reduces cost of screening. "

The plant crop cycle was divided into three periods according to different combinations of climate and growth stages of the plant: rainy season before flowering, dry season before flowering and rainy season after flowering. All plantain cultivars were rated susceptible because the final symptom stage developed within 18–25 days. Before flowering, black sigatoka development was faster in the rainy season than in the dry season. Significant correlations were found between rainfall and incubation time (r = t-0.62∗, n = 12). Symptom evolution time and youngest leaf spotted were correlated both in the rainy season (r = −0.98∗∗∗, n = 110) and the dry season (r = 0.66∗∗∗, n = 110) suggesting that data recording is more effective in the rainy season than in the dry season. The higher correlation in the rainy season seems related to favourable conditions for host plant and fungus development. Both symptom evolution time and youngest leaf spotted were useful variables for determining host plant response to black sigatoka. In the rainy season after flowering, plantain cultivars developed symptoms of black sigatoka more slowly than in the rainy season before flowering, suggesting a change in the host susceptibility with age.

The 28 soil physicochemical properties and six crop yield parameters measured were partitioned between location and year before applying a stepwise regression procedure to analyze them. The study showed that soil variables accounted for &gt;70% of the variation in cassava root yields and harvest index. Both soil physical and chemical properties contributed but the former (particularly macroporosity, microporosity, total porosity and bulk density) contributed most. Selected soil variables also accounted for &gt;70% of the variation in yam tuber yield and shape index of tubers especially in 1998. In both crop years chemical properties appeared to dominate over the physical ones. Soil variables accounted for between 51 and 99% of the variation in maize grain and stover yields. The only exception was the figure of 44% obtained at the forest location in 1998. Soil pH, total exchangeable acidity and microporosity were particularly important contributors to the variations in both maize yield parameters. The contributions of soil variables to pigeon pea yield parameters were low (&lt;50%) except in 1999 at the forest location where seven soil variables accounted for over 85% variation in seed yield. It was obvious generally from the study that soil variables were important determinants of yield variations in the four crops. It was also shown that physical properties should always be included in this kind of analysis. Also the number of soil variables which were of significance generally increased when the level of soil properties was low, as was the case with the cultivated site versus forest site, and 1999 versus 1998 analysis. Thus increasing the number of soil variables used and partitioning them into more homogeneous units helped to improve the results obtained using the procedure. "

The challenge, therefore, remains to increase the availability of organic inputs and to develop recommendations for their combination with inorganic fertilizers. An on-farm experiment was conducted in the northern Guinea savanna of Nigeria to evaluate the fertilizer effect of rice (Oryza sativa L.) mill waste (RMW) on a degraded Alfisol. The decomposition and nutrient (N and P) release patterns of \{RMW\} were studied using the litterbag technique, and the effect on maize yield and soil properties was determined. The \{RMW\} was applied at rates of 0, 5, 10, and 15 Mg \{DM\} ha−1 and was applied either unburnt or burnt (farmers’ practice). In both years, compound fertilizer was broadcast during land preparation on all plots at rates of 40 kg N ha−1, 17 kg P ha−1, and 33 kg K ha−1. Results obtained in the litterbag study showed that, at maize harvest, more than 90% of the P had been released from the decomposing RMW. However, around 60% of the organic C and 45% of the N still remained. Compared to the control treatment (0 Mg ha−1 RMW), which yielded 0.55 Mg ha−1, maize (Zea mays L.) grain yields were increased by 95% when 10 Mg ha−1 of unburnt \{RMW\} was applied, and by 147% with 15 Mg ha−1 (mean of 2 years). In contrast, burnt \{RMW\} did not result in significant yield increases. The cumulative application of 30 Mg ha−1 of unburnt \{RMW\} significantly increased the soil organic carbon in the surface soil from 0.7% (0 Mg ha−1 RMW) to 1.3%. The results of this investigation indicate that \{RMW\} constitutes a valuable organic input in the Guinea savanna if applied unburnt at rates of 10–15 Mg ha−1 in combination with inorganic fertilizer. The repeated application of unburnt \{RMW\} may contribute to the rehabilitation of degraded soils through the buildup of soil organic matter. "

Losses in the generally sensitive local cassava cultivars have been so great that a common farmer response to the problem has been the temporary abandonment of cassava cultivation. As a consequence, the \{CMD\} `pandemic’ has had a significant destabilising effect on food security in East Africa. In attempting to combat the problem, vigorous efforts have been made to identify, multiply and disseminate resistant cassava germplasm. This has included cultivars obtained from the breeding programme of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), based in Nigeria, as well as local selections derived from \{IITA\} parent stock. Whilst considerable success has been realised in controlling the pandemic in Uganda, addressing the problem at the regional level remains a major challenge. This article reviews progress made in recent years, both in understanding the cause and mechanisms behind the pandemic's expansion, and in developing strategies to control it. Particular attention is drawn to the likely threat the pandemic poses to cassava production in the countries of central Africa, most notably the Democratic Republic of Congo, where insecurity currently impedes an assessment of the problem and the ready implementation of control measures. Scientists and other stakeholders with an interest in \{CMD\} management are therefore urged to explore innovative mechanisms that will allow them to develop a more comprehensive approach to \{CMD\} control in the region.

Mangoes were sampled every two weeks during the two crop years, to assess the damage caused by these quarantine pests on ten main cultivars. Three native species of Ceratitis and a recently described new exotic species, Bactrocera invadens made up the complex of economically significant fruit flies associated with the mango tree in Borgou. Ceratitis species occurred during the dry season and the main species, Ceratitis cosyra, reached a peak at the end of the dry season. B. invadens populations were scarce during the dry season, but increased steadily from the end of April to reach a peak at the end of June during the rainy season. Regression analyses indicated that minimum–maximum temperature, relative humidity and rainfall were the major climatic factors influencing fly populations. Daily rainfall was the factor showing the strongest positive correlation with B. invadens populations. Host plant was another essential factor influencing the population fluctuations. Trapping and rearing data indicated that Ceratitis quinaria and Ceratitis silvestrii, were abundant only in the dry season, causing damage only to early cultivars. C. cosyra, also common during the dry season, attacked both early cultivars or mid season cultivars. A consistent population increase of B. invadens in the early rainy season caused considerable damage to mid season and late cultivars. The seasonal increase of the B. invadens population coincided with the fruiting period of the main mango cultivars in this Northern Guinean savannah, but mango availability influenced the population of this new invasive species only when the rains had arrived. Mean damage on mangoes for the two seasons and two studied orchards increased from 17% in early April to 73% at mid June. "

Application of the microorganisms separately, in dual, or in triple combinations were assessed in the presence of the plant-parasitic nematode, Meloidogyne incognita under screen house (1000 second stage juvenile/plant) and field (1500 eggs/plant) conditions, with two soybean genotypes. The microorganism treatments were compared with application of a synthetic nematicide (Furadan 3G® [a.i. carbofuran]), an untreated control without nematodes and a nematode-only control. Application of the microorganisms in full factorial combinations suppressed nematode reproduction in most cases and reduced nematode galling comparable to the nematicide treatment. The results provide evidence of the potential of beneficial microorganisms in providing equal or better protection against root-knot nematode damage, than the synthetic nematicide carbofuran. "

Stepwise regression and canonical correlation analysis revealed that \{CMD\} was positively correlated with increasing numbers of weeds and with cultivar mixtures. Cassava bacterial blight (CBB) was particularly severe in all ecozones of Benin, but rare in Ghana. Cassava in the savanna zones of Benin was heavily diseased with an incidence of 34.5–84.1% and a high percentage of plants showing systemic symptoms, while \{CBB\} was not observed in the rainforest (RF) zone and only sporadically in the coastal savanna zone of Ghana. High incidence and severity of \{CBB\} was associated with increasing plant age and clay soils, whereas the disease was less when fields were intercropped or planted to cultivar mixtures. Anthracnose and leaf diseases caused by Cercospora spp. were of minor importance. The severity of diseases caused by Cercospora spp. was positively correlated with profusely branching varieties. Incidence of Cercospora caribaea was associated with increasing rainfall and seemed to be suppressed in cultivar mixtures. Integrated control methods are proposed for the diseases, especially CBB. "

The objectives of the studies were to investigate the soil nitrogen dynamics and response of maize after different periods of legume growth and in a separate experiment to investigate the effect of inorganic N fertiliser on the maize grown after the selected legumes. In one experiment, the two herbaceous legumes were grown using two rotations—short (12 months) with a single forage harvest and followed by early maize; or long (15 months) with two forage harvests followed by late maize. More N was removed in the S. guianensis forage (140 kg N ha−1) compared to C. macrocarpum (90 kg N ha−1) although more N accumulated in the regrowth after harvest of C. macrocarpum (about 100 kg N ha−1—almost twice that of S. guianensis). Subsequently, the N status of maize plants (estimated using chlorophyll readings) in the first 37 days after sowing was higher for C. macrocarpum. Soil Nmin also tended to be higher after C. macrocarpum (maximum of 70 μg N g−1) compared to S. guianensis (maximum of 50 μg N g−1). This was not consistently reflected in maize grain yields. Under the experimental conditions, nitrogen appeared to be immobilised in the soil during the initial stage of legume decomposition, although this was less pronounced after S. guianensis. In a second experiment, first wet season (early) maize was grown after the same two legume species, and the interaction of preceding legumes with three levels of fertiliser N (0–30–60 kg N ha−1) applied to maize was assessed. Increasing fertiliser N levels had no clear impact on Nmin dynamics. Increased grain yield of maize in response to N addition was measured only after S. guianensis which may have been related to site characteristics. With respect to their potential to contribute to crop-livestock production, the two species differed in that S. guianensis was better with respect to year-round forage production, but C. macrocarpum had a greater effect on the subsequent maize yield. In order to improve the legume N contribution to maize at similar sites, the role of delayed N release during leguminous residue decomposition is emphasised. "

The estimated worldwide area under cowpea is about 14 million ha of which West Africa alone accounts for about 9.3 million ha with annual production of about 2.9 Mt. Cowpea grains are consumed as food and the haulms are fed to livestock as a nutritious fodder. Farmers often grow a short-duration spreading variety for grain and a long-duration spreading variety for fodder, but the grain and fodder yields are poor due to low yield potential of the spreading varieties and also due to early cessation of rains. Therefore, \{IITA\} in collaboration with \{ILRI\} has initiated a systematic programme to develop medium-maturing, semi-erect, dual-purpose varieties with higher grain and fodder yields and with enhanced fodder quality. By crossing the late, traditional spreading varieties with improved early, semi-erect varieties, a semi-erect group of medium-maturing, dual-purpose varieties has been developed which yield over 1.5 t ha−1 grain and 2.5 t ha−1 haulms. Despite the high grain and fodder yields, the haulms of improved dual-purpose varieties have similar crude protein content (17–18%) and dry matter digestibility (64–71%) compared to the local varieties. Controlled sheep feeding experiments have shown an average live weight gain of about 80 g per animal per day with 200–400 g per day of cowpea haulms as a supplement to a basal diet of sorghum stover. This was 100% higher than the average live weight gain of animals fed sorghum fodder alone. These results indicate that improved dual-purpose varieties can play an important role in enhancing crop–livestock integration in West Africa. "

However, in order to optimize its biological control potential when deployed as an endophyte, it is essential to establish the inoculum dose and exposure duration that provides suitable levels and distribution of the pathogen within the plant. It is equally important to determine any negative fitness costs that might be associated with increased population of the fungus in the host plant. In an attempt to optimize plant colonization by this fungus, the effects of B. bassiana doses and exposure durations on colonization and growth of tissue cultured banana (AAA-EA, cv. Kibuzi) plants were investigated. The plants were inoculated by dipping in B. bassiana suspension and then grown in the screenhouse for a month. B. bassiana successfully colonized banana plants with 96.7% of B. bassiana-treated plants colonized, 1 month after inoculation. The optimal dose and exposure duration for effective colonization of tissue cultured banana plants varied, but dipping plants in a dose of 1.5 × 107 conidia/ml for 2 h produced the best percentage colonization. Endophytic colonization of tissue cultured banana plants by B. bassiana had no negative impact on plant growth, even when plants were inoculated at the highest dose. "

This is because a successful technology represents a synthesis of the researcher and key stakeholder knowledge sets, and creating this synthesis requires more iteration and negotiation as complexity increases. Instead of assuming a new technology is ‘finished’ when it leaves the research institute, a more effective way of developing complex technologies is for the R&amp;D team to release them as soon as the key stakeholders will adopt, and then nurture the technology’s continued development in partnership with the key stakeholders.

There is, therefore, the need for production, processing and utilization techniques to be developed, evaluated and made available to farmers. However, because of the limitations associated with the use of chemicals in Africa, development of resistant cultivars is the most appropriate and realistic approach to the control of pests and diseases. The strategy employed by \{IITA\} in breeding root and tuber crops resistant to diseases and pests is, first to identify the factors determining the incidence of such diseases and pests; these are the biological and environmental factors on which screening breeding materials in the field is based. The second step is to examine the factors influencing the efficiency of screening. Finally, the role of pathogenic variation in developing efficient and foolproof screening methods is examined. These form the basis of screening breeding materials for resistance to pests and diseases. Using this strategy, \{IITA\} has made substantial progress in breeding for resistance to cassava mosaic virus, cassava bacterial blight, the cassava mealybug, the cassava green spider mite, the African sweet potato weevils, the sweet potato virus disease complex, white yam scorch, cocoyam blight and nematodes.

Cultivars Gonja, Kibuzi and Pisang Awak were more susceptible with 50–75% wilt incidence in pot trials and 36–45% in field trials. The less susceptible cultivars had fewer and shorter primary roots, and took an average of 69–77 days to wilt while the more susceptible cultivars had more and longer primary roots and wilted within 40–50 days after planting.

While the impact of the reform programs has been different for each country, it is commonly observed that impact at the farm level has been less than anticipated. A central theme of this paper is to assess the impact of fertilizer market reforms on the fertilizer market structure and fertilizer use for both food and export (cotton) crop production in Bénin. This analysis of farm-level policy impact is based on data from 899 farm households randomly selected and interviewed in all six départements of Bénin in 1998/1999. Results of the study show that there have been only insignificant changes in the fertilizer market structure. Access to fertilizers has not improved; prices for fertilizer have risen in real terms, resulting in application rates lower than that recommended by extension agents. The effects of the reform programs are vital for investment decisions and provide lessons for introducing alternative approaches for improving soil fertility or management. Since 1992, 54% of farmers find maize (Zea mays L.) production more profitable, while 38% reported that cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production has become more profitable. As a result of the mixed effects of the fertilizer market reform program on the level of fertilizer use and profitability, there is need to develop efficient soil fertility management strategies for small-scale farmers. Such strategies should incorporate the use of complementary inputs, such as seeds with a high level of response to the balanced nutrient package. "

Principal component analysis of 15 quantitative traits was carried out to establish a more objective taxonomic relationship of cultivar groups and subgroups in the Musa germplasm. Fruit traits, number of neutral flowers, total number of leaves, plant girth at 50 cm, and days to flowering and harvest were the major discriminating traits in the germplasm.

abstract = "Abstract Banana and plantain (Musa spp.), produced in 10.3 million ha in the tropics, are among the world's top 10 food crops. They are vegetatively propagated using suckers or tissue culture plants and grown almost as perennial plantations. These are prone to the accumulation of pests and pathogens, especially viruses which contribute to yield reduction and are also barriers to the international exchange of germplasm. The most economically important viruses of banana and plantain are Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV), a complex of banana streak viruses (BSVs) and Banana bract mosaic virus (BBrMV). \{BBTV\} is known to cause the most serious economic losses in the “Old World,” contributing to a yield reduction of up to 100% and responsible for a dramatic reduction in cropping area. The \{BSVs\} exist as episomal and endogenous forms are known to be worldwide in distribution. In India and the Philippines, \{BBrMV\} is known to be economically important but recently the virus was discovered in Colombia and Costa Rica, thus signaling its spread into the “New World.” Banana and plantain are also known to be susceptible to five other viruses of minor significance, such as Abaca mosaic virus, Abaca bunchy top virus, Banana mild mosaic virus, Banana virus X, and Cucumber mosaic virus. Studies over the past 100 years have contributed to important knowledge on disease biology, distribution, and spread. Research during the last 25 years have led to a better understanding of the virus–vector–host interactions, virus diversity, disease etiology, and epidemiology. In addition, new diagnostic tools were developed which were used for surveillance and the certification of planting material. Due to a lack of durable host resistance in the Musa spp., phytosanitary measures and the use of virus-free planting material are the major methods of virus control. The state of knowledge on BBTV, BBrMV, and BSVs, and other minor viruses, disease spread, and control are summarized in this review. "

However, there was 57% increase in amount of S. hermonthica infection and a 68% reduction in maize shoot dry matter when maize was grown in pasteurised soil compared with natural soil. In another experiment, soil steaming significantly influenced the effects of increased soil N fertility (from preceding soybean cv. SAMSOY-2 or application of 90 kg N ha−1) on severity of S. hermonthica in maize. In natural soil, application of N to maize reduced (by 53%) the number of emerged S. hermonthica plants and increased (by 154%) maize dry matter compared with no fertilizer application. In pasteurised soil, application of N to maize increased S. hermonthica severity by 26% and also significantly increased maize dry matter compared with no fertilizer application. The same effects were observed when soybean was used to increase soil N content. Analysis of natural and pasteurised soil revealed only minor differences in composition of K+, Na+, Cu, Mn, and Fe, and none of these changes was directly related to S. hermonthica infection in maize. Results of this study indicate that the differences in S. hermonthica infection in pasteurised and natural soil could be attributed to soil biotic factors that reduce S. hermonthica infection in natural soil. The results partly provide an explanation for the wide variation in reports on the effects of N fertilization on severity of S. hermonthica infection and stress the need for understanding the mechanisms of natural reduction in S. hermonthica infection and interactions of these natural mechanisms with other control techniques.

A potential biological control option for reduction of crop yield–loss within the season of application is the use of soil-borne antagonists of S. hermonthica seed. This study was aimed at selecting soil-borne fluorescent pseudomonad strains capable of suppressing germination of S. hermonthica seeds and consequently reducing parasitism and damage to maize. An in vitro screening procedure was developed and was used to evaluate 460 fluorescent pseudomonad isolates from naturally suppressive soils. This resulted in the identification of 15 Pseudomonas fluorescens/P. putida isolates that significantly inhibited germination of S. hermonthica seeds. In a pot experiment using steam-sterilized soil, there was a significant reduction in the number of S. hermonthica plants on maize grown from seeds that were inoculated with any of the 15 bacterial isolates. Inoculation of maize seed with six of these isolates resulted not only in a reduced number of S. hermonthica plants, but also in an increased maize shoot biomass compared with the check. When soils inoculated with these bacterial isolates were left dried for 5 weeks after maize harvest and then planted with a second maize crop, no reduction in S. hermonthica parasitism was observed. This suggested that the bacteria did not persist in the soil after the first crop of maize. These results suggest that saprophytic fluorescent pseudomonads have potential for biological control of S. hermonthica in maize and that periodic application of bacteria, perhaps through seed treatment, may be necessary for sustained control.

abstract = "Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. is an obligate, root-parasitic, flowering plant that limits cereal production in sub-Saharan Africa. Successful control depends on eliminating its seed reserves in soil, thereby preventing parasitism. Striga hermonthica seeds germinate only if adequately conditioned and exogenous stimulant initiates ethylene production within the seed, or if ethylene is directly supplied to the conditioned seed. Since S. hermonthica is an obligate root parasite, stimulating the seeds to germinate in the absence of the host plants results in seedlings that die within 3–4 days (suicidal germination). Soil injection with ethylene gas is a proven method of eliminating Striga spp. seed reserves in soils, but its cost and potential hazard limit its use in Africa. Use of legume cultivars selected for their ability to cause suicidal germination of S. hermonthica seeds in rotation with cereal host is feasible, but effective reduction of parasite seeds in field soils normally requires several seasons of the legume crop. In this study, ethylene-producing strains of Pseudomonas sp. in combination with N2-fixing Bradyrhizobia japonicum strains were evaluated in pots as a supplement to legume rotation for S. hermonthica control. Co-inoculating cowpea cv. IT93K-637-1 or soybean cv. SAMSOY-2 with Pseudomonas fluorescens/Pseudomonas putida isolates that do not produce ethylene and with B. japonicum isolates either enhanced or had no effect on nodulation compared with B. japonicum alone. Co-inoculating cowpea or soybean with ethylene-producing Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea (Psg) and B. japonicum strains did not affect nodulation. While one or two preceding crops of cowpea or soybean reduced S. hermonthica parasitism on subsequent maize crops, the reductions were significantly improved by co-inoculating cowpea or soybean with Psg and B. japonicum strains. Psg and B. japonicum may have reduced S. hermonthica parasitism on maize by causing suicidal germination of S. hermonthica seeds and enhancing N2-fixation. Results indicate that co-inoculating cowpea or soybean with ethylene-producing rhizosphere competent pseudomonads and N2-fixing bradyrhizobia has potential to increase the effectiveness of legume rotation in reducing S. hermonthica parasitism on subsequent maize crops.

Yams are a vegetatively propagated crop and the use of virus-free planting material forms an essential component of disease control. Current serological and PCR-based diagnostic methods for \{YMV\} are time consuming involving a succession of target detection steps. In this study, a novel assay for specific \{YMV\} detection is described that is based on isothermal reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-exoRPA). This test has been shown to be reproducible and able to detect as little as 14 pg/μl of purified \{RNA\} obtained from an YMV-infected plant, a sensitivity equivalent to that obtained with the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in current general use. The RT-exoRPA assay has, however, several advantages over the RT-PCR; positive samples can be detected in less than 30 min, and amplification only requires a single incubation temperature (optimum 37 °C). These features make the RT-exoRPA assay a promising candidate for adapting into a field test format to be used by yam breeding programmes or certification laboratories. "

In total, six triploid banana (Musa spp.) cultivars were characterized during well-watered and two different water deficit conditions. We developed a concept to evaluate both \{TE\} and growth, since selection for high \{TE\} is often associated with slow growth. \{TE\} increased for all cultivars when stressed and a clear genotypic variation in \{TE\} during water deficit could be discerned. ‘Kayinja’ (ABB) and ‘Sukali Ndizi’ (AAB) were ranked as the most efficient cultivars and the East African highland cultivar ‘Mpologoma’ (AAA) exhibited the least transpiration efficient phenotype. Selection for high \{TE\} did not lead to selection of slow growers during well-watered and mild stress conditions. High \{TE\} varieties are thus projected to bring forth good yield under well-watered and water deficit conditions. "

Aflatoxins, ochratoxins, fumonisins, and zearalenone are among the most hazardous mycotoxins produced by fungal species, mainly in the genera Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Fusarium. Due to their high stability, mycotoxins are a cause of concern not only during crop production, but also in storage, transport, processing, and post-processing steps. Mycotoxin contamination is one factor that reduces the competitiveness of agricultural commodities from \{SSA\} for export. Moreover, these impurities negatively impact the health of humans and livestock which affects household security, livelihood, productivity, and income and leads to significant costs and economic losses for the producing countries. Limited knowledge or awareness of most actors along the food and feed chain is considered to be one of the major problems delaying effective counter measures. In the last decades, various accurate and sensitive analytical methods have been developed to detect levels of mycotoxins on food and feed samples such as HPLC, LC-MS, immuno-based assays, and optical methods. Nevertheless, immuno-based techniques are still the most useful for identifying mycotoxins in the field and farm levels as they can be conducted onsite. Although tolerable limits for mycotoxins have been established in many \{SSA\} countries, most contamination still exceeds maximum thresholds and these toxins continue to pose considerable risk to public health. To address mycotoxin problems in SSA, therefore, possible intervention strategies should provide support for capacity building and supply chain coordination, increased public awareness, and knowledge through education and extension, as well as improved incentives for management of respective fungal species.

Similarly, in the maize ear shoot, maximum husk size as well as number of ears per plant, maximum cob length and grain growth depended respectively on the levels of soil moisture, nitrogen fertilization and solar radiation income. Maximum grain yield of maize therefore would depend on moisture, nitrogen and solar radiation supplies which must be adequately available throughout the life cycle of the maize plant.

The soybean cultivars, TGX1456-2E (medium maturity) and TGX1660-19F (late maturity), were grown in 1996 and 1997. Treatments, imposed only in the first year of the trial, were: (i) uninoculated, (ii) inoculated with a mixture of two Bradyrhizobium strains, and (iii) fertilized with 60 kg N ha−1. A fourth treatment was a plot left to fallow. In 1998, all the previous soybean and fallow plots were sown to maize without any fertilizer application. Results in 1996 and 1997 showed a soybean response to inoculation in the first year, but differences due to the residual effect of inoculation in the second year were not significant. Both cultivars showed a similar response to inoculation but responses at the five sites were varied. Soybean cultivar 1456-2E fixed 43–52% of its N amounting to 56–70 kg N ha−1 and cultivar 1660-19F derived 39–54% of its N from N2-fixation which amounted to 51–78 kg N ha−1. Both cultivars had a high N harvest index resulting in a net removal of 52–95 kg N ha−1 when both grain and stover were exported. Even when the stover was returned, there was a depletion of 23–65 kg N ha−1, with 1456-2E removing more N than 1660-19F. Arbuscular-mycorrhizal infection on maize roots was 11–27% and dependent on previous soybean treatments and farmers’ fields. Plant height, shoot biomass, grain yield, and N uptake of maize were significantly greater in plots previously sown to soybean than in the fallow plots. In general, plots sown to the late maturing cultivar 1660-19F exhibited better residual effect, producing larger yield parameters than the plots planted with medium maturing 1456-2E. "

A β-glucuronidase reporter gene under control of pCsVMV (pCsVMV-GUS) was introduced into the cassava landrace ‘Tokunbo’ via Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. Transgenic tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum SR1) with the same gene construct were also produced. In tobacco, the pCsVMV-GUS was highly expressed in all tissues tested such as leaf, stem, petiole, and roots. In transgenic cassava, the pCsVMV-GUS gene was highly expressed in all tissues and most cell types of in vitro plants including leaf, stem, petiole, and fibrous roots. The pCsVMV-GUS gene was also highly expressed in these tissues as well as in tubers of greenhouse grown cassava. High and stable pCsVMV-GUS gene expression was maintained over 3 cycles of ratooning under greenhouse conditions, thus showing the absence of undesired gene silencing effects after repeated in vitro subculturing and vegetative propagation. From the high constitutive levels of \{GUS\} activity observed, the study concluded that the CsVMV promoter cassette was useful for high-level expression in cassava over repeated cycles of clonal propagation.

From both pot and field experiments, no nematode damage was observed on yam tubers that were intercropped with Aeschynomene histrix, Crotolaria juncea, and Tagetes erecta. Damage in intercropped tubers was reduced by 72.7% with Mucuna pruriens, Centrosema pubescens, and Pueraria phaseoloides and by 58.3% with Stylosanthes guianensis compared to yams planted without cover crops; they also had lower (p ≤ 0.05) nematode populations. Cajanus cajan, Lablab purpureus and Vigna unguiculata however, supported high nematode populations and led to nematode damage in intercropped yams. Tubers from M. incognita-inoculated plants were more damaged and lost 42% more weight (p ≤ 0.05) following three months of storage than tubers from uninoculated plants. Intercropping yams with selected cover crops can be useful in managing M. incognita without reducing yam yields. "

An analytical approach based on the concept of competing risks and originating from human demography was used to assess the seed damage by the pod sucking bugs (PSB), Maruca testulalis and Apion varium during different stages of pod formation in the presence and absence of other pests. The damage pattern created by an individual pest acting alone changed considerably when competition was taken into account. The risk analysis revealed that an increase in seed damage by a pest of a factor five was possible when others were excluded. It showed that the control of one pest alone is unlikely to reduce seed damage to an acceptable level. Seed damage by the \{PSB\} was observed during all stages of pod formation. Heavy seed attack by this pest group during early pod formation reduced available food for other pests in many fields and consequently masked their real damage potential.

Of the 153 fields visited, 40% were infested with S. gesnerioides. Generally, the severity of the parasitic weed was light, with a mean rating of 1.5 on a scale of 1 to 5. A high correlation was found between incidence of striga and the amount of sand in the soil. Of the 153 sites only 27 had no sand in the soil. Of those 27, only three (11%) had some S. gesnerioides compared with 50% on sandy soils. A database was compiled on cowpea phenotypes and the cropping systems in which they are used. Severity of striga infestation per cowpea plant decreased somewhat from east to west, though it is unclear whether this was a function of cowpea genotype or striga pathotype. The predominant cropping systems where striga infestation occurred were sole cowpea, intercrop with millet, and with sorghum. Fields in rotation with cotton, or intercropped with vegetables and legumes were always striga-free. "

Several hybrids with high provitamin A content that were competitive to a commercial hybrid in grain yield and other traits were identified in this study. Selection of parental lines with high provitamin A content and desirable agronomic traits from different molecular-based groups may serve as the basis for developing hybrids with greater expression of heterosis in productivity and concentrations of provitamin A carotenoids.

Species included Dactyladenia barteri, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Pterocarpus soyauxii, and Senna siamea. Definite seasonal trends were observed. Concentrations of sugar and total reserve carbohydrates (sugar+starch) were highest during the dry season. Starch had two maxima, one early in the dry season, and one early in the wet season. Conversion of starch to sugar seemed to occur as trees developed drought tolerance. All carbohydrate values decreased as active growth resumed during the wet season. In general, all carbohydrate values were relatively low as active growth continued; they increased only when dry weather slowed growth. In several species, carbohydrate concentrations in the lower boles decreased during reproductive growth, especially during the last phase of fruit maturation. Significant linear correlations were found between concentrations of sugar and total reserve carbohydrates and a number of weather variables — rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation. Correlations with starch were much lower than for sugar, although several were significant, suggesting that seasonal trends in starch are too complex to be described adequately by linear correlations.

An agricultural innovation systems approach is used to provide a holistic image of (relations between) constraints faced by different stakeholder groups, the dimensions and causes of these constraints, and intervention levels, timeframes and types of innovations needed. Our data shows that constraints for sustainable intensification of agricultural systems are mainly of economic and institutional nature. Constraints are caused by the absence, or poor functioning of institutions such as policies and markets, limited capabilities and financial resources, and ineffective interaction and collaboration between stakeholders. Addressing these constraints would mainly require short- and middle-term productivity and institutional innovations, combined with middle- to long-term \{NRM\} innovations across farm and national levels. Institutional innovation (e.g. better access to credit, services, inputs and markets) is required to address 69% of the constraints for sustainable intensification in the Central Africa Highlands. This needs to go hand in hand with productivity innovation (e.g. improved knowhow of agricultural production techniques, and effective use of inputs) and \{NRM\} innovation (e.g. targeted nutrient applications, climate smart agriculture). Constraint network analysis shows that institutional innovation to address government constraints at national level related to poor interaction and collaboration will have a positive impact on constraints faced by other stakeholder groups. We conclude that much of the \{R4D\} investments and innovation in the Central Africa Highlands remain targeting household productivity at farm level. Reasons for that include (1) a narrow focus on sustainable intensification, (2) institutional mandates and pre-analytical choices based project objectives and disciplinary bias, (3) short project cycles that impede work on middle- and long-term \{NRM\} and institutional innovation, (4) the likelihood that institutional experimentation can become political, and (5) complexity in terms of expanded systems boundaries and measuring impact.

However, quantitative production figures are necessary to provide coffee stakeholders and policy makers with evidence to justify immediate action. Using data from the northern Tanzanian highlands, we demonstrate for the first time that increasing night time (Tmin) temperature is the most significant climatic variable responsible for diminishing C. arabica yields between 1961 and 2012. Projecting this forward, every 1 °C rise in Tmin will result in annual yield losses of 137 ± 16.87 kg ha−1 (P = 1.80e-10). According to our \{ARIMA\} model, average coffee production will drop to 145 ± 41 kg ha−1 (P = 8.45e-09) by 2060. Consequently, without adequate adaptation strategies and/or substantial external inputs, coffee production will be severely reduced in the Tanzanian highlands in the near future. Attention should also be drawn to the arabica growing regions of Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ethiopia and Kenya, as substantiated time series evidence shows these areas have followed strikingly similar minimum temperature trends. This is the first study on coffee, globally, providing essential time series evidence that climate change has already had a negative impact on C. arabica yields. "

Seventeen crops were mostly cultivated by the farmers in the surveyed areas; maize (32%), sunflower (16%) and pigeon peas (12%) were the most cultivated while maize was the most stored. There are at least 7 months between two harvest seasons of each crop; while farmers sold the crops soon after harvest to cater for household expenditure (54%) and school fees (38%), the market prices increased significantly (P ≤ 0.05) within six months of storage. Most processing activities (winnowing, dehulling, drying, sorting and shelling) were carried out manually, almost entirely by women, but mechanized processing for maize, sunflower, millet, and sorghum were commonly practiced. Quantitative post-harvest losses of economic importance occur in the field (15%); during processing (13–20%), and during storage (15–25%). The main storage pests responsible for the losses are larger grain borers (Prostephanus truncatus), grain weevils (Sitophilus granarius) and, the lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica). Most of the farmers considered changes in weather (40%), field damage (33%), and storage pests (16%) as the three most important factors causing poor crop yields and aggravating food losses. However, survey results suggest that the farmers' poor knowledge and skills on post-harvest management are largely responsible for the food losses. 77% of the surveyed farmers reported inadequate household foods and 41% received food aid during the previous year. Increasing farmers' technical know-how on adaptation of the farming systems to climate variability, and training on post-harvest management could reduce food losses, and improve poverty and household food security.

Annual cast deposition in undisturbed systems was significantly higher on Alfisols (49,000 kg ha−1) than on Ultisols (25,000 kg ha−1). Vegetation clearance had significant detrimental effects on earthworm activity. With an increasing length of continuous cropping, cast deposition declined. In young fallows, cast production exceeded levels attained in previously un-cropped controls on Alfisols, yet, on Ultisols, it depended on the previous \{LUS\} and length of the previous cropping phase. Recovery was highest after agrisilviculture and after clearing bush fallow. After forest clearance, burning and one year cropping, cast deposition did not recover within three years. On Alfisols, cast production was higher under planted tree fallow and natural fallow than under herbaceous fallow. On Ultisols, fallow type had no effect. Earthworm surface cast production contributes to soil quality. However, its suitability as an indicator of soil quality is limited to rough assessments as it is dependent upon earthworm species composition, vegetation management and soil type, with more drastic changes on the poorer Ultisols than the more fertile Alfisols.

The highest \{EPN\} presence was recorded in sandy loam, sandy clay loam, sandy clay and clay soils. \{EPNs\} were not recovered in sand, loamy sand and clay loam soils. Using principal component analysis for elucidating the major variation patterns among sampling sites, four factors explaining for 73.64% of the overall variance were extracted. Factors were a combination of geographical (latitude, longitude, altitude), soil (pH, contents of sand, silt and clay, organic carbon, texture), and moisture (wilting point, field capacity) parameters as well as climatic parameters (mean annual rainfall, mean air temperature). Logistic regression and redundancy analyses (RDA) revealed that soil pH, longitude, available water and altitude were associated with presence and absence of EPN. Both logistic regression and \{RDA\} indicated that, increasing soil pH and longitude, associated with decreasing altitude, led to higher percentages of samples containing entomopathogenic nematodes.

A selectivity model was used that accounts for the effects of transactions costs, assets, technology, and support services in promoting input use and generating a marketable surplus. Output supply and input demand responses to changes in transactions costs and price and non-price factors were estimated and decomposed into market entry and intensity. The results showed that while transactions costs indeed have significant negative effects on market participation, institutional innovations—such as group marketing—are also emerging to mitigate the costs of accessing markets. Output price has no effect on output market entry and only provides incentives for increased supply by sellers. On the other hand, both price and non-price factors have significant influence on adoption and intensity of input use. Overall, the findings suggest that policy options are available other than price policies to promote input use and marketed surplus. The paper concludes with implications for policy to induce greater input–output market participation among smallholders in Africa. "

Application of mulch in the row zone and mulch incorporation in the top layer decreased soil bulk density of the 0–10-cm layer by 9 and 4%, respectively, in comparison with the unmulched control. The least infiltration rate, however, was observed for the mulch incorporated treatment due to formation of surface seal. During the dry season, the cumulative water loss from the soil was least for the complete surface mulch treatment. Soil chemical properties were also more favorable for complete surface mulch treatment. Density of feeder roots of cassava was high for the complete surface mulch and mulch incorporated treatments.

A study was thus carried out to evaluate the effects of different tillage systems on the growth and yield of paddy rice, grain yield response to N applications, and weed control. Five experiments were conducted for three consecutive seasons on hydromorphic soils (loamy and sandy loamy, mixed, isohyperthermic Aeric Tropaqualfs) at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan, comparing the effects of zero tillage (without dry tillage and puddling) and conventional tillage (dry tillage and puddling) at two or more N levels. In two of the above experiments the effects of either two moisture regimens or chemical versus manual weed control were also evaluated. In four experiments there were no statistically significant differences in grain yield between zero-tillage plots sprayed with paraquat and conventional-tillage plots. Only in Experiment 2 did zero-tillage (with paraquat) plots give a significantly lower yield than conventional-tillage plots (5200 versus 5580 kg ha−1, respectively) but the difference could be explained by greater rat damage in the former. The highly significant response in grain yield to N applications in all five experiments was statistically similar under both tillage systems. The continuous flooding treatment (Experiment 1) gave better weed control and higher grain yield than the saturation moisture regime (6150 versus 5420 kg ha−1 grain yield). In zero-tillage plots where weeds were slashed before transplanting (Experiment 2), grain yield was lower and the weed growth greater than in zero-tillage and low N level.

The results show that although the management of leucaena trees increases labour requirements by about 50%, the system can sustain and increase maize yields by over 60%, reduce the use of nitrogenous fertilizers and give an attractive net income and marginal rate of return per unit cost.

abstract = "The results of a participatory rural appraisal (PRA) in 3 villages in the Couffo district of Benin show that the variegated grasshopper Zonocerus variegatus L. is a major, but recent, crop pest. Farmers’ knowledge of grasshopper biology is limited and they have not yet developed indigenous control methods. Villagers were keen to collaborate in a participatory research, testing alternative control methods. A demonstration of biological control of grasshoppers was organized, followed by the training of a group of six farmers per village—the village brigade, who will be in charge of grasshopper control in their village. After the training, where grasshopper biology and the advantages and disadvantages of different control options were discussed, it was agreed to test a biological pesticide, an oil-based formulation of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae var. acridum, in a participatory research program. The village brigades chose to test two different strategies: preventive control by treating the young larval stages and curative control by treating adult grasshoppers, with two different sprayers (flit gun and spinning-disc sprayer). Both strategies were tested at three different doses (2, 20 and 50 g of spores/ha). Results show that the dose can be reduced to 20 g/ha without loss of efficacy, so the cost of the treatment (estimated at $20/100 g or $4/ha) is within the farmer's reach. Participatory testing also revealed that treating the uncultivated areas is not a practical strategy. Finally, although battery -powered spinning-disc sprayers are more expensive than the hand-powered flit gun sprayers, their higher efficacy justifies the extra expense. The villagers proposed that grasshopper biological control be organized by village brigades, in close collaboration with the village association of cotton growers, who will provide credit. For the 1998–1999 season, this strategy was proposed and accepted in 18 new villages, and each village organized a brigade, trained by the project. Women, who generally manage their own fields, preferred a separate brigade, and three female brigades have been trained so far. "

This chapter reviews the available information, identifies knowledge gaps, and defines research and development priorities. The effects of soil erosion on crop production depend on many factors—including soil rooting depth, nutrient distribution in the profile, subsoil properties, crop grown, soil and crop management, and the rate of new soil formation. Dense parent material weathers at a slower rate than that having low bulk density. Tropical forests are characterized by intense and deep weathering. Susceptibility to erosion, or soil erodibility, depends on physical, chemical, and biological properties. Soil erodibility is a dynamic property and is readily altered by changes in structural stability, organic matter content, biotic activity, and so on. The effects of soil erosion on crop yield depend on soil profile characteristics, the crop, and the prevailing micro-and mesoclimate. Impressive progress has been made in gaining an understanding of erosion processes and in discovering effective soil conservation techniques for a wide range of ecologies throughout the tropics. Some useful information is available about techniques of new land development and management of forest resources in the humid and subhumid tropics. "

Tropical rainforest refers to the climax vegetation of the lowland humid tropics where there is either a short period of water deficit or none at all. Tropical rainforest is confined to the equatorial region and is a very diverse and complex ecosystem. Soil is an integral element of the rainforest ecosystem and is as much influenced by the vegetation as the vegetation itself is influenced by the soil. Soils supporting tropical rainforests are usually old, highly weathered, and excessively leached. Estimates of forest conversion in the Brazilian Amazon, in tropical Africa, and in the tropics are presented. Possible local effects of deforestation on biophysical environments are explained. Major effects are on microclimate, water and energy balance, nutrient capital with disruption in pathways of various nutrient elements, soil, flora and fauna composition and activity. Deforestation for intensive land use is an important factor in forest conversion. Methods of deforestation vary widely depending on the intended cropping systems, and soil and crop management methods. It is suggested that forest conversion for plantation crops should also be preferably done by manual, and slash and burn methods. "

Of the no-till plots, those with mulch had the greatest soil moisture retention at low suctions; those without mulch had low moisture retention for suctions exceeding 0.1 bar. Cassava plants in plowed plots were more vigorous than those in no-till plots, and mulching decreased plant height of cassava in the initial stages and increased plant height at about 38 weeks after planting. In the first 10 cm, yam root length density was 0.31 cm cm−3 for no-till plots vs. 0.27 cm cm−3 for plowed plots. Mulch application increased root length density of yam. The root length density of cassava was 0.32 cm cm−3 for no-till plots versus 0.16 cm cm−3 for plowed plots. Mulch application, however, significantly increased root length density of cassava in no-till plots only. Yield of yam tubers was more for plowed plots than no-till plots — 12.4 vs. 10.9 t ha−1. The increase in yam tuber yield due to mulching was 21% for no-till and 28% for plowed treatments.

We evaluated soil nutrient concentration, soil acidity and soil organic matter status under natural Chromolaena fallow, fallow without Chromolaena (where Chromolaena was removed by hand), and planted Pueraria fallow in three different sites with different soil physico-chemical properties in southern Cameroon. Human population pressure is high and fallow length is short in the northern site, while an intermediate position and the contrary were observed in the central and southern sites, respectively. The highest nutrient concentrations (Ca2+ and Mg2+), and effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) were found in the sandy clayey soils in the northern site. The lowest Al saturation and soil acidity were noticed in the sandy soils in the central site, while in the clayey soils in the southern site the lowest nutrient concentration, ECEC, and the highest soil acidity and Al saturation were found. Pueraria decreased soil acidity and increased nutrient concentration relative to Chromolaena in the northern site. The beneficial effects of Pueraria on soil acidity and nutrient concentration became less pronounced in the central site and were absent in the southern site. In the northern and central sites, the highest maize yield was observed under Pueraria, showing the responsiveness of maize to N. In the soils of the southern site with the smaller weight (&lt;1.50 mg per g of soil) of particulate organic matter (POM) (53–4000 μm) and greater chemical constraints (high soil acidity and Al saturation), higher in N content in medium (250–2000 μm) and fine (53–250 μm) \{POM\} was found under Pueraria compared to natural fallow. N content in medium \{POM\} under Pueraria was greater by 47% compared to the natural fallow. The N content in fine \{POM\} under Pueraria was greater by 59% relative to the natural fallow. In the southern site, chemical constraints induced very low maize yields under all fallow types. It appears that \{POM\} quality, i.e. N content, was more important for maize than \{POM\} quantity, i.e. weight, while groundnut and cassava were more sensitive to \{POM\} quantity. Pueraria have a beneficial ecological and environmental sustainability in the soil with low acidity, while Chromolaena seems to be more sustainable than Pueraria in the acidic soils. However, crop yields found in this study were low. Maize yield was lower than 2000 kg ha−1, groundnut grain dry matter yield was lower than 600 kg ha−1 and cassava was lower than 400 tuber dry matter kg ha−1. Therefore, to attain, highest productivity levels it is necessary to combine fallow management (primarily planted such as Pueraria which can increase N content even where there are chemical constraints or soil degradation) with the use of fertilisers (organic and mineral).

Here we aimed at assessing the quality of seeds acquired from the informal SS, and compared this with the quality of seeds obtained from the formal SS. Cowpea seed production in northern Nigeria was used as a case study to evaluate the seed health of samples from farmers, seed companies, and foundation seed producers. In two years, a total of 45,500 seeds from 91 seed samples from 43 sources (farmers, seed companies and research) were tested for seed-borne bacteria and fungi by plating disinfested seed onto an agar medium. The most commonly isolated plant pathogens were Fusarium oxysporum (69% of the samples), Macrophomina phaseolina (76%) and Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (48%). The infection incidence, the percentage of seeds infected per sample, varied from 0.2 to 75.6%. F. oxysporum had a median infection incidence of 9% in 2009 and 25% in 2010, while M. phaseolina had a median infection between 4 and 10%.

No evidence was found that seed recycling in the informal \{SS\} did lead to increased levels of seed-borne pathogens. In contrast to farmers, seed companies distribute seed over large distances, and therefore form a potential threat for spreading diseases at relatively large scale. Responsible authorities are recommended to make seed dressing mandatory for all seeds sold by seed companies. "

While some empirical studies examine the conditions catalysing the successful formation of cooperatives, quantifications of the net benefits, i.e., difference between revenues and costs, of cooperation and how farmers divide these net benefits are scarce. Therefore, we develop a quantitative framework to analyse and allocate net benefits in a cooperative production agreement. The framework allows for cooperative exchange of several types of resources and the production of multiple products. Linear programming provides insight into optimal production levels, both for individual and cooperating farmers, and gives optimal revenue levels. A transaction cost function is used to account for costs of cooperation, such as meeting costs, moral hazard and free ridership of labour use and the risks of farmers defaulting from the agreement. Transaction costs are likely to increase with the number of households participating, the total cropping area and the heterogeneity of resources of the cooperating farmers. Therefore, we introduce a measure of heterogeneity in the resources for each cooperative. Finally, cooperative game theory is used to generate fair divisions of the net benefits in a cooperative. This framework may be used to give additional explanations to the findings in empirical studies on cooperatives. We illustrate this with an empirical example from northern Nigeria. It is found that cooperation between farmers sharing complementary resources gives the highest revenues. Next, we illustrate the effects of two different transaction cost functions. For reasonable assumptions on these functions, cooperation remains economically attractive. Nevertheless, larger and more diverse coalitions are not always the most beneficial, while the returns in some small coalitions are negative, possibly impeding the formation of cooperatives in some locations.

This paper explores the case of northern Nigeria, by using a combination of multi-attribute utility theory and bio-economic modelling. This approach allowed us to identify heterogeneity in production strategies and to quantify its effect on the use of soil nutrient resources. We find that farmers with larger land holdings place more emphasis on gross margins in their utility function, while those with larger holdings of fertile fadama fields place more emphasis on sustainability. Risk aversion, operationalised through variance minimization, appears an important attribute in the utility function of many farm households that are more dependent on agriculture for their overall income. A regression analysis shows that differences in production strategies significantly affect nutrient balances, but also shows that such effects are heterogeneous across locations. We find more favourable nutrient balances for some of the more market-oriented farm households who place more emphasis on sustainability. In farm plans of the most risk-averse households, the production of cereals for subsistence consumption dominates and leads to negative soil nutrient balances, especially for potassium. Farmers who place a large importance on gross margins are likely to benefit most from policies aimed at enhancing profitability through improving functioning of markets. The large group of risk-averse farmers will have the largest immediate gain in utility from policies and technologies aimed at reducing production risk in high-value crops. Additional policies aimed at creating a stronger market-oriented production by the least-endowed farm households could play a role in reducing intensity of soil fertility mining. Under these conditions, the efficient cropping pattern shifts partially from cereal cropping to high-value crops, associated with higher input use. The main results are similar to those in other studies, although some of the nutrient balances are less negative. The results do appear to be sensitive to the type of cropping activities included in the analysis, and additional methodological research is required. Extensions of the used method should further account for temporal and spatial differences in soil fertility, leading to differences in nutrient uptake and production, as well as potential temporal heterogeneity in production strategies.

These aspects are discussed in this review. In general terms, it has been found that root and tuber crops are sensitive to soil compaction, inadequate aeration or poor drainage and therefore respond favorably to intensive tillage, followed by ridging or mounding. However, large differences exist between crops, with potato, sweet potato and yam requiring more intensive cultivation than cassava and taro. On light-textured soils, cassava can be grown without or with minimum tillage as long as weeds are controlled; in heavy or compacted soil cassava responds favorably to tillage and yields tend to increase when grown on ridges. In order to reduce erosion as well as production costs, cassava should be grown with as little tillage as possible as long as high yield can be maintained. Contour ridging and mulching are other practices that not only tend to increase yields but also reduce erosion losses. Organized data for use in a classification of the tillage requirements of different soils for the various root crops is lacking. We suggest that research efforts should be directed towards the characterization of the physico-chemical and biological factors which determine the tillage requirements of a given soil for a given root crop.

The climate smart agriculture rapid appraisal (CSA-RA) is a mixed method approach that draws on participatory bottom-up, qualitative, and quantitative tools to assess the heterogeneity of local contexts, and prioritize context-specific \{CSA\} options. This is an imperative if countries are to respond to the \{COP21\} agreement and meet their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs). The CSA-RA is designed to assess biophysical including climatic, socio-cultural, economic and technological characteristics at the household, farm and community/regional level. The CSA-RA employs gender-disaggregated methods, including gender differences in perceptions of climate change and its impacts. The CSA-RA combines common participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and rapid rural appraisal (RRA) tools into one methodology, that disaggregates the gender dimension, and includes resource mapping; climate calendars; historical calendars; cropping calendars; organization mapping; transect walks; key informant interviews; farmer interviews; and pairwise ranking matrix. The tool collects qualitative and quantitative data from various stakeholders (farmers, local leaders, researchers, local-level agricultural experts, private sector actors, donor organizations, and policy implementers), allowing expansive analysis, triangulation and validation. Application of the CSA-RA in Tanzania and Uganda reveals heterogeneity across the sites in terms of vulnerability, constraints and \{CSA\} priorities among different social groups (gender) and agro-ecological zones. Thus, the CSA-RA allows stakeholders to simultaneously take into account biophysical and socio-economic aspects to target and implement CSA. "

abstract = "Tuber yields of yam (Dioscorea spp.), a main staple food in West Africa, are steadily declining per unit area, an incidence for which decreasing soil fertility due to increasing land pressure is largely blamed. Recent studies demonstrated the association of a plethora of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) with yam, soil microorganisms crucial for natural soil fertility. Thus, inoculation of yam with \{AMF\} could help reverse declining yields, above all in soils with a strong loss of \{AMF\} diversity due to agricultural land use intensification. In a pot experiment, we studied the impact of indigenous and exotic \{AMF\} isolates on growth performance of micro-propagated white yam plantlets (Dioscorea rotundata, cv.TDr89/02461). Pots were inoculated with single spore derived isolates of Glomus etunicatum, originating from tropical environments in West Africa, South America and Asia and, for comparison, also with three isolates of other \{AMF\} species from temperate Europe. In addition, isolates of nine \{AMF\} species originating from sub-Saharan West Africa and three commercial \{AMF\} were compared. Six of the 11 isolates of G. etunicatum from the tropics increased yam tuber growth compared with non-mycorrhizal controls, whereas the European \{AMF\} species tended to be less efficient but led to an increased tuber phosphorus concentration. The African isolates of G. mosseae, G. hoi, G. etunicatum, Acaulospora scrobiculata and A. spinosa generally led to increased tuber growth compared with non-mycorrhizal controls, while isolates of G. sinuosum and Kuklospora kentinensis did not. Our study indicates that inoculation of micro-propagated yam plantlets with selected indigenous \{AMF\} could potentially constitute a sustainable measure to boost yam productivity again in degraded African soils.

Drought, in particular, represents one of the most important natural factors contributing to malnutrition and famine in many parts of the region. The overall impact of drought on a given country/region and its ability to recover from the resulting social, economic and environmental impacts depends on several factors. The economic, social and environmental impacts of drought are huge in \{SSA\} and the national costs and losses incurred threaten to undermine the wider economic and development gains made in the last few decades in the region. There is an urgent need to reduce the vulnerability of countries to climate variability and to the threats posed by climate change. This paper attempts to highlight the challenges of drought in \{SSA\} and reviews the current drought risk management strategies, especially the promising technological and policy options for managing drought risks to protect livelihoods and reduce vulnerability. The review suggests the possibilities of several ex ante and ex post drought management strategies in \{SSA\} although their effectiveness depends on agro-climatic and socio-economic conditions. Existing technological, policy and institutional risk management measures need to be strengthened and integrated to manage drought ex ante and to minimize the ex post negative effects for vulnerable households and regions. A proactive approach that combines promising technological, institutional and policy solutions to manage the risks within vulnerable communities implemented by institutions operating at different levels (community, sub-national, and national) is considered to be the way forward for managing drought and climate variability.

Adoption of \{ISC\} increased from 44 participating farmers in four pilot areas to more than 500 farmers in 16 villages and hamlets in three seasons. On average, farmers adopted 3.25 different Striga control options from a basket of six “best bets”. Resource-poor and -medium farmers were more likely to adopt than resource-rich ones. Adopting farmers enjoyed livelihood improvements, largely through selling \{ISC\} soybean. Women in most adopting households benefited through selling food products based on soybean. Adoption of \{ISC\} can be attributed to four factors: (1) farmer-field-school-type training that explained how the technologies worked; (2) incorporation of at least one technology in the \{ISC\} package that gave quick benefits to sustain farmer interest in adopting and learning other components whose effects took longer to become evident; (3) allowance for farmer experimentation and adaptation to local conditions; and, (4) use of a monitoring and evaluation component that identified and incorporated farmer modifications to continually improve the \{ISC\} package. These principles are likely to be valid for research and extension approaches for similar integrated natural resource management (INRM). Impact pathway evaluation methodology used for the evaluation helped give the project a greater impact focus; helped design and reporting of the evaluation; and, by identifying early adoption pathways, has provided a firm basis for any future ex post impact assessment of \{ISC\} in Northern Nigeria.

The accumulated knowledge on soil management gathered over the last 10 years, combined with solid crop improvement and plant health research at farmers’ level, has brought us to a stage where we can now address with confidence the intensification of cereal–grain–legume-based cropping systems in the dry savanna of West Africa in a sustainable and environmentally positive manner. Two sustainable farming systems that greatly enhance the productivity and sustainability of integrated livestock systems have been developed and implemented in the dry savanna of Nigeria. These are: (i) maize (Zea mays L.)–promiscuous soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotations that combine high nitrogen fixation and the ability to kill large numbers of Striga hermonthica seeds in the soil; and (ii) miflet [Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaerth] and dual-purpose cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.]. Improvement of the cropping systems in the dry savanna has been driven by the adoption of promiscuously nodulating soybean varieties (in particular \{TGx\} 1448-2E) and dual-purpose cowpea. The rate of adoption is very high, even in the absence of an efficient seed distribution system. The number of farmers cultivating the improved varieties increased by 228% during the last 3 years. Increased production of promiscuous soybean has been stimulated by increased demand from industries and home utilization. Production in Nigeria was estimated at 405,000 t in 1999 compared to less than 60,000 t in 1984. Economic analysis of these systems shows already an increase of 50–70% in the gross incomes of adopting farmers compared to those still following the current practices, mainly continuous maize cultivation. Furthermore, increases in legume areas of 10% in Nigeria (about 30,000 ha in the northern Guinea savanna) and increases of 20% in yield have translated into additional fixed nitrogen valued annually at US$ 44 million. This reflects, at the same time, an equivalent increase in land-use productivity, and with further spread of the improved crops, there are excellent prospects for additional economic and environmental benefits from a very large recommendation domain across West Africa.

Field tests against this locust are notoriously difficult in non-outbreak years so the applicability of ‘pre-field trials’ is discussed. In an arena test, the effect of direct contact with spray droplets was quantified, and large semi-permanent cages were constructed to investigate the effects of droplet size and the importance of secondary pick-up of spray residues. A formulation containing approximately 1.0 × 1012 live conidia.l−1 was applied using a Micron ‘Micro-Ulva’ to four groups of locusts in arenas positioned in four rows downwind of a single spray line. Their subsequent mortality (at days 8–12 after application) was correlated with the number of droplets per cm2 on artificial targets placed in each arena. Under these experimental conditions, at least 50 droplets.cm2 appear to be necessary to achieve &gt; 90% mortality at 10 days by direct contact only, or approximately 30 droplets.cm2 to achieve a similar effect by day 12. In experiments carried out in large field cages, locusts were released onto millet plants sprayed using various versions of an air-assisted spinning disc sprayer: the ‘Ulvafan’. Droplet size spectra of these sprayers with an oil-based formulation are illustrated. In one test, there was no significant difference between mycoinsecticide applications with two different droplet sizes and 50% mortality was achieved by day 8. A second experiment indicated that although it took a shorter time to kill 50% of the insects directly exposed to spray droplets, there was no significant difference in the average survival time between locusts exposed directly and those picking up spores exclusively from the vegetation.

To assess food security outcomes, we employ the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) – a tool that has not been used for impact assessment before. Estimates of treatment-effects models show that \{TC\} banana adoption, combined with improved crop management, causes considerable increases in farm and household income. Technology adoption also reduces relative food insecurity in a significant way. These results indicate that \{TC\} technology can be welfare enhancing for adopting farm households. Adoption should be further promoted through upscaling appropriate technology delivery systems. "

The four atoxigenic strains were individually formulated on sterile sorghum grain and subsequently mixed in equal proportions. The blended product was applied on soil (40 kg/ha), 2–3 weeks before flowering. Grains from treated and untreated fields were analyzed for aflatoxins at harvest and after storage. Proportions of the A. flavus population composed of each of the four applied strains in soil before treatment and in harvested grains were determined using vegetative compatibility analyses. Application of the strain mixture resulted in reduced aflatoxin content and significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased the combined frequencies of the vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) of the applied strains recovered from the soil and grain. Aflatoxin reductions of 67–95% were associated with a 74–80% combined incidence of the \{VCGs\} of the four atoxigenic strains on the treated crops. The applied atoxigenic strains remained with the crop into storage and reduced postharvest increases in contamination. The results suggest that the evaluated multi-strain formulated product has potential to contribute to reduced aflatoxin contamination in Nigeria. This is the first report of a field evaluation of an endemic strain mixture effective at reducing aflatoxin contamination during crop development. "

Based on completed questionnaires, reconnaisance visits to 21 of the 24 local government areas of Oyo State, coupled with official documents and personal communications, the team found that: (i) effective distribution of plantable stems to the majority of cassava farmers did not begin until the second half of the 1976–1985 decade, (ii) the required capacity for, and rate of multiplication of \{IITA\} cassava varieties was grossly inadequate, (iii) the varieties are yet to be introduced to some localities due to a poor stem supply system for these cassava varieties and (iv) a large potential exists for further adoption of \{IITA\} varieties if farmers can obtain more plantable stems. This study identified the short supply of plantable stems to farmers as the chief obstacle to a wider spread, adoption, and use of \{IITA\} improved cassava for meeting the food needs of cassava-dependent rural farm families in Oyo State.

This paper examines the effect on farm profitability of smallholder maize farmers’ use of intensification technologies in tropical agriculture. The survey was conducted in southwest Nigeria. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select 300 respondents from two major agroclimatic zones in Osun State. Primary data were collected using a structured questionnaire and complemented with focus group discussions (FGDs), while the State’s Ministry of Agriculture provided secondary data. Pressure on land was found high because farmland was continuously cropped for an average of 10 years with a mean fallow period of 2 years only. Technologies used to intensify agriculture included inorganic fertilizer, organic manure, alley cropping, and tree planting. Results from costs and returns analysis showed that average net returns to inorganic fertilizer use ranked highest in the two zones, while tree planting ranked lowest. There was a significant ecoregional difference on the average net returns/year earned by users of mineral fertilizer. While organic manure use earned higher net returns than alley cropping practice in the rain forest, the reverse was the case for the derived savanna. \{FGDs\} revealed that respondents’ preferred to use inorganic fertilizer despite its inadequate supply because, apart from enhancing higher returns and net gains, it also improved output level and provided an opportunity for the continuous use of the scarce land. These results imply that economic returns play a critical role in farmers’ use of intensification technologies and consequently affect their resource management decisions. Policy measures aimed at promoting research on appropriate technologies that are profitable on farmers’ fields will be more effective in enhancing farmers’ use of intensification technologies. "

A three-stage sampling technique was used to select communities and fields in targeted Local Government Areas in the two States. The soils in the two States were generally of low fertility, characterized by low levels of total N, organic C, available P and exchangeable bases. In Kano State, Striga incidence ranged from 0 to 100%. One hundred percent of the maize fields sampled in Bauchi State had Striga. In general, Striga population was more than twice higher in Bauchi State [3.1 plants m−2] than in Kano State [1.4 plants m−2]. There were differences in Striga population and severity of attacks between the States and between communities within States. In Kano State, the Striga population was negatively related to latitude, total N, and exchangeable K and was positively related to sand and silt. In Bauchi State, Striga was negatively related to clay, exchangeable K, and Ca, and was positively related to pH and latitude. In both states, the Striga population was negatively correlated with maize grain yield. Up to 75% of the variations in maize grain yield in Kano State could be explained by Striga population and soil organic C. Management of Striga usually requires several measures, however, improving the levels of soil fertility should be the central component of any integrated Striga management approach. "

Control efforts at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Nigeria, focus on developing integrated S. hermonthica management (ISM) options such as legume-cereal rotation, use of host–plant resistance, soil-based biological control exploiting enhancement of naturally occurring biotic soil suppressiveness, and use of acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibiting herbicides as host–crop seed treatments. We investigated, in pots, if soybean crops with or without fertilizer (N, P, or NPK) and preceding a maize crop used as a bioassay enhanced biotic soil suppressiveness to S. hermonthica, and if the ALS-inhibitor herbicides, imazaquin and nicosulfuron, used to control weeds in preceding crops constitute any risk to this biotic system. Factors tested included: (1) crop preceding bioassay maize (soybean [EMGOPA] versuss maize [8338-1]); (2) herbicide weed control in preceding crop (imazaquin in soybean and nicosulfuron in maize versus hand weeding); (3) fertilizer application to preceding crop (90 kg N ha−1, 40 kg P ha−1; 90 kg NPK; versus no fertilizer); (4) soil treatment before planting bioassay maize (pasteurized soil versus non-pasteurized soil). Effects of treatments on biotic suppressiveness were evaluated by comparing effects of treatments in non-pasteurized soil with those of the same treatments in pasteurized soil. Results indicated that biotic soil suppressiveness to S. hermonthica existed naturally in the soil used and was enhanced by a preceding soybean crop and application of N, P or \{NPK\} fertilizers. Weed control using ALS-inhibiting herbicides in the preceding crops, particularly imazaquin applied in soybean, had a negative effect on natural soil suppressiveness to S. hermonthica parasitism in maize. Results of this study further confirm the biotic nature of soil suppressiveness to S. hermonthica, and stress its important role in ISM. Land-based management strategies for S. hermonthica control, such as legume crops in rotation to enhance soil N and fertilizer application appear to directly enhance soil suppressiveness to S. hermonthica. Because ALS-inhibiting herbicides pose a risk to biotic soil suppressiveness, their use as a primary control measure for S. hermonthica control in Africa may not be a sustainable approach. "

Field surveys were undertaken in Jigawa State, Nigeria in 2012 to assess (i) the level and extent of Strgia infestation of cereal and cowpea fields (ii) the severity of Striga attack on crops and (iii) to determine the factors associated with Striga infestation of crop fields. The study was conducted in 48 communities. Eight farmer's fields were sampled in each community along two intersecting transects. Striga hermonthica incidence ranged from 58 to 100% in sorghum fields and from 0 to 100% in millet fields. In sorghum and millet fields, number of emerged Striga plants ranged from 4750 to 431,500 and 0 to 251,750 plants ha−1 respectively. For cowpea, S. gesnerioides population ranged from 1625 to 105,375 plants ha−1. The severity of Striga attack on sorghum was devastating in all the communities studied. Except in a few cases, all cowpea plants in fields surveyed in most communities were attacked by S. gesnerioides. Field infestation was largely related to poor soil fertility. Stepwise multiple regression identified latitude, pH, available P, Cu and exchangeable K as potentially most important in explaining observed variations in S. hermonthica infestation in sorghum fields. For millet fields, soil pH, available P, Zn and latitude accounted for most of the variations in Striga population whereas latitude, total N, organic C, exchangeable Ca, ECEC, pH, available Mn and Cu accounted for most of the observed variations in S. gesnerioides population in cowpea fields. Our study showed that Striga is a major problem in Jigawa State with almost all the cowpea, sorghum and millet fields infested with the parasite. Improved soil fertility management technologies and Striga-resistant crop varieties are needed to address the menace of Striga in the State. "

abstract = "Abstract Cassava mosaic disease (CMD), caused by different species of cassava mosaic geminiviruses (CMGs), is the most important disease of cassava in Africa and the Indian sub-continent. The cultivated cassava species is protected from \{CMD\} by polygenic resistance introgressed from the wild species Manihot glaziovii and a dominant monogenic type of resistance, named CMD2, discovered in African landraces. The ability of the monogenic resistance to confer high levels of resistance in different genetic backgrounds has led recently to its extensive usage in breeding across Africa as well as pre-emptive breeding in Latin America. However, most of the landraces carrying the monogenic resistance are morphologically very similar and come from a geographically restricted area of West Africa, raising the possibility that the diversity of the single-gene resistance could be very limited, or even located at a single locus. Several mapping studies, employing bulk segregant analysis, in different genetic backgrounds have reported additional molecular markers linked to supposedly new resistance genes. However, it is not possible to tell if these are indeed new genes in the absence adequate genetic map framework or allelism tests. To address this important question, a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map of cassava was developed through genotyping-by-sequencing a bi-parental mapping population (N = 180) that segregates for the dominant monogenic resistance to CMD. Virus screening using \{PCR\} showed that \{CMD\} symptoms and presence of virus were strongly correlated (r = 0.98). Genome-wide scan and high-resolution composite interval mapping using 6756 \{SNPs\} uncovered a single locus with large effect (R2 = 0.74). Projection of the previously published resistance-linked microsatellite markers showed that they co-occurred in the same chromosomal location surrounding the presently mapped resistance locus. Moreover, their relative distance to the mapped resistance locus correlated with the reported degree of linkage with the resistance phenotype. Cluster analysis of the landraces first shown to have this type of resistance revealed that they are very closely related, if not identical. These findings suggest that there is a single source of monogenic resistance in the crop's genepool tracing back to a common ancestral clone. In the absence of further resistance diversification, the long-term effectiveness of the single gene resistance is known to be precarious, given the potential to be overcome by \{CMGs\} due to their fast-paced evolutionary rate. However, combining the quantitative with the qualitative type of resistance may ensure that this resistance gene continues to offer protection to cassava, a crop that is depended upon by millions of people in Africa against the devastating onslaught of CMGs.

abstract = "Abstract The annual harvest of banana and plantain (Musa spp.) is approximately 145 million tons worldwide. About 85% of this global production comes from small plots and kitchen or backyard gardens from the developing world, and only 15% goes to the export trade. Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana are the ancestors of several hundreds of parthenocarpic Musa diploid and polyploid cultivars, which show multiple origins through inter- and intra-specific hybridizations from these two wild diploid species. Generating hybrids combining host plant resistance to pathogens and pests, short growth cycles and height, high fruit yield, parthenocarpy, and desired quality from the cultivars remains a challenge for Musa crossbreeding, which started about one century ago in Trinidad. The success of Musa crossbreeding depends on the production of true hybrid seeds in a crop known for its high levels of female sterility, particularly among polyploid cultivars. All banana export cultivars grown today are, however, selections from somatic mutants of the group Cavendish and have a very narrow genetic base, while smallholders in sub-Saharan Africa, tropical Asia and Latin America use some bred-hybrids (mostly cooking types). Musa improvement goals need to shift to address emerging threats because of the changing climate. Innovative cell and molecular biology tools have the potential to enhance the pace and efficiency of genetic improvement in Musa. Micro-propagation has been successful for high throughput of clean planting materials while in vitro seed germination assists in obtaining seedlings after inter-specific and across ploidy hybridization. Flow cytometry protocols are used for checking ploidy among genebank accessions and breeding materials. \{DNA\} markers, the genetic maps based on them, and the recent sequencing of the banana genome offer means for gaining more insights in the genetics of the crops and to identifying genes that could lead to accelerating Musa betterment. Likewise, \{DNA\} fingerprinting has been useful to characterize Musa diversity. Genetic engineering provides a complementary tool to Musa breeders who can introduce today transgenes that may confer resistance to bacteria, fungi and nematodes, or enhance pro-vitamin A fruit content. In spite of recent advances, the genetic improvement of Musa depends on a few crossbreeding programs (based in Brazil, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Guadeloupe, Honduras, India, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda) or a handful of genetic engineering endeavors (Australia, Belgium, India, Kenya, Malaysia and Uganda). Development investors (namely international aid and philanthropy) should therefore increase their funding to genetically enhance this crop that ranks among the 10-top staple foods of the developing world.

Walp.) were studied in a rice fallow of an inland valley swamp in central Nigeria during the dry seasons of 1988 and 1989. Soil physical properties measured were particle size distribution, bulk density, soil water retention, penetrometer resistance, pore size distribution, soil temperature and wetness. In general, soil compaction was such that zero tillage ⪢ minimum tillage ⋍ mounds. The proportion of macropores in the 0–0.05 m depth was 18%, 35.2% and 42.0%, with zero tillage, minimum tillage and mounds, respectively. Diurnal soil temperatures and soil wetness were highest and lowest, respectively, on mounds, and lowest and highest, respectively, with zero tillage. Mulching had no effect on compaction but decreased diurnal soil temperature and increased wetness. The combination of zero tillage and mulch resulted in a wet, cool and compacted seedbed, whereas the warmest, driest and most porous seedbed was the bare mound. Grain yield of cowpea was not significantly affected by seedbed preparation method. Seedbed preparation methods which increase porosity and are not labour-intensive (e.g. minimum tillage) are, therefore, more appropriate for cowpea production in inland valley swamps. Mulching was effective in increasing yield, only when rainfall occurred prior to the onset of reproductive growth in cowpea such that yield was increased by 36% in 1988, but not in 1989. However, rainfall analyses indicate that moderate amounts of rainfall are likely to occur during the latter part of the dry season when reproductive growth of cowpea takes place. The least risky and hence, most appropriate soil management system for dry-season cowpea production in rice fallows of inland valley swamps is, therefore, a combination of minimum tillage and mulch.

Adingnigon, on the Abomey plateau, represents a level of severe degradation, while Hayakpa, on the Allada plateau, is still relatively non-degraded. Treatments included: (i) an unamended control, (ii) P fertilizer only, applied in 1998 or 1999, and (iii) P plus K applied in 1999. At Hayakpa, yields without fertilizer were generally moderate to high; responses to P were statistically significant and K application had a significant effect on soybean yield in 2000. At Adingnigon, P application had a large relative effect (30–200%) but a small absolute effect (less than 100 kg/ha) on cowpea and soybean yield. Subsequent K application increased grain yields further (approximately 100 kg/ha) but still not up to the cowpea yield potential. When 13 Mg/ha of organic amendment (chicken manure or cotton seed) were applied to severely degraded plots at Adingnigon with prior grain yields below 200 kg/ha, cowpea yields of more than 500 kg/ha were achieved, approaching their biological potential for the zone. It is clear from this study that (i) P and K inputs are needed for grain legumes even on relatively non-degraded terre de barre soils and (ii) inorganic fertilizer alone will not revive highly degraded soils on the terre de barre plateaus of southern Bénin.

Wheat lines that are stochastically dominant (“risk-efficient”) exhibit a particular type of environmental adaptation (relatively good performance in poor environments) which makes them suitable for risk-averse farmers. The results of the analysis lend support to the hypothesis that recently bred lines are more risk efficient and thus more suitable for peasant farmers than lines which appeared in the early ISWYNs. Risk-efficiency implies good adaptations to poor environments, although some lines may also perform well in good environments. There was a tendency for risk-efficient lines to be high mean yielders, but many exceptions existed. A combination of high mean yield and risk-efficiency is a virtual guarantee of good performance across all environments. Consequently, stochastic dominance analysis for risk-efficiency would seem to be a useful adjunct to simple measures of mean yield or other more sophisticated analytical methods. Comparisons between the results of stochastic dominance analysis and pattern analysis of the same data set indicated a general tendency for groups formed by pattern analysis to contain lines of the same degree of stochastic dominance. This is not entirely unexpected, since both forms of analysis group together lines whose performance across environments is similar, even though stochastic dominance analysis concentrates on the poor environments. However, there is no guarantee that stochastically dominant (risk-efficient) lines also perform relatively well in good environments and some risk-efficient lines were identified that did not. These were largely from the lower yielding groups. "

For both villages smallholder capacity for future \{REDD\} + project adoption was found to require reinforcement to guarantee local feasibility of \{REDD\} + projects. Possibilities to encourage already in use agroforestry systems under a \{REDD\} + scheme are discussed.

Farmers insist on including low-growing vegetables like okra (Abelmoschus esculentus Moench) and egusi melon (Citrullus lanatus Thunb.) in the complex. Studies were conducted in Ibadan to investigate the effects of inclusion of either or both vegetables on gross economic yields and total land productivity of the cassava/maize-plus-vegetables mixture. Tuber yield of cassava in cassava/maize/okra (15.8 t/ha), cassava/maize/egusi melon (15.1 t/ ha) and cassava/maize/okra/egusi melon (14.5 t/ha) did not differ significantly from that in cassava/maize (16.4 t/ha). Maize grain yield was not depressed by intercropping with vegetables. The economic yields of intercropped okra and egusi melon were reduced by more than 50% of their respective sole crop yields. The cassava/maize cropping system yielded highest calories per hectare per day (18.6 × 104 cal ha−1 day−1) but land productivity, based on land equivalent ratio (ler), was higher where the cassava/maize system (ler = 1.58) included both okra and egusi melon (ler = 1.60).

Viruses are pervasive in yam worldwide, decreasing growth and yield, as well as hindering the international movement of germplasm. Badnaviruses have been reported to be the most prevalent in yam, and genomes of some other badnaviruses are known to be integrated in their host plant species. However, it was not clear if a similar scenario occurs in Dioscorea yam. This study was conducted to verify the prevalence of badnaviruses, and determine if badnavirus genomes are integrated in the yam genome. Leaf samples (n = 58) representing eight species of yam from global yam collections kept at CIRAD, France, and 127 samples of D. rotundata breeding lines (n = 112) and landraces (n = 15) at IITA, Nigeria, were screened using generic badnavirus \{PCR\} primers. Positive amplification of an expected ca. 579 bp fragment, corresponding to a partial RT-RNaseH region, was detected in 47 (81%) of 58 samples analysed from \{CIRAD\} collections, and 100% of the 127 \{IITA\} D. rotundata samples. All the D. cayenensis and D. rotundata samples from the \{CIRAD\} and \{IITA\} collections tested PCR-positive, and sequencing of a selection of the \{PCR\} products confirmed they were typical of the genus Badnavirus. A comparison of serological and nucleic acid techniques was used to investigate whether the PCR-positives were sequences amplified from badnavirus particles or putative endogenous badnavirus sequences in the yam genome. Protein A sandwich-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PAS-ELISA) with badnavirus polyclonal antisera detected cross-reacting viral particles in only 60% (92 of 153) of the \{CIRAD\} collection samples analysed, in contrast to the aforementioned 81% by PCR. Immunosorbent electron microscopy (ISEM) of virus preparations of a select set of 16 samples, representing different combinations of positive and negative \{PCR\} and PAS-ELISA results, identified bacilliform particles in 11 of these samples. Three PCR-positive yam samples from Burkina Faso (cv. Pilimpikou) were identified in which no viral particles were detected by either PAS-ELISA or ISEM. Southern hybridisation results using a yam badnavirus RT-RNaseH sequence (Gn155Dr) as probe, supported a lack of badnavirus particles in the cv. Pilimpikou and identified their equivalent sequences to be of plant genome origin. Probe Gn155Dr, however, hybridised to viral particles and plant genomic \{DNA\} in three D. rotundata samples from Guinea. These results represent the first data demonstrating the presence of integrated sequences of badnaviruses in yam. The implications of this for virus-indexing, breeding and multiplication of seed yams are discussed. "

Soil samples were taken at the onset of the rainy season before application of fresh organic inputs in March 2011. We studied the abundance (quantitative PCR) and community structure (T-RFLP analysis) of the total (i.e., 16S rRNA gene) and specifically proteolytic (i.e., npr gene encoding neutral metalloproteases) bacteria. Alterations of the soil microbial decomposer community were related to differences of quantity (i.e., soil carbon (TC)) and particularly composition of SOC, where mid-infrared spectroscopic (DRIFTS) information, and contents of extractable soil polyphenol (PP) and the newly introduced PP-to-TC ratio served as \{SOC\} quality indicators. For total bacteria, effect of organic input quality was minor in comparison to the predominant influence of soil texture. Elevated soil \{PP\} content, driven by polypheneol rich organic inputs, was not suppressive for overall bacterial proliferation, unless additional decomposable C substrates were available as indicated by PP-to-TC ratios. In contrast to the total bacterial community, biochemical quality of organic inputs exposed a stronger effect on functionally specialized bacterial decomposers, i.e., proteolytic bacteria. The npr gene abundance was depressed in the \{TD\} treated soils as opposed to soils receiving CC, and showed a positive correlation with soil PP. It was suggested that the high presence of lignin and polyphenol relative to the N content in organic inputs was increasing the npr gene abundance to counteract most likely the existence of polyphenol–protein complexes aggravating protein degradation. We concluded from our study that integration of spectroscopic, geochemical (i.e., soil PP) and molecular soil data provides a novel pathway to enhance our understanding of the lasting effect of organic input quality induced \{SOC\} quality changes on bacterial decomposers and particularly proteolytic bacteria driving soil organic N cycling.

Fifth-instar locust nymphs, reared in the laboratory, were treated with various concentrations of one of the two pathogens or with both pathogens. The numbers of locusts killed were recorded each day and the production of pathogen spores within the dead locusts was assessed at the end (day 21) of each experiment. Locust nymphs treated with both P. locustae and M. anisopliae died sooner than nymphs infected with only one of the pathogens. At the lower concentrations of pathogen tested, the effects of the two pathogens were additive. At the higher concentrations the combined effects were synergistic. In terms of locust mortality, there was no evidence of any antagonistic effects between the two pathogens. However, the production of spores by P. locustae was reduced considerably when the host insects were infected also with M. anisopliae. For example, nymphs treated initially with P. locustae and then treated 3 and 10 days later with M. anisopliae produced 3–20 times and 2.5–8 times fewer spores, respectively, than nymphs treated only with P. locustae. Hence, in areas where M. anisopliae is applied, the natural persistence of P. locustae in the local grasshopper and locust populations may be diminished. "

Six genotypes of Dioscorea alata, planted on six dates (March–August) in each of 1998 and 1999 in Ibadan, Nigeria, were evaluated to determine the effects of planting date and genotype on severity of the two diseases. The date of planting had a profound influence on anthracnose severity, contributing 72% of the observed variation due to combined effects of planting date, genotype and their interactions. In contrast, the genotype effect was most dominant with respect to virus severity, accounting for 85% of the total observed variation. Planting in August supported least anthracnose development while April and May plantings resulted in the least severity of virus diseases. While selection of planting time could be used to manage anthracnose disease, its application could be influenced by the prevailing weather conditions in a particular location. Two of the genotypes (TDa 291 and \{TDa\} 297) had low severity values for both diseases across the different planting dates. Availability of such sources of multiple disease resistance and appropriate choice of planting date would be very useful in integrated management of the two major yam diseases. "

However, approximately 10% of the \{FA\} were as resistant as the average of the introduced GA, showing the potential of selection for resistance to Ppr in farmers’ fields. The average level of resistance of the \{FA\} was relatively higher than that of the local GA.

By use of linear regression and a modified Logan model and with eggs of the noctuid Sesamia calamistis Hampson as hosts, the lower and upper thresholds for development were estimated at 13.1 and 36°C, respectively, and the optimal temperature for development was 31°C. Female T. isis had no measurable preoviposition period, and the oviposition period ranged from 3 to 5 days. Approximately 66% of the total lifetime complement of eggs of T. isis were produced within 6 h after emergence. Average total lifetime fecundity was 61.1 and 82.1 eggs per female at 21 and 28°C, respectively. Longevity of adult females was 17.1 days at 21°C and 5.2 days at 30°C. Host acceptance and suitability were tested, using nine lepidopteran borer species. Only the noctuids S. calamistis, Sesamia poephaga (Tam &amp; Bowden), Sesamia botanephaga (Tam &amp; Bowden), and Busseola fusca (Fuller) were successfully attacked by T. isis. Parasitism and emergence did not differ among those species, but the sex ratio (expressed as proportion of female progeny) was significantly lower on S. calamistis. An increase of the host age from 1 to 4 days significantly reduced mean parasitism from 56.7 to 23.5%. Parasitoid emergence rates and sex ratio did not vary among 1-, 2-, or 3-day-old host eggs, but both parameters were significantly lower on 4-day-old eggs. With increasing duration of host deprivation from 0 to 17 days, longevity increased from 8.5 to 18.5 days, whereas average lifetime fecundity decreased from 81.2 to 40.5 eggs per female, respectively, indicating resorption of eggs.

Contrary, no understanding is available regarding its interactions with key rhizosphere microorganisms steering relevant nutrient cycles in soils including nitrogen (N). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that “Foxy-2” displaces indigenous prokaryotic, N cycling communities in the maize rhizosphere due to competition for organic resources. Consequently, we evaluated if the application of an N-rich organic residue (i.e., Tithonia diversifolia with C/N ratio = 13, lignin content = 8.9%, polyphenol content = 1.7%) compensates these presumed competition effects. In a rhizobox experiment, quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to follow the response of rhizosphere ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) as well as total bacteria and archaea following “Foxy-2” inoculation in two physico-chemically contrasting soils (sandy Ferric Alisol versus clayey Humic Nitisol). Soils were treated with or without “Foxy-2”, S. hermonthica seeds, and T. diversifolia residues. Contrary to our expectations, we observed a distinct soil texture dependent, promoting effect of “Foxy-2” on rhizosphere prokaryotes. Abundance of \{AOA\} and total prokaryotic communities increased in response to “Foxy-2” in the sandy soil, while \{AOB\} remained unaffected. This effect on \{AOA\} was accelerated when T. diversifolia residues were incorporated. Further, in the clayey soil, \{AOA\} abundance was promoted when exposed to S. hermonthica infestation of maize. This suggested their capability to adapt to this biotic stress situation. It was concluded that “Foxy-2” did not pose a negative effect on targeted indigenous microorganisms, but the underlying mechanisms for the observed promoting effect of \{AOA\} abundance by “Foxy-2” inoculation are yet to be understood.

Here, we investigated in a Humic Nitisol of 10-year old field experiment in Kenya the effect of contrasting organic inputs (i.e., Tithonia diversifolia (TD; C/N ratio: 13, Lignin: 8.9%; Polyphenols: 1.7%), Calliandra calothyrsus (CC; 13; 13; 9.4) and Zea mays (ZM; 59; 5.4; 1.2); rate of 4 Mg C ha−1 year−1) combined with mineral N fertilizer (120 kg CaNH4NO3 ha−1 growing season−1) on amoA gene-based abundance (i.e., functional potential) and community composition of \{AOB\} and AOA. \{AOB\} abundance was significantly lower in \{CC\} and \{ZM\} compared to TD, whereas \{AOA\} abundance was significantly lower in \{CC\} compared to \{ZM\} and TD. This reduction was attributed to a considerable N stress induced by limited organic N availability in \{ZM\} and polyphenol-protein complexes in CC. High abundance of \{AOA\} under \{ZM\} was attributed to their affinity to ammonium under N limiting conditions. Abundance shifts matched observed community composition differences between \{TD\} versus \{ZM\} (AOB) as well as \{TD\} versus \{ZM\} and \{CC\} (AOA). Mineral N irrespective of organic input type depressed abundance of AOA, but not AOB. This implied utilization of ammonium from fertilizer and organic N by AOB, while \{AOA\} mainly utilized ammonium from organic N. Our findings suggested input type dependent effects on AOB/AOA abundance and community composition, but influence of other factors such as soil type, seasonality and crop growth stages remain uncertain. These factors should not only be studied on basis of the functional potential of ammonia oxidizing prokaryotes as given in this study, but also by rRNA analyses to capture the active proportion of existent \{AOB\} and AOA.

This study assessed the mechanism of this positive rotational effect in terms of soil P availability using a greenhouse trial with large volume (74 l) containers. The rotation effect was analysed in relation to \{PR\} application, previous legume growth and incorporation of the legume residues. Velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens) and maize were grown in a representative Acrisol from the Nigerian Northern Guinea savannah (NGS). All soils were applied with sufficient urea to exclude N-effects in the rotations. In a first season, velvet bean and maize responded similarly to \{PR\} application, and P uptake by both crops increased by 45%. The soil total labile P quantity (E-value) and P concentration in soil solution ( P solution 31 ) after plant growth were increased by PR-application only in soils previously grown by velvet bean, suggesting enhanced \{PR\} solubilisation in the legume-grown soils. In the subsequent season, grain yields and P uptake of a maize crop following velvet bean were twice as large compared to maize following a first maize crop. This residual effect of velvet bean was even significant in treatments without PR-application, although both maize and velvet bean withdrew similar amounts of P during the first season and no differences in soil P availability were observed. Furthermore, legume residue incorporation in soils previously grown by maize did not affect yields or P uptake of the subsequent maize crop, while it significantly increased the E-value and P solution 31 during the first 7 weeks in the second season. As such, the positive rotational effects of velvet bean were larger than predicted by soil P availability measures. Maize yield significantly increased with increasing plant P concentration among all treatments. However, the rotational effect was unrelated to internal P concentration: significantly larger yields were obtained for maize following velvet bean than for maize following maize at identical internal P. This suggested the presence of another growth-limiting which is counteracted by the previous velvet bean growth. In conclusion, our results confirmed that the introduction of a legume supplied with \{PR\} into a maize-based cropping system increases yield and P-uptake by a subsequent maize crop, compared to maize following a first maize crop supplied with PR. These stimulations, however, went beyond improved P nutrition. Results strongly suggested that the legume in the rotation system has other positive, possibly soil-microbiological effects which enhance maize growth and production. "

Under Mucuna, Ca2+, K+ and P concentrations, \{ECEC\} and soil pH were higher and C mineralisation was lower than under natural regrowth and Pueraria in 0–10 cm depth. Soil under natural regrowth had a higher C mineralisation in 0–10 cm indicating more labile \{SOM\} than in Pueraria and Mucuna fallow. There was no difference in weight of total POM, for any of the fractions between the three fallow types. However, both leguminous fallow species increased \{POM\} quality through a higher N content.

This study was conducted to develop and evaluate a selection procedure to improve the drought resistance of maize populations grown under limited moisture supply, particularly around flowering. Eighty-five full-sib progenies of the tropical lowland population Tuxpeno were grown under three soil moisture-deficit treatments at a site in Mexico without rainfall during the season. The treatments were; mild (normal irrigation); medium (irrigation to field capacity soon after emergence and again 10 days after flowering); and severe (irrigation to field capacity soon after emergence only) soil moisture-deficits. Mean yields were 6120, 4330 and 1560 kg ha−1, respectively, under the three treatments. There was significant genotype (progeny) × soil moisture-deficit interaction for grain-yield. Yield under the severemoisture-deficit was significantly correlated with a measure of the rate of leaf and stem extension (r=-0.39∗∗). Tnterval between male and female flowering (r-−0.73∗∗) and rate of foliar senescence (r=−0.39∗∗). These indices were used along with grain-yield in a selection index. To test its usefulness, experimental varieties formed from progenies selected for yield per se unde the different soil moisture-deficit treatments and for a divergence (index-tolerant and index-susceptible) of performance using the selection index were grown under conditions similar to those of the initial progeny evaluation. The drought-tolerant variety (selected for yield and favourable adaptive traits) outyieldeall others by 500 kg ha−1 under the severe moisture-deficit but not at the expense of yield under the well-watered conditions. Recurrent selection for these traits under similar moisture-deficits was practised among 250 full-sib progeny in this population for three cycles. Canopy temperature, determined by infrared thermometry prior to flowering, was highly correlated (r=−0.73∗∗) with yield under severe moisture-deficits, and was included in the selection index after the second cycle. After three cycles of improvement with a 33% progeny-selection intensity, evaluation under the same soil moisture-deficits showed that grain-yield increased by 1.8, 7.8 and 21.6%, or 320, 420 and 410 kg ha−1 cycle−1 under the mild, medium and severe moisture-deficits, respectively.

The mean density of earthworms (Hyperiodrilus africanus and Eudrilus eugeniae) in the experimental plots decreased in the following order: high quality &gt; intermediate quality &gt; low quality mulches. High quality mulch (Leucaena and Gliricidia prunings) supported 54% higher earthworm populations than the (no mulch) control, whereas low-quality mulch (Dactyladenia prunings) only increased earthworm density by 15%, compared to the control in 1990. Plots with Leucaena and Gliricidia prunings had the highest earthworm populations at the initial stage of the experiment, while the other treatments showed increased earthworm numbers at a later stage. Effects of earthworms on mulch decomposition were examined in the field in large pots with or without earthworms (Eudrilus eugeniae). The effects of earthworms were more pronounced for Dactyladenia prunings (low quality), than for Leucaena and Gliricidia prunings (high quality).

It uses difference-in-difference and decomposition analyses on household data collected from intervention and control villages in the neighborhood of forest reserves. We find that commercial forest plantations are weakly effective in conserving natural forests. The reduction in forest use is unevenly distributed across households depending on location and resource endowments such as farmland and livestock. The results suggest that the conservation effectiveness can be enhanced by complementary interventions that change characteristics that reduce forest use, such as more education for forest users. "

Soil moisture and termite density increased with decreases in PRQI, whereas decomposition rate constants of plant residues, soil temperature and ant density increased with increase in PRQI.

We investigated the potential to produce mulch by growing Tephrosia vogelii either intercropped with smallholder coffee or in arable fields outside the coffee, and the effect of the mulch on coffee yields over two years. Two accessions of T. vogelii (ex. Gisagara, Rwanda and ex. Kisumu, Kenya) were grown for six months both within and outside smallholder coffee fields in the first year. Experimental blocks were replicated across eight smallholder farms, only a single replicate per farm due to the small farm sizes. The accession from Rwanda (T. vogelii ex. Gisagara) grew more vigorously in all experiments. Soils within the coffee fields were more fertile those outside the coffee fields, presumably due to farmers’ long-term management with mulch. Tephrosia grew less well in the fields outside coffee, producing only 0.6–0.7 Mg ha−1 of biomass and adding (in kg ha−1) 19 N, 1 P and 6 K in the mulch. By contrast, Tephrosia intercropped with coffee, produced 1.4–1.9 Mg ha−1 of biomass and added (in kg ha−1) 42–57 N, 3 P and 13–16 K in the mulch. Coffee yields were increased significantly by 400–500 kg ha−1 only in the treatments where Tephrosia was intercropped with coffee. Soil analysis and a missing-nutrient pot experiment showed that the poor growth of Tephrosia in the fields outside coffee was due to soil acidity (aluminium toxicity) combined with deficiencies of P, K and Ca. In the second year, the treatments in fields outside coffee were discontinued, and in the coffee intercrops, two Tephrosia accessions were grown in treatments with and without \{NPK\} fertilizer. Tephrosia grew well and produced between 2.5 and 3.8 Mg ha−1 biomass for the two accessions when interplanted within coffee fields, adding 103–150 kg N ha−1, 5–9 kg P ha−1 and 24–38 kg K ha−1. Tephrosia mulch increased yields of coffee by 400 kg ha−1. Combined use of \{NPK\} + Tephrosia mulch increased Tephrosia biomass production and in turn yielded an additional 300–700 kg ha−1 of coffee. Over the two years, this was equivalent to a 23–36% increase in coffee yield using Tephrosia intercropping alone and a further 25–42% increase in coffee yield when \{NPK\} fertilizer was also added. Agronomic efficiency (AE) of nutrients added were 30% greater when the Tephrosia mulch was grown in situ and the two cultivars of Tephrosia did not differ in AE. The \{AE\} of Tephrosia mulch was 87% that of \{NPK\} fertilizer, reflecting the rapid mineralization of Tephrosia mulch. There was a synergistic effect of Tephrosia mulch on the efficiency with which \{NPK\} fertilizer was used by coffee. The increase in coffee yields was positively related to the amount of nutrients added in the Tephrosia biomass. Tephrosia intercropping required 30 man-days ha−1 less than current farmer management due to reduced labour required for weeding, and benefit–cost ratios ranged between 3.4 and 5.5. The Tephrosia-coffee intercropping system offers great potential for agroecological intensification for smallholder farmers in the East African highlands. "

Index descriptors based on the combination of two characteristics were calculated. Despite the significant (P&lt;0.05) influence of the environment and the genotype-by-environment interaction, most of the variation was significantly affected by the specific genotype of the Musa accessions. The most productive cultivars were the Cavendish bananas and the giant French plantains (&gt;30 t ha−1 year−1). Five phenotypic correlations were common to all known taxonomic Musa groups. Short-cycling cultivars showed early flowering, whereas tall cultivars had wide plant girth and many leaves. The number of fruit per bunch was significantly associated with the number of hands (or nodal clusters of fruit). The most important component of yield potential was bunch weight in all Musa cultivars, and days to harvest only in the dessert bananas derived from interspecific crosses of M. acuminata. Index descriptors may be useful for selection of traits that are difficult to score or that show a high coefficient of variation. Short Musa cultivars may be selected by calculating the index of pseudostem condensation. A low value of pseudostem condensation (&lt;9 cm leaf−1) was characteristic of known dwarf plantain and banana cultivars. "

At sampling a questionnaire was used to evaluate maize storage practices. Farmers were asked what storage structure they used, their storage form, storage period, pest problems in storage and what was done against them. Beninese farmers often changed their storage structures during the storage period, transfering the maize from a drying or temporary store to a more durable one. Most of the farmers complained about insects damaging stored maize. Often, storage or cotton insecticides were utilized against these pests. Regression analysis identified those factors that were associated with increased or reduced aflatoxin. Maize samples in the southern Guinea and Sudan savannas were associated with higher aflatoxin levels and the forest/savanna mosaic was related to lower toxin levels. Factors associated with higher aflatoxin were: storage for 3–5 months, insect damage and use of Khaya senegalensis-bark or other local plants as storage protectants. Depending on the agroecological zone, storage structures that had a higher risk of aflatoxin development were the “Ago”, the “Secco”, the “Zingo” or storing under or on top of the roof of the house. Lower aflatoxin levels were related to the use of storage or cotton insecticides, mechanical means or smoke to protect against pests or cleaning of stores before loading them with the new harvest. Fewer aflatoxins were found when maize was stored in the “Ago” made from bamboo or when bags were used as secondary storage containers. "

Traditional millet-, cotton-, sugarcane- and/or banana-based farming systems with an important fallow and/or grazing component have evolved into continuously cultivated cassava or cassava/maize-based systems. Within three to four decades, cassava cultivation increased from 1–11 to 16–55% of cropped fields in our six study sites. Declining soil fertility, and not labour or food shortage, was apparently the primary trigger for this transformation. The land use changes have increased nutrient offtakes and reduced nutrient recycling rates. Cassava and maize now account for 50–90% of nutrient removal. Whereas single-season fallows were the most important source of nutrient recycling on cropped fields in the past, currently cassava litterfall and maize stover contribute roughly 70% of nutrient recycling, with 50–70% of N, P and K recycled in cassava litterfall. This may explain why many farmers reason that cassava ‘rests’ the soil. With increasing land use pressure farmers progressively use cassava as an ‘imitation fallow’ throughout their farm. Farmers increasingly target cassava to poor fertility fields characterized by low pH and available P. High cassava intensities are nonetheless maintained on more fertile fields, probably to guarantee regeneration of soil fertility on all fields. Once cassava is targeted to poor fertility soils, farmers have run out of low-input management options and need to intensify management to maintain system productivity. As cassava is now used by more farmers and on a larger acreage than fallowing in the studied farming systems, cassava cropping could perhaps serve as an excellent entry point to strengthen system sustainability.

To ensure that released materials would compete with landraces on a fruit quality basis, an evaluation methodology was developed to compare exotic and hybrid Musa genotypes with West African triploid landraces. Tests showed that plantain hybrids and cooking bananas had heavier bunches than plantain landraces. The plantain hybrids generally produced more but smaller fruit compared with False Horn plantain (AAB). The fruit ripening time of plantain hybrids and the cooking banana cultivar Pelipita was longer than that of plantain landraces, and selected plantain hybrids had fruit with a dry matter content similar to that of the female parent. The fruit of ripe plantain landraces had a firmer texture than plantain hybrids and the landraces Agbagba and Bobby Tannap had lower levels of soluble solids at specific stages of ripening compared with the other Musa germplasm. These results showed that simple physical tests can be used to select for higher quality cooking bananas and plantain hybrids and that specific plantain hybrids, within the test group, showed a higher potential for market acceptance.

A. flavus was the most prevalent (91.8%) of the isolates obtained from the feed in the \{AEZs\} while A. parasiticus had the lowest incidence (0.1%) and was isolated only from a layer mash sample collected from the \{DS\} zone. About 29% of the Aspergillus isolates produced aflatoxins in maize grains at concentrations up to 440,500 μg/kg B and 341,000 μg/kg G aflatoxins.

Alongside with essential mineral elements, these pigments are well known to have high impact on human health. Therefore, accumulation of carotenoids in wheat grain is an important trait in view to improving nutritional value of cereals. Wheat is one of the major staple foods in Portugal because of its agronomical adaptability and the usage of its flour into various traditional products. In the present investigation, the seeds of ninety-four Old Portuguese wheat cultivars grown over two years were analysed. Significant genetic variability for content of carotenoids was observed in the studied lines. Within the 47 bread wheat genotypes the Yellow Pigment Content (YPC) values varied from 2.7 - 5.8 μg/g and 3.0 - 8.0 μg/g for 2004/2005 and 2009/2010, respectively. On the other hand, during 2004/2005 and 2009/2010, the 47 durum wheat cultivars exhibited the \{YPC\} values from 1.1 - 8.0 μg/g and 3.4 - 8.3 μg/g, respectively. In addition, multivariate methods were also explored to assess the wheat grains quality, resorting to \{FTIR\} spectroscopy (Figure 1). Preliminary analyses of \{FTIR\} spectra clearly revealed differences among the distinct studied genotypes. Thus, in order to find spectroscopical patterns related to carotenoids accumulation and antioxidant activity, efforts are being made to develop a model that will allow the assessment of these parameters through FTIR, in the near-future.

abstract = "Abstract Volcanic mountains in the East African Rift (e.g. Mt. Kenya, Mt. Kilimanjaro, Mt. Elgon) are some of the most productive agricultural regions, often dominated by coffee and banana cultivation. Consequently, these regions suffer from a high and increasing population density with a declining soil fertility status imposing pressure on the available land, which in turn results in encroaching into the national forests. This study documents the soil fertility constraints along the slopes of Mt. Elgon and explores its corresponding gradients in plant nutritional status. This research links the topography of Mt. Elgon to the prevailing soil types and their current fertility status. It reveals important relations and gradients between soil fertility parameters and its corresponding environment along the slope. Soil pH, soil available P and exchangeable K, Ca and Mg are significantly decreasing with elevation. Thereby, gradients and constraints in macro- and micro-nutrient uptake by coffee and banana are revealed along the toposequence and different altitude-specific nutrient limitations are determined for both crops. K, Mn and Si uptake in both crops is decreasing with elevation along the slope, while the Mo and Ni uptake in both crops is increasing. With increasing elevation, B uptake is only decreasing in coffee and P uptake is only decreasing in banana. In addition, the antagonistic interaction between K and Mg limits the Mg uptake of both crops in the lower areas, while in the high region the Mg uptake is simply limited by low soil availability. It follows that a general fertilizer recommendation cannot be made in these regions and that the soil fertility problems along these slopes should be specifically addressed and appropriately managed according to the local requirements.

The five isolates expressing greatest reproductive ability and nematode suppression in pots were further assessed in a typical double-cropping system of tomato and carrot in the field in Benin. All seventeen isolates were re-isolated from both soil and roots at eight weeks after application, with no apparent crop growth penalty. In pots, a number of isolates provided significant nematode control compared with untreated controls. Field assessment demonstrated significant inhibition of nematode reproduction, suppression of root galling and an increase of tomato yield compared with the non-fungal control treatments. Trichoderma asperellum T-16 suppressed second stage juvenile (J2) densities in roots by up to 80%; Trichoderma brevicompactum T-3 suppressed egg production by as much as 86%. Tomato yields were improved by over 30% following the application of these biocontrol agents, especially T. asperellum T-16. Although no significant effects were observed on carrot galling and yield, soil \{J2\} densities were suppressed in treated plots, by as much as 94% (T. asperellum T-12), compared with the non-fungal controls. This study provides the first information on the potential of West-African Trichoderma spp. isolates for use against root-knot nematodes in vegetable production systems. The results are highly encouraging, demonstrating their strong potential as an alternative and complementary crop protection component. "

To determine the potential threat of \{BBTV\} to the production of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.) in the sub-region, field surveys were conducted for the presence of banana bunchy top disease (BBTD) in the DRC, Angola, Cameroon, Gabon and Malawi. Using the DNA-S and DNA-R segments of the virus genome, the genetic diversity of \{BBTV\} isolates was also determined from these countries relative to virus isolates across the banana-growing regions around the world. The results established that \{BBTD\} is widely prevalent in all parts of DRC, Malawi, Angola and Gabon, in south and western part of Cameroon. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences of DNA-S and DNA-R indicate that \{BBTV\} isolates from these countries are genetically identical forming a unique clade within the ‘South Pacific’ phylogroup that includes isolates from Australia, Egypt, South Asia and South Pacific. These results imply that farmers’ traditional practice of transferring vegetative propagules within and between countries, together with virus spread by the widely prevalent banana aphid vector, Pentalonia nigronervosa, could have contributed to the geographic expansion of \{BBTV\} in SSA. The results provided a baseline to explore sanitary measures and other ‘clean’ plant programs for sustainable management of \{BBTV\} and its vector in regions where the disease has already been established and prevent the spread of the virus to as yet unaffected regions in SSA.

The program was implemented in the Democratic Republic of Congo from 2001 to 2009. We apply propensity score matching, Rosenbaum bounds on treatment effects, Altonji et al. method of selection on observables and unobservables and endogenous switching regression to farm survey data collected during the 2009 cropping season. We use these methods to test whether the \{R4D\} program has a statistically significant effect on outcomes of interest and if these are not driven by selection on unobservables. Using propensity score matching, we find statistically significant positive effects on household participation in cassava markets, adoption of improved varieties and crop management practices and household food adequacy; and no statistically significant effects on yields and profits. The results show that bias due to selection on unobservables is not severe enough to invalidate the impact estimates. Bias may still be a problem that is present in the analysis. But there is evidence that it is not substantial. Although the program does not have a statistically significant positive effect on yields and profits, the significant program effects on market participation, variety adoption, and food adequacy merit further promotion of the program since these positive outcomes tend to be pre-conditions for realizing long-term yield and profit benefits.

Selection of genotypes for adaptation to either P deficiency or Al toxicity has sometimes been unsuccessful because these two soil factors often interact. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate eight cowpea genotypes for Al resistance and to study the combined effect of P deficiency and Al toxicity stress on growth, P uptake, and organic acid anion exudation of two genotypes of contrasting Al resistance selected from the first experiment. Relative root inhibition by 30 μM Al ranged from 14% to 60% and differed significantly among the genotypes. Al significantly induced callose formation, particularly in Al-sensitive genotypes. P accumulation was significantly reduced (28% and 95%) by Al application for both the Al-resistant and the Al-sensitive genotypes. Al supply significantly enhanced malate release of root apices of both genotypes. However, the exudation rate was significantly higher in the Al-resistant genotype. P deprivation induced an enhanced malate exudation in the presence of Al only in the Al-resistant genotype IT89KD-391. Citrate exudation rate of the root apices was lower than malate exudation by a factor of about 10, and was primarily enhanced by P deficiency in both genotypes. Al treatment further enhanced citrate exudation in P-sufficient, but not in P-deficient plants. The level of citrate exudation was consistently higher in the Al-resistant genotype IT89KD-391 particularly in presence of Al. It is concluded that the Al-resistant genotype is better adapted to acid Al-toxic and P-deficient soils than the Al-sensitive genotype since both malate and citrate exudation were more enhanced by combined Al and P-deficiency stresses.

This study focuses on the constraints inherent in the acquisition and application of pesticides for cocoa growing on small farms in the tropical rainforest areas of southern Cameroon. Over 50% of farmers use chemical pesticides, but the high cost and lack of availability in rural areas are cited, respectively by 65% and 55% of cocoa farmers as major constraints by users of pesticides. Only 21% of cocoa farmers buy their pesticides in the village. Fungicides are the main pesticide used to control Phytophthora megakarya, but farmers do not apply the recommended application rate so production is low. Some farmers form groups to circumvent production problems, while some use plant extracts. To increase production it is essential to improve safe practices in the purchase, transportation; storage, handling and application of pesticides and promote integrated pest management in southern Cameroon.

Fertilizer effect increased as farmers' overall yield level (reflected in their mean site yield) increased. At current fertilizer and maize prices, fertilizer was profitable for all except the poorest-yielding fields. Variation in yield level was partly explained by degree of shade and stand losses during the season. Part of the stand losses was due to termites.

The fallow systems include: (1) two continuous cultivation alley cropping systems with leucaena hedgerows planted at 2 m and 4 m interhedgerows spacings: (2) the continuous cultivation no-till farming system; and (3) two traditional bush fallow systems with a 3-year cropping period in 6- and 12-year cycles. Under a 10 percent discount rate, when no yield penalties are imposed (reflecting the case of population density), the 12-year cycle shifting cultivation system is most profitable, followed by the 4 m alley cropping, the no-till, the 2 m alley cropping and the 6-year cycle shifting cultivation systems. When penalties are imposed on yields due to land being taken out of production because of fallow vegetation (reflecting the case of rising land values), the 4 m alley cropping is most profitable, followed by the no-till, the 2 m alley cropping, the 12- and 6-year cycle bush fallow systems. Thus where access to new forest land is ‘costless’, slight yield from erosion will not detract significantly from the immediate profit advantage of traditional bush fallow systems, with longer fallow periods.

The challenge is to increase the sustainable agricultural productivity of the land with acceptable inputs to meet increasing human needs, while maintaining the soil resource base and minimising environmental degradation. One technology that can meet this need for rainfed upland farming with low external chemical inputs is the alley cropping system. This technology integrates trees and shrubs in spatial zonal arrangements with food crops in the production system. The presence of woody species in the alley cropping production system has been shown to contribute to (1) nutrient recycling, (2) reduction in soil nutrient leaching losses, (3) stimulation of higher soil faunal activities, (4) soil erosion control, (5) soil fertility improvement and (6) sustained levels of crop production. These experiences can be utilised in developing sustainable and environmentally friendly agroforestry systems. "

abstract = "This paper reviews intercropping research for a particular case: cassava-based crop combinations. Cassava is dominated in combination with maize while it is the dominating species in combination with low-growing species. Combinations with maize or legumes show a real biological advantage over the sole crops reflected in (modified) Area × Time Equivalency ratio (ATER) values above unity. This is not the case with sweet potatoes. Success of maize+cassava mixtures depends on time and rate of recovery of cassava after maize harvest. Biological advantage tends to disappear when maize yield exceeds about 3.5 t ha−1. Under growing conditions or practices which result in high maize yield, intercropping cassava with maize is not biologically advantageous Biological advantage of intercropping with legumes decreases with the legumes' growth duration, which should not exceed 90 days. Physiological traits of cassava for successful intercropping with maize or with legumes are probably not the same, but their nature is not clear. Moderate early vigour and a high partitioning of dry matter to the storage roots after harvest of the associated crops seem important in both cases. Cassava breeding for sole cropping has resulted in varieties with good performance in intercropping. Whether varieties can be selected with better adaptation to intercropping cannot be concluded from the literature. Dry-matter distribution, in particular after harvest of the associated crop, seems important but more growth analytical studies are required. Usefulness of currently available crop models in the study of intercropping is doubtful. "

Performance of upland crop associations [cassava (Manihot esculenta) + sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and cassava + soybean (Glycine max)] was observed in a trial conducted along a small valley toposequence. Groundwater table depth (GWT) was a significant covariate for cassava yield and regression analysis showed that cassava clones of similar yield potential responded similarly and positively to increasing \{GWT\} depth (r2=0.77) regardless of associated crop. Sweet potato tuber production was related to \{GWT\} depth for variety \{TIS\} 9465 (r2=0.47) but not for \{TIS\} 8441. Sweet potato was more tolerant of shallow \{GWT\} than cassava. Combined cassava and sweet potato tuber production was also positively correlated to \{GWT\} depth (r2=0.83). The range of \{GWT\} depth to be considered by plant breeders screening cassava and sweet potato varieties for excess moisture in inland valleys should include depths 0.2 to 0.4 m, because those depths were shown to be stressful to these crops.

This article presents an approach for addressing the challenge of technology development and transfer in the NGS. It is based on an analysis of the evolutionary change of agricultural systems. Exogenous and endogenous determinants have been identified for the formation of, at present, four agricultural systems, five major resource domains and at least ten major farming domains in the NGS. The domains cluster areas of similar resource endowments and development potential which are at a similar point along generalized evolutionary pathways. The additional differentiation of farmer domains integrates changes in equity and externalities into the concept.

Millipede populations were not significantly affected by mulching. Earthworm populations were negatively correlated with the ratio of lignin : N of plant residues. Ant populations were significantly related to the N content of plant residues (R2 = 0.87 and 0.84 for 1990 and 1991 respectively). The results imply that chemical plant composition, particularly N and lignin contents, play a critical role in faunal abundance in the soil through their effect on palatability and decomposibility.

However, their contribution to tropical soil quality and crop performance, as well as relations with agricultural management (e.g., Conservation Agriculture), are not well understood. This study aimed to quantify soil macrofauna and its impact on soil aggregation, soil carbon and crop yields in a maize–soybean system under tropical sub-humid conditions. A field trial was established in Western Kenya in 2003 with tillage and residue retention as independent factors. A macrofauna exclusion experiment was superimposed in 2005 through regular insecticide applications, and measurements were taken from 2005 to 2012. Termites were the most abundant macrofauna group comprising 61% of total macrofauna numbers followed by ants (20%), while few earthworms were present (5%). Insecticide application significantly reduced termites (by 86 and 62%) and earthworms (by 100 and 88%) at 0–15 and 15–30 cm soil depth respectively. Termite diversity was low, with all species belonging to the family of Macrotermitinae which feed on wood, leaf litter and dead/dry grass. Seven years of macrofauna exclusion did not affect soil aggregation or carbon contents, which might be explained by the low residue retention and the nesting and feeding behavior of the dominant termites present. Macrofauna exclusion resulted in 34% higher maize grain yield and 22% higher soybean grain yield, indicating that pest damage – probably including termites – overruled any potentially beneficial impact of soil macrofauna. Results contrast with previous studies on the effects of termites on plant growth, which were mostly conducted in (semi-) arid regions. Future research should contribute to sustainable management strategies that reduce detrimental impact due to dominance of potential pest species while conserving soil macrofauna diversity and their beneficial functions in agroecosystems.

Their production generally declines over time due to poor farm management and declining soil fertility. Farmers believe that among the bunch mass maintaining factors, plant density management offers some prospect. They often decrease banana mat (i.e. a single mother plant with interconnected suckers) density in an effort to increase bunch size, but the effectiveness and profitability of this practice has not been studied. In addition, not much research has been executed on the influence of climatic and edaphic factors on variations in on-farm plant density. An on-farm survey was conducted in contrasting agro-ecological sites of Rwanda (Ruhengeri, Rusizi, Karongi, Butare, Ruhango, Kibungo and Bugesera) to determine existing densities and their relationship to bunch mass. A plant density assessment method was used that measures the average distance of five mats to their respective nearest four mats to calculate average mat spacing. Plant density positively correlated with surplus/deficit water supply (i.e. difference between rainfall and water demand by bananas) (r2 = 0.62), with highest plant densities (&gt;1500 mats ha−1) found in high rainfall areas (&gt;1200 mm yr−1) with water surplus (218–508 mm yr−1) and lowest plant densities (1000–1400 mats ha−1) found in lower rainfall areas (1000–1200 mm yr−1) with water deficit (from −223 to −119 mm yr−1). Heaviest bunches (18.1–20.8 kg fresh mass plant−1) were found at lowest plant densities and medium sized bunches (14.7–15.5 kg) at highest plant densities. Lower soil and banana leaf nutrient contents (especially N, K, Ca and Mg) were observed on weathered soils (Acrisols) and were associated with smaller bunch mass in comparison to fertile soils (Andosols, Nitisols). Farmers tended to reduce mat densities (i) if they wanted to intercrop bearing in mind site characteristics, and (ii) to increase bunch mass to adapt to market preferences. The plant densities generally recommended by extension bodies (3 m × 3 m or 2 m × 3 m; i.e. 1111 and 1666 mats ha−1, respectively) are seldom practiced by farmers, nor do they seem to be very appropriate, as higher densities seem productive in areas with high rainfall and relatively good soil fertility.

This was done over two consecutive yam growing seasons; 2002–2003 at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) Cotonou Station, Benin experimental farm and 2003–2004 in a farmer's field at Save in central Benin. S. bradys populations were obtained from yam originating from different geographical areas of Save and Toui in the northern Guinea savannah and Glazoue in the southern Guinea savannah, respectively. Four-week-old plants were each inoculated with ca. 1000 S. bradys juveniles and adults in chopped, infected pieces of yam peel. The experiments were harvested at 9 and 10 months after planting, respectively, at \{IITA\} and Save. Some differences were observed in the pathogenicity of the different nematode populations, although differences were not consistent between experiments and between yam cultivars. At harvest, in 2002–2003, the various S. bradys populations did not affect tuber weight, number of tubers produced or dry rot severity on the tubers. Highest nematode population density was observed with IsoGlaz, and Banioure was the yam cultivar most susceptible to nematode infestation. In 2003–2004, nematode inoculation reduced (P ≤ 0.05) tuber weight for yam cv's Aloungan, Moroko and TDr131. Weights of tubers from IsoToui- and IsoSave-inoculated plants were lower than those from control plants. Dry rot severity was more pronounced on cv's Moroko and \{TDr131\} tubers than on cv's Aloungan and Banioure, while no dry rot symptoms were observed on cv Tabane tubers. IsoToui and IsoGlaz caused higher (P ≤ 0.05) tuber dry rot severity than IsoSave. Differences in nematode population densities occurred across S. bradys populations for cv's Tabane, \{TDr131\} and Aloungan with IsoSave resulting in the highest nematode population densities on cv's Aloungan and TDr131. IsoToui caused the highest percentage weight loss. During 5 months storage, infected tubers lost more (P ≤ 0.05) weight than uninfected control tubers.

A 0.5 kg representative sample was obtained from each surveyed vendor and the colony forming units (CFU) of fungal species determined. The samples were also analyzed for total aflatoxin level while isolates of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus were screened for production of aflatoxin B1, B2, \{G1\} and G2. Eight fungal species were detected in the samples and were in decreasing order of CFU/g of sample: A. flavus S-strain (467), A. flavus L-strain (341), Penicillium spp. (326), Aspergillus niger (156), Aspergillus tamari (27), Aspergillus alliaceus (21), A. parasiticus (10), and Aspergillus caelatus (5).

The combined incidence of A. flavus and A. parasiticus was varied significantly (p ≤ 0.05) with peanut product: peanut flour (69%), shelled raw peanuts (53%), spoilt peanuts (49%), boiled podded peanuts (45%), podded peanuts (39%), peanut butter (31%), fried peanuts (22%) and roasted peanuts (20%). Seventy three percent of A. flavus and A. parasiticus isolates produced at least one of the aflatoxin types, with 66% producing aflatoxin B1.

Therefore, nematode control through genetic improvement is widely encouraged. Protocols have been set up to detect sources of resistance in the existing Musa germplasm, but the screening under greenhouse and field conditions is laborious and time consuming. In vitro screening could facilitate this process by picking up sources of resistance at an early phase. In this study, a procedure for in vitro screening for the resistance to R. similis was set up by determining the optimal incubation time and the optimal nematode inoculum. In a second step, the optimized procedure was confirmed by screening a selection of Musa varieties with a known host plant response. Except for ‘Yangambi Km5’, their host response under in vitro conditions corresponded to their host response under greenhouse or field conditions.

The most probable number (MPN) technique was used to determine the bradyrhizobial populations that nodulate \{TGx\} soybean genotypes (a cross between nonpromiscuous North American soybean genotypes and promiscuous Asian soybean genotypes), cowpea or North American soybean cv. Clark IV, in soils from 65 sites in 9 African countries. The symbiotic effectiveness of isolates from these soils was compared to that of Bradyrhizobium japonicum strain USDA110. The bradyrhizobial population sizes ranged from 0 to 104 cells g−1 soil. Bradyrhizobium sp. (TGx) populations were detected in 72% and B. japonicum (Clark) in 37% of the soil samples. Bradyrhizobium sp. (TGx) populations were generally low, and significantly less than that of the cowpea bradyrhizobial populations in 57% of the samples. Population sizes of less than 10 cells g−1 soil were common as these were detected in at least 43% of the soil samples. B. japonicum (Clark) occurred in higher population densities in research sites compared to farmers’ fields. Bradyrhizobium sp. (TGx) populations were highly correlated with biotic but not abiotic factors. The frequent incidence of low Bradyrhizobium sp. (TGx) populations is unlikely to support optimum \{BNF\} enough for high soybean yields while the presence of B. japonicum (Clark) in research fields has the potential to compromise the selection pressure anticipated from the indigenous Bradyrhizobium spp. (Vigna) populations. Bradyrhizobium isolates could be placed in four symbiotic phenotype groups based on their effectiveness on a \{TGx\} soybean genotype and the North American cultivar Clark IV. Symbiotic phenotype group \{II\} isolates were as effective as B. japonicum strain \{USDA110\} on both soybean genotypes while isolates of group \{IV\} were effective on the \{TGx\} soybean genotype but not on the Clark IV. The group \{IV\} isolates represent a unique subgroup of indigenous bradyrhizobia that can sustain high soybean yields when available in sufficient population densities. "

Initially, weed species were identified, and then controlled using glyphosate at 1.6 kg ai ha−1. Twenty four plots were marked, each measuring 4 × 5 m. Six treatments 1) IR-maize coated, 2) IR-maize coated + brown dolichos, 3) IR-maize coated + black dolichos 4) IR-maize uncoated, 5) IR-maize uncoated + brown dolichos, 6) IR-maize uncoated + black dolichos were laid out in a randomized complete block design replicated four times. IR-maize was planted at a spacing of 90 × 45 cm and 2 seeds per hole. Weeds were sampled from a one meter squared quadrat 21 and 42 days after planting (DAP). The data was subjected to analysis of variance using Genstat version 12.0. Eighteen (18) weed species were prevalent before the experiment. Interaction of dolichos and herbicide coated IR-maize had no significant (P &gt; 0.05) effect on weed species composition and density. Dolichos significantly (P &lt; 0.05) reduced the density of Portulaca quadrifida L. and Paraknoxia parviflora L., and increased Eleusine indica L. Weed species composition decreased by 14% (21 DAP) and 33% (42 DAP) in plots with dolichos compared to no cover. Maize yields were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher in plots with dolichos than without. From the findings, this study recommends dolichos integration with coated IR-for weed management and increased maize yields in drylands. "

The hyperspectral data were gathered for shrubs, grasses, weeds, and agricultural crop species from the four ecoregions of African savannas using a 1-nm-wide hand-held spectroradiometer but was aggregated to 10-nm-wide bandwidths to match the first spaceborne hyperspectral sensor, Hyperion. After accounting for atmospheric widows and/or areas of significant noise, a total of 168 narrowbands in 400–2500 nm was used in the analysis. Rigorous data mining techniques consisting of principal component analysis (PCA), lambda–lambda \{R2\} models (LL R2M), stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA), and derivative greenness vegetation indices (DGVI) established 22 optimal bands (in 400–2500 nm spectral range) that best characterize and classify vegetation and agricultural crops. Overall accuracies of over 90% were attained when the 13–22 best narrowbands were used in classifying vegetation and agricultural crop species. Beyond 22 bands, accuracies only increase marginally up to 30 bands. Accuracies become asymptotic or near zero beyond 30 bands, rendering 138 of the 168 narrowbands redundant in extracting vegetation and agricultural crop information. Relative to Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) broadbands, the best hyperspectral narrowbands provided an increased accuracy of 9–43% when classifying shrubs, weeds, grasses, and agricultural crop species.

A continuous maize production system was compared with crop sequence systems, in which maize followed a grain legume (cowpea, soybean), cover crop (mucuna, pigeon pea) or a bush fallow. Compared to the continuous maize cropping system, maize in the crop sequence with legume and fallow systems had significantly higher leaf and stem nitrogen content at 35 and 63 days after planting (DAP), respectively. Differences in K and P at 35 and 63 DAP, and of N in stem and grain at harvest were not significant. Maize in the rotation systems had 1.5–2 times more borers per plant compared to the continuous maize production systems, particularly at the early stages of maize growth. At 63 DAP, larval mortalities were 1.4–1.5 higher in rotation systems than in the continuous maize system. As a result, dead-hearts and tunnel length did not vary significantly among treatments. In the insecticide protected plots, when comparing with the maize–maize cropping system, average grain yields were increased by 15.1–24.6% and 30.3–42.5% in crop sequences of grain legumes with maize and cover crops fallow systems, respectively. However, grain yield losses due to borers were 1.9–3.1 times higher in the continuous maize production system than in the crop sequences of grain legumes with maize and 4.5–11.1 times higher compared to maize after cover crops. It is concluded that an increased nutritional status of the plants lead to an increase in borer attacks at the early stage of plant growth, but also to improved plant vigour, resulting finally in a net benefit for the plant and grain yield.

The main treatments consisted of disc ploughing to 20 cm depth followed by harrowing, compared with the no-tillage system. Traffic treatments of 0, 2 and 4 passes of a tractor-drawn 2 Mg roller were sub-plots in a split-plot design experiment. All tillage and traffic treatments were controlled so they always occurred in the same place, season after season. The 4-pass treatment significantly increased penetrometer resistance and dry-soil bulk density, and considerably decreased total porosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity and infiltration rate, more so in disced plots than in no-till plots. The 2-pass treatment had a significant but less marked effect on soil physical properties than the 4-pass treatment. Soil compaction thus resulted in reduced percent emergence, plant height, leaf area index and root growth. Eight weeks after seeding, the root densities in the 0–7 cm soil layer were 2.8, 1.6 and 1.3 mg cm−3 for no-till, and 2.1, 1.3 and 0.9 mg cm−3 for disced plots for 0, 2 and 4 passes, respectively.

The Nelder fan design was used to produce varying plant spacings (from 0.55 to 1.50 m) in a continuum.

A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to 80 randomly selected participants to obtain sociological information including gender, age category, education levels, and adoption of cover crops. Two binary logistic regression models were used to determine the factors affecting cover crops adoption by respondents. Results showed that 80% of the respondents had adopted cover crop technologies at Kalama compared to 57.5% at Kee. Results indicated that gender had a significant (P &lt; 0.05) effect on adoption. Men were less likely to adopt. Age category had mixed effects on cover crop adoption. At Kalama age category had a significant (P &lt; 0.05) effect on cover crops adoption however age effect was not significant at Kee. Education indicated mixed effects on cover crop adoption suggesting other factors not covered in the study were at play. Views from farmers with experience in growing cover crops revealed that, knowledge and skills, demonstration of gains and related cost had a significant (P &lt; 0.05) effect on cover crop adoption. Majority of farmers, adopters or non-adopters used seeds from market. Non-adopters in Kee (37.5%) used relief seed suggesting other factors were required to give the threshold required to influence adoption. This implies research is needed to identify factors with likelihood to reach threshold for adoption under different farming systems. The study recommends capacity building to develop cover crop knowledge and skills, demonstrate gains and related costs to improve men and women’s likelihood to adopt. In addition, the study recommends research to shed light on other factors likely to influence adoption. "

Using data from Indonesia, we show that the choice of a forest definition can have a large impact on estimates of deforestation and forest degradation areas, on assessment of drivers of deforestation and on the development of a REL. The total area of deforestation between 2000 and 2009 was 4.9 million ha when using the \{FAO\} definition, 18% higher when using a ‘natural forest definition’ and 27% higher when using the national definition. Using the national and natural forest definitions, large areas (&gt;50%) were classified as shrubland after deforestation. We used regression models to predict future deforestation. Deforestation was much better predicted than degradation (R2 of 0.81 vs. 0.52), with the natural forest definition giving the best prediction. Apart from historical deforestation and initial forest cover, gross domestic product and human population were important predictors of future deforestation in Indonesia. Degradation processes were less well modeled and predictions relied on estimates of historical degradation and forest cover. "

In the villages Ngoungoumou (56.8% forest cover), Metet (39.5% forest cover), and Nkometou (24.9% forest cover), plots were established in both fallow types and half were slashed, burned, and cropped in 2000, the rest maintained as undisturbed controls. In 2001, cropped plots were split, one half abandoned to fallow, the other cropped a second time as in 2000. Casts were collected weekly from April to December in 2000 and 2001. In 2000, surface cast deposition was different between villages, in both fallow types and land-uses. At Nkometou casting was lowest and no effects of fallow type or land-use were found. At Metet and Ngoungoumou, more casts were deposited in undisturbed fallow (22.5 and 3.0 Mg ha–1, respectively) than in the cropped treatment (7.1 and 0.6 Mg ha–1, respectively). Cropping reduced cast deposition in both fallow types, yet more so in \{CHR\} than in YFOR. In 2001, as in 2000, no differences were found at Nkometou. At Metet and Ngoungoumou, more casts were deposited in undisturbed controls than in the other treatments. Cast deposition was higher in plots in the first year of fallow after cropping than in double cropped plots, indicating an immediate recovery after cropping. Cast production was not correlated with soil chemical properties across villages. Earthworm species assemblages were different between villages, with large bodied, endogeic and anecic species most abundant at Metet. Earthworm species assemblage is likely to be the main factor determining surface cast deposition and thus differences between villages. "

abstract = "Cassava yields in Africa are small and it remains unclear which factors most limit yields. Using a series of farm surveys and on-farm and on-station trials in Uganda and western Kenya, we evaluated the importance of abiotic, biotic and associated crop management constraints for cassava production in a range of socio-economic settings as found in smallholder farms in the region. Average yields under farmer management were 8.6 t ha−1, but these were more than doubled to 20.8 t ha−1 by using improved crop establishment, improved genotypes and 100–22–83 kg ha−1 of single-nutrient N–P–K fertilizers. A farm survey revealed large yield differences between farms. Less endowed farmers harvested less cassava per unit area than better endowed farmers (difference of 5.9 and 9.7 t ha−1 in Kenya and Uganda, respectively); differences were associated with less access to labour, poorer soils, and premature harvesting by less endowed farmers. Analysis of 99 on-farm and 6 on-station trials showed that constraints for cassava production varied strongly between sites and years. Poor soil fertility, early water stress and sub-optimal weed management limited cassava production by 6.7, 5.4 and 5.0 t ha−1, respectively, when improved crop establishment and genotypes were used. Pests and diseases were relatively unimportant, while weed management was particularly important in farmer fields during a dry year in Kenya (yield gap of 11.6 t ha−1). The use of complementary analytical tools such as multiple regression and boundary line analysis revealed that many fields were affected by multiple and interacting production constraints. These should be addressed simultaneously if significant productivity improvements are to be achieved. This will be more difficult for less endowed than for better endowed farm households, since the former lack social and financial capital to improve management. "

Three different types of sensors were used, a leaf porometer to measure leaf stomatal conductance, a thermal infrared camera to measure the canopy temperature and a meteorological sensor to measure weather variables. Stomatal conductance of water stressed pear was significantly lower than in the control group 9 days after stress began. This decrease in stomatal conductance reduced transpiration, reducing evaporative cooling that increased canopy temperature. Using thermal infrared imaging with wavelengths between 7.5 and13 μm, the first significant difference was measured 18 days after stress began. A second order derivative described the average rate of change of the difference between the stress treatment and control group. The average rate of change for stomatal conductance was 0.06 (mmol m−2 s−1) and for canopy temperature was −0.04 (°C) with respect to days. Thermal infrared remote sensing and data analysis presented in this study demonstrated that the differences in canopy temperatures between the water stress and control treatment due to stomata regulation can be validated.

Significant effects (P ≤ 0.05) of cropping system and cultivars were observed for cowpea grain yield. Cultivar × cropping system interaction was significant only for fodder yield. Intercropping reduced cowpea yields significantly but the degree of reduction varied among cultivars. Early-maturing erect cultivars exhibited greater yield reduction than the indeterminate spreading types and had the least effect on millet yields. Indeterminate spreading cultivars produced greater grain and fodder yield than erect types and caused the greatest millet yield reduction. The relationship between the yield of cowpea cultivars and millet when intercropped was negative. Linear correlations between yield of cowpea in sole and intercrop were positive and significant (P &lt; 0.01) with r values ranging from 0.45 to 0.91. However, a small proportion of the greatest and least-yielding cowpea cultivars in intercropping would have been selected and rejected, respectively, on the basis of sole-crop grain-yield. It was concluded that selection of cowpea cultivars for intercropping with millet based on their grain yield in sole crop may have limited success. Selection based on fodder yield favoured late-maturing cultivars. Selection of cowpea cultivars for intercropping should be based on their intercropped performance, paying special attention to other agronomic factors. An appropriate cowpea cultivar for intercropping with millet would be the one that is less competitive with millet and yields both grain and fodder. "

Observations were also made of root growth and relative leaf water content (RLWC) of maize at 1300 h. Profile water content was greater with tied ridging than with open ridging. Among tied ridged plots, undersowing with S. hamata resulted in drier profiles in 1986 and 1987, whereas no significant effect was observed with open ridging. Clay content, OM, total \{CEC\} and exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K were greater, and sand content was lower, in the furrows of tied ridged plots. Undersowing with S. hamata resulted in higher levels of exchangeable bases and \{CEC\} in furrows of open ridged plots. Soil temperature at a depth of 0.03 m was lowest in monocropped tied ridged plots. Water infiltration in furrows was not significantly affected by either ridging or cropping system. Tied ridging and undersowing maize with S. hamata resulted in a deeper and more dense root system. \{RLWC\} of maize at 1300 h was increased only by tied ridging. Tied ridges significantly increased grain and dry matter (DM) production of maize, but not \{DM\} production of S. hamata. Grain and \{DM\} yield of maize in tied ridged plots was reduced by undersowing with S. hamata only when drought occurred during reproductive and late vegetative growth, respectively.

Continued adoption is high (70% of tryout farmers) but capital constraints are important and not all extension interventions are effective for continued adoption.

abstract = "Land clearing of a tropical rainforest implies cutting and felling of existing vegetation by manual or mechanized techniques, with or without windrowing, followed by burning in situ or in windrows. The objective of this study was to evaluate effects of land clearing at three levels of initial soil wetness on soil physical properties, and on growth and yield of maize and cowpea for a tropical Ultisol in southern Nigeria. One of three main-plot treatments measuring 6 × 40 m was cleared mechanically in February, April and June 1987, respectively. These months corresponded to the dry, moist and wet seasons, giving three different initial levels of soil wetness. Each main plot was divided into six sub-plots, 6 × 5.5 m each, with buffers in between. Maize (Zea mays) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) were grown in a sequence with uniform management in all sub-plots. Sub-plots were subjected to two tillage methods, i.e. tilled and no-till systems. Soil wetness at 0.05 m depth at the time of clearing was 0.11, 0.16 and 0.20 m3 m−3 in the February, April and June clearing, respectively. In July 1987 at 0.05 m depth, soil bulk density was significantly higher in the February (by 28%), April (by 35%) and June (by 41%) clearing than that of the forested control. The increase in bulk density in the February clearing compared with the forested control was significant to 0.35 m depth. However, this difference persisted to 0.65 m depth for the April and June clearings. The steady-state infiltration rate measured soon after clearing was 62.0, 2.2 and 3.3 cm h−1 in the February, April and June clearings, respectively, as compared with 200 cm h−1 in the forested control. Tillage reduced soil bulk density in the tilled layer and increased the infiltration rate. Bulk density of tilled plots increased with time after cropping began. In contrast. however, bulk density in no-till plots decreased after cropping began. Infiltration rate increased with cropping duration in all plots irrespective of the tillage method. Maize grain yield was not affected by clearing at either level of initial soil wetness during 1987 when yields were low. In 1988, however, grain yields of maize were lower in the February and April clearings than in the June clearings. Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) yield was also significantly lower in the February-cleared than in the April- or June-cleared plots. Yield observations were, however, too variable to draw valid conclusions. Furthermore, crop yields were also affected by factors other than alterations in soil properties caused by land clearing. The data suggest that dry-season clearing is better for soil physical properties than wet-season clearing. However, the soil surface must be kept covered by the felled biomass to protect soil against high temperatures and intense rains. "

Diagnostic trials were implemented in Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria and Tanzania, as part of the African Soils Information Service (AfSIS) project, to identify soil fertility constraints to crop production across various cropping systems and soil fertility conditions. In each country, one to three sites of 10 km × 10 km were included with each site having 12–31 field trials. The treatments tested included a control, an \{NPK\} treatment, three treatments in which the N, P and K nutrients were omitted one at a time from the \{NPK\} treatment, and three treatments in which secondary and micronutrients (Ca, Mg, S, Zn and B) simply referred here as multi-nutrients, manure and lime were added to the NPK. The field trials were conducted for 1–2 seasons; the test crop was maize except in Mali where sorghum was used. Nitrogen was limiting in all sites and generally the most limiting nutrient except in Sidindi (Kenya) and Kontela (Mali) where P was the most limiting. The general pattern in Kiberashi (Tanzania) shows none of the nutrients were limiting. K is mainly limiting in only one site (Mbinga) although incidences of K limitation were seen in almost all sites. Addition of multi-nutrients and manure further improved the yields of \{NPK\} in most sites. Cluster analyses revealed that maize crop in 11% of fields were highly responsive to nitrogen application, 25% (i.e., 21% poor and 4% fertile) ‘non-responsive’ to any nutrient or soil amendment, 28% being ‘low responsive’ and 36% of ‘intermediate response’. This study indicates that constraints to crop production vary considerably even within a site, and that addressing limitations in secondary and micronutrients, and increasing soil carbon can improve response to fertilizers. For sustainable crop production intensification in smallholder farming systems in SSA, there is need to develop management strategies to improve efficiency of fertilizer use and of other inputs, recognizing the site-specific nutrient response patterns at various spatial scales.

Conservation Agriculture (CA) has been promoted to achieve this goal, based on three principles: minimum tillage, soil surface cover, and diversified crop rotations. \{CA\} originated in regions where fertilizer is commonly used and crop productivity is high, ensuring an abundance of crop residues. By contrast, crop yields are generally low in \{SSA\} and organic residues in short supply and farmers face competing demands for their use. Since minimal tillage without mulch commonly results in depressed yields, the use of fertilizer to enhance crop productivity and organic residue availability is essential for smallholder farmers to engage in CA. This is especially true since alternative ways to increase organic matter availability have largely failed. A case study from Kenya clearly demonstrates how fertilizer increases maize stover productivity above thresholds for minimal initial soil cover required for initiating \{CA\} (about 3 tonne ha−1). We conclude that strategies for using \{CA\} in \{SSA\} must integrate a fourth principle – the appropriate use of fertilizer – to increase the likelihood of benefits for smallholder farmers. "

Microbes play a pivotal role both in the process of soil fertility restoration and in nutrient acquisition by the crops. Here we ask the question how the duration of fallow affects the composition of indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities and their contribution to maize nutrition and growth, in acidic, low P soils of southern Cameroon. This question has been addressed in a bioassay where soils collected from continuously cropped fields, short-term fallows dominated by Chromolaena odorata and long-term fallows (secondary forests) have been sterilized and back- and cross inoculated with living soils from the different land-use systems. Particular microbes larger than the pore size of the filter paper (mainly the fungi including the AMF) contained in the cropped and short-fallowed soils caused greater growth and P uptake stimulations to the maize as compared to the forest soil. By using molecular profiling, we demonstrated a shift in the composition of \{AMF\} communities along a gradient of fallow duration, changing from dominance by Rhizophagus in the forest fallow soil, to dominance by Claroideoglomus under cropland. Our results contradict the hypothesis that deterioration of quality of root symbiotic communities would be responsible for a rapid yield decline following deforestation, and indicate a positive feedback of cropping on mycorrhizal functioning under conditions of shifting agriculture in tropical Africa.

Two categories of encrusted bauxitic surfaces have been identified: (i) discontinuous surfaces covering a total area of 11.13 km2, and (ii) continuous surfaces overlapping 2.41 km2. Field observations portray discontinuous surfaces with 5.5 m thick bauxitic mantle subdivided into 1.5 m thick discontinuous duricrust lying on 4.0 m thick continuous duricrust. The continuous surfaces are 4.1 m thick bauxitic duricrust. Mineralogical studies showed that the Foumban bauxites exhibit 78–86% of gibbsite, 7–22% of goethite and less than 7% of kaolinite. Geochemically, Al is the most abundant element with 45.6–58.7 wt.% of Al2O3; followed by Fe with 12.9–20.1 wt.% of Fe2O3 and Si with 1.0–3.7 wt.% of SiO2. Element mobility stated with enrichment factor (EF) allows differentiating three chemical elements: strongly depleted with \{EF\} &lt; 1 (Si, Ca, Mg, K, Na, Cu, Mn, Zn); strictly enriched with \{EF\} &gt; 1 (Al, Fe, Cr); and with irregular depletion and enrichment behavior with \{EF\} ± 1 (Nb, Sr, V, Zr).

The Foumban encrusted bauxites are classified as laterite and iron-rich high grade orth-bauxites with 45.6–58.7 wt.% of Al2O3 and 1.0–3.7 wt.% of SiO2, with bauxite reserves estimated to 75.8 million tons.

Storage of both yellow gari products was modelled at ambient temperatures typical of tropical areas (19–40 °C) over a 3-month-period at constant relative humidity. Carotenoid content and hence vitamin A activity of the gari products decreased markedly with time and temperature. Trans-β-carotene degradation fitted well the kinetics predicted by the Arrhenius model, in particular for BG. Activation energies for trans-β-carotene were 60.4 and 81.0 kJ mol−1 for \{BG\} and \{RPG\} respectively (R2 = 0.998 and 0.997, respectively); hence the minimum energy to cause degradation of trans-β-carotene in gari was lower with BG. Rates of degradation of 9-cis-β-carotene in gari were of the same order as with trans-β-carotene. Although the initial content of trans-β-carotene was twice as high in the \{BG\} compared to RPG, trans-β-carotene in \{BG\} degraded much faster. Results showed that the average shelf life at ambient temperature for \{BG\} was significantly shorter than for \{RPG\} and therefore carotenoids in \{BG\} were less stable than in RPG. "

Field trials were conducted between 2003 and 2005 to compare the effect of six 2-year rotations involving two genotypes each of cowpea (IT 96D-724 and SAMPEA-7) and soybean (TGx 1448-2E and SAMSOY-2), a natural bush fallow and maize on soil microbial and chemical properties and yield of subsequent maize. Changes in soil pH, total nitrogen (Ntot), organic carbon (Corg), water soluble carbon (WSC), microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) and nitrogen (Nmic) were measured under different cropping systems. Cropping sequence has no significant (P &gt; 0.05) effect on soil pH and Corg, while \{WSC\} increased significantly when maize followed \{IT\} 96D-724 (100%), SAMPEA-7 (95%), \{TGx\} 1448-2E (79%) and SAMSOY-2 (106%) compared with continuous maize. On average, legume rotation caused 23% increase in Ntot relative to continuous maize. The Cmic and Nmic values were significantly affected by cropping sequence. The highest values were found in legume–maize rotation and the lowest values were found in fallow–maize and continuous maize. On average, Cmic made up to 4.8% of Corg and Nmic accounted for 4.4% of Ntot under different cropping systems. Maize grain yield increased significantly following legumes and had strong positive correlation with Cmic and Nmic suggesting that they are associated with yield increases due to other rotation effects. Negative correlation of grain yield with Cmic:Nmic and Corg:Ntot indicate that high C:N ratios contribute to nitrogen immobilization in the soil and are detrimental to crop productivity. The results showed that integration of grain legumes will reverse this process and ensure maintenance of soil quality and maize crop yield, which on average, increased by 68% and 49% following soybean and cowpea, respectively compared to continuous maize.

Previous studies conducted in Nigeria and Ghana found high concentrations of aflatoxins in pre- and post-harvest maize. However, little information is available on the population structure of Aspergillus Sect. Flavi in West Africa. We determined the incidence of Aspergillus Sect. Flavi and the level of aflatoxin contamination in 91 maize samples from farms and markets in Nigeria and Ghana. Aspergillus spp. were recovered from 61/91 maize samples and aflatoxins \{B1\} and/or \{B2\} occurred in 36/91 samples. Three samples from the farms also contained aflatoxin \{G1\} and/or G2. Farm samples were more highly contaminated than were samples from the market, in terms of both the percentage of the samples contaminated and the level of mycotoxin contamination. One-hundred-and-thirty-five strains representative of the 1163 strains collected were identified by using a multilocus sequence analysis of portions of the genes encoding calmodulin, β-tubulin and actin, and evaluated for aflatoxin production. Of the 135 strains, there were 110 – Aspergillus flavus, 20 – Aspergillus tamarii, 2 – Aspergillus wentii, 2 – Aspergillus flavofurcatus, and 1 – Aspergillus parvisclerotigenus. Twenty-five of the A. flavus strains and the A. parvisclerotigenus strain were the only strains that produced aflatoxins. The higher contamination of the farm than the market samples suggests that the aflatoxin exposure of rural farmers is even higher than previously estimated based on reported contamination of market samples. The relative infrequency of the A. flavus \{SBG\} strains, producing small sclerotia and high levels of both aflatoxins (B and G), suggests that long-term chronic exposure to this mycotoxin are a much higher health risk in West Africa than is the acute toxicity due to very highly contaminated maize in east Africa.

The objective was to evaluate effects and side-effects on target grasshoppers and epigeal non-target arthropods, using simple binary (presence/absence) sampling techniques. Plots (≈50 ha, 3 replicates) were treated at standard recommended dose rates of 5 × 1012 spores/ha (Metarhizium) and 250 g a.i./ha (fenitrothion). The frequency of occurrence – or total presence – was used as a measure of relative population density. The fauna was monitored at 5 day intervals for 36 days (5 d before and 31 d after treatment) and again in August 1997, using 40 miniature pitfall traps per plot and sampling date. Presence/absence sampling proved appropriate to detect and quantify pesticide effects, and the use of similar techniques in rapid risk assessment programs (RAPs) for locust and grasshopper control is recommended. Both control agents were effective against grasshoppers, reflecting their inherent mode of action and speed of kill. The efficacy of fenitrothion ranged from 75 to 86% over the 31 d post-treatment period. Metarhizium had an efficacy of 76% during the last sampling period (days 21–31). Differences between treatments were not significant during this phase. The non-target arthropods monitored on species or species group level represented four insect families which together made up about 75% of the total catch: Carabidae, Tenebrionidae, Formicidae and Ephydridae. 75% of these taxa were significantly reduced by fenitrothion. The median effect was 69% (first week), 33% (second week) and 51% (third to fourth week), respectively, and fenitrothion was classified as `medium risk'. Most of the non-target fauna had fully recovered after 31 days, but one ant species was still significantly reduced in 1997. None of the taxa monitored proved susceptible to the mycopesticide. The median effect was &lt;25% and the product was classified as `low risk'. The field trials provided further evidence that M. anisopliae var. acridum can be as effective as organophosphates without threatening non-target arthropods other than orthopterans. "

Our objective was to evaluate soil properties and soil quality under these land cover types and to investigate on their interrelationships. Topsoil samples (0–20 cm) were collected at the same time from 8 different land cover types (bare soil with burned vegetation biomass (FR1), bare soil with unburned vegetation biomass (FR), Chromolaena odorata fallow (JC), bush ligneous fallow (JR), secondary forest (SF), primary forest (FC), Gilbertiodendron dewevrei forest (FG), and raffia and Uapacca forest (RA)) and analysed for routine laboratory determinations. A soil quality index (SQI) computed based on soil chemical properties, analysis of variance and multiple comparison tests were used to compare soils from different land cover types. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to select the most appropriate indicators that control soil quality. Several soil properties showed high to very high coefficient of variation within the land cover types. Organic matter was significantly high under forested land cover types (FC, FG, RA) and under bare soil with burned vegetation (FR1). Soil quality differs significantly (p = 0.000) from one land cover to another and shows the following ranking: SQI_FR1 ≫ SQI_FG &gt; SQI_RA &gt; SQI_FR &gt; SQI_FC &gt; SQI_JC &gt; SQI_FS &gt; SQI_JR. Organic matter (OM), available P, calcium (Ca), and pHw combined, accounted for 88.5% of the variation of soil quality. The soil quality appeared to be highly influenced by ashes from burned vegetation biomass which temporally enriches soils with nutrient elements and by the organic matter supplied by forested land cover types.

To determine at which level of intensification tomato yields were maximized and which tomato cultivar responds best to intensification, an on-farm, factorial trial was conducted at Essong Mintsang in the central region of Cameroon on a rhodic Kandiudult. Current farmer practice of manual tillage yet not destumped was compared with either reduced input (no tillage, not destumped) or increased input (no tillage yet destumped, manual tillage and destumped, mechanical tillage and destumped). Yields and yield components of three tomato varieties were determined to assess if changes in intensity of land preparation can improve soil physical properties and thus yields. At 6 weeks after planting, cultivar Rossol had more flowers (521,126 ha−1, p = 0.09) than cv. Rio Grande (403,930 ha−1), with cv. Roma (504,718 ha−1) not being significantly different from either variety. At harvest, across land preparations the cv. Rossol produced higher yields (8.12 Mg ha−1, p = 0.005) than cv. Roma (6.05 Mg ha−1) and cv. Rio Grande (4.46 Mg ha−1); the latter being significantly different (p = 0.03) from both others. Tomato total and marketable yields were significantly higher in the destumped tractor till, destumped manual till and stumps-retained manual till treatments than in the stumps retained no-till treatment. Yields in destumped no-till treatment were not significantly different from any of the treatments. Total fresh yields of cvs Roma and Rossol increased when the soil was tilled, while cv. Rio Grande had no response to land preparation. Tomato pest and disease damages were not affected by land preparation. Weeding took less time (p = 0.05) in destumped manual till (153 h ha−1) and tractor till (157 h ha−1) than in not destumped manual till plots (243 h ha−1). Soil aggregates were least stable in the destumped, tractor till treatment, with significantly lower \{MWD\} (p = 0.02), and higher mesoaggregate proportions (p = 0.05) than in the other treatments. Across tomato cultivars and treatments, the marketable fruit yield could be predicted by clay, macroaggregates and bulk density in the 0–10 cm layer: marketable yield = 0.12 clay − 0.14 macroaggregate + 12.20 (with r2 = 0.50, n = 15, p = 0.016) and for the 10–20 cm soil layer: marketable yield = 0.17 clay + 5.15 bulk density − 10.25 (with r2 = 0.58, n = 15, p = 0.005). Early flowering and fruit production combined with nematode resistance were probably the main contributing factors to the high yields of cv. Rossol. "

Arabica (Coffea arabica L.) and Robusta (Coffea canephora Pierre ex Froehn.) are the two coffee species grown. Robusta is dominantly cultivated at lower elevations (&lt;1400 m) such as in Central and Northern Uganda and Arabica is dominant at higher elevations (&gt;1400 m) such as Eastern, Southwest, and Northwest Uganda. Actual yields are far below (&lt;30%) potential due to various biotic, abiotic, and management constraints, yet there is no quantitative information on site-specific production constraints and the yield gaps attributed to those constraints. In this study, yields and diverse production factors were monitored in 254 plots of five major coffee growing regions (i.e., Central, North, East, Southwest, and Northwest). Boundary line analysis was applied to evaluate the relative importance of the individual production factors in limiting coffee production and to quantify the associated yield gaps at regional level. The impacts of rainfall variation on coffee yield were evaluated separately by regression analysis. The results of boundary line analysis indicated that biotic constraints (coffee twig borer) and poor management practices (unproductive coffee trees and low coffee plant density) restricted Robusta production in the Central region; poor soil nutrient status (especially potassium) and lack of mulching were the causes of yield loss of Robusta grown in the Northern region. For Arabica, unfavorable soil properties (high soil pH and phosphorus concentration) and excessive number of shade trees were the most important constraints in the East; high soil magnesium concentration and poor mulching limited coffee yield in the Southwest; poor soil nutrient status (especially phosphorus and potassium) and low coffee plant density were the important yield limitations in the Northwest. Average explained yield gaps of individual coffee plot due to the most important production constraints were 45%, 52%, 57%, 49%, and 50% of attainable yield, respectively, in the Central, Northern, Eastern, Southwest, and Northwest regions. Considerably less annual precipitation was received in 2009/2010 coffee growing season compared with that in the previous three years (2006–2008). Seasonal rainfall shortage occurred in the Southwest was a significant limitation to Arabica production, while excessive rainfall across the whole growing season was associated with yield reduction in the Eastern and Northwest regions. We conclude that there was a large yield gap for both Robusta and Arabica coffee grown in Uganda. Boundary line analysis allows the evaluation of relative importance of individual production constraint directly in the plot. The important production constraints varied strongly depending on the regions, which calls for site-specific management implementations. Soil fertility can be improved by implementing integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) that makes use of nutrients from the soil, recycled crop residues, mulch and chemical fertilizers. Attentions should also be given to other management practices such as coffee plant density, unproductive coffee trees and shade trees etc. "

Genetic improvement of the crop is hindered by very low seed set and poor seed germination. The objective of this study was to compare seed set, seed quality and embryo rescue rates of hybrid seeds obtained from 20 East African highland banana cultivars crossed with a fertile diploid species, Musa acuminata spp. burmannicoides ‘Calcutta 4’, as a male parent. There was great variation in seed set, seed quality and in vitro embryo germination rates among the cultivars. Although 72% (range = 47–88%) of the seeds appeared normal externally characterized by black hard integuments, only 59% (range = 35–81%) contained embryos, of which 9% (range = 0–22%) germinated. This study demonstrated that hard-seededness alone does not signify the presence of an embryo and should not be regarded as a measure of seed fertility in East African highland bananas. Cultivars ‘Entukura’, ‘Enzirabahima’ and ‘Kabucuragye’ of the ‘Nfuuka’ clone set were superior in terms of seed set, presence of seeds with embryos and culturability of embryos. These cultivars are recommended as female parents for a crossing program in the improvement of East African highland bananas. The low embryo rescue rates suggest that hybrid seeds derived from East African highland banana possess factors that cause high embryo abortion. This may be ascribed to endosperm breakdown, which can release toxins. "

Addition of earthworms significantly increased the breakdown of maize stover. Addition of millipedes significantly increased the breakdown of maize stover and rice straw. Combined addition of earthworms and millipedes generally resulted in greater plant residue breakdown, compared to that of a single group of fauna. During 10 weeks of exposure, earthworms and millipedes, on average, accounted for the breakdown of all plant residues by 10.4 and 28.4%, respectively. Millipedes and earthworms contributed more to the breakdown of plant residues with low quality (high C-to-N ratio, lignin and polyphenol contents) than to the degradation of those with high quality. It is concluded that fauna-enhanced breakdown of plant residues will have different effects on soil nutrient supply, depending on residue quality. "

The spatial distribution of bauxites and lateritic land surfaces on the Bamiléké plateau (West Cameroon) has been investigated with a Boolean modeling process into a \{GIS\} environment on the basis of geological constraints such as elevation, rock and soil types, and landscape morphology. Field observation and \{SRTM\} (Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission) data allowed the differentiation of two lateritic land surfaces separated by a minimum altitude difference of about 60 m. These surfaces constrained by favorable rock types, slope steepness and soil types provided a potential lateritic bauxitic area of 381 km2 (17.2% of the total study site). Field validation and the integration of legacy spatial data resulted in an area of 60.1 km2 for potential bauxitic ores, i.e. obviously duricrusted bauxitic surfaces (with 47.8 km2 in the upper surface and 12.3 km2 in the lower surface). Alumina contents obtained from duricrust samples were analyzed by geostatistical methods and classical kriging interpolation to discriminate between bauxitic and ferruginous laterites. This highlighted a geochemical trend from higher alumina values on the upper surface (40–66 wt.%) to lower values on the lower surface (13–44 wt.%). Finally, our study documents two duricrusted lateritic surfaces arranged in a staircase manner and having different geochemical characteristics. The total bauxitic-rich surface is distributed in five spots throughout the study area and covers 56.2 km2, while ferruginous laterites occupy a spot of 3.9 km2. \{GIS\} mapping approach of lateritic land surfaces, accounting for reliable constraints, might be promising for larger scale investigations of mineral resources in Cameroon.

This study aimed to investigate the quality and stability of air-dried papaya in terms of quality dynamics and behavior of bio-active compounds during storage for up to 9 months in two packaging materials: aluminum laminated polyethylene and polyamide/polyethylene. Samples with moisture content (MC) of 0.1328 g g−1 and water activity (aw) of 0.5 were stored at 30 °C and relative humidity (RH) of 40–50%. The MC, aw, degree of browning (DB) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) content were found to notably increase as storage progressed. On the contrary, there was a significant decrease in antioxidant capacity (DPPH, \{FRAP\} and ABTS), total phenolic (TP) and ascorbic acid (AA) contents. Packaging in aluminum laminated polyethylene under ambient conditions was found to better preserve bio-active compounds and retard increases in MC, aw and DB, when compared to polyamide/polyethylene.

The top-side area and total surface area derived from computer vision were analyzed, while the illuminated area and light intensity from optical scattering images were used to interpret photon migration in the fruit tissue. The relationship between moisture content and shrinkage in terms of volume and area reduction during drying was satisfactorily explained by a linear model. The results demonstrated that the prediction of papaya shrinkage during drying from top and total surface areas of the sample was possible, but can potentially be improved. Multivariate correlations of computer vision parameters and optical scattering properties showed the enhanced performance for shrinkage prediction. This multi-sensor approach could possibly be applied as a fast, accurate and non-invasive technique for in-line quality control to monitor shrinkage in the production of dried fruits. "

The leaf litter of the same species, collected during the different prunings had different qualities. Older Leucaena and Senna residues had a lower N content. Older Leucaena residues contained substantially more polyphenols than residues younger than 8 weeks, while 8-week-old Senna residues contained more soluble polyphenols than residues of 29 weeks. The lignin content of the Leucaena residues was greatest for the oldest prunings; while for the Senna residues no clear trend was observed. The decomposition and N release patterns of the four Leucaena and Senna pruning residues were different. The first and second prunings decomposed following first order kinetics. For the third pruning, a negative exponential regression procedure against the number of days where rainfall exceeded pan evaporation (“rainy days”) yielded a better fit than against time. Less than 10% of the dry matter of the fourth pruning decomposed after 112 days. Significant correlations were found between the decomposition rate calculated against the number of “rainy days” and the N content, the C-to-N ratio and the (lignin + polyphenol)-to-N ratio. The N release rate, calculated against the number of “rainy days” correlated significantly with the polyphenol-to-N and (lignin + polyphenol)-to-N ratios. The presence of a fully established crop increased the decomposition and N release of the residues of the second pruning in the no-tree-control plots. The amount of residues confined in the litterbags and the presence of a tree canopy had little effect on residue decomposition. "

Historical weather data spanning 20 years were used at the target production environments to generate probabilistic estimates of maize yields; nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) associated with fertilizer and variety technologies. Analysis shows with high probability that, under rainfed conditions and N fertilizer input, the 90–110 day varieties (MDV) would yield better than 120–150 day varieties (LDV) at Mokwa and Ibadan, with superior NUE. The risk of crop failure with no N input was, however, substantial. Although response to N varied dramatically from year to year in association with the rainfall, there appears to be no advantage in adjusting N-input strategy for a variety. \{NUE\} was predicted to be best at the 60 kg N/ha input strategy, indicating potentials of further yield increase if methods of enhancing \{NUE\} at the higher N input levels could be further investigated.

It is unlikely, however, that breeding objectives conserving traditional crop characteristics as found in extensive systems would have been more successful. The authors identify systems caught in the agricultural transition from subsistence to intensified, market-oriented production as the most important target for crop improvement, and provide examples of new breeding objectives for cowpea, sorghum and upland rice. In each of these cases, breeders, with the help of physiologists, have developed innovative plant-type concepts that combine improved yield potential and input responsiveness with specific traditional crop characteristics that remain essential during the agricultural transition. In the case of cowpea, dual-purpose varieties were developed that produce a good grain yield due to an erect plant habit, then produce new leaves enabling a second harvest of green foliage. For upland rice systems that are limited by labour (mainly needed to control weeds that abound due to shortened fallow periods), a weed competitive plant type was developed from Oryza sativa × Oryza glaberrima crosses. Lastly, sorghum breeders who had previously deselected photoperiod sensitivity are now re-inserting sensitivity into plants having “modern” architecture, in order to allow for flexible sowing dates while maintaining an agro-ecologically optimal time of flowering near the end of the wet season. The ecophysiological basis of these plant types, their place in current and future cropping systems, as well as the problem of under-funding for their realisation, are discussed. "

This work was conducted to determine the contribution of different \{SOM\} fractions to the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of a tropical soil and to study the effect of organic matter inputs of different biochemical composition on the \{CEC\} of SOM. Soil samples were collected from a 20-year-old arboretum established on a Ferric Lixisol, under seven multipurpose tree species: Afzelia africana, Dactyladenia barteri, Gliricidia sepium, Gmelina arborea, Leucaena leucocephala, Pterocarpus santalinoides, and Treculia africana. Fractions were obtained by wet sieving and sedimentation after ultrasonic dispersion. Relationships between \{CEC\} and pH were determined using the silver thiourea-method and were described by linear regression. The \{CEC\} of the fractions smaller than 0.053 mm was inversely related to their particle size: clay (&lt;0.002 mm)&gt;fine silt (0.002–0.02 mm)&gt;coarse silt (0.02–0.053 mm), except for the soils under T. africana, D. barteri, and L. leucocephala, where the \{CEC\} of the fine silt fraction was highest or comparable to the \{CEC\} of the clay fraction. The clay and fine silt fractions were responsible for 76–90% of the soil \{CEC\} at pH 5.8. The contribution of the fine silt fraction to the \{CEC\} at pH 5.8 ranged from 35 to 50%, which stressed the importance of the fine silt fraction for the physicochemical properties of the soil. Differences in \{CEC\} between treatments for the whole soil and the fractions could be explained by the differences in carbon content. Except for the intercept for the clay fraction, \{SOM\} had a significant (P&lt;0.001) contribution to both the intercepts (=estimated \{CEC\} at pH 0) and slopes (=pH-dependent charge) of the CEC–pH relationships for the whole soil and the fractions. The \{CEC\} of \{SOM\} at pH 5.8 varied between 283 cmolc kg−1 C for particulate organic matter, and 563 cmolc kg−1 C for the fine silt fraction. The biochemical composition of the organic inputs did not have an important effect on the \{CEC\} of SOM. In total, \{SOM\} was responsible for 75–85% of the \{CEC\} of these soils. "

Although soybean can obtain 50% or more of its N requirement from the atmosphere, the N contribution of the crop to the system depends on the amount of N contained in roots, haulms, and fallen leaves after grain harvest. At four sites in the northern Guinea savanna, the effects on N balance of P fertilizer and soybean varieties of different duration were tested. The varieties received P fertilizer at the rates of 0, 30, and 60 kg P ha−1. The total N accumulated aboveground at harvest averaged 104 kg N ha−1 in the early and medium varieties, and 135 kg N ha−1 in the late varieties. Across all varieties and sites, total N content was increased by 40–47% when P was applied. Apparent N harvest index averaged 85% but was not significantly affected by variety or P rate. When only grain was exported, the calculated N balance of the early and the medium varieties was −2.6 to −12.2 kg N ha−1 while the longer duration varieties had positive N balances ranging from 2 to 10.9 kg N ha−1. The N accrual was negative when P was not applied and ranged from 2.4 to 5.2 kg N ha−1 with P application. The interaction of variety and site on the N balance was significant at P&lt;0.05. N balance at the southernmost site was −14.2 kg N ha−1 compared with 2.6–10 kg N ha−1 at the northern sites where \{N2\} fixation was higher. The estimate of N balance is reduced when soybean haulms are exported. A positive N contribution by soybean is, therefore, possible in a soybean–cereal rotation when: (i) P is applied, (ii) the soybean variety is late maturing, and (iii) only grain is exported. "

Contrary to temperate forests, there has been very little research on saproxylic beetle assemblages in tropical forests. In Africa, large tracts of natural forest have been converted to tree plantations (mainly exotic species) and cropland, and these land use changes are expected to have a dramatic effect on saproxylic beetle assemblages. In the Lama forest reserve in Southern Benin, we conducted an inventory of dead wood and the associated saproxylic beetle fauna, focusing on three different forest types, natural semi-deciduous forest, teak plantations and fuelwood plantations. The dead wood recorded included all coarse woody debris (CWD), standing dead trees (snags) and dead branches or stems on live trees (limbs). Saproxylic beetles were reared from dead wood of different decay stages and tree species, using emergence traps. Both the quantity and quality of dead wood resources differed greatly among natural forest and plantations. Average volumes were about 30, 4 and 1 m3 ha−1 in natural forest, teak and fuelwood plantations, respectively. Dead wood of advanced decay was basically absent in plantations, due to wood-collecting activities of the local population. The overall species richness of saproxylic beetles was higher in natural forest, and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) clearly segregated dead wood beetle assemblages from natural forest and plantations. Multiple regression found three significant predictors of the first ordination axis, the volumes of (a) recently dead wood; (b) large pieces of dead wood; and (c) coarse woody debris. Despite the overall paucity of dead wood, in particular the lack of strongly decayed wood, saproxylic beetle diversity in teak and fuelwood plantations was surprisingly high, providing evidence of the importance of dead wood and the potential of dead wood management for biodiversity conservation.

To assess if the fallow phase had attained sufficiently high levels of fertility, the status of the soil macrofauna was used by 42% of farmers as an indicator. The presence of earthworm casts was used by 35% of farmers to determine if the land was ready for cropping. Earthworms were not believed to have any effect on soil fertility (98.6%) and only 0.7% of farmers believed that earthworms either increased or decreased soil fertility. Across all crops, 71.6% of farmers reported that earthworms had no effect on crop yields. Any positive effects on yields were regarded as crop specific: 30.1% of farmers believed that groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) and cassava (Manihot esculentus) yields increased if earthworms were present. For maize (Zea mays), plantain (Musa spp.), cocoyam (Xanthosoma sagittifolium) and cacao (Theobroma cacao), between 27.7 and 19.2% of farmers believed that earthworms created yield increases. Few respondents (mean across crops 1.8%) believed that earthworms decreased crop yields, with the greatest proportion of these relating to plantain (3.8%). The farmers' perception of earthworms' effects on cassava and groundnut yields was very dependent on the location and related to the levels of surface casting. "

However, most of the women are satisfied with the different cultivars of plantain available in urban markets, and with their general quality characteristics respective to the final use. Finally, the study found that most women consider that chemical fertilisers have a negative impact on plantain quality. The second part of the paper analyses prices, preferences, and consumption habits of urban households regarding the main starchy products. Plantain and yam are actually the most expensive products in terms of price per energy unit (kcal), compared to rice, cassava or maize. Plantain is the preferred staple for most households, but a higher level of consumption is constrained by family budgets.

abstract = "Abstract Typologies may be used as tools for dealing with farming system heterogeneity. This is achieved by classifying farms into groups that have common characteristics, i.e. farm types, which can support the implementation of a more tailored approach to agricultural development. This article explored patterns of farming system diversity through the classification of 70 smallholder farm households in two districts (Savelugu-Nanton and Tolon-Kumbungu) of Ghana’s Northern Region. Based on 2013 survey data, the typology was constructed using the multivariate statistical techniques of principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Results proposed six farm types, stratified on the basis of household, labour, land use, livestock and income variables, explaining the structural and functional differences between farming systems. Types 1 and 2 were characterized by relatively high levels of resource endowment and oriented towards non-farm activities and crop sales respectively. Types 3 and 4 were moderately resource-endowed with income derived primarily from on-farm activities. Types 5 and 6 were resource constrained, with production oriented towards subsistence. The most salient differences among farm types concerned herd size (largest for Type 1), degree of legume integration (largest for Types 2–4), household size and hired labour (smallest household size for Types 4 and 6, and largest proportion of hired labour for Type 4), degree of diversification into off/non-farm activities (highest for Type 1 and lowest for Type 5) and severity of resource constraints (Type 6 was most constrained with a small farm area and herd comprised mainly of poultry). It was found that livelihood strategies reflected the distinctive characteristics of farm households; with poorly-endowed types restricted to a ‘survival strategy’ and more affluent types free to pursue a ‘development strategy’. This study clearly demonstrates that using the established typology as a practical framework allows identification of type-specific farm household opportunities and constraints for the targeting of agricultural interventions and innovations, which will be further analysed in the research-for-development project. We conclude that a more flexible approach to typology construction, for example through the incorporation of farmer perspectives, might provide further context and insight into the causes, consequences and negotiation of farm diversity.

Food security is used as a case study, and the food security impacts of two agro-industrial and two smallholder biofuel projects in Mozambique are described and analysed. The sustainability frameworks and schemes used in this study are able to address some, but not all, of the heterogeneity between and within different biofuel production systems. The emphasis is on monitoring agro-industrial projects while smallholder projects tend to slip through the net even when their negative impacts are evident. We conclude that globally applicable sustainability principles are useful, however, they should be operationalised at local or production system levels. This approach will support balancing between global frameworks and local heterogeneity. "

This article aims to compare a quantitative, statistical typology based on a survey dataset and multivariate analysis, with a qualitative participatory typology based on informal group sessions and activities with local stakeholders from three communities in Northern Ghana. The statistical typology resulted in six clusters, with farm households categorized on the basis of their structural (resource endowment)- and functional (production objectives/livelihood strategies) characteristics. The participatory typology identified five farm types, based primarily on endowment (farm size, income investment), gender and age-related criteria. While the entire household was adopted as the unit of analysis of the statistical typology, the participatory typology provided a more nuanced differentiation by grouping individual farmers; with possibly several farmer types per household (e.g. ‘small’ and ‘female farmers’) as well as ‘farm-less’ individuals as a result. Other sources of dissimilarity which contributed to limited overlap between the typologies included changes that occurred in the communities between the two data collection efforts and inaccuracies in the data. The underlying causes of the latter seemed to mainly relate to socio-cultural issues that distorted information collection in both typologies; including power and status differences between both the researchers and farmers, as well as the farmers themselves. We conclude that although statistical techniques warrant objectivity and reproducibility in the analysis, the complexity of data collection and representation of the local reality might limit their effectiveness in selection of farms, innovation targeting and out-scaling in \{R4D\} projects. In addition, while participatory typologies offer a more contextualized representation of heterogeneity, their accuracy can still be compromised by socio-cultural constraints. Therefore, we recommend making effective use of the advantages offered by each approach by applying them in a complementary manner. "

In 2007, the use of the fallout radionuclide 137Cs as a tracer for estimating the magnitude of medium-term (40–50 years) rates of soil redistribution was tested at a research station in Ibadan, Nigeria, to investigate, for the first time, its applicability in the derived savanna of West Africa. Because of the traditional tillage practice for cassava cultivation of creating downslope oriented ridges and furrows during the annual ploughing, there was a need to adapt the 137Cs approach to these specific condition. The mean inventory was determined for cores collected from both ridges and furrows at different positions down the slope and this value was used to estimate the downslope variation in the longer term soil redistribution rate. The mean 137Cs reference inventory obtained for an undisturbed site was 568 ± 138 Bq m−2. The average inventory for the upper slope of the cassava field (423 ± 323 Bq m−2) was generally lower than the average inventory for the middle slope (509 ± 166 Bq m−2) and for the lower slope (606 ± 245 Bq m−2) and these results provided clear evidence of the downslope movement of soil. The mean 137Cs inventory for the study area within the cassava field (496 ± 273 Bq m−2) was 13% lower than the reference inventory, indicating that some of the soil mobilised and redistributed by erosion had been exported beyond the field. Using 137Cs data set and the conversion model mass balance model 2 (MBM2), the gross erosion rate from the cultivated site was estimated to be 18.3 t ha−1 year−1 and the net erosion rate 14.4 t ha−1 year−1, providing a sediment delivery ratio of 78%. These estimates are comparable to the rates generated by conventional soil loss measurements made close to the study site. The study demonstrates that the 137Cs technique can be successfully used to obtain data on medium-term soil redistribution in the derived savanna of Nigeria, and that it could be a useful tool for supporting the improvement of soil conservation on farmland in West Africa.

Structurally, cassava mosaic geminiviruses (CMGs) are comprised of two small, single-stranded, circular \{DNA\} molecules, DNA-A and DNA-B, each of which is encapsidated within a geminate coat. \{CMG\} infection results in symptoms comprising misshapen leaves with a mosaic-like chlorosis and general plant stunting, leading to reduced tuberous root production. Through the processes of virus–virus synergism, pseudo-recombination, and true recombination, \{CMGs\} have evolved into a diverse and highly successful group of plant pathogens and seven species are currently recognized from Africa. Rapid spread of a recombinant strain, East African cassava mosaic virus-Uganda (EACMV-UG), has been associated with a pandemic of unusually severe CMD, which has affected much of East and Central Africa, leading to production losses of 47%, equivalent to nearly 14 million tonnes. Although the deployment of conventionally bred host plant resistance is the main approach being used to manage CMGs, with considerable success, increased attention is being given to the development of transgenic resistance strategies.

To delineate its determinants, the relative importance of cassava based on each of the above three concepts was regressed as a function of environment, occurrence of famine, demographic and market variables, in an ordinary least squares regression framework. The results show that ecological and non-ecological factors determine cassava's relative importance, especially on a field area basis. The occurrence of famine is also an important determinant, but only on a farmers' ordinal crop rank basis. In general, non-ecological factors are more important determinants of the relative importance of cassava in Nigeria than ecological factors. "

Yet, banana yields in this region are among the lowest in the world due to a wide range of abiotic, biotic and socio-economic causes. Cropping systems which could contribute to soil fertility replenishment, pest and disease suppression and climate change mitigation might improve banana yields and contribute to uplifting the livelihoods of millions of people in the region. In this context, a survey was conducted over two seasons in banana-based subsistence farming systems in Rwanda, Burundi, north-western Tanzania (Kagera and Kigoma regions) and eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (South Kivu province), to investigate the distribution and incidence of banana Fusarium wilt as related to cropping systems, edapho-climatic and socio-economic factors. Banana Fusarium wilt incidence was found generally high in the region, 54.1% of all farms had disease incidence higher than 40%, with Tanzania having the highest number of farms with high disease incidence (63.6%). Statistical analysis (chi-squared test of association) and \{GIS\} mapping, by layering Fusarium wilt incidence over selected predictor maps, showed that disease incidence was lower in farms growing cultivar mixtures (p &lt; 0.01) and at higher altitudes (&gt;1600masl) (p &lt; 0.05), and a significant association of Fusarium wilt and farm age was observed whereby disease incidence was highest in farms aged between 10 and 30 years (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, this study reports for the first time the occurrence of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense race 2 in Rwanda and Burundi, and suggests that strategies for banana Fusarium wilt management in east and central Africa should include raising farmers’ awareness on pathogen spread mechanisms and enhancing their access to disease-free planting materials.

In the early stages of growth low soil pH was associated with chlorosis of the first trifoliate leaves of some cultivars. A more frequently observed symptom was a “freckling” on the unifoliate and first trifoliate leaves. Many varieties growing in acid soil developed multiple shoots in petiole axes after flowering. This symptom, when severe, was always associated with aborted flowers. The Mn contents of 35-day-old cowpea tops, grown at three pH levels, ranged from 600 to 2800 μg/g. As a group, cultivars which responded most to lime additions, if they were not limed, contained almost twice as much Mn as the nonresponsive group. The maximum Mn content of young cowpea at which growth was possible was in the range 2500–2800 μg/g. Cultivars which responded to lime fixed increasing amounts of N with increasing soil pH (decreasing plant Mn). The most vigorously growing young plants contained about 1000 μg Mn/g plant top. In nutrient solution culture this Mn content was associated with 1–2 μg Mn/ml of nutrient solution. Potential yield of the cultivars at pH 4.8 and at the most favorable pH was estimated from regression curves of yield vs. distance across the lime variable. Responsiveness to lime was evaluated by the slope of the regression line. A scheme which classified cowpea for tolerance to Mn was developed. The scheme had five main groups based on yield potential at the most favorable soil pH for each cultivar and three subgroups based on yield potential at pH 4.8. Responsiveness to lime was indicated by the order of listing within subgroups. Based on this scheme 10 cultivars qualified for subgroup \{A1\} which required a yield potential &gt; 1500 kg/ha at optimum pH and yield potential &gt; 50% of maximum at pH 4.8. "

One experiment studied the effect of location of Eupatorium odoratum mulch on soil properties and crop growth. A second experiment studied the effect of tillage system and Eupatorium odoratum mulch on soil properties and crop growth. In both experiments mulch was applied at an annual rate of 12 t∗∗t=metric tonne=1000 kg ha−1 (25% moisture content) in a split application at planting and 150 days after planting (DAP). No fertilizer was applied during the experiment. Concentration of mulch in the plant row resulted in values of within-row bulk density in the surface 0.10 m which were lower by 15% and 13% in 1983 and 1984, respectively. Tillage in combination with mulch reduced bulk density in the surface 0.10 m by an average of 10% and 9% in 1983 and 1984, respectively. No significant differences were found among other treatments. Soil chemical properties were unaffected by treatments in both experiments. Cassava tuber yield was unaffected by location of Eupatorium odoratum mulch. Both plowing and no-tillage when combined with mulch improved tuber yields. Cassava tuber yields of untilled plots were 16.8 and 12.7 t ha−1 during 1983–1984, and 13.1 and 8.3 t ha−1 during 1984–1985 in mulched and unmulched treatments, respectively.

To determine the effect of shading on its development and yield, cassava was subjected to six shade regimes (0, 20, 40, 50, 60 and 70% of full sunlight). The 2-year field study was undertaken on a sandy clay loam soil (Oxic Paleustalf or Ferric Luvisol) in southwestern Nigeria. Plant height increased while leaf area index decreased as percentage of shade increased. Stem and leaf dry weight increased with decreasing degree of shade. All levels of shade delayed tuber bulking.

Suggestions for improving cassava productivity in mixed cropping and intercropping systems include the use of late-maturing cassava varieties, reducing the population of the associated crop and allowing long recovery intervals after the harvest of the intercrop.

In 1999, a survey of 365 men and women from 192 households in 24 villages in the target area, using participatory and quantitative methods, revealed that water hyacinth, although not eliminated, was perceived by the villagers as having been reduced from a serious pest to one of minor or moderate importance. According to their estimates of the impacts they perceived, at the peak of the infestation water hyacinth had reduced the yearly income of this population of about 200 000 by approximately US$84 million. Lost revenues for men were mostly in fishing, while women experienced lost revenues in trade, primarily food crops and fish. The reduction of water hyacinth cover through biological control was credited with an increase in income of US$30.5 million per year. The total cost of the control program is estimated at a present value of US$2.09 million. Assuming the benefits are to stay constant over the next 20 years, a most conservative assumption, the accumulated present value would be US$260 million, yielding a respectable benefit cost ratio of 124:1. This ratio is calculated for direct economic effects on the people of Southern Benin only, and does not take into account indirect benefits or the benefits of the project to other countries were the biological control agents were successfully introduced. Other effects mentioned, but not measured, included an increase of water quality and of human health. "

As far as is known, these indigenous bradyrhizobia strains have not been tested for compatibility and effectiveness with recent selections from a breeding programme which has proceeded without input from soil microbiologists for the last 20 yr. Twenty bradyrhizobia strains isolated from soyabean and cowpea grown in Ibadan and Zaria soils in Nigeria were examined in a pot experiment for symbiotic effectiveness on two promiscuous soyabean breeding lines (TGX 1660-19F and \{TGX\} 1456-2E) and a cowpea cultivar (IT 849-92). Two bradyrhizobial isolates (R25B and \{IRj\} 2180A) had an average symbiotic effectiveness (SE) of 2.36-fold and 1.62-fold of the uninoculated control when inoculated on 1456-2E and 1660-19F, respectively. These strains, however, were less effective on cowpea having a \{SE\} of 1.20-fold. Cowpea bradyrhizobia inoculated on promiscuous soyabeans produced less than 77 nodules plant−1 compared to an average of 120 by the two best bradyrhizobia strains from soyabean. The best isolates (R25B, \{IRj\} 2180A and their mixture) and one cowpea bradyrhizobia (IRc 461) were further tested on these lines under field conditions at three sites in different agroecological zones in moist savanna (Fashola, Mokwa and Zaria) in Nigeria. Both soyabean lines nodulated with the local rhizobia, but the degree of effectiveness depended on the plant genotype and field sites. Soyabean line 1456-2E showed improved growth and yield in response to N fertilizer application indicating that in this line \{N2\} fixation induced by the indigenous bradyrhizobial community supplied less than optimal amounts of N. The mixture of bradyrhizobial isolates \{R25B\} and \{IRj\} 2180A increased grain yield of 1456-2E by 30 and 25% at Zaria and Mokwa but failed to do so at Fashola. Grain yield of 1660-19F was not affected by bradyrhizobial inoculation and N fertilizer at any of the three sites. Thus, the need for bradyrhizobia inoculation will be determined by the degree of promiscuity of soybean lines and the effectiveness of the community of indigenous bradyrhizobia present in the site.

The order of erodibility as evaluated for the different soils varied with the index used and the prevailing soil conditions.

Also the use of the rainfall simulator on a microplot (0.036 m2) would appear to have serious limitations even for comparative studies in this and similar soils of the area because of high degree of variability in microenvironments. The soil aggregate stability technique was the least satisfactory index for determining erodibility of these soils. "

The study involved four different species of shrubs (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit, Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Walp, Alchornea cordifolia, and Acioa barterii), planted at two row spacings (2 and 4 m) and two fertilizer rates (F1=45-20-20 and F2=90-40-40 kg of N-P-K ha−1) applied to the maize crop only. The hedgerows were periodically pruned, and the prunings added as mulch to the respective plots. The control plots were cropped without hedgerows. There was partial shading of the crops by the hedgerows despite periodic pruning of the shrubs. Incident radiation measured at the height of the leaves subtending the ear in maize, and just above the canopy in cowpea, decreased exponentially as a function of an index defined by the ratio of the relative height of the shrubs above the respective height of measurement in the crops (Hs−Hc) to the distance (D) between the hedgerow and the adjacent crop row. A higher degree of shading associated with the faster growing species (Leucaena, Gliricidia) and/or closer inter-hedgerow spacing resulted in corresponding decreases in crop yield. Larger amounts of hedgerow biomass production (&gt; 5 t ha−1 dry weight) were found to be associated with significant decreases in crop yields owing to increased hedgerow shading particularly with Leucaena. Hedgerows and the organic residue mulch from the prunings contributed to an overall improvement in soil moisture retention. "

Earthworm activity was greater with intercropping although it was not significantly affected by the number of component crops in a mixture. The particle size distribution, bulk density, exchangeable cations, Bray-1-P, pH and effective cation exchange capacity (CEC) of soil and earthworm casts did not differ among the cassava-based cropping systems investigated. Greatest values of mean weight diameter, organic C and total N were observed in earthworm casts from three component crop mixtures, although the adjacent soil was not similarly affected. The results suggest that although the cropping system changed some physico-chemical properties of earthworm casts, similar changes did not occur in the adjacent soil. Water infiltration into the soil was, however, increased by intercropping and may be related to earthworm activity. Cropping system may, therefore, influence soil fertility indirectly by changing water infiltration characteristics and hence, nutrient losses in run-off and erosion. In relation to soil, earthworm casts had higher silt and clay contents, bulk density, mean weight diameter, pH, Bray-1-P, Organic C, total N, C:N ratio, exchangeable cations and effective CEC, and lower sand content.

Soil sampled from mound surfaces, mound perimeters (interface of mound and surrounding soil) and surrounding soil was analyzed for various physical and chemical features.

Easy to grow even under harsh agronomic conditions, cassava is the primary source of carbohydrates for more than 200 million people, including the poorest on the continent, and provides food security to most subsistence farmers. Several pests including phytophagous arthropods, plant pathogens and weeds constrain cassava production on the continent. The exotic species introduced accidentally from the Neotropics constitute the largest group of pests. The long cropping cycle exposes cassava to relatively few additional pests in Africa, and enhances sustainable pest management interventions such as biological control, host plant resistance and cultural practices. Historically, cassava plant protection focused on resistance breeding, but since the invasion of several devastating exotic pests in the 1970s, a wider range of pest management solutions are now being pursued. Plant protection interventions that are developed and tested by teams of multi-disciplinary scientists with input from extension agents and client farmers are urgently needed. Appropriate technology development requires an understanding of key pest-host-agroecosystem interactions in the context of the agronomic practices of the farmer and the socio-economic importance of the crop. A regional project to develop, test and implement ecologically sustainable cassava plant protection in West Africa is presented as a general model for developing appropriate pest management in Africa.

Soil compaction decreased seedling emergence and shoot and root growth. Residue mulching decreased seedling emergence by 35.6% in direct-seeded rice.

A common response of farmers is to shorten fallow periods, which can lead to a decline in crop yields, due to incomplete nutrient replenishment. However, whether farmers change their management of soil and nutrients according to the fallow length is not known. A survey was carried out in southern Cameroon in 1995 to establish factors determining farmers’ nutrient management practices (NMPs). Three classes of indigenous \{NMPs\} were identified: crop placement, mulching, and the use of inputs. Crop placement comprised intentional cultivation of certain crops in ash patches or near to tree trunks and stumps. Mulching was done with weeds and crop residues, on the soil surface next to crops or in planting holes. Crop placement was found in 88.8% of fields and mulching in 57.4%, while inputs were used in only 1.7%. Nutrient management seemed to be restricted to an optimal allocation of crops to nutrient sources in the field. Relationships were weak between the frequency of crop placement or mulching and indices of land or labor availability. Fallow length seems to be negatively correlated to crop placement at rotten trunks or stumps or in ash patches and positively to placement near recently felled trees. Crop placement and mulching of crop residues were used less often in simplified crop associations than in traditional intercrops. Nutrient inputs were mainly given to monocrops. Application of purchased inputs concentrated on commercial crops. Most respondents knew the advantages and risks of currently practiced methods, but often lacked information on the use of locally available internal inputs (refuse, kitchen ash, manure). Application of internal inputs was considered too labor demanding. The use of purchased inputs was limited by high prices. Soil fertility was in most cases not regarded as a problem. "

It argues that these have consisted not merely of the introduction of new high-yielding varieties but of a broad set of mutually reinforcing changes which have transformed agricultural practice in the areas in which they took place. The changes have typically involved a suite of new technological components (including several new crops, fertilizers, and new power sources, among others), altered land use patterns, and changes in the labor economy. These have facilitated both intensification and extensification of agriculture (except in south India, where intensification predominated), resulting in substantial increases in regional output and income. Market production rather than population pressure has driven the changes in all of these cases, and it is questionable that population growth alone could lead to transformations of this kind. The cases also demonstrate that adoption of plows and fertilizers can occur at relatively low population densities in Africa, provided other conditions are favorable. In Africa, India, and elsewhere such changes have been geographically uneven, occurring dramatically in some areas but affecting others only marginally. Such geographic disparities call for attempts to mitigate the regional inequities and stresses to which they give rise. "

The maize model is designed to simulate plant physiological processes (nutrient and water uptake, transpiration, photosynthesis, organogenesis and biomass partitioning), and predict growth, development and yield in daily time steps in a manner similar to the processes as they are thought to occur in the real plant. An adequately tested and validated crop model with known genetic constants for varieties could be a time and money saving tool, useful for studying response of varieties in constrasting environments and management practices. Information on phenology, leafweight stem weight, above ground biomass, grain yield and leaf area index was collected approximately every 10 days. Daily weather data were collected using an automatic station located within the field. Genetic constants, i.e. growing degree days (base 8°C) from seedling emergence to the end of juvenile phase (P1), degree days (base 8°C) from silking to maturity (P5) potential number of grains per plant (G2) and potential grain growth rate during the linear filling stage (G3), were estimated using observed silking and maturity dates, grains per plant and weight per grain at harvest for each replication, using 1990 data. \{P1\} and \{P5\} were estimated to be 280 and 680 degree days across all replications; \{G2\} was 647, 654 and 612 with a mean of 637·66 grains per plant; similarly, \{G3\} was 9·2, 9·13 and 8·06 with a mean of 8·79 mg/day.

The most resistant accessions belonged to V. vexillata, followed by those from V. oblongifolia, with a few outstanding exceptions from V. unguiculata. Even though the latter were the least resistant, they provided the greatest variability among the tested accessions. In the DCAT, the cultivated cowpea line, IT84S-2246, which was used as the susceptible control was always preferred for feeding by the larvae (feeding index [FI] of 1.10–2.60) than the V. unguiculata accessions (FI ranged from 0–0.52). Against the resistant control (itself belonging to V. vexillata), only a few accessions were less preferred, most of these being either V. vexillata or V. oblongifolia. Larvae lost weight on the most resistant from all three species, because they either did not feed, or fed very little. Weight gain was positively correlated with seed damage (r = 0.82, P &lt; 0.01) and the amount of frass produced (r = 0.91, P &lt; 0.01).

abstract = "The effects of three methods of deforestation and of land preparation on the growth and yield of maize (Zea mays L.) were investigated for an Alfisol in southwest Nigeria. Performance of maize was evaluated with and without fertilizer and with and without tillage for plots cleared with a front-mounted root rake on a tracked tractor, cleared manually followed by in situ burning, and cleared manually followed by removal of the entire biomass without burning. Maize growth was generally poor on mechanically-cleared unfertilized plots: plants were stunted, showed chlorotic symptoms of nutrient deficiency, and moisture stress a few days earlier than on manually-cleared plots. Maize grain yield was significantly affected by fertilizer application, and generally higher on manually-cleared no-till plots than on mechanically-cleared or plowed plots. Crop performance and grain yield were related to changes in soil properties due to methods of land clearance and post-clearance soil management. "

Intercropping with N-fertilizer application gave the highest leaf area index and light interception and hence the best weed control, highest N, P and K uptake, total yields and land equivalent ratio. Intercropping with no N application made only a slight improvement in leaf area index, light interception and weed control over the corresponding sole cassava. "

One-spray at flowering stage was better than 1-spray at podding stage. There was no significant difference between no-spray and 1-spray at podding stage. The improved varieties produced significantly higher grain yields than the local variety especially with no or only one 1-spray at podding stage indicating that the improved varieties have some level of field resistance to insect pests. Combined analysis of the 3-year results indicated maximum gross income for the 3-spray treatment and minimum from no-spray as expected. The improved early maturing varieties, IT93K-452-1 and IT97K-499-4 performed equally well with 2-sprays and 1-spray at flowering, indicating that these varieties do not require more than two sprays. Thus, using a combination of improved early maturing cowpea varieties and time of application, the need for insecticide sprays can be greatly minimized in cowpea production. "

Surveys were conducted in 1996 and 1997 in the coastal/derived savanna (Benin and Nigeria) and southern Guinea savanna (Côte d'Ivoire) to characterize farming systems, soils, and farmers’ management strategies in fields dominated by speargrass. Twenty-one crops were found in speargrass dominated fields. Speargrass was ranked as the most serious weed in both agroecological zones. Besides speargrass, Commelina benghalensis L., Digitaria nuda Shumach, Cyperus rotundus L., Tridax procumbens L., Rottboellia cochinchinensis (Lour.) Clayton, Digitaria horizontalis Willd, Striga spp., and Euphorbia heterophylla were also considered as important weeds in major cropping systems. Speargrass was undesirable because it reduces crop yield and quality, limits farm size, causes injury to the skin, increases labour requirement and increases the presence of pathogens and insects of economic crops. Nevertheless, some farmers indicated that speargrass was an important source of cheap roofing material, animal fodder and medicines. Most farmers used labour intensive control strategies to combat speargrass due to, among other reasons, lack of capital. Speargrass occurred in soils with a wide range of chemical properties and particle size distribution. "

Easy to grow even under harsh agronomic conditions, cassava is the primary source of carbohydrates for more than 200 million people, including the poorest on the continent, and provides food security to most subsistence farmers. Several pests including phytophagous arthropods, plant pathogens and weeds constrain cassava production on the continent. The exotic species introduced accidentally from the Neotropics constitute the largest group of pests. The long cropping cycle exposes cassava to relatively few additional pests in Africa, and enhances sustainable pest management interventions such as biological control, host plant resistance and cultural practices. Historically, cassava plant protection focused on resistance breeding, but since the invasion of several devastating exotic pests in the 1970s, a wider range of pest management solutions are now being pursued. Plant protection interventions that are developed and tested by teams of multi-disciplinary scientists with input from extension agents and client farmers are urgently needed. Appropriate technology development requires an understanding of key pest-host-agroecosystem interactions in the context of the agronomic practices of the farmer and the socio-economic importance of the crop. A regional project to develop, test and implement ecologically sustainable cassava plant protection in West Africa is presented as a general model for developing appropriate pest management in Africa.

Measuring the discrepancy between true and estimated heritability has important theoretical and practical implications for the genetic improvement of plantain and bananas. In this regard, formulas were developed to describe the relationships between parental and filial generations with different ploidy states and this information was used to estimate heritability for several traits of plantains and bananas. This approach may be extended to other polysomic species with similar meiotic behaviour and ploidy polymorphism. "

Varietal susceptibility to S. zeamais did not appear to be associated with husk cover. Most damage by storage pests occurred later in the season, and damage was most strongly associated with P. truncatus density. An ideal maize breeding programme should include the development of maize varieties able to resist insect attack for a long storage season, in addition to varieties with a high yield. "

However, fungicide use might have negative impacts on soil-faunal mediated nutrient cycling, a crucial process in perennial systems in the tropics as fertilizer is rarely used. An experiment was established in 35 year old cacao farms in southern Cameroon to assess the effects of different fungicide application rates, none, reduced (‘low’), and manufacturer's recommended rate (‘high’), upon earthworm cast production for 4 years and this was also compared with cast production in a secondary forest of the same age. Supplementary measurements were made to assess the impacts of fungicide treatment on litter decomposition and, through potentially lower earthworm activity, on soil compaction. Cocoa yields were 2.5 times greater in the high spray treatment than in the low spray treatment. There were no significant differences in cast production between cacao spray treatments in the first 3 years. In year 4 only, cast production was significantly lower in the high spray treatment than in the no-spray control. With no evidence of any negative effect on either litter decomposition or soil bulk density, the high spray regime can be recommended to farmers, perhaps accompanied by measures such as adding leguminous cover crops or mulch to hasten litter decomposition rates, provide soil coverage and thus possibly reducing the efficacy of P. megakarya inoculum.

Hot-water treatment reduced nematode infestation to about 30% of that found in untreated plants and increased rhizome survival by 11%. Fertilizer application increased the proportion of bunch-producing plants from 44 to 65% through reduced die-back, toppling and pseudostem breakage during the dry season but had no effect on bunch weight per plant. Fresh bunch yield of the plant-crop was 10.2 Mg ha−1 in unfertilized, untreated, plots; fertilized plots produced 15.3 Mg ha−1 and hot-water treated plots 13 Mg ha−1. Fertilized and hot-water treated plots produced 20.8 Mg ha−1. First ratoon yields were unaffected by fertilizer, but increased due to hot-water treatment from 0.81 to 5.0 Mg ha−1. Plant-crop bunch weight decreased with increasing time between planting and harvest. Mean bunch fresh weight was negatively correlated with an index of root nematode infestation and positively correlated with the number of living roots. For the plant-crop and plant-crop plus ratoon yields, the yield increase due to combined use of fertilizer and hot-water treatment was larger than increases attained by individual measures. Thus combination of hot-water treatment and fertilizer had a synergistic effect on plantain fresh bunch yield, justifying introduction of both measures simultaneously. "

The objective was to determine the combining ability of seven extra-early yellow-endosperm inbreds, place them into heterotic groups, identify the best testers and superior single-cross hybrids under drought, Striga infestation, optimal conditions and across environments. General combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) mean squares were significant for grain yield and most other traits across test environments. Mean squares for \{GCA\} were larger than those of \{SCA\} in all environments, indicating that additive gene action was more important in the inheritance of traits. Three testers (TZEEI 79, \{TZEEI\} 76 and \{TZEEI\} 63) and opposing heterotic groups (TZEEI 95, \{TZEEI\} 78, \{TZEEI\} 79), (TZEEI76, \{TZEEI\} 82) and (TZEEI 63, \{TZEEI\} 58) were identified across environments. \{TZEEI\} 79 had the highest positive \{GCA\} effects for grain yield across environments. Furthermore, \{TZEEI\} 95 × \{TZEEI\} 79 was identified as the potential single-cross tester for the development of three-way and double-cross hybrids. Results of repeatability analysis showed that the managed drought test site, IKDT, was the most repeatable even though it was not very discriminating. In contrast, \{ZAWW\} had high representativeness, discriminating ability and repeatability, indicating that it was the ideal test location. The best extra-early hybrid \{TZEEI\} 79 × \{TZEEI\} 63 under drought stress and \{TZEEI\} 82 × \{TZEEI\} 79 under Striga infestation were comparable in yield to the best open-pollinated early check. \{GGE\} biplot analysis revealed \{TZEEI\} 79 × \{TZEEI\} 76 as the highest yielding and most stable hybrid across environments.

This approach requires the presence of adequate genetic differences in concentrations of grain minerals for improvement. Eight trials involving different sets of tropical maize inbred lines adapted to the lowlands and mid-altitudes were, therefore, evaluated for concentrations of grain Fe, Zn and other minerals in two locations. The combined analyses of variance showed significant variation in concentrations of grain minerals among inbred lines in each trial, which was always greater than the variation caused by locations and line × location interactions. The line × location interaction had no significant effect on concentrations of Fe, Zn, Cu, Mg and P in at least three trials of lowland inbred lines. The line × location interaction also did not significantly affect the concentrations of any minerals, except S, in at least three trials of mid-altitude inbred lines. The best-inbred lines identified from each trial had 32–78% more Fe and 14–180% more Zn than their trial average. The first two principal component axes, which accounted for 55–64% of the total variation in kernel mineral concentrations, stratified the inbred lines in each trial into four groups based on differences in their grain mineral compositions. None of the correlations of Fe and Zn with Mn, Cu, Ca, Mg, K, P and S was significant and negative in the various trials, while the correlations of Fe with Zn were positive and significant (r = 0.55 to r = 0.68, p &lt; 0.0001) in almost all the trials. These results suggest that a genetic potential exists for concurrent improvement of Fe and Zn without lowering the concentrations of other grain minerals in maize. "

The number of eggs laid on the seeds and most other demographic variables increased with increase in insect density (number of females per 40 seeds). Although the same trend was observed with increase in seed density (seeds per 8 females), this was less predictable. However, the number of eggs per seed decreased significantly as seed density increased, but increased with increase in female density. Adult emergence increased significantly with increase in both insect and seed density while the growth index did not vary. Significantly more eggs were laid on the seeds of \{TVu\} 2027 (the resistant control) than on all the other cultivars when 20 or 40 seeds were available to 8 females, or at the lowest insect density (2 females per 40 seeds). However, percentage adult emergence and growth were higher on Ife Brown (susceptible control) than on \{TVu\} 2027 and the two Maiduguri cultivars. Measurements of percentage adult emergence and growth index indicated clear cultivar differences at all seed and insect densities. Also, although the loss in weight of seed increased with increase in insect density and decreased significantly with increase in seed density, meaningful differences in resistance among test cultivars were not always apparent at all densities. Based on these findings, we propose using 40 seeds and 2 pairs of adult beetles in screening cowpea for resistance. In addition, we conclude that % adult emergence, growth index and % weight loss are the most reliable indicators for resistance of cowpea to damage by this insect. The need to standardize experimental procedures used for host plant resistance work on storage pests of cowpea is emphasized. "

It established in 26 African countries, causing a satisfactory reduction in the population density of P. manihoti in most farmers' fields. Four conclusions concerning the possible application of the research results to other biological control projects are discussed. (1) Foreign exploration was intensive and should be maintained at this level in other projects, if necessary at the cost of other activities. (2) In the controversy about the amount of research results needed before first releases are made, an understanding of the proper role of quarantine is essential. Whereas quarantine (preferably outside the continent) guarantees nonnoxiousness of natural enemies, only research in the experimental release sites can determine whether a given natural enemy will be efficient. It was confirmed that the released exotic insects did not affect the diversity of the indigenous fauna. Modalities used in this project for the execution of releases, i.e., always on request by and in collaboration with national programs, are recommended for adoption in future projects. (3) Laboratory and field studies established the scientific basis for quantifying the impact of the pest insect and its control by A. lopezi. This was expressed as reduction in pest population levels and yield loss and gain in revenue. Behavior of adult females in searching and choosing hosts was identified as a better predictor of efficiency of a species in the field than life table studies under controlled temperatures. (4) It is concluded that biological control is the basis for integrated pest management. Other interventions, such as cultural methods or the use of resistant varieties, need to be in harmony with biological control because the impact of natural enemies cannot usually be manipulated by the farmer. To achieve sustainability, the aim is to optimize tritrophic interactions among the plant, the phytophagous pest organisms, and their natural enemies, rather than to maximize the effect of a single intervention.

In the fifth season, psopho contributed 15 kg N ha−1 to maize in the psopho-maize plots that were cropped continuously for five seasons. Maize grown in a psopho live-mulch that had already been established for four cropping seasons contained 36 kg ha−1 more N than maize grown by itself. This positive N contribution came, at least in part, from increases in microbial biomass and in organic matter derived from the cover crop in the form of litter and earthworm casts. These casts represented a supplementary N reserve of 13–21 kg ha−1 under the cover crop. The casts also had a larger biomass C content, and higher percent stress-labile N (PSN), organic C and total N than the corresponding soils. Biomass C and \{PSN\} values were the lowest in soils from bare maize plots, indicating that the live-mulch improved soil nutrient availability and biological properties. "

A two-stage method is developed to determine the Green and Ampt parameter values for soils under different management practices. The first stage is aimed at calculating rainfall infiltration from rainfall and runoff data of small field plots which had different soil surface conditions (e.g. tillage, residue cover and crusting). To determine accurate rainfall infiltration rates from field plots, we employed a water balance model which accounted for depression storage, detention storage as well as surface routing of runoff. The second stage is aimed at evaluating the values of the Green and Ampt infiltration equation parameters by the linear least squares parameter estimation technique. The Green and Ampt parameter values determined were the effective capillary suction at the wetting front and the effective hydraulic conductivity. The results of this study indicated that this procedure is sufficiently sensitive to reflect the effects of tillage, residue cover and crusting on infiltration data. Raindrop impact reduced infiltration rates by crusting the soil surface. However, most of the management systems that left about 30% of residue cover protected the soil from raindrop impact as evidenced by the higher effective hydraulic conductivity. It is concluded that the model developed by Green and Ampt in 1911 satisfactorily fitted the infiltration data obtained from protected and crusted soil profiles. Also, residue cover and crusting greatly influenced the Green and Ampt infiltration parameter values. "

Crop growth in the Alfisols and associated soil groups is further constrained by soil compaction, low soil fertility, high soil temperatures, low soil water retention and available water holding capacity, and low water infiltration rate. Tied ridges, ridges with earthen bunds constructed at right angles to the self-same ridges at intervals of 1–4 m, can alleviate or circumvent the above constraints, and can conserve rainfall received on-site. Water runoff with tied ridging ranges from 0 to 15% of seasonal rainfall, whereas with either open ridging or flat planting 20–45% of seasonal rainfall is lost as runoff. Soil water content is, therefore, greater with tied ridging. Tied ridging also reduces surface bulk density, maintains soil fertility by reducing losses of soil nutrients in surface runoff and improves soil water retention and available water holding capacity. The water infiltration rate in furrows of tied ridged plots is lower than that with flat planting or open ridging. With tied ridging, however, rainwater is retained on site by the ‘ties’, whereas with open ridging or flat planting it is lost as runoff. Tied ridging increases depth of rooting and subsoil root density in maize (Zea mays), millet (Pennisetum americanum) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) in both wet and dry years, and in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) in dry years. Root growth of bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea) is unaffected by tied ridging. Cowpea subsoil root growth is not significantly affected by tied ridging in wet years although root proliferation occurs in the topsoil because of the high sensitivity of cowpea to transient waterlogging. Vegetative growth and dry matter production of maize, millet, cotton, bambara groundnut, cowpea, groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) are increased by tied ridging in both wet and dry years. Grain yields of maize, millet and sorghum are increased by tied ridging, as is lint production of cotton. Cowpea grain yield is increased only in dry years. Grain yields of bambara groundnut are not significantly affected by tied ridging. Yield responses of groundnut to tied ridges are variable. Growth and yield inhibition may occur in waterlogging-sensitive crops such as cowpea and cotton during wet years. In general, greatest yield and growth increases from tied ridging occur in drought-sensitive cereal crop species and cultivars. Furthermore, strong and positive responses to tied ridges may be obtained consistently over a long period of time only in upland environments where long- and short-term droughts are frequent, soil compaction and temperatures are high, and available water-holding capacity and water infiltration rates are low.

Twenty banana plots were visited within 6 hills/valleys at each of the three toposequence positions: valley bottom, mid-slope and crest. Important variability in plant growth, nutrition and soil properties was observed within the toposequence. Significantly better plant growth (height and girth) was observed in the valley bottoms, where banana bunch weight was 1.7–3.4 kg higher (although not significant) than at upper toposequence positions. Best plant growth was observed in valley bottoms in contrast to the highest N and K foliar deficiencies in this position. Plants in the valley bottoms had higher foliar Ca and Mg, and K compared to those in the crest. Plants in the mid-slope had greater percentage of dead roots (19.1%), compared to the plants in the valley bottoms (12.3%) and the crest (14.2%). Soils in the valley bottoms were deeper, sandier, with lower organic matter, lower N, and K compared to the soils at higher toposequence. Nematodes likely play a key role in banana root damage, however, their effect appear to be in relation to various soil factors at each position. The abundance of Pratylenchus goodeyi had generally limited impact on banana yields in fields having less than 5% slope (crest and valley bottom) where soil conditions were more optimal for root growth. However, in the presence of increased run-off on steeper middle slopes, root death was increased even under moderate pressure from P. goodeyi. "

The G to T transversion at the third position of codon 249 (AGG) of the \{TP53\} gene, substituting arginine to serine, is the most common aflatoxin-induced mutation linked to HCC. This study examined mutations in \{TP53\} by PCR-RFLP analysis and by measurement of an aflatoxin-albumin adduct as a biomarker for human exposure of aflatoxin \{B1\} by indirect-competitive ELISA, in samples collected from healthy controls as well as patients with hepatitis in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India. A total of 238 blood samples were analyzed the presence of the G to T mutation. Eighteen of these samples were from HBV-positive subjects, 112 of these were from subjects who had HBV-induced liver cirrhosis, and 108 samples were taken from subjects without \{HBV\} infection or liver cirrhosis (control group). The G to T mutation was detected in 10 samples, 8 of which were from subjects positive to both \{HBV\} and aflatoxin-albumin adduct in blood (p = 0.07); whilst two were from individuals who were HBV-negative, but positive for the aflatoxin-albumin adduct (p = 0.14).

The concentration of aflatoxin-albumin adduct ranged from 2.5 to 667 pg/mg albumin.

Our objective was to determine whether selection before backcross would lead to more progenies with both high yield and acceptable levels of agronomic performance than direct backcross without selection. To test the feasibility of the proposed approach, we conducted parallel experiments in which two exotic sorghum accessions were crossed to two adapted sorghum parents and further backcrossing was conducted with either \{F1\} or selected \{F2\} plants. Fifty random \{S1\} families were evaluated in three test environments. Although selection before backcross resulted in a higher frequency of families with maturity equal to or earlier than those of the adapted parents, no consistent changes in grain yield and plant height were observed between populations with and without selection. Similar results were found with either an inbred or a population as the recurrent parents. Given these findings and the extra generation required, we do not recommend selection before backcross in the process of introgression of exotic germplasm. "

Using \{PD\} as an index of forage quality, the \{MPTS\} were classified into high, medium and low groups. The b and \{PD\} in \{BC\} during the dry season were significantly higher than in \{WS\} and WG. The results suggested the existence of intraspecies and interspecies variation in rumen degradation characteristics of \{DM\} of the \{MPTS\} in BC, \{WS\} and WG.

The cumulative effect of heavy damage sustained over several crop cycles resulted in greater reduction in bunch weight than that inflicted by similar levels of damage in a single cycle.

Five \{CMD\} cassava clones were planted in a randomized complete block design with two level of fertilizer treatments (0 and 160 kg nitrogen/ha) with two replications while harvesting was done 12 months after planting. Composite flour was produced at a ratio of 10/90 (cassava/wheat flour, w/w). The oven spring, specific volume, crumb texture (softness) and crumb moisture of loaves ranged from −0.57 to 0.63 cm, 4.37 to 6.85 cm3/g, 18.4 to 29.4 mm and 31.40% to 34.70%, respectively.

The first is concerned with the refinement of the system and the assessment of its relevance and acceptability to farmers while the second is for the collection of technical and productivity data under farm conditions. Further, because the former type of trial is concerned with the evolution and definition of the system, it must be implemented at an early stage, as part of the development of the technology, and must precede the collection of technical data. Feedback from both types of trial is essential to ensure the relevance of on-station research. The close involvement of extension is required for the successful implementation of this approach. "

In this paper previous research is reviewed to evaluate the economic and ecological constraints to animal draft cultivation. Results of past studies have shown that the animal-drawn plow is only profitable at higher intensities of farming induced by population growth and better market access. Utilization and use of animal-driven implements will, however, be low in areas characterized by light soils (arid zones) or areas prone to erosion, or with a short growing season. Other constraints on the profitable use of animal draft are farmers' characteristics and policy factors. Farm and family size, the farmer's experience and types of equipment are shown to play important roles. One factor often ignored is the opportunity cost of labor and capital during off-farm activities. Utilization of animal traction implies tending costs. If, however, the cost of maintaining the animal outside the peak season reduces off-farm income opportunities, farmers are not likely to make a profitable use of the plow. Other opportunities available to the farmer (e.g. beef production when beef prices are high) are likely to have a negative impact on utilization of oxen cultivation. Rural-urban dualism which characterizes African agriculture owing to low agricultural productivity and high wages in cities, is likely to be an important constraint. "

Current emphasis on increasing resilience to climate change and reducing agricultural greenhouse gasses (GHG) emissions strengthens the support for sustainable agricultural production. In fact, reducing losses in soil fertility, reclaiming degraded lands, and promoting synergistic interaction between crop production and forests are generally seen as good climate change policies. In order for decision-makers to develop long-term policies that address these issues, they must have tools at their disposal that evaluate trade-offs, opportunities, and repercussions of the options considered. In this paper, the authors combine and reconcile the output of three models widely accessible to the public to analyze the impacts of policies that target emission reduction in the agricultural sector. We present an application to Colombia which reveals the importance of considering the full scope of interactions among the various land uses. Results indicate that investments in increasing the efficiency and productivity of the livestock sector and reducing land allocated to pasture are preferable to policies that target deforestation alone or target a reduction of emissions in crop production. Investments in livestock productivity and land-carrying capacity would reduce deforestation and provide sufficient gains in carbon stock to offset greater emissions from increased crop production while generating higher revenues.

The present study investigated the efficacy of F. oxysporum f. sp. strigae (Foxy 2) for S. hermonthica management in Western Kenya. Research was conducted in post-entry quarantine (PEQ) facilities at Alupe, Busia, Homabay, Kibos and Siaya field stations for two seasons. Each \{PEQ\} was a split-plot, with 4 main blocks each having 6 treatment subplots. The treatments included seeds of two S. hermonthica-susceptible maize varieties, either coated with Foxy 2 using gum Arabic, gum Arabic alone, or left untreated. Data was collected over seven sampling periods on S. hermonthica population per plant, percentage of those that were wilting, and the severity of wilting. Maize plant growth parameters assessed included duration to 50% anthesis and 50% silking, plant height, number of leaves, stover and cob weights, and maize yield per hectare. Statistical analysis was done using \{SAS\} 9.1 software. Data on S. hermonthica population were analyzed by χ2-test using Proc Genmod (Poisson); while the other parameters were analyzed by Proc Mixed using study location, season and blocks as random effects, and the sampling periods as repeated effects. All the assessed parameters were similar between plants grown from seeds inoculated with F. oxysporum f. sp. strigae (Foxy 2), those coated with gum Arabic, and the ones without any coating. These parameters were also not different between the maize varieties. There are varying reasons for the disparities between results on F. oxysporum f. sp. strigae (Foxy 2) obtained in this Kenyan study, and those from researches outside this country. In conclusion, F. oxysporum f. sp. strigae strain Foxy 2 is predominantly safe on maize growth, but its efficacy in controlling S. hermonthica was not evident on the tested Kenyan soils. "

The two Fusarium species most commonly isolated from maize were Fusarium verticillioides (68%) and Fusarium proliferatum (31%). Atypical isolates of F. verticillioides with some characteristics of Fusarium andiyazi but apparently closer to F. verticillioides, because the isolates were all high fumonisin producers, were also found only on preharvest maize. Study of F. verticillioides strains showed the presence of extremely high fumonisin producers in Benin with total fumonisin levels ranging from 8240 to 16,690 mg/kg. Apart from 2002–2003, Fusarium occurrence was not significantly different from one zone to another, although a slight decrease was observed from south, humid, to north, drier. Fusarium occurrence varied somewhat from one season to another. It significantly decreased over the 6 months of storage. Widespread fumonisin occurrence in maize was observed. Most of the maize samples collected were found positive for fumonisin with levels ranging from not detected to 12 mg/kg in 1999–2000, 6.7 mg/kg in 2000–2001 and 6.1 mg/kg in 2002–2003.

The specificity of the AFLP-marker to Fos was confirmed on basis of comparison of Fusarium isolates of differing relatedness to Fos. These consisted of 40 Fos, 17 Fusarium spp. and 68 F. oxysporum isolates retrieved from tropical and temperate ecosystems. The robustness of the AFLP-marker for monitoring Fos was validated in a controlled incubation experiment. In this experiment, we inoculated the known Fos-BCA “Foxy-2” as model organism via seed coating (1.15 * 105 colony forming units per seed) of a tropical maize (Zea mays L.) variety to a tropical clayey (Humic Nitisol) and a sandy (Ferric Alisol) soil, both with no indigenous Fos infestation. The proliferation of “Foxy-2” was followed at 14, 28 and 42 days after start of experiment by Fos-specific quantitative \{PCR\} using the AFLP-marker. Moreover, the experimental set-up considered two additional factors: (1) presence of S. hermonthica, and (2) application of Tithonia diversifolia residues as nitrogen-rich resource for supporting “Foxy-2” proliferation. The explicit AFLP-marker was appropriate to reveal that soil type and organic resource availability exhibited distinct effects on abundance of inoculated “Foxy-2”. Negative \{PCR\} signals, which confirmed the Fos-specificity of the developed AFLP-marker, were retrieved from control soils not inoculated with “Foxy-2”. Hence, we verified the applicability of the explicit AFLP-marker for Fos in two soils, but recommend additional broad scale field studies to approve its suitability as Fos monitoring tool for differently managed soils in contrasting tropical agro-ecological zones.

The study employed the use of Land Degradation Sampling Framework (LDSF) to characterize the sites. \{LDSF\} a spatially stratified, random sampling design framework consisting of 10 km × 10 km blocks and clusters of plots. The study broadly identified and classified the indicators and attributes of land degradation into soil and site stability, hydrologic function and biotic integrity. Assessment of general vegetation structure showed that over 70% of the land was under cropland with forests accounting for 8% of the area. Sheet erosion was the major form of soil loss. High variability was observed for the soil properties and this can be due to both inherent soil characteristics as well as land management practices. There was distinct variation in the soil properties between the topsoil (0–20 cm) and the subsoil (20–30 cm) with the topsoil having higher values for most of the parameters compared to the subsoil. Using coefficient of variation (CV) as criteria for expressing variability, Ca, TON, Mg, \{SOC\} and silt were most variable soil properties for the 0–20 cm depth. Moderate variability (CV 0.15–0.35) was observed for CEC, P, K and clay while Na, Sand and pH had the least variability (CV &lt; 0.15). For the subsoil (20–30 cm), Ca, Mg and silt were the most variable. About 94% of the farms sampled were recorded to have very strongly acidic soil levels (pH 4.5–5.5) while 6% of the farms had moderately acidic soil levels (pH 5.6–6.0). Over 55% of the farms had low (&lt; 2%) total organic carbon levels and this varied with land use. Soils with \{SOM\} below this ‘critical level’ are at a threat of degradation if not well managed. The principal component analysis (PCA) identified three main explanatory factors for soil variability: ‘soil fertility potential’, ‘soil physical properties’ and ‘available P’. Improving productivity of land therefore calls for the adoption of integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) options as a strategy to ensuring nutrient availability while at the same time building the natural nutrient reserve through soil organic matter build up.

The possibility that there is a genetic basis for this apparent variation was investigated in a series of feeding experiments with small ruminants. The same five provenances of G. sepium (three high-yielding provenances from the native range, plus two land races locally considered to be of high and low acceptability, respectively) were planted at sites in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Costa Rica, Colombia and Nigeria. They were compared in terms of their relative acceptability and their effects on intake, live weight gain, and in vivo and in sacco dry matter disappearance. In preference tests, both sheep and goats could distinguish between provenances, and displayed a clear preference for local material (to which they had previous exposure). In seven trials where each animal received a single provenance, there was a significant effect of provenance on total intake in only one case, but this was not reflected in any significant variation in live weight gain or in vivo digestibility at any of the sites. Provenance differences in sacco dry matter disappearance were apparent at 24 and 48 h, but the differences were not consistent across sites. The findings of the study suggest that superior genetic material of G. sepium can be selected for fodder on the basis of growth and yield only, since there appears to be much greater within-species variation in yield than in nutritive value.

We explored the spatial refuge used by one of the most important coconut pests, the coconut mite Aceria guerreronis Keifer (Eriophyidae). Based on the assumption that A. guerreronis shifted its habitat under the perianth of coconut to avoid competition and/or escape from predation we investigated the fine scale spatial distribution of A. guerreronis and associated competitors and predators. Coconut fruits were sectioned and discrete chambers identified under the perianth. A. guerreronis was present on 92% of fruits and by far the most abundant mite under the perianth. It preferentially resided in the tightest chambers to the fruit surface. Another herbivore, Steneotarsonemus furcatus De Leon (Tarsonemidae) was found on ∼30% of fruits most of which were simultaneously occupied by A. guerreronis. Neoseiulus baraki Athias-Henriot (Phytoseiidae) was the predominant predatory mite (∼35% of fruits) followed by Proctolaelaps bickleyi Bram (Ascidae) (∼7% of fruits). A. guerreronis, S. furcatus and N. baraki showed a slightly different but more similar repartition among chambers under the perianth than P. bickleyi.

Estimates suggest that about 10 million ha of forest may have been lost in the 20th Century, and around 80% of the original forest area is now an agriculture-forest mosaic. These highly modified forests provide food, fuel, fibre and a range of ecosystem services for over 200 million people. As a consequence, the future of biodiversity in the region is intimately linked with the lives and livelihoods of local people. The available evidence suggests that forest loss and degradation has been caused primarily by agricultural expansion, sometimes facilitated by other human activities such as wood extraction. This expansion is a response to the demand generated by a growing and increasingly urbanised human population, but has been exacerbated by small increases in crop yields over recent decades. We synthesize and review our state of knowledge on the value of human-modified habitats for forest biodiversity in the region. Data on biodiversity are patchy, but we show that across plant, invertebrate and vertebrate groups, there is a significant loss of forest species as tree cover is reduced and vegetation structure simplified. Agricultural expansion clearly causes significant local biodiversity loss. We argue that replicated landscape-scale studies are now needed that describe changes across a range of biodiversity groups (above and below ground) in relation to land-use and landscape context to address knowledge gaps and biases. Such descriptive studies need to be complemented by a deeper understanding of the causes of species turnover patterns, together with work on the consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem function and services. Biodiversity conservation in the region is becoming increasingly embedded within a more multi-functional view of agriculture-forest mosaics that attempts to recognise and value the range of services provided by tree cover and other land-uses. This relatively new perspective has the potential, at least in principle, to re-shape the drivers of land-use change because tree cover can generate additional revenue through carbon trading or certification schemes. It will become clearer over the coming decades whether this potential can be realised, but the implications for biodiversity conservation in the region are potentially profound. The socio-economic processes that have driven forest loss and degradation in West Africa are having an increasing impact on the relatively undisturbed rainforest of the Congo Basin. We conclude by pointing out that while West African forest landscapes are a potent reminder of what might happen in Central Africa in the near future, they also provide insights for developing policies and practice that might avoid comparable levels of forest loss and degradation.

In this paper we implement the Rapid Appraisal of Agricultural Innovation Systems (RAAIS) as a diagnostic tool to identify specific and generic entry points for innovations to address parasitic weeds in rain-fed rice production in Tanzania. Data were gathered across three study sites in Tanzania where parasitic weeds are eminent (Kyela, Songea Rural and Morogoro Rural districts). The results demonstrate that in Tanzania, weeds in general and parasitic weeds in particular receive little attention in agricultural research, training and education curricula. Crop protection policies mainly focus on the control of (insect) pest and diseases and there is relatively little attention for weed prevention, which is essential for addressing parasitic weed problems effectively. Specific entry points for innovation include increasing awareness of parasitic weed problems among farmers, extension and crop protection officers and policymakers. In regions where awareness is relatively high, participatory research approaches can provide a basis for developing locally adapted parasitic weed management strategies. Generic entry points for innovation include enhanced collaboration and interaction between stakeholders across different levels, for example in multi-stakeholder platforms. This can provide the basis for developing and implementing coherent policy and development strategies to address structural constraints in the agricultural system, including the promotion of clean local seed systems, investments in physical and knowledge infrastructure development, adequate backstopping of agricultural extension officers, agribusiness training for farmers, quality control of agricultural inputs, timely access to agricultural inputs, and improved access to markets for farmers. Together the specific and generic entry points can strengthen the innovation capacity of Tanzania's agricultural system to address parasitic weed problems, as well as other complex agricultural problems.

Inefficient cooking techniques consume large amounts of fuel and create indoor pollution, with negative health impacts particularly among women and small children. Efficient cooking stoves can potentially save fuel and reduce the health risks of smoke in the kitchen. This study compared the ease of use, energy consumption, fuel use efficiency and gas and particle emissions of a small-scale gasifier cooking stove with that of a traditional three-stone stove and an improved Hifadhi stove in a smallholder farming setting in Kenya. This was done by participatory evaluation of these cooking techniques by women on smallholder farms, assessing fuel consumption, time used in cooking and indoor air concentrations of carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter. It was found that compared with traditional and improved cooking stoves, the gasifier domestic cooking system saved 27–40% of fuel, reduced cooking time by 19–23% and reduced emissions by 40–90%. Thus the gasifier system has potential to alleviate energy and time poverty among small-scale farmers, while improving kitchen air quality. These new findings can assist in development of cleaner biomass cooking technologies in developing countries. Women who cooked using the gasifier preferred it to current cooking practices due to perceived benefits. Thus the gasifier is appropriate for rural areas; it constitutes a cleaner cooking system that saves fuel, produces charcoal for another round of cooking, cooks rapidly, and reduces indoor air pollution from cooking with biomass fuel. However, there is a need to improve the design to make it more stable and safer. "

Six cowpea fields were established in three agroecological zones over a 3-year period. The abundance of both larvae and adults of M. sjostedti was assessed on plants grown from (1) seeds co-inoculated at sowing with arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) and rhizobia (mycorrhiza/rhizobia); (2) non-inoculated seeds and plants sprayed three times with M. anisopliae (Metarhizium); (3) seeds co-inoculated at sowing with \{AMF\} and rhizobia and plants sprayed three times with M. anisopliae (mycorrhiza/rhizobia/Metarhizium); (4) non-inoculated seeds and plants sprayed three times with the synthetic insecticide deltamethrin; and compared with (5) a control consisting of non-inoculated seeds and unsprayed plants. Results indicate that thrips infestation was associated with the flowering cycle and was higher in the first than in the second cropping season in most agroecological zones. In general, M. sjostedti larval and adult counts were significantly higher (P&lt;0.01) in the control than in other treatments. Compared with the control, treatment insecticide obtained the highest reduction of adults (range 52–95%) and larvae thrips population (64–97%), followed by mycorrhiza/rhizobia/Metarhizium (29–56%) and (29–49%), mycorrhiza/rhizobia (31–49%) and (24–52%), and Metarhizium (25–58%) and (5–52%), respectively. In all of the above treatments, the reduction of thrips led to a subsequent increase of seed yield, although it was not always significant. Apart from two cases (Ngaoundéré 2000 and Nkolbisson 1999), biological treatments (Metarhizium, mycorrhiza/rhizobia and mycorrhiza/rhizobia/Metarhizium) consistently reduced grain yield loss in the trials compared with the control at Ngaoundéré in 1999 and Maroua 2001.

DC. cv.-group utilis) is widely promoted in tropical and sub-tropical regions as a green manure cover crop that can reduce weed growth and soil erosion and enhance soil fertility. To provide these benefits, the crop must attain rapid ground cover and develop substantial aboveground biomass. To assist biophysical targeting of the crop to environments that can provide adequate growth conditions, the \{CROPGRO\} model was adapted to simulate velvet bean growth and development. This paper evaluates the performance of the model for phenology, growth, senescence and N accumulation for multiple locations that represent a range of environmental and agronomic management scenarios. Vegetative development, as described by main stem leaf appearance rate, varied linearly with thermal time. Time to flowering showed departures from the linear photoperiod response used in the model. Additional research is required to determine whether the crop is influenced by factors besides photoperiod and air temperature, especially water and nutrient deficits. The linear response to photoperiod did, however, provide reasonable values for partitioning to vegetative, reproductive and senesced materials. Simulation of nitrogen concentration for various plant components matched observed data. Sensitivity analyses evaluating the ability of the crop to provide ground cover, intercept light and develop adequate growth for soil protection and weed suppression indicated that a mean temperature of over 22 °C and a soil moisture holding capacity of at least 100 mm are required. The \{CROPGRO\} model proved to be a reliable decision support tool for guiding analyses of velvet bean response to crop management and environmental conditions. Further research, however, is warranted to improve its predictive capability, especially for phenology. "

The number of emerged, surviving and reproducing Striga plants were analyzed on maize and sorghum and showed a large variability among fields. Differences among fields were larger for maize than for sorghum and were mainly due to differences in crop management practices being used by farmers. The number of newly produced Striga seed at the end of the season varied between 0 and 109,000 seed m−2 and proved to be largely independent of the initial soil seed bank. Large differences were found in the contribution of sorghum and maize in mixed cropping systems to the overall reproduction of Striga. Sorghum is the major host for Striga reproduction. In an area with intensified maize-cropping, maize functions as a Striga-suppressive crop while in an area with extensive crop management maize contributes significantly to Striga reproduction. The analysis of the population dynamics of the parasite shows the importance of a farming systems approach to pest management and to the development of sustainable cropping systems for the savannas.

This article provides the state of the art on \{DH\} technology including the induction and identification of haploids, what factors influence haploid induction, molecular basis of microspore embryogenesis, the genetics underpinnings of haploid induction and its use in plant breeding, particularly to fix traits and unlock genetic variation. Both in vitro and in vivo methods have been used to induce haploids that are thereafter chromosome doubled to produce DH. Various heritable factors contribute to the successful induction of haploids, whose genetics is that of a quantitative trait. Genomic regions associated with in vitro and in vivo \{DH\} production were noted in various crops with the aid of \{DNA\} markers. It seems that \{F2\} plants are the most suitable for the induction of \{DH\} lines than \{F1\} plants. Identifying putative haploids is a key issue in haploid breeding. \{DH\} technology in Brassicas and cereals, such as barley, maize, rice, rye and wheat, has been improved and used routinely in cultivar development, while in other food staples such as pulses and root crops the technology has not reached to the stage leading to its application in plant breeding. The centromere-mediated haploid induction system has been used in Arabidopsis, but not yet in crops. Most food staples are derived from genomic resources-rich crops, including those with sequenced reference genomes. The integration of genomic resources with \{DH\} technology provides new opportunities for the improving selection methods, maximizing selection gains and accelerate cultivar development. Marker-aided breeding and \{DH\} technology have been used to improve host plant resistance in barley, rice, and wheat. Multinational seed companies are using \{DH\} technology in large-scale production of inbred lines for further development of hybrid cultivars, particularly in maize. The public sector provides support to national programs or small-medium private seed for the exploitation of \{DH\} technology in plant breeding. "

During periods of low soil-moisture content, differences in the maximum soil temperatures at these two sites decreased. Soil temperatures measured 18 months after burning (during the rainy season) were nearly similar at the two sites. "

Effect of vegetation-burning on soil properties and crop yields, however, has received limited attention. Two months after clearing a rainforest by the shear-blade method, dry-biomass was windrowed (4 windrows per plot) and burnt. Changes in soil properties, evaporation and crop productivity in windrows (burnt area) one year after burning the felled biomass were investigated. There were considerable increases in the amounts of exchangeable cations in the top 30-cm soil layer after burning. Consequently, soil pH increased from 5.7 to 7.0 in the 0–10-cm layer, from 5.6 to 6.5 in the 10–20-cm layer, and from 5.4 to 5.9 in the 20–30-cm layer. Burning and conversion of biomass to ash increased the availability of major nutrient elements. Bulk density was lower in the burnt area. The equilibrium infiltration rate was 106 and 13 cm h−1 in the burnt and unburnt areas, respectively. The rate of water evaporation and, thus, cumulative evaporation was higher from the burnt area. Rice (cultivar UPL-Ri-5) and plantain yielded significantly more in the burnt compared with the unburnt sites. Corn and cassava also yielded more in the burnt area, though differences were not significant. Growth and yield of cowpea was not affected. The results indicated that biomass should not be burnt in windrows in order to avoid introducing fertility variation in otherwise uniform fields. "

Mixed cropping had limited effect on major insects and natural enemies. Colonies of Aphis craccivora were significantly smaller and there were more adults of Maruca vitrata in crop mixtures than in monocultures. However, flower and raceme infestation by larval M. vitrata, Megalurothrips sjostedti, and Sericothrips sp. were similar in crop mixtures and monocultures. Empoasca sp. populations and seedling infestation by beanfly Ophiomyia phaseoli were also similar in mixtures and monocultures as well as pod damage by M. vitrata and populations of Clavigralla tomentosicollis. Parasitization rates of M. vitrata, C. tomentosicollis and O. phaseoli and predator–prey ratios of spiders and Orius sp. were similar across cropping systems. Host-plant resistance in \{TVnu\} 72 drastically reduced insect populations and damage. Grain yield per hill was high in cowpea IT86D-715 and was not affected by intercropping with millet. Grain yield of \{TVnu\} 72 was poor and reflected the low yield potential of this accession. Host-plant resistance is an effective means of controlling insect pest damage in cowpea and there is no evidence that high levels of resistance reduced natural biological control. "

The experiment was designed as a split-plot with three replications. Nicosulfuron was applied 2 weeks after planting maize. Hoe weeded and unweeded treatments were controls. In both years, 7 weeks after treatment, the unweeded control had lower maize leaf area index (LAI) (19% at Ijaye and 25% at Ilorin) than the weeded control. Maize \{LAI\} was highest in plots that received 35 g a.i./ha of nicosulfuron at Ijaye and the weeded control at Ilorin in both years. All plots that received nicosulfuron had significantly higher maize grain yield than the unweeded control at both locations in both years.

Traditionally, sucker derived planting materials have been used to establish banana plantations but there is a risk of transmitting pests such as plant-parasitic nematodes with untreated suckers. Tissue cultured banana plants are pest-free and widely grown in commercial dessert banana plantations but are not common agricultural practice under East African conditions. This study aimed at evaluating the agronomic performance and nematode infestation levels of sucker-derived and tissue cultured planting material of the East African highland cooking banana cultivar Nabusa (Musa spp., genome group AAA-EA) over five crop cycles. A field trial was conducted in Central Uganda using tissue culture plants, untreated suckers, pared suckers or pared and hot water treated suckers. All plants were cultivated under mulched or non-mulched conditions to represent high or low input systems, respectively. Mulch in general improved agronomic performance of banana. Type of planting material also influenced plant growth and yield. Tissue culture plants developed faster and yielded higher during the first crop cycle than sucker-derived material but not thereafter. Plant height and bunch weight of untreated suckers was inferior to all other planting material from the third crop cycle onwards. All mulched plants flowered earlier in all crop cycles. Duration from planting to the first harvest was less for tissue-cultured plants, but planting material had no influence on days to harvest from the third crop cycle onwards. Nematode densities were higher in roots from plants grown from untreated suckers than all other planting material, with Radopholus similis consistently recovered in greater densities than Helicotylenchus multicinctus across treatments. Mulching had no influence on nematode densities, root necrosis, number of root base lesions or number of dead roots. Nematode associated damage was higher in plants from untreated suckers but did not differ among tissue-cultured and pared and hot water treated or pared sucker plants. This study demonstrates the benefits of using clean planting material for cooking banana over five consecutive crop cycles and confirms the beneficial effects of mulching. In order to achieve high banana yields over several crop cycles, clean planting material needs to be supported by the application of mulch. However, this study shows that the application of mulch will not offset the detrimental effects of plant parasitic nematode-infected sucker planting material. "

This study examines the effect of socio-economic factors on the likelihood of using chemical fertilizer and pesticide in peri-urban lowland agricultural systems in Cameroon. Rather than the univariate probit model which is commonly used, the bivariate probit model is employed to take account of the correlation between the disturbances. Results generally indicate that lowland farmers who are more highly educated, those with temporary land rights and those whose fields are more distant from the homestead are more likely to use chemical fertilizer. In the same way, lowland male farmers, those who have contact with extension, those who have temporary land rights or those practising continuous cropping are more likely to use chemical pesticides.

Overall, the results show that increasing insect density resulted in a corresponding increase in damage to the crop (measured as abscission of fruiting bodies and as damage to pods and seeds). Yield reduction was approximately proportional to the bug population when low, with highly significant correlation coefficients. Damage to the crop and yield reduction were more drastic when infestation was made during flowering as opposed to infestation at podding; although there was some compensation of damage to fruiting bodies during the former growth phase, this was not sustained with increasing pest density. Suggested pest densities at which control measures should be initiated are two insects (fourth instar and over) per 10 plants at flowering and four insects at podding. Further studies on damage thresholds in multiple pest scenarios are suggested. "

The albumin fraction was also shown to contain both trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors through enzyme inhibitor assays. Western analysis using antibodies, raised against a representative, 23 kDa polypeptide, indicated that this protein species accumulates exclusively during seed development, suggesting a role in seed storage. Haemagglutination assays using rabbit erythrocytes failed to detect the presence of lectins. The results are discussed within the context of the role of lectins and protease inhibitors in storage and plant defence. The findings are also relevant in view of the toxic and antimetabolic effects of these proteins, which determine the acceptability and adoption of velvet beans as animal and human feed. "

abstract = "The Sahelian countries have been much more successful attaining higher yields of export crops, including cotton and peanuts, than with increasing yields of their cereals and other food crops. One principal explanation has been the poor economic and agricultural policy support historically given to food crops. Now this is being changed with structural adjustments, including the 1994 devaluation of the CFA. Intensive cereal production became more profitable with a lag after devaluation. In southern Mali, even highly risk-averse farmers will adopt intensive sorghum technologies, according to risk programming results. Credit can be generated internally for this activity by selling some of the livestock. Returns were very high for this intensification but its further expansion would require more internal liquidity or the expansion of credit in order to increase purchases of inorganic fertilizers. "

It has been recognized for its success in producing scientific outputs and real world impacts and as a pioneer in integrated natural resource management (iNRM). Until now, there has been little understanding of the reasons for its success in integrating different perspectives and ways of working. To fill this gap, an on-line consultation involving \{ASB\} researchers was structured following an analytical framework developed by the Initiative on Science and Technology for Sustainability. The structure of the presentation of major results presented in this article also follows that framework, which includes four dimensions of integration (disciplinary, functional, spatial/temporal, and knowledge) and linked challenges of institutional learning and adaptation, fostering appropriate participation, and managing resource and capacity constraints. To lay the foundations for interpreting these insights and to motivate the study, introductory sections present qualitative evidence regarding organizational learning within the consortium (using research hypotheses as indicators) and success in producing integrated results (using a selection of research results as evidence). This report on ASB's experience in integrative science and organizational learning is intended to advance understanding of the scope and limits of a complex international consortium to integrate activities across disciplines, organizations, scales and knowledge systems in order to produce knowledge and policy relevant outputs. ASB's processes and structures have weaknesses as well as strengths. And while there almost certainly are a range of effective alternative approaches to integrative science, the insights from ASB's experience documented in these online discussions could be of interest to other geographically dispersed teams, especially those working on environment and development issues. Moreover, from a methodological perspective, the use of information technology reported in this article proved to be an effective means of triangulating the perceptions of geographically dispersed researchers. In doing so, this web-based consultation provided a medium for reflection by a large ‘virtual team’ on whether words about integration are translated into practice, at least as perceived and self-reported by the scientists who participated. These techniques could be employed for process documentation by other dispersed teams, thereby adding to the stock of information on what works (and what does not) in efforts to put integrative science into practice on a significant scale.

The ‘One cow per poor family’ programme was initiated in Rwanda as part of a poverty alleviation strategy, aiming to increase the livestock population. A four month-study was conducted in Umurera village (Simbi sector), southern Rwanda with the objectives to (1) quantify the on-farm fodder availability, (2) quantify the amount and quality of fodder on offer to livestock, (3) analyse potential fodder availability under five future scenarios and (4) evaluate the implications and feasibility of the programme. Farmers’ surveys, measurements of field sizes, together with daily measurements of fodder on offer, milk production and fodder refusals were conducted. Feeds used were diverse, comprising grasses (53%), banana plant parts (25%), residues of several crops (9%) and other plants (10%). Herbs collected from valley-bottoms, uncultivated grasses and crop residues were predominant fodder types on poorer (Resource group 1 – RG1) farms while Pennisetum and Calliandra were predominant fodder types for moderate (RG2) and better resource endowed (RG3) farms. The amount of fodder on offer for cattle ranged from 20 to 179 kg fresh weight animal−1 day−1 (9–47 kg DM). The milk yield ranged between 1.3 and 4.6 L day−1. The amount of Pennisetum and Calliandra fodder available decreased in the dry season with a concomitant increase in reliance on banana leaves and pseudo-stems. The poorest farmers (RG1) were not able to feed a local cow under all scenarios. \{RG2\} farmers can sustain a local cow during both seasons when using all possible fodder resources, but can sustain a European cow under just two scenarios during the rainy season. \{RG3\} farmers can feed a European cow during the rainy season under all scenarios and for four scenarios during the dry season. We conclude that the ‘One cow per poor family’ programme needs to be adjusted to increase its effectiveness. Our main recommendations are to shift to livestock that require less fodder, for example local cattle or small ruminants such as goats. "

However, few studies have assessed the field performance of this fungus for biological control of pests and diseases in banana. Further to greenhouse assessment, studies were carried out to evaluate the performance of F. oxysporum strains against plant-parasitic nematodes on banana (Musa sp., cv. Giant Cavendish and cv. Grand Nain) in the field using tissue-cultured plants. Plants were inoculated separately with one of three strains (V5W2, Eny 7.11o and Emb 2.4o) before being inoculated with Pratylenchus goodeyi and Helicotylenchus multicinctus in an on-station trial and in an on-farm trial planted in a field naturally infested with the same nematodes. All three endophytic strains significantly suppressed P. goodeyi and H. multicinctus densities and damage in the field. On-station, nematode population densities were reduced by &gt;45% in endophyte-inoculated plants compared to non-inoculated plants, while percentage root necrosis was reduced by &gt;20%. Similarly, on-farm, nematode damage to roots and densities were also significantly lower in endophyte-inoculated plants compared with control plants. Significantly improved yields were observed for plants inoculated with endophytes when compared to the control plants, with inoculation with strains Emb 2.4o and \{V5W2\} resulting in up to 35% and 36% increased banana yields, respectively, for the on-station trial. For the on-farm trial, up to 20% increase in yields were observed for strain Eny 7.11o compared to control plants. This study provides the first report from the field in Africa on the reduction of nematode populations and damage, and the increase in banana production by fungal endophytes. The study shows that endophytes have potential to enhance yields of tissue-cultured banana plants and protect them against pests. "

In 1993, 13 leguminous cover crops (Aeschynomene histrix, Centrosema brasilianum, Centrosema pascuorum, Chamaecrista rotundifolia, Cajanus cajan, Crotalaria verrucosa, Crotalaria ochroleuca, Lablab purpureus, Mucuna pruriens, Psophocarpus palustris, Pseudovigna argentea, Pueraria phaseoloides and Stylosanthes hamata) were planted in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Maize and natural fallow (mainly Chromolaena odorata and Imperata cylindrica) were included as comparisons. Only six of the legumes (A. histrix, C. pascuorum, C. cajan, C. ochroleuca, M. pruriens, and P. phaseoloides) were included in the measurements in the 1994 new plots. Soil water suctions at various stages of legume growth were measured at daily or weekly intervals (depending on the frequency of rainfall events) using tensiometers installed at 0–15 and 15–30 cm soil depths. Soil water suctions exceeding 10 kPa (theoretical field capacity) were observed mainly between 6 and 12 weeks after planting (WAP), and by 20 \{WAP\} when cover crops had matured and rainfall frequency was very low. Soil water suctions were significantly related (r2&gt;0.80) to dry matter between 8 and 10 WAP. The studied cover crops were classified in three groups which can be used as a guide for choosing the legumes in tropical farming systems. Soil water depletion was markedly influenced by growth characteristics of legumes and distribution of rainfall during the rainy season. Leguminous cover crops conserved soil water after their growth needs were satisfied. "

In screen house experiments, cowpea was always selected over soybean, both by parental adults and \{F1\} larvae, regardless of the larval feeding history. The number of adult moths in the various cowpea and soybean crop combinations was a function of the proportion planted to cowpea; moth distribution was generally unaffected by the area cropped with soybean. The choice of host by adult R. dentipes was also unaffected by the nutritional history of the nymphs. Bug distribution on the two crops varied with crop phenologies; distribution in plots of different cowpea:soybean ratios was a function of the proportion of cowpea in that treatment only when podding occurred earlier on cowpea.

abstract = "In banana on-farm studies in the East African Highlands, quantification of production has been difficult because plants are at different stages of development at any given time. Production is continuous and quantification would therefore require permanent presence of an observer. Hence, most on-farm surveys have resorted to estimations from farmers or ‘experts’ through recall or visual qualitative observations. These methods are highly inaccurate. This study aims to develop and validate allometric relationships for quantitative estimation of bunch weights, based on rapid, inexpensive and non-destructive methods of data collection that take into consideration genotypic, spatial and developmental variability. The study was conducted in 179 farmer fields in central, south, southwest, and east Uganda. Bunch weights were estimated through linear regression with log-transformed girth of pseudostem at base and 1m, number of hands, and number of fingers in the lower row of the second lowest hand. The number of hands and fingers relate to the potential sink size (i.e. bunch), and the girth at base and 1m were used as a proxy for pseudostem volume, which relates to the potential of the plant to fill the sink. Bunch weight was significantly (P ≤ 0.001) and positively (R2 = 0.73) related to log-transformed pseudostem volume, and number of hands and fingers. When data were partitioned and regressed, regression coefficients did not differ significantly for cultivars (i.e. Enyeru, Kibuzi, Nakabululu and Nakitembe), developmental stages (flowering, early fruiting, late fruiting and full maturity), regions (central, south, southwest and east Uganda), foliar and soil N, P, K, Ca and Mg concentrations. Data partitioning improved the accuracy of prediction significantly for different cultivars, regions, and foliar Ca, but not for bunch developmental stages, foliar N, P, K and Mg and soil N, P, K, Ca and Mg concentrations. However, the residuals of all the regressions of partitioned data correlated highly (R2 between 0.92 and 1.00) to those of the regression based on pooled data. On validation of the regression based on pooled data, the bias (−9.97%) and modeling efficiency statistic (0.64), suggested that predictions were not always accurate. Still, the total predicted bunch weights were higher than the observed bunch weight by only 2%. This study therefore concludes that the regression derived using pooled data is suitable for on-farm prediction of bunch weight, for the East African Highland cooking banana, regardless of genotypic, developmental and spatial variations.

The 225 full-sib progenies generated in the maize population using the North Carolina Design \{II\} (NCD II) mating scheme were evaluated with three checks under artificial infestation with the two borer species in two seasons using a 12 × 19 rectangular lattice design with two replications. Genotypic variance was significant for stalk breakage, ear damage, leaf feeding at 5 weeks after infestation, and for most agronomic traits. Narrow-sense heritability estimate was very low for damage parameters except for stalk breakage (23.26%), but it was moderate for grain yield under infestation (43.84%). Expected gains/cycle were low for damage parameters, but moderate for grain yield (10.59% per cycle). Damage parameters were negatively correlated with grain yield and some agronomic traits, while correlations among the damage parameters were positive. Stalk breakage had the highest genotypic correlation with grain yield (rg = −0.47*) among damage parameters, followed by tunnel length (−0.42*). Breeding scheme such as \{S1\} or full-sib selection method would be effective in improving this maize population for combined resistance to the borer species, as well as grain yield using directselection for increased grain yield under infestation as the criterion. The low heritability as well as low expected gains/cycle for damage parameters indicate that progress from selection for resistance may be slow. "

Results showed that maize grain yield was significantly higher in the treatment in which either the herbicide mixture or velvetbean was combined with 40,000 maize plants ha−1 and weeded thrice. The lowest maize grain yield was obtained with the farmer's control. Weed dry matter was 60% more in the farmer's control than in velvetbean combined with 40,000 maize plants ha−1 and weeded three times. The farmer's control was higher in weed species diversity with Setaria pallide-fusca, Vernonia galamensis, and Boerhavia erecta as the dominant species. Sporobolus pyramidalis and Thelepogon elegans were the dominant weeds in the herbicide treatment and velvetbean plots, respectively. Herbicide or velvetbean in combination with medium maize density and weeding three times (2, 4, and 6 WAP) is recommended for weed management in the northern Guinea savanna. "

A trial was conducted to determine the effects of intercropping with maize on micro-environment, growth and yield of cassava. Radiant energy reaching the soil surface and maximum diurnal soil temperatures were lower with intercropping, with the lowest values being observed in the fertilized plots. Similarly, soil moisture content and earthworm activity were greater with intercropping, with the highest values occurring in fertilized plots. Soil fertility, especially N, was lower in intercropping than in cassava grown alone, with the lowest fertility occurring in non-fertilized mixtures. Intercropping with fertilizer application thus lowered exposure and temperature, and increased soil water and earthworm activity. Inclusion of maize with cassava increased plant height, reduced leaf area index and stem branching and diameter, favoured lodging, delayed bulking of storage roots and decreased nutrient uptake in cassava. The ability of cassava to compensate for impaired early growth after maize harvest depended strongly on soil fertility, especially the level of nitrogen. "

However, quantitative information on the importance, interactions, and geographic distribution of yields and constraints is scanty. We monitored yields, biotic and abiotic constraints in 159 plots in Central, South and Southwest Uganda in 2006–2007. About half the plots were on-farm demonstrations that received fertilizer (average 71N, 8P, 32 K kg ha−1 year−1) through a development project, the rest were ordinary farmer fields (i.e. controls). Fresh banana yields in controls were significantly (P ≤ 0.05) higher in Southwest (20 t ha−1 year−1) compared with Central (12 t ha−1 year−1) and South (10 t ha−1 year−1). Demonstrations yielded 3–10 t ha−1 year−1 more than controls. Yield losses were calculated using the boundary line approach. In Central, yield losses, expressed as percentage of attainable yield, were mainly attributed to pests (nematodes 10% loss, weevils – 6%) and suboptimal crop management (mulch 25%). In South, poor soil quality (pH – 21%, \{SOM\} – 13%, N-total – 13%, and Clay – 11%) and suboptimal crop management (weeds – 20%) were the main constraints. In Southwest, suboptimal crop management (mulch 16%), poor soil quality (K/(Ca + Mg) − 11%) and low rainfall (5%) were the primary constraints. The study revealed that biotic stresses (i.e. pests, weeds) are particularly important in Central, whereas abiotic stresses (i.e. nutrient deficiencies, drought) dominate in South and Southwest. This study concludes that (i) technologies currently available allow farmers to double yields and (ii) past research efforts have mistakenly neglected abiotic constraints. "

However, there has been a decline in productivity, attributed to declining soil fertility, drought, pests and diseases and crop management factors. This study aimed to explore the possibility of increasing yields through the use of fertilizer and mulch, and to evaluate the benefits of these inputs across the major banana producing regions in Uganda. This study was carried out in 179 smallholder plots in Central, South, Southwest and East Uganda in 2006/7. Half of the plots were ‘demonstration plots’ of an agricultural development project, while the other half were neighboring farmer plots that acted as ‘control’. Demonstration plots received mineral fertilizer (100% of plots), averaging 71 N, 8 P, 32 K kg ha−1 yr−1 and external mulch from grass and crop residues (64% of plots), whereas control plots received no mineral fertilizer and little external mulch (26% of plots). Demonstration plots had significantly (P ⩽ 0.05) higher yields than control plot in Central, South and Southwest, but average yield increases varied from 4.8 t ha−1 yr−1 (Southwest) to 8.0 (Central), and 10.0 (South). Average weevil corm damage (3%) and nematode-induced root necrosis (7%) was low and similar for both plot types, so yield increases could only be explained by the use of fertilizer and mulch. The highest demonstration plot yield increases were observed where fertilizer addressed key nutrient deficiencies identified using the compositional nutrient diagnosis approach. Farm gate bunch prices declined from 0.17 (Central Uganda) to 0.07 \{USD\} kg−1 (Southwest Uganda). Consequently, average marginal rate of return (MRR) of fertilizer and mulch use ranged from 0.1 (Southwest) to 5.8 (Central). The technologies were likely to be acceptable to farmers (MRR ⩾ 1.00) up to 160 km away from the capital. Fertilizer use is likely to be acceptable in all regions (MRR = 0.7–9.4) if local fertilizer prices of 2006/7 (average \{USD\} 0.56 kg−1 of fertilizer) declined by 50%. Doubling of fertilizer prices is likely to make fertilizer use unacceptable beyond 100 km away from the capital. The study concludes that there is scope for increased input use in banana systems in Uganda, but that regional variations in crop response, input/output prices, and price fluctuations have to be taken into account.

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that all properties measured varied significantly (P &lt; 0.001). The flours had a wider range of starch content (65–88%), amylose content (13–23%), water absorption capacity (136–224%), diastatic activity (128–354 mg maltose), peak viscosity (77–328 RVU), final viscosity (56–217 RVU), and trough (32–152). Due to the peculiarity of the experimental data generated, two protocols of applying multivariate statistical techniques were evaluated for discriminating the cassava clones. By first applying principal component analysis (PCA), followed by cluster analysis (CA) and finally, discriminant function analysis (DFA) of the experimental data, it was possible to achieve about 87% correct classification of the cassava clones. The final viscosity and diastatic activity of the flours were found to be the most important variables for classifying the cassava clones. "

This paper discusses a methodology for measuring the agricultural sustainability and economic viability of tropical farming systems for new technology evaluation. The approach is based on the concept of interspatial and intertemporal total factor productivity, paying particular attention to valuation of natural resource stock and flows. Agriculture is a sector which utilizes natural resources (e.g. soil nutrients) and the stock and flows of these resources affect the production environment. However, in many cases, the stock of these resources is beyond the control of the farmer and must be accounted for in an agricultural sustainability and economic viability measurement. For example, soil nutrients are removed by crops, erosion or leaching beyond the crop root-zone, or other processes such as volatilization of nitrogen. Agricultural production can also contribute to the stock of some nutrients by leguminous plants such as agroforestry systems. Using a data set available at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, we compute the intertemporal and interspatial total factor productivity indices for four cropping systems in southwestern Nigeria using stock of major soil nutrients as the natural resource stock. Results show that the sustainability and economic viability measures are sensitive to changes in the stock and flow of soil nutrients as well as the material inputs and outputs. Where the contribution of natural resource stock and flows are important (such as in the case of alley cropping), the measures provide markedly different results from conventional \{TFP\} approaches. The advantage of this approach is that interspatial and intertemporal total factor productivity measures are computed using only price and quantity data, thus eliminating the need for econometric estimation.

Three sets of full diallel crosses were made, one set using five parents contrasting for both grain Fe and Zn concentrations; the second set using six parents contrasting only for Fe, and the third set with four parents contrasting only for Zn. The crosses and parents were evaluated in replicated trials for two years. The results indicated that both additive and non-additive gene action play a role in conditioning grain Fe and Zn concentration in sorghum. However, non-additive gene action is predominant in conditioning grain Fe; and additive gene action in conditioning grain Zn. Some of the crosses showed significant heterosis for grain Fe concentration without yield penalty and some crosses showed targeted grain Zn concentration (40 mg kg−1) coupled with higher grain yields. The results also showed that it is possible to improve grain Fe concentration through exploiting heterosis, but there would be little opportunity if any for improving grain Zn through heterosis breeding. To develop hybrids with high grain Fe and Zn concentration in sorghum both parents needs to be improved for these micronutrients. Combining higher grain Fe and Zn with high yield is feasible. "

We measured physical and chemical parameters in the worked soils that are known to be important in soil quality, and therefore to influence fertility. We found that C. fungifaber raised pH in soils with an initial low pH, increased organic carbon, water content and relative amount of kaolinite, and decreased the relative amount of quartz. The main effect of these termites is to raise local microsite soil quality, and these effects are greatest in the near primary and old secondary forests.

Planting of the crop in the Caribbean and Central America is usually carried out between March and July. As water yam is very sensitive to small variations in photoperiod, changes in the planting date may greatly affect crop development and growth. The aim of this study was to assess the change in the radiation use efficiency (RUE) as a function of the planting date, and its effect on yam growth and yields. For this, we adapted the CropSyst model to simulate yam development and growth. The model was modified, calibrated and tested using two independent data sets from field experiments carried out in Guadeloupe (French Antilles) under non-limiting conditions for water and nutrients and over a wide range of planting dates and photoperiods (e.g. from 12.9 h in March to 11.3 h in October). The planting-harvest period varied from 4.4 months for the late planting dates to 9.1 months for the early planting dates. The \{RUE\} was relatively stable in the vegetative phase, increased after tuber initiation (TI) to reach a maximum value during the exponential phase of tuber growth, and then decreased towards the end of growth. The mean value of \{RUE\} increased from the early (March, 1.4 g MJ−1) to the intermediate planting dates (July, 2.7 g MJ−1), and then decreased for the late planting dates (October, 1.3 g MJ−1). Maximum \{RUE\} was negatively correlated with photoperiod. This particular behaviour of \{RUE\} was induced by a source–sink interaction which was controlled by crop development and photoperiod. The model described yam development and growth satisfactorily for all the planting dates: e.g. \{R2\} &gt; 0.92 for the correlation between modelled and measured tuber biomass. Yields varied little from the early to the intermediate planting dates because of an offset between the length of the vegetative phase, which determined leaf area, and the level of \{RUE\} after TI, which determined the capacity of the crop to fill tubers. Growth and yield drastically decreased for the late planting dates because photoperiod induced fast \{TI\} which strongly affected the leaf area. The model was a powerful tool to identify the underlying mechanisms affecting yam yields for some early planting dates, and to assess the factors involved in the high year-to-year variability currently observed in water yam yields.

Overall reduction of mycotoxin level was more significant during the preparation of makume (93% reduction of aflatoxins, 87% reduction of fumonisins) and akassa (92% reduction of aflatoxins, 50% reduction of fumonisins) than that of owo (40% reduction of aflatoxins, 48% reduction of fumonisins).

Aflatoxins and fumonisins were significantly recovered in discarded mouldy and damaged grains and in washing water. Fermentation and cooking showed little effect. During the preparation of ogi and akassa, reduction of fumonisin levels measured in food matrix was lower (50%) compared to mawe and makume, probably due to significant fumonisin release in ogi supernatant.

It uses descriptive statistics to track the trends in adoption of cowpea storage technology compared to previous studies and Firth logistic regression to identify important factors in adoption. The interviews indicate that regionally about 46% of respondents use some type of hermetic storage for their cowpeas and about 44% of the quantity of cowpea stored on farms is in hermetic containers. Both the percentage of respondents and the percentage of stored quantity fall slightly short of the 50% benchmark hypothesized. The 2010–2012 estimates compare to about 30% of cowpea quantity stored in hermetic containers in 2003–2004. Regionally, the most commonly used hermetic storage container is the triple layer Purdue Improved Cowpea Storage (PICS) bag. In \{PICS\} villages, local unavailability is the most common reason for not using the bags. The logit analysis shows that living in a village with \{PICS\} activities is the single most important factor explaining adoption of the technology. In six of the nine regressions participation in the demonstrations was also positive and a statistically significant determinant of adoption. For someone living in a \{PICS\} village and participating in the activities the combined effect is highly influential. In Niger such an individual would be 27% more likely than a non-participant from a non-PICS village to use \{PICS\} bags. In Senegal he or she would be 55% more likely. Some form of exposure to \{PICS\} activities or village technicians is key in adoption of the \{PICS\} technologies, though it may not be direct contact with a \{PICS\} technician. On average additional cash flow due to storage of cowpea in \{PICS\} bags is estimated at $26.58/100 kg bag more than sale at harvest. "

The objective of this paper is to identify institutional and political constraints and opportunities for innovation to address parasitic weed problems in rice. Constraints and opportunities for innovation were studied across three nested systems: the parasitic weed control system, the crop protection system, and the agricultural system. Multi-stakeholder workshops, interviews and surveys were held to gather data on key constraints faced by different stakeholder groups across three parasitic weed infested study sites in both Tanzania and Benin. The results demonstrate that in both countries, the majority of institutional and political constraints relate to the functioning of the broader crop protection and agricultural systems and not specifically to parasitic weeds. Although differences were observed between the two countries and the different stakeholder groups, the majority of constraints perceived by the stakeholders were caused by a lack of capabilities and resources and a limited access to credit. Awareness raising of parasitic weed problems among farmers, extension and crop protection officers at the local level, combined with improved input and service supply and enhanced agricultural education and training curricula at the national level, were identified as important elements for improvement. More structural collaboration between key stakeholder groups is expected to contribute to a better recognition of agricultural problems, like that of parasitic weeds in rice, and a more timely identification of feasible solutions.

Innovation capacity in the agricultural system is studied by analysing (1) constraints within the institutional, sectoral and technological subsystems of the agricultural system, and (2) the existence and performance of the agricultural innovation support system. \{RAAIS\} combines multiple qualitative and quantitative methods, and insider (stakeholders) and outsider (researchers) analyses which allow for critical triangulation and validation of the gathered data. Such an analysis can provide specific entry points for innovations to address the complex agricultural problem under study, and generic entry points for innovation related to strengthening the innovation capacity of agricultural system and the functioning of the agricultural innovation support system. The application of \{RAAIS\} to analyse parasitic weed problems in the rice sector, conducted in Tanzania and Benin, demonstrates the potential of the diagnostic tool and provides recommendations for its further development and use.

There are, however, many uncertainties that influence these predictions. Despite the significance of weather on plant diseases, comprehensive analysis of how climate change will influence plant diseases that impact primary production in agricultural systems is presently unavailable. Evaluation of the limited literature in this area suggests that the most likely impact of climate change will be felt in three areas: in losses from plant diseases, in the efficacy of disease management strategies and in the geographical distribution of plant diseases. Climate change could have positive, negative or no impact on individual plant diseases. More research is needed to obtain base-line information on different disease systems. Most plant disease models use different climatic variables and operate at a different spatial and temporal scale than do the global climate models. Improvements in methodology are necessary to realistically assess disease impacts at a global scale. "

We went beyond the level of simply ‘identifying’ the proteins of interest during osmotic stress experiments in an allopolyploid crop (in casu banana) and focus on an important stress family: the cytoplasmic HSP70s. \{HSP70s\} were already identified earlier in proteomics studies as an important player during stress but an insight into the different family members and their polymorphisms was lacking. One particular spot within a whole spot trail drew our attention: its abundance was significantly higher after osmotic stress. What distinguishes this spot from its brother and sister spots? To understand what was special about that particular spot, we characterized the whole spot family in roots and meristem cultures. Using an 2D-DIGE LC–MS/MS approach we were able to measure a proteotypic peptide for each paralog. From our data it is clear that the different paralogs have evolved over time and do not necessarily behave the same when subjected to a stress treatment. The presumable paralog that particularly reacted to the osmotic stress in roots and meristems is located on chromosome 2 and the promoter region contains a unique \{ABRE\} element. Biological significance To our knowledge, this is the first time that a proteomics approach has led to the exploration of a protein family at the paralog and allelic variant level in a crop. Moreover we identified a specific osmotic responsive cytoplasmic \{HSP70\} isoform, the \{HSP70\} paralog 2, at the protein level. We have shown that the availability of genomic resources as well as the technique used for proteomics analysis are crucial in being able to go beyond the ‘usual suspects’. "

abstract = "Abstract Sub-Sahara Africa can overcome the soil fertility depletion that has resulted from decades of nutrient mining by small-scale farmers and threatens the region's food security. Nutrient restoration is now technically feasible because its mechanisms are understood and the rural development community is alerted to this need. Rapid and inexpensive approaches of diagnosing soil fertility limitations are also becoming available and information generated is becoming systematically applied. For example, the recently initiated Africa Soil Information Service project aims at evaluating, mapping, and monitoring Africa's soil qualities for better targeting of soil fertility management technologies to improve crop yields while enhancing the environment. Practical knowledge is available on nutrient management in small-scale farming systems that combines increased biological nitrogen fixation, utilizes agromineral resources such as phosphate rock, better uses organic resources, and more efficiently applies mineral fertilizers. The new approach to managing soil nutrients, recognized as integrated soil fertility management, aims to increase food production through strategic combination of traditional and new technologies and is being stimulated through increased availability and more profitable use of mineral fertilizers by Africa's poorer farmers. This is building on already existing sparks of hope for restoring soil fertility in sub-Saharan Africa derived from such examples as the increasing adoption of the zaï-type of pitting system originated in drier parts of West Africa which exemplifies the beneficial effects of integrating harvesting of water and applying nutrient sources at each planting station so as to increase yield in a region where both necessities are key limiting factors. Nitrogen fixation by indigenous and introduced legumes combined with improved agronomic practices has shown potential for kick-starting self-multiplying improvements in soil productivity. Such successes will be accelerated by broader initiatives which improve rural infrastructure, increase accessibility of inputs, improve marketing facilities, and make reinvestment into farming more productive and sustainable. Indeed, experience indicates that investments in farming and, by inference, soil fertility conservation are made when economic returns from smallholder production are sufficient to do so. So, while technical advances leading to improvements in farming practice must continue, policymakers must also recognize that agriculture ultimately forms the basis for economic recovery and act upon past promises to invest in agriculture, including the restoration of nutrient-depleted soils. Investments must address factors that have impacts both on the broad reforms for provision of services such as marketing and trade, as well as those directly constraining the poor farmers such as capacity to access and efficiently apply fertilizers.

Using 20-year experimental data from southern Togo, a biannual rainfall area, we analysed the effect of two rates of mineral \{NPK\} fertiliser application to maize–cotton rotation on the long-term dynamics of soil C and nutrient contents, as compared with two control treatments. Mineral fertiliser treatments consisted of application to both maize (first season) and cotton (second season) the research-recommended \{NPK\} rates (Fertiliser-RR) and 1.5 times these rates (Fertiliser-1.5 RR). Control treatments consisted of cropping maize and cotton without fertiliser use (No-Fertiliser) and of double annual soil tillage (as done for planted treatments) without planting a crop (Tillage-NoCrop). Maize residue biomass was every year returned to the soil of crops planted treatments, whereas cotton stems were uprooted, piled and burnt on the experimental plots as done locally for phyto-sanitary reasons. Treatment effects were analysed through a long-term change in crop productivity, in soil C and nutrient contents. Our results indicate that productivity of maize and notably of cotton cannot be sustained in this Ferralsol without nutrient inputs. On average, maize yields without fertilisers decreased from 2 t ha−1 after woodland clearing to 0.5 t ha−1 after 10 years of cultivation, while cotton yields decreased from 1.5 to 0.5 t ha−1 only after 5 years. In spite of the need of mineral fertiliser use to sustain productivity of this soil, there was little justification to increase inputs of mineral fertiliser over the research recommended rate. Over 20-year experiment, both maize and cotton while received N, P and K inputs at the research-recommended rates produced virtually the same yields as when these rates were increased by 50%. Although C inputs to soil under \{RR\} and 1.5 \{RR\} were greater than in the No-Fertiliser control (nil for Tillage-NoCrop), and the N input was more favourable for 1.5RR, the rates in which contents of soil C and N decreased over time did not differ substantially between treatments. Soil available P decreased for all treatments, while exchangeable K concentration increased under \{RR\} and 1.5 \{RR\} and decreased in unfertilised treatments (No-Fertiliser and Tillage-NoCrop). In fertilised plots and in tillage no-planted plots, soil pH decreased more than in No-Fertiliser plots. A decline of soil pH was associated with a decline of exchangeable Ca and Mg, which were on average 20 and 40% higher in fertilised plots than in No-Fertiliser plots. We conclude that soil C and N decline in this Ferralsol was more determined by a change in soil conditions due to woodland clearance and continuous tillage than by the quantities of C or N inputs added annually.

This study assessed the drought response of 64 small red-seeded genotypes of common bean grown in a lattice design replicated twice under contrasting moisture regimes, terminal drought stress and non-stress, in Ethiopia during the dry season from November 2014 to March 2015. Multiple plant traits associated with drought were assessed for their contribution to drought adaptation of the genotypes. Drought stress determined by a drought intensity index was moderate (0.3). All the assessed traits showed significantly different genotypic responses under drought stress and non-stress conditions. Eleven genotypes significantly (P ≤ 0.05) outperformed the drought check cultivar under both drought stress and non-stress conditions in seed yielding potential. Seed yield showed positive and significant correlations with chlorophyll meter reading, vertical root pulling resistance force, number of pods per plant, and seeds per pod under both soil moisture regimes, indicating their potential use in selection of genotypes yielding well under drought stress and non-stress conditions. Clustering analysis using Mahalanobis distance grouped the genotypes into four groups showing high and significant inter-cluster distance, suggesting that hybridization between drought-adapted parents from the groups will provide the maximum genetic recombination for drought tolerance in subsequent generations.

Epidemics occurred in Madagascar and Uganda in the 1930s and 1940s, and more localised rapid spread of \{CMD\} was observed in parts of coastal Tanzania in the 1930s and coastal Kenya in the 1970s. During the 1990s, a major regional pandemic of an unusually severe form of \{CMD\} has expanded to affect parts of at least five countries, causing massive economic losses and destabilising food security. Mechanisms responsible for the development and progress of the pandemic have been described, and comparisons of epidemiological data for varieties grown throughout the period under review suggest that the recent pandemic has been characterised by rapid rates of \{CMD\} spread hitherto unknown in East Africa. A key factor in the genesis and spread of the pandemic has been the recombination between two distinct cassava mosaic geminiviruses to produce a novel and more virulent hybrid. Although such events may be common, the known history of \{CMD\} in East Africa suggests that the frequency with which they become epidemiologically significant is low. A corollary of this is that resistance, developed originally in Tanzania between 1934 and 1960, and utilized and supplemented at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Nigeria, since 1971, is providing effective \{CMD\} control in current pandemic-affected areas of East Africa. Consequently, it is concluded that prospects for managing \{CMD\} in the 21st century are good, and that the approach adopted should build on the model of collaborative research and implementation that has been established in tackling the current \{CMD\} pandemic.

The dynamics of age-structured populations of leaves, shoots, roots, peduncles, and other reproductive organs having numbers and dry matter attributes is simulated by a time-varying distributed delay model with attrition. A modified functional response model from predation theory is used to estimate the daily photosynthates acquisition. Dry matter allocation is simulated by a metabolic pool model. Growth and yield formation of the plant are driven by the computed ratio between carbohydrates supply and demand. Simulation results are compared with four sets of field data. Further, the model has been used to evaluate the effect of drought stress and different levels of available phosphate in the soil. The model is designed for research purposes, to be used as a tool for further studies of the cowpea agro-ecosystem. "

Surveys on banana weevil and its natural enemies were undertaken in Indonesia, in 2000 and 2001. Banana weevil incidence was found to be low, 0.6–1.7 adults per trap in West Sumatra and 0.2–0.4 in West Java.

Therefore, a 2 year (1982–1984) field experiment was initiated on an Alfisol in Nigeria to study the effect of tillage, mechanization and mulch on soil structure and physical properties. Three zero-tillage treatments and a plough treatment were compared. The disk-plough and one of the no-till treatments were highly mechanized: all the field work was performed with tractors and machines, and consisted of secondary bush clearing, crop cultivation and harvest. On the other two no-till treatments, the impact of machine load was reduced, wither by hand harvesting or by performing all field operations manually. These four tillage-traffic systems were either treated with mulch or left unmulched. There were four growing seasons, with maize (Zea mays L.) as a test crop. After 2 years of zero-tillage the bulk density (BD) and penetration resistance (PR) were significantly greater on plots with high mechanization compared with hand treated plots. Plots with hand harvest but otherwise mechanized were in between. Because of the hard-setting nature of the soil, the plougheed plots with and without mulch exhibited a dramatic change in \{PR\} and \{BD\} during the season. On no-till the infiltration transmissivity (A) was greater and \{BD\} and \{PR\} were less in the mulched compared with the unmulched treatments. The gravel content of the topsoil was negatively correlated with \{BD\} and positively correlated with A. Geostatistical analysis revealed that within the experimental area there was a similar spatial distribution of gravel content and A after the first season. Because of the superimposing effect of gravel on BD, which cannot be accounted for by considering the gravel content per se, \{BD\} was adjusted by means of covariance analysis for evaluation of the treatment effects already mentioned. It was concluded that mechanization of a no-till system on sandy Alfisols may only be successful in the long run if appropriate measures like mulching, crop rotation and fallow systems are applied to regenerate soil structure and to enhance macroporosity.

The major soil groups of the \{WASAT\} are Alfisols, Inceptisols and Entisols and Vertisols, with the former three predominating. The major soil constraints to crop growth are: soil compaction, low fertility, high temperature and low soil water retention, available water holding capacity and infiltration rate. Tillage in traditional farming systems is manual. However, mechanization of tillage operations has received emphasis in the recent past. The accelerated soil degradation which is a feature of mechanized-tillage systems under rainfed agriculture can be minimized with no tillage. However, lower yield have been reported to occur with no tillage. Some possible reasons are: the absence or low amounts of residue mulch, high soil compaction, the presence of harmful soil insects in crop residues, the creation of stable pores by tillage in soils of high organic matter, silt and fine sand contents. Unavailability of crop residues in a major impediment to the adoption of no tillage. The use of heavy and intensive mechanical tillage in irrigated agriculture leads to the formation of plow soles. Deep tillage such as subsoiling does not ensure the elimination of plow soles. While no tillage appears to hold promise for use in the irrigated agriculture of the \{WASAT\} much research remains to be done. "

At the centre of these changes are smallholder coffee producers, responsible for 80% of global coffee production. Although rural households are known to depend on more than agricultural production alone, the literature on specialty coffee and certification has rather narrowly focused on coffee income and production. In this study, broader impacts are explicitly taken into account. Household income was decomposed into categories corresponding to specific income-generating activities and coffee income was broken down into price, yield and area effects. Results show that coffee certification encourages farmers to specialise in coffee production, increasing coffee income but not total household income, at least not in the short run. The time and effort required to attain the higher coffee income offered by certified production means farmers have to give up other activities. This substitution effect cancels out the income effect, such that there is no increase in total household income. The lack of an effect on total household income suggests the return to the additional labour effort required for certified coffee production is not higher than in other activities, questioning the benefits of certification for small-scale producers.

We observed a strong response to both P and I, which significantly increased grain yields by 452 and 447 kg ha−1 respectively. The additive effect of P + I (777 kg ha−1) resulted in the best average yields. Variability in yield among farms was large, which had implications for the benefits for individual farmers. Moreover, although the yield response to P and I was similar, I was more profitable due to its low cost. Only 16% of the variability in control yields could be explained by plant establishment, days to first weeding, percentage sand and soil exchangeable magnesium. Between 42% and 61% of variability in response to P and/or I could be explained by variables including year, farm size, plant establishment, total rainfall and pH. The predictive value of these variables was limited, however, with cross-validation \{R2\} decreasing to about 15% for the prediction between Local Government Areas and 10% between years. Implications for future research include our conclusion that averages of performance of technologies tell little about the adoption potential for individual farmers. We also conclude that a strong agronomic and economic case exists for the use of inoculants with promiscuous soybean, requiring efforts to improve the availability of good quality inoculants in Africa.

We investigated the influence of planting density on nutrient mass fractions and nutrient imbalance indices in bananas under small-scale, low-input systems using the compositional nutrient diagnosis (CND) approach. Boundary line functions were developed to identify yield limiting factors and quantify their contribution to the yield gap. Soil, plant, yield and water data were collected in plant density experiments conducted in three contrasting agro-ecological sites of Rwanda (i.e. Kibungo low rainfall with medium soil fertility, Rubona high rainfall but low soil fertility and Ruhengeri high rainfall with high soil fertility). Effects of site × cultivar and site × density on bunch yield were significant (p &lt; 0.05). Annual yields (t ha−1 yr−1) ranged from 6.1 to 9.2 at Kibungo, 9.5 to 21.5 at Rubona and 7.0 to 25.0 at Ruhengeri. Similar trends were registered for the above ground dry matter yield. \{CND\} indices showed that K, Mg and P were the most deficient elements in areas with low inherent soil fertility (Kibungo and Rubona). The yield gap analysis also confirmed that K was the most limiting factor, contributing to a predicted yield gap of 55.3% at Kibungo while P and Mg collectively contributed to a 35% yield gap at Rubona. An increase in plant density resulted in an increase in average yield gap from 45.6 to 70.2% at Kibungo, whilst the average yield gap decreased significantly with increases in plant density from 47.5 to 30.2% at Rubona and 76.6 to 53.7% at Ruhengeri. The study confirmed that soil fertility is a more limiting factor than water, but both \{CND\} norms and boundary line analysis showed that predicted yield gaps seem to be higher for plant density than soil fertility. Therefore, plant density management is an entry point to optimize yield of East African highland bananas. "

Weeding five times or applying glyphosate was more effective than weeding twice in preventing crop yield losses and suppressing speargrass. Plots that received glyphosate or those weeded five times had 28–59% higher crop yields than plots weeded twice at all locations. In maize, subplots without cover crop had 30% more maize grain yield than plots with cover crops. In cassava, subplots without cover crops at Ezillo and plots where kudzu was intercropped with velvetbean at Ogoja had the lowest cassava tuber yields. Speargrass was more effectively suppressed in plots with cover crops than in plots without cover crops. Across all main treatments, velvetbean nearly eliminated rhizomes of speargrass within 2 years of treatment application at Avrankou. It was cheaper to use glyphosate than handweeding for speargrass control in both crops. Cover crops generally gave better economic benefit in cassava while in maize an opposite trend was observed. "

abstract = "The adaptation of cowpeas to different environments was associated with several differences in developmental processes among the 32 accessions examined. In wild lines from seasonally arid environments, such as Niger, the timing of all developmental stages investigated depended on environmental conditions: temperature and soil water status influenced the softening of hard seeds and their rates of germination; daylength determined the time of flowering; the vapour pressure deficit in the atmosphere sorrounding mature pods control-led the release of seeds. In wild lines from the sub-humid and humid tropics, on the other hand, the time of germination was the major influence on the life cycle, flowering and seed dispersal being less tightly coupled to climatic conditions. The cultivated cowpeas investigated encompassed a wide range of responses, but in the most extreme cases development was controlled almost entirely by time of planting, the seed having no form of dormancy, floral initiation being faster and insensitive to daylength, and the lines lacking a natural means of seed dispersal. Domestication of the cowpea has, therefore, been accompanied by a reduction in the controlling influence of environmental conditions on the life cycle. "

Walp. (V. sinensis (L.) Savi). Structurally all of the seed coats examined, except those of groundnuts (Arachis hypogaea), conformed to the general pattern for legumes, but there was considerable variation in thickness associated with differences in the size of cells. The specific weight of the testas ranged from 30.6 mg cm−2 in Lupinus pilosus to 1.6 mg cm−2 in some cowpeas. Cowpeas have two distinct types of seed coat: that with a rough texture was the thinnest coat found any of the legumes examined; the other was a smooth or thich coat. Intermediate forms were also found. Domesticated legumes had thinner seed coats that were more permeable to water and had larger seeds than their wild relatives. Experiments with cowpeas failed to provide any evidence that a thick testa limits the size of seeds by acting as a mechanical constraint to growth. The smooth testas of dry seeds had a clear role in regulating the loss of water, which occurred through the hilum groove, and its entry, which was through the raphe. It is proposed that differential swelling and contraction of layers within the testa may account for the action of these regions. Rough-seeded lines did not have the capacity to control water exchange, the entire testa being permeable. The selective advantages of thick and thin seed coats to wild and cultivated legumes are discussed and a proposal is made to account for differences in the seed coat thickness found in hard seeds of wild legumes.

The distribution of \{C3\} and \{C4\} species in the tropics could be affected by landuse change and estimates of yield increases will be dependent on their proportions. The allocation of photosynthate to the root will increase under elevated CO2, resulting in increased fine root dry weight and root length. Root sink strength and the turnover of roots and associated symbionts are critical knowledge gaps. Carbon: nitrogen ratios in tissues will increase resulting in decreased decomposition rates. The concentration of secondary compounds will be affected more by nitrogen limitations than a direct \{CO2\} effect. Changes in lignin, tannin and polyphenol levels are more important in the decomposability of tropical litters than changes in the C : N ratios.

This article presents a micro-level simulation study that was undertaken for Northern Ghana, building on the approach and data developed within a research project of the \{CGIAR\} Challenge Programme on Water and Food. The study applied agent-based modelling to analyse how adaptation affects the distribution of household food security and poverty under current climate and price variability. Specifically, we examined the effectiveness of policy interventions related to the promotion of agricultural credit and off-farm employment opportunities. Our simulation experiments suggest that both climate and price variability have a pronounced negative effect on household welfare. Moreover, we found substantial difference in the poverty and food security status of households due to climate and price variability. Provision of agricultural credit and access to off-farm employment are found to be highly effective policy entry points that deserve more empirical research. "

Rainfall erosivity differences were more pronounced between the Guinea Savanna and Forest or Coastal belts than between the Forest and Coastal belts. Erosivity is higher in the Forest or Coastal belts than the Guinea Savanna belt. The high erosivity of rains in southeastern Nigeria can be attributed to heavy storms of comparatively high intensities and, often, long duration. The magnitude of rainfall erosivity provides a useful insight into the causes of the catastrophic erosion problems in southeastern Nigeria. "

P addition to soil from P. phaseoloides fallow had the same effect in the Rhodic Kandiudult, while a more pronounced response to P addition was found in soil from C. odorata fallow in the Typic Kandiudult.

At the initiation of the study, 1990, the seedling community was dominated by perennial weeds (60%). After 6 years, 84% of the weed seedlings were broadleaf (53% annuals and 31% perennials). Weed seedling emergence differed with type of fallow, landuse intensity and year (P&lt;0.01). Weed seedlings emerged throughout the sampling period of 3–15 weeks after planting (WAP) crops.

Natural bush and L. leucocephala fallow had more weed seedlings than P. phaseoloides fallow in all years except 1993 and 1995.

This paper quantifies, using an econometric model, the factors determining farmers’ adoption and use of alley farming variants in southwest of Cameroon, based on a survey of 156 farmers in 11 villages in the region. The analysis showed that male farmers are more likely to adopt than women. Adoption is higher for farmers with contacts with extension agencies working on agroforestry technologies. Adoption is higher for farmers belonging to farmers’ groups. Adoption is lower for farmers in areas with very high population pressure, as farmers in such areas may have greater labor productivity from use of less labor intensive natural resource management technologies like chemical fertilizers. Adoption is higher for farmers in areas facing fuel wood scarcity. Farmers have made adaptations to the conventional alley farming technology recommended by researchers, the most significant adaptation being the introduction of fallow periods into the system. Farmers use alley farming as a land use option, not as a replacement for the slash-and-burn system, since land supply is still relatively elastic. Achieving increased impact with alley farming variants requires effective targeting. Results showed that econometric modeling using farmer and village characteristics, socioeconomic and institutional variables can lead to more effective targeting to farmers and locations where higher adoption rates may occur.

It is commonly considered the major constraint to plantain production in West Africa. The disease causes severe leaf necrosis and reduces yield by 30 to 50%. Twenty euploid hybrids, derived from interspecific interploidy crosses were selected for a range of host responses to black Sigatoka. The performance of these hybrids was compared with that of their parents to determine the influence of the disease on growth parameters and components of yield. There were significant differences for all components of black Sigatoka resistance, growth parameters, and yield components among the hybrids. For diploid hybrids, which often had a short growth cycle, early flowering, or both, the disease incubation time was significantly correlated with days to fruit filling (P&lt;0.05). However, for tetraploid hybrids that had a long growth cycle and delayed flowering, the correlation was not significant (P ≥ 0.05). For diploid and tetraploid hybrids, the disease evolution time and the disease development time were both correlated (P &lt; 0.05) with days to fruit filling. The bunch weight of tetraploid hybrids was correlated (P &lt; 0.05) with the disease development time that was easily scored by the youngest leaf spotted at flowering (ρ = 0.933; P &lt; 0.001).

Crop yields after short-term fallows with natural vegetation are often low as a consequence of low nutrient availability to crops. Planted tree fallows may offer an alternative to natural fallows for improving short fallow-crop cycles if trees accumulate and therefore retain more nutrients in the system. Calliandra calothyrsus (Meissner) (calliandra) trees (3947 ha−1) were planted at different spatial patterns into 18 farmers’ fields in six villages, covering a wide range of soil and rainfall conditions in the forest zone of Cameroon. After 2 year of fallow calliandra tree fallows had produced between 18.9 and 25.0 Mg ha−1 of above-ground dry matter, significantly more than 14.3 and 17.3 Mg ha−1 of dry matter in 2- and 4–5-year old natural fallows, dominated by Chromolaena odorata. Planting trees in alleys and in equidistant pattern produced more biomass than planting in clusters and around the plot borders. The tree fallows accumulated above-ground on average 225 kg N ha−1, significantly more than 168 kg N ha−1 in natural fallows. Alley-planted trees accumulated more P (19 kg ha−1) than natural fallows (14 kg P ha−1), but no difference in K–Ca–Mg accumulation was found. Between 57 and 65% of the biomass in the tree fallows was stem-wood of calliandra, and 23–27% in branch wood. Nutrients in these components are unavailable for annual crops if not burned. Planting trees in clusters and dense lines around the border reduced the stem-wood mass. The stem-wood of calliandra contained on average 18% of the total fallow N, 21% of the P, 28% of the K, 16% of the Ca, and 14% of the Mg.

An expenditure model of demand using results from a 1998 survey (n=150) in Yaounde, Cameroon estimated that as a group \{TLVs\} were normal goods, which contribute a significant share of essential nutrients for the urban poor. Urban consumption of Brassica exotics, which have replaced \{TLVs\} in other parts of Africa, was minimal. Price analysis revealed a decline in supply during the dry season, which is a food security concern for the very poor. Field and market surveys conducted in 1998 and 1997 estimated that over 32000 households were engaged in producing and marketing \{TLVs\} under readily accessible entry conditions. Three production styles were identified: an intensive system within the urban limits, a semi intensive style in the urban periphery and an extensive style also in the urban periphery. The largest number of producers were women employing an extensive mixed crop system. Successful in situ conservation will require research to improve the productivity of \{TLV\} cropping systems and media efforts to promote their use. "

On unshelled cobs adult weevils must feed and oviposit mostly on the kernel's crown, the only part of the kernel fully exposed to the external environment. The resistance of unshelled kernels to the maize weevil, relative to shelled kernels, is shown to depend on three factors: (1) reduced oviposition, as a result of non-preference for oviposition on the kernel's crown; (2) an increase in weevil median development period (MDP) due to the less suitable endosperm diet of first instar larvae which hatch from eggs laid on or near the crown; and (3) an additional increase in \{MDP\} due to difficulty in finding a site on the kernel where the \{F1\} generation adult can emerge. These resistance factors, which contribute to lower levels of weevil infestation in traditional on-the-cob maize storage, have not been thoroughly investigated before. Other kernel and cob characteristics which appear to contribute to resistance are also discussed. "

Factors responsible for differences in susceptibility and suitable screening methods for resistance to the maize weevil were also studied. In the first part of this study the varieties were compared in the field, during field drying and when stored using traditional techniques. The international improved varieties had significantly higher grain yield (60%) but had significantly poorer husk cover. The percentage of damaged ears following field drying, and the numbers of storage pests and grain weight loss after one month of storage were significantly higher in the international improved varieties presumably as a result of poorer husk cover. In the second part of this study the varieties were compared in a factorial arrangement of three storage forms (undehusked, dehusked and shelled grain) and two infestation methods (free and no-choice). Due to their superior husk cover quality, Benin varieties were significantly more resistant to weevils when infested in the traditional, undehusked storage form than international improved varieties. The smaller-grain, flinty, Benin varieties showed a significantly smaller number of \{F1\} generation weevils. A significant lengthening of the median development period (MDP) of weevils was observed when maize was stored as dehusked ears compared to shelled grain, particularly on the international improved varieties. No improved vs Benin variety comparisons interacted with free vs no-choice comparisons except for index of susceptibility in the undehusked storage form. Free choice infestations resulted in increased experimental error for number of \{F1\} weevils, presumably due to a clumped distribution of female weevils during oviposition. When the target farmer's storage system is undehusked ears, it is suggested to use no-choice infestation of undehusked ears as a screening method for elite candidate varieties. An assessment of husk quality and no-choice infestation of shelled grain and/or dehusked maize ears is suggested as more appropriate for preliminary screening of diverse germplasm. "

Field conditions, insects and diseases, plant growth and yield variables were assessed in 164 fields. Increased soil fertility (expressed as plant vigour) favoured Bipolaris maydis, Physoderma maydis, and Busseola fusca. There was a positive relationship between soil organic matter and B. fusca, Eldana saccharina and B. maydis. As organic matter decreased, percentage leaf area lost to pathogens, particularly Puccinia sorghi, increased. There was an inverse relationship between wild grasses around a field and stem borers in the field. Stem diameter, cob fill and weight increased with altitude reflecting the change from early maturing lowland cultivars to very late maturing mid- to high-altitude cultivars. Across ecological zones and surveys, B. fusca accounted for 95% of all the species found on maize, followed by E. saccharina. In the first cropping season, the mean percent borer infestation was similar in lowland and highland with a mean of 43%. Borer incidence was higher during the second cropping season. In both low and mid-altitude fields, 52–56% of the plants were infested, resulting in a calculated cob weight loss of 9 g per plant. At that time, the average plant loss from dead hearts across zones was 11%. B. maydis, Puccinia polysora, and Physoderma maydis predominated in the lowlands, and E. turcicum, P. sorghi, and Phaeosphaeria maydis occurred mainly in mid- to high-altitudes. Maize streak virus, stem diseases, B. maydis, Rhizoctonia sheath blight, and P. sorghi consistently had significant negative impacts on cob weight. The aetiology of stem lesions was not determined, but they significantly affected cob weight in the humid lowlands. Average reduction in cob weight from foliar and stem diseases in the different ecological zones and seasons ranged between 10 and 12 g per plant. "

Three Ugandan strains of B. bassiana (G41, \{S204\} and WA) were applied by dipping the roots and rhizome in a conidial suspension, by injecting a conidial suspension into the plant rhizome and by growing the plants in sterile soil mixed with B. bassiana-colonized rice substrate. Four weeks after inoculation, plant growth parameters were determined and plant tissue colonization assessed through re-isolation of B. bassiana. All B. bassiana strains were able to colonize banana plant roots, rhizomes and pseudostem bases. Dipping plants in a conidial suspension achieved the highest colonization with no negative effect on plant growth or survival. Beauveria bassiana strain \{G41\} was the best colonizer (up to 68%, 79% and 41% in roots, rhizome and pseudostem base, respectively) when plants were dipped.

It was hypothesised that the reduction in fresh bunch mass and increase in dry matter (DM) allocation to corms with drought stress, K and N deficiency is additive. Individual plant measurements at harvest from two field trials in central and south western Uganda were analyzed to evaluate effects of cumulative rainfall (CRF) received 365 days from sucker emergence, mineral K and N inputs on \{EAHB\} bunch yields. Dry matter content in aerial shoot (leaves and pseudostems) relative to that in the subterranean corm was also analyzed to evaluate \{DM\} allocation plasticity due to drought stress, K and N deficiency. This was verified with allometric analysis using pre-harvest stage plants from farms of known K and N nutritional status and plants from a screen house drought stress pot trial in Uganda. Dry matter production and yields were mainly driven by K interacting with CRF. Within 12 months, K input (250–600 kg K ha−1 yr−1) increased bunch yield from 8 to 15 Mg ha−1 yr−1 irrespective of whether dry (CRF &lt; 1100 mm) or wet (CRF ≥ 1100 mm) conditions prevailed, possibly due to K-mediated osmotic adjustment under dry conditions. Without K input, wet conditions increased bunch yield from 6 to 8 Mg ha−1 yr−1 while dry conditions decreased it from 6 to 4 Mg ha−1 yr−1 within 12 months. Total \{DM\} and its distribution between the biomass structures followed similar trends. Nitrogen input (150–400 kg N ha−1 yr−1) neither affected bunch yield nor \{DM\} allocation at harvest stage. At pre-harvest stage, reduction in \{DM\} allocation to the corm per unit increase in total \{DM\} was 14–22% significantly lower with N and/or K deficiency compared with that under sufficient K and N. Drought stress per se had no effect on \{DM\} allocation but enhanced \{DM\} allocation shifts due to K deficiency. Drought-stressed \{EAHB\} thus increase \{DM\} allocation to subterranean structures only if K-deficient, unlike responses reported for other plant species. Potassium nutrition is perhaps a more viable entry point for mitigation of drought stress in \{EAHB\} cropping systems than irrigation but this requires further agronomic and economic evaluation. It may be important to account for carbon allocated to osmotic adjustment for realistic simulation of water- and K-limited growth in EAHB. "

Under Striga infestation, mean grain yield ranged from 2537 kg ha−1 for the period 1 cultivars to 3122 kg ha−1 for period 3 cultivars with a corresponding annual genetic gain of 1.93%. When Striga-free, grain yield ranged from 3646 kg ha−1 for the period 1 cultivars to 4227 kg ha−1 for the period 2 cultivars with an annual genetic gain of 1.0%. The average annual rate of increase in grain yield was 41 kg ha−1 when Striga-infested and 34 kg ha−1 when Striga-free. The annual genetic gain in grain yield was 0.86% for period 1 cultivars, 2.07% for period 2 cultivars, and 2.11% for period 3 cultivars under Striga infestation. The increase in grain yield under Striga infestation was associated with significant decrease in Striga damage and the number of emerged Striga plants at 8 and 10 weeks after planting (WAP), an improvement in ear aspect, lodging resistance, plant height, and increase in the number of ears per plant (EPP) from the period 1 to the period 3 cultivars. For the emerged Striga plants, the annual genetic gains of −0.63% for 8 \{WAP\} and −0.57% for 10 \{WAP\} were obtained from the period 1 to the period 2 cultivars. The increase in genetic gains was 0.70% for \{EPP\} and −0.65% for ear aspect.

The objectives of this study were to determine the combining ability of 28 early maturing inbreds, classify them into heterotic groups, identify suitable testers under Striga-infested and Striga free environments and to assess the efficiency of three heterotic grouping methods. Three hundred and seventy-eight hybrids derived from diallel crosses of 28 early inbreds along with two checks were evaluated in Striga-infested and Striga-free environments for 2 years at two locations in Nigeria. Twenty-seven of the 28 inbreds were genotyped with 46 polymorphic simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers previously mapped on the 10 maize chromosomes. Analysis of variance revealed highly significant (P &lt; 0.01) general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) mean squares for most traits under test conditions. Based on the \{SCA\} effects and heterotic group's specific and general combining ability (HSGCA) for grain yield, four and five heterotic groups were identified under Striga-infested and Striga-free environments, respectively. Two inbreds could not be classified into any of the four groups under Striga-infestation. The \{SSR\} markers revealed a wide genetic variability among the inbred lines as the genetic distance ranged between 0.21 and 0.68. Four heterotic groups were identified based on genetic distance (GD) derived from the \{SSR\} analysis. Correlation analyses showed that grouping using \{GD\} was more consistent with grouping based on \{SCA\} under Striga-free than under Striga-infested environments. The \{HSGCA\} method was the most effective in classifying early maturing maize inbreds under Striga-infested and Striga free environments. A total of 4 and 8 inbred testers were identified under Striga-infested and Striga-free environments, respectively. These inbred testers are invaluable resources for tropical maize breeding programs.

In this study a comparison was made between monitored and calendar spray applications to determine whether monitored spraying would reduce the number of insecticide applications and still produce yields comparable to calendar spraying. The study focused on four insect pests — the cowpea aphid (Aphis craccivora Koch), legume bud thrips (Megalurothrips sjostedti Tryb.), legume pod borer (Maruca testulalis Geyer) and pod-sucking bugs. These pests damage cowpea at various stages of growth. The trials were carried out at three locations in Nigeria — Ibadan (forest transition zone), Mokwa and Bida (in the southern Guinea savanna zone). At all locations the two calendar schedules used were 7- and 10-day spray intervals. Differences in their effect on insect pest numbers were not significant, neither were there differences in grain yield (p ≥ 0.05). In general, the calendar schedules recorded lower infestation/damage by aphids, flower thrips and pod borers than monitored spraying but grain yields did not differ between them. Monitored spraying required only two sprays at Ibadan and Mokwa and three at Bida. This was half the number used for calendar spraying. Monitored spraying therefore looks quite attractive as a component in the overall management of cowpea pests. "

A pot experiment was conducted using soils collected from 13 farmers' fields located in two agroecological zones (northen and southern Guinea savanna) in the moist savanna of Nigeria to determine the relationships between growth response to previous rhizobial inoculation and the indigenous rhizobial populations. At each farmer's field, soil was collected in plots which were planted the previous year (1993) to: (1) maize, (2) soybean cv. Bossier, (3) soybean cv. \{TGX\} 1456-2E and (4) soybean cv. \{TGX\} 1660-19F. The soybean cultivars \{TGX\} 1660-19F and \{TGX\} 1456-2E were either uninoculated or inoculated with an enriched population of a mixture of local rhizobial strains. Four test plants: soybean cultivars \{TGX\} 1660-19F (slightly promiscuous), \{TGX\} 1456-2E (highly promiscuous), Bossier (non-promiscuous) and cowpea (typically promiscuous) were planted in pots containing soils from the above field treatments. Previous inoculation increased shoot dry matter production by an average of 32% over the uninoculated controls in 94 of the 312 (30%) legume inoculations and farmers' field combinations while the indigenous rhizobia were more effective than the introduced ones in 103 combinations (33%) with an average of 20% increase compared to previous inoculation treatments. Previous inoculation increased biomass yield of both promiscuous and non-promiscuous soybean varieties. The response to previous inoculation treatments was farmers' fields dependent and inversely related to the numbers of rhizobia in the soil. Soil rhizobial population ranged from 0 to &gt; 400 cells g−1 soil and response to inoculation often occurred when numbers of indigenous rhizobia were fewer than 10 cells g−1 soil. Numbers of indigenous rhizobia were generally lower or below detection limit in soils previously cropped to maize. These results indicate a relationship between rhizobia cell counts and promiscuous soybean responses, which may be used to indicate under which conditions inoculation will be beneficial to a farmer.

Mean cast production in cropped plots was 35.7 Mg ha−1in the first year, 34.9 Mg ha−1 in year 2 and 30.1 Mg ha−1 in year 3. This was 63%, 84%, and 65%, respectively, of cast production in undisturbed, unthinned timber plantation plots. In comparing cast nutrient concentrations between years 1, 2 and 3, there were highly significant correlations for nearly all nutrients in control plots but fewer such correlations in the low TSD. In cropped plots, none of earthworm parameters was correlated with nutrient concentrations of slash or amounts of slash applied to the soil surface at establishment. There were positive correlations between cast N and litterfall N (kg ha−1 y−1) in both year 2 (cast N = 0.49 × litterfall N + 61.7, r2=0.46) and year 3 (cast N = 0.38 × litterfall N + 55.6, r2=0.42). The ratio of soil:cast nutrient concentrations were related by negative power functions to soil nutrient concentrations for all nutrients and organic carbon. This suggests that earthworm communities adjust to lower soil nutrient concentrations by increasing their selectivity and thus produce relatively higher quality casts on poorer soil. "

We tested three hypotheses: (1) the physiological age at flowering is independent of site effects, (2) there is no difference in threshold size at flowering between sites with different growth potential, and (3) morphological and physiological components of highland banana relative growth rate (RGR) contribute equally to mitigate growth reduction in response to limiting supply of water, K or N. The physiological age of highland banana plants from field trials at Kawanda (central Uganda) and Ntungamo (south-western Uganda) was computed from daily temperature records. Growth analysis was conducted using RGR, net assimilation rate (NAR), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf mass ratio (LMR) estimated from allometry. Growth response coefficients were used for quantifying the relative contribution of NAR, \{SLA\} and \{LMR\} to RGR. Physiological age at flowering was delayed by 739 °C d at Kawanda compared with that at Ntungamo whose chronological age at flowering was in turn 51 d older. At both sites a threshold total dry mass of 1.5 kg per plant was required for flowering. Faster absolute growth rate and \{NAR\} fostered by wet conditions, K input and cooler temperatures enabled plants at Ntungamo to attain the threshold total dry mass sooner than those at Kawanda, hence the phenotypic plasticity in age at flowering. Net assimilation rate contributed at least 90% to \{RGR\} increase due to wet conditions at both sites. The contribution of \{NAR\} to \{RGR\} increase in response to K at Kawanda reduced to 38% while that for \{SLA\} increased to 49%. Net assimilation rate contributes more to highland banana \{RGR\} modulation than \{SLA\} except when warmer conditions reduce NAR. Differences in crop growth rate cause phenotypic plasticity in highland banana rate of phenological development. "

Uganda is the largest banana producer and 2nd largest coffee producer in Africa. Both crops are predominantly grown as monocultures. However, coffee–banana intercropping is common in densely populated areas. This study assessed the profitability of intercropped coffee–banana systems compared to mono-cropped systems in regions growing Arabica (Mt. Elgon) and Robusta (south and west) coffee in Uganda. The study was carried out in 152 plots in 2006/2007. Data were collected through structured farmer interviews, field measurements and observations. Coffee yields did not differ significantly (P ⩽ 0.05) between mono-crops and intercrops. Arabica coffee yields were 1.23 and 1.18 t ha−1 year−1 of green beans in mono-cropped and intercropped plots, respectively. Robusta yields averaged 1.25 and 1.09 t ha−1 year−1 of green beans in mono-crops and intercrops, respectively. Banana yields were significantly higher (P ⩽ 0.05) in intercrops (20.19 t ha−1 year−1) compared with mono-crops (14.82 t ha−1 year−1) in Arabica growing region. In Robusta growing region, banana yields were significantly lower (P ⩽ 0.05) in intercrops (8.89 t ha−1 year−1) compared with mono-crops (15.04 t ha−1 year−1). Marginal rate of returns of adding banana to mono-cropped coffee was 911% and 200% in Arabica and Robusta growing regions, respectively. Fluctuations in coffee prices are not likely to affect the acceptability of intercrops when compared with coffee mono-crops in both regions, but an increase in wage rates by 100% can make intercropping unacceptable in Robusta growing region. This study showed that coffee–banana intercropping is much more beneficial than banana or coffee mono-cropping and that agricultural intensification of food and cash crops in African smallholder systems should not solely depend on the mono-crop pathway.

Yellow maize contains both pro-vitamin A and nonprovitamin A carotenoids with potential health benefits to humans. An improvement in the concentration of these compounds can have a positive impact on dietary intakes in areas where yellow maize is consumed. An essential first step in breeding yellow maize for enhanced carotenoid concentrations involves an assessment of the carotenoid diversity of adapted maize inbred lines. Trials were thus conducted (i) to explore the genetic variation in carotenoid concentrations among tropical-adapted yellow maize inbred lines, (ii) to assess the potential for concurrent improvement of different carotenoids and (iii) to determine the consistency of carotenoid concentrations in different locations. Seed samples of a large set of lines harvested from four trials grown in one location and a fifth trial grown in two locations were analyzed for carotenoid concentrations using HPLC. The analyses of variance revealed that carotenoid concentrations were not strongly affected by the differences in replications or locations. There were large differences among the tropical-adapted yellow maize inbred lines in lutein, zeaxanthin, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, α-carotene and total pro-vitamin A contents. As significant correlations were observed among carotenoids sharing a single branch of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, it should be feasible to increase the levels of multiple carotenoids simultaneously. Principal component analysis on the carotenoid composition of the yellow inbred lines identified some lines with higher levels of all carotenoids formed across both major branches of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, and other lines having higher levels of those carotenoids formed under a single major branch of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. These indicate that the selection of parental lines with diverse carotenoid profiles may possibly be exploited for genetic improvement of carotenoids in tropical maize. "

The tests included five treatments (diets): pollen of three plant species—Zea mays L. (maize), of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit, and of Ricinus communis L.—cassava foliar exudate, and cassava leaf tissue (as the control). Neoseiulus idaeus did not complete development (hence no reproduction occurred) on any of the offered foods. Both T. aripo and T. manihoti successfully completed immature development—albeit in small proportions—on pollen of maize and L. leucocephala and on cassava foliar exudate. Only T. aripo completed immature development on pollen of R. communis and cassava leaf tissue; on the latter two foods, however, only males reached the adult stage. Moreover, of the five diets, none except pollen of maize was suitable for reproduction, and only for T. aripo, as T. manihoti did not reproduce on any of these diets. The duration of immature development of T. aripo was shorter on pollen of maize (6.9 days) than on cassava foliar exudate (11.1 days), while an intermediate value was recorded on pollen of L. leucocephala (8.6 days). Typhlodromalus manihoti developed faster on pollen of maize and cassava foliar exudate (6.8 days) than on pollen of L. leucocephala (9.8 days). Typhodromalus aripo lived much longer on pollen of maize and cassava foliar exudate compared with T. manihoti, whereas the two predator species had nearly similar female longevity on pollen of L. leucocephala. These results suggest that consumption of pollen of maize, pollen of L. leucocephala, or cassava foliar exudate can enhance development of T. aripo and T. manihoti in the absence of M. tanajoa, their preferred prey. Pollen of maize was suitable for T. aripo in completing oögenesis and hence allowing the predator to increase in abundance during shortages of M. tanajoa. The implications of our findings for the persistence of the acarine predator–prey system on cassava, and for the success of biological control of M. tanajoa in Africa are discussed. "

Data analysis showed that there were significant differences ( P &lt; 0.0 0 0 1 ) between the two treatments for the number of holes, number of insects, weight of each chip as well as damage.

A comprehensive literature review on nutrient balances in Africa was carried out to illustrate the main approaches, challenges, and progress, with emphasis on issues of scale. The review showed nutrient balances being widely used across the continent. The collected dataset from 57 peer-reviewed studies indicated, however, that most of the balances were calculated at plot and farm scale, and generated in East Africa. Data confirmed the expected trend of negative balances in the continent for nitrogen and potassium, where &gt;75% of selected studies had mean values below zero. For phosphorus only 56% of studies showed negative mean balances. Several cases with positive nutrient balances indicated that soil nutrient mining cannot be generalized across the continent. Land use systems of wealthier farmers mostly presented higher nitrogen and phosphorus balances than systems of poorer farmers (p &lt; 0.001). Plots located close to homesteads also usually presented higher balances than plots located relatively farther away (p &lt; 0.05). Partial nutrient balances were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) than full balances calculated for the same systems, but the later carried more uncertainties. The change in magnitude of nutrient balances from plot to continental level did not show any noticeable trend, which challenges prevailing assumptions that an increasing trend exists. However, methodological differences made a proper inter-scale comparison of results difficult. Actually, the review illustrated the high diversity of methods used to calculate nutrient balances and highlighted the main pit-falls, especially when nutrient flows and balances were scaled-up. Major generic problems were the arbitrary inclusion/exclusion of flows from the calculations, short evaluation periods, and difficulties on setting of spatial-temporal boundaries, inclusion of lateral flows, and linking the balances to soil nutrient stocks. The need for properly describing the methods used and reporting the estimates (i.e. appropriate units and measure of variability and error) were also highlighted. Main challenges during scaling-up were related to the type of aggregation and internalization of nutrient flows, as well as issues of non-linearity, and spatial variability, resolution and extent, which have not been properly addressed yet. In fact, gathered information showed that despite some few initiatives, scaling-up methods are still incipient. Lastly, promising technologies and recommendations to deal with these challenges were presented to assist in future research on nutrient balances at different spatial scales in Africa and worldwide.

Agriculture is a climate-dependent activity and hence is highly sensitive to climatic changes and climate variability. Nevertheless, there is a knowledge gap when agricultural researchers intend to assess the production of minor crops for which data or models are not available. Therefore, we integrated the current expert knowledge reported in the FAO-EcoCrop database, with the basic mechanistic model (also named EcoCrop), originally developed by Hijmans et al. (2001). We further developed the model, providing calibration and evaluation procedures. To that aim, we used sorghum (Sorghum bicolor Moench) as a case study and both calibrated EcoCrop for the sorghum crop and analyzed the impacts of the SRES-A1B 2030s climate on sorghum climatic suitability. The model performed well, with a high true positive rate (TPR) and a low false negative rate (FNR) under present conditions when assessed against national and subnational agricultural statistics (min \{TPR\} = 0.967, max \{FNR\} = 0.026). The model predicted high sorghum climatic suitability in areas where it grows optimally and matched the sorghum geographic distribution fairly well. Negative impacts were predicted by 2030s. Vulnerabilities in countries where sorghum cultivation is already marginal are likely (with a high degree of certainty): the western Sahel region, southern Africa, northern India, and the western coast of India are particularly vulnerable. We highlight the considerable opportunity of using EcoCrop to assess global food security issues, broad climatic constraints and regional crop-suitability shifts in the context of climate change and the possibility of coupling it with other large-area approaches.

Negative nutrient balances at farm scale or at larger scales are very often presented as proof that soil fertility is at stake in SSA. However, nutrient balances at plot and farm section scale are not always negative. In areas with large nutrient stocks, short-term nutrient mining is fully acceptable. Fertilizer use continues to face considerable controversy in SSA. In this paper, we demonstrate that fertilizers rarely damage the soil; that fertilizers are being used in SSA, often with favourable value-to-cost ratios; and that fertilizers do not cause eutrophication in SSA. Rock phosphates are abundantly present in \{SSA\} but most are poorly soluble. Adding these phosphates to compost heaps does not enhance the short-term availability of their P. Although organic inputs are essential soil amendments besides fertilizer, organic inputs alone cannot sustain crop production due to limitations in their quality and availability. Organic resources can also potentially stimulate harmful pests and diseases. Legumes are often advocated as important sources of organic matter but not all legumes fix nitrogen, require inoculation, or are a source of free nitrogen, as even green manures require land and labour. Certain grain legumes with high N harvest indices do not improve soil fertility, but remove net amounts of N from the soil. These myths need correction if we are to harness the role of science in the overall goal of assisting farmers to address the acute problems of poor soil fertility for smallholder farmers in SSA. "

The soils used are classified as Typic Kandiudox (TKO), Rhodic Kandiudult (RKU), and Typic Kandiudult (TKU). Analysis of variance, regression, and principal component analyses were used for data analysis and interpretation. Shoot dry matter yield (DMY) was significantly affected by soil type and P rate with no significant interaction. Predicted maximum attainable \{DMY\} was lowest in the \{TKO\} (26.2 g pot−1) as compared to 35.6 and 36.7 g pot−1 for the \{RKU\} and TKU, respectively. Properties that positively influenced \{DMY\} were the levels of inorganic NaHCO3-extractable P, individual basic cations (Ca, Mg, and K), and pH. Their effects contrasted with those of exchangeable Al and C/N ratio, which significantly depressed DMY. Principal component analysis yielded similar results, identifying 4 orthogonal components, which accounted for 84.7% of the total system variance (TSV). Principal component 1 was identified as soil nutrient deficiency explaining 35.9% of TSV. This soil quality varied significantly among the studied soils, emerging as the only soil quality which significantly (P &lt; 0.05) correlated with maize growth.

Findings show that HIV/AIDS poses a significant and complex threat to the already deficient soil fertility management practices among smallholders. The disease's synergistic relation with poverty increases the stress on soil fertility management. It destructs local social structures and households by taking away resource persons, overburdening traditional insurance systems, and obliterating any modest capital and labour useful for soil fertility management that has been accumulated by the household. There is need for robust soil fertility policy-action frameworks that can be sustained under the limiting conditions of affected households and that can mitigate HIV/AIDS impacts amidst high poverty.

Although cassava mosaic disease (CMD) has been an important constraint to cassava production in Africa for more than a century, changes in the nature of the disease during the last two decades have led to losses on a hitherto unprecedented scale. Strategic epidemiological studies that have traced the development and spread of what is now known as the African \{CMD\} pandemic have provided vital insights into the mechanisms and pattern through which this disease is spread and the critical interactions with its whitefly vector, B. tabaci. Based on this new knowledge, an effective and wide-ranging management programme has been implemented utilizing each of the principal virus management tools, although the primary focus has been on the deployment of host-plant resistance. There has been a substantial impact in areas where management programmes have run for several years. The best example of this is Uganda, where more than a third of the cassava crop is under CMD-resistant varieties. "

The choice of fields was unbiased, and insect populations were estimated from large random samples. Seven years after the first release of E. lopezi, the entire area, with the exception of an isolated \{CM\} population near Lake Chad, had been colonized by the parasitoid. Within the area of distribution of E. lopezi, average \{CM\} populations were very low (1.6 \{CM\} per shoot tip), highest densities being found in the forest transition zone. The mean tip damage score on a scale from 1 to 5 was only 1.2. Only 3.2% of all tips were strongly stunted, the same percentage had more than 10 CM, and no tip had over 1000 CM. However, significant tip damage persisted on the 4.8% of fileds with unmulched, sandy soils in the forest zone. In these fields, 3.3 times fewer \{CM\} were needed to cause heavy stunting than on less stressed plants on soils with mulch, or clay, or less rain. This deleterious effect of leaching and lack of crop rotation was alleviated completely in the fields which had a small amount of mulch.

The perceived relative and absolute gravity of pests, and the techniques used against them, varied between areas.

Targeted technology application may help to improve the efficient use of limited nutrient and water resources. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal combination of fertilizer micro-dosing and manure application rates for improved millet yield and enhanced water use efficiency in low input millet-based cropping system. A two-year field experiment was conducted at a research station in Niger using a randomized complete block design with three replications. The treatments consisted of the factorial combination of: (i) two fertilizer micro-dosing options (20 kg ha−1 of diammonium phosphate (DAP) and 60 kg ha−1 of \{NPK\} corresponding to 2 g hill−1 of \{DAP\} and 6 g hill−1 of NPK, respectively), (ii) cattle manure at four application rates (0 kg ha−1, 1000 kg ha−1, 2000 kg ha−1, 3000 kg ha−1) and (iii) two methods of manure application (broadcasting and hill placement). Millet grain yields under fertilizer micro-dosing combined with manure was increased on average by 59%, 83% and 113% for 1000 kg ha−1, 2000 kg ha−1 and 3000 kg ha−1, respectively compared with fertilizer micro-dosing alone. Combined applications of manure and fertilizer micro-dosing increased water use efficiency significantly. Hill placement of manure increased total dry matter on average by 23% and water use efficiency by 35% relative to manure broadcasting. The total root length density was increased by 66% and 42% in hill placement of manure at 25 cm and 50 cm, respectively, from the hill centre compared with manure broadcast. These results indicate that millet production with the fertilizer micro-dosing technology can be improved further by hill-placement of manure. The combination of 2000 kg ha−1 of manure and 20 kg \{DAP\} ha−1 hill-placed were most promising for increasing millet yield and the efficient use of limited nutrients and water in Sahelian millet based systems. There is need for testing this technology further together with farmers to valuate its effectiveness. "

The colonization of individual maize stalks originating from fields in The Netherlands, Italy and Nigeria by Fusarium spp. was quantified using specific TaqMan-PCR assays. Highest values were found for F. graminearum and Fusarium avenaceum in Dutch samples, for F. graminearum and \{FUM\} producing species (F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum) in Italian samples and \{FUM\} producing Fusarium spp. in Nigerian samples. The increase in Fusarium spp. colonization under field conditions during a period of 3–6 months after harvest of the maize crops varied considerably between individual stalks. The fungal and bacterial diversity was analyzed for sub-sets of stalks with high versus low increase of Fusarium colonization. Bacterial taxonomic groups such as Bacillus, Curtobacterium, Erwinia, Flavobacterium, Novosphingobium, Pantoea, Sphingomonas, Rahnella and Staphylococcus and fungal taxonomic groups such as Acremomium sp., Cryptococcus flavescens, Cryptococcus zeae, Leptosphaeria sp. and Microdochium bolleyi were more abundant in the stalks with lower increase in pathogen colonization.

In the Vuli season, a cool rainy season from September to December, white polythene mulch produced significantly more grain yield of maize, cowpea, and soybean than other treatments. Results of crop performance for the no-till treatment and of rainfall erosivity index are not in agreement with those previously experienced in West Africa. "

In Sub-Saharan Africa and (to a lesser extent) in South Asia, limited data availability and institutional networking constrain agricultural research and development. Here we performed a review of relevant aspects in relation to coupling agriculture–climate predictions, and a three-step analysis of the importance of climate data for agricultural impact assessment. First, using meta-data from the scientific literature we examined trends in the use of climate and weather data in agricultural research, and we found that despite agricultural researchers’ preference for field-scale weather data (50.4% of cases in the assembled literature), large-scale datasets coupled with weather generators can be useful in the agricultural context. Using well-known interpolation techniques, we then assessed the sensitivities of the weather station network to the lack of data and found high sensitivities to data loss only over mountainous areas in Nepal and Ethiopia (random removal of data impacted precipitation estimates by ±1300 mm/year and temperature estimates by ±3 °C). Finally, we numerically compared \{IPCC\} Fourth Assessment Report (4AR) climate models’ representation of mean climates and interannual variability with different observational datasets. Climate models were found inadequate for field-scale agricultural studies in West Africa and South Asia, as their ability to represent mean climates and climate variability was limited: more than 50% of the country-model combinations showed &lt;50% adjustment for annual mean rainfall (mean climates), and there were large rainfall biases in \{GCM\} outputs (1000–2500 mm/year), although this varied on a \{GCM\} basis (climate variability). Temperature biases were also large for certain areas (5–10 °C in the Himalayas and Sahel). All this is expected to improve with IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report; hence, appropriate usage of even these new climate models is still required. This improved usage entails bias reduction (weighting of climate models or bias-correcting the climate change signals), the implementation of methods to match the spatial scales, and the quantification of uncertainties to the maximum extent possible.

Analysis indicates that the performance of irrigated areas will be affected by such diverse factors as crop prices, subsidies, the availability of water, land taxes and the price of water, the existence of markets for non-traditional crops, the size of fields and the technological skills of farmers. The development priorities for improving the economic performance of agriculture in the Odivelas region were identified.

The results indicated that \{RCTLR9\} cDNA contains 3141 bp. It encodes 1047 amino acids containing 16 typical structures of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) including an LRRTYP, \{LRRCT\} and a motif involved in \{PAMP\} binding was identified at position 240–253 amino acid. Broad expression of \{RCTLR9\} was found in larval, juvenile and adult stages irrespective of the tissues. In larval stage, \{RCTLR9\} mRNA expression decreased at 5 d and then increased at 10 dph. At juvenile stage cobia, the expression was significantly high (p &lt; 0.05) in spleen and intestine compared to gill, kidney, liver and skin. However, at adult stage, the significant high expression was found in gill and intestine. Cobia challenged with P. damselae subsp. piscicida showed significant increase in \{RCTLR9\} expression at 24 h post challenge in intestine, spleen and liver, while in kidney the expression was peak at 12 h and later it decreased at 24 h. The highest expression was 40 fold increase in spleen and the lowest expression was ∼3.6 fold increase in liver. Cobia stimulated with CpG oligonucleotides showed that the induction of these genes was CpG \{ODN\} type and time dependent. In spleen and liver, CpG \{ODNs\} 1668 and 2006 injected group showed high expression of RCTLR9, IL-1β, chemokine \{CC\} compared to other groups.

The reported experiment was conducted from 1993 to 1996 in fallow plots established in 1989 to rehabilitate a degraded Alfisol after 10 years of continuous cultivation of maize/cassava. Treatments consisted of four plots each of woody legume species (Acacia auriculiformis, A. leptocarpa, Leucaena leucocephala, and Senna siamea), and a herbaceous legume cover crop (Pueraria phaseoloides). Two controls (natural bush fallow and continuous maize/cassava) were included. Each treatment was cleared and cultivated in 1993 and 1995 (after 4 and 6 year fallow). Cultivation was repeated in 1994 for plots cleared in 1993 and in 1996 for subplots cleared in 1995. In all the years, weed density and dry weight was lower in planted fallows than in the controls. Per capita weed population growth rate decreased in all the fallow treatments most notably in A. auriculiformis and S. siamea fallow. All fallow species except A. auriculiformis would require more than 6 years of fallow to prevent growth of the weed population over the long term. The weed seed bank was 75% lower in A. auriculiformis and P. phaseoloides fallow than the control plots. Canonical correspondence and redundancy analysis indicated differences in species composition between treatments in the aboveground weed flora and in the weed seed bank. Cynodon dactylon and Digitaria horizontalis dominated continuously cultivated maize/cassava plots. Chromolaena odorata occurred more in natural bush fallow. In contrast, annual broadleaf weeds dominated the planted fallow treatments. Die Einsatz von stickstoffbindenden Bäumen und Bodenbedeckungspflanzen zur Unkrautbekämpfung in kleinbäuerlichen Anbausystemen ist eine vielversprechende Alternative zum traditionellen Wanderfeldbau. Zwischen 1993 und 1996 wurde auf einem degradierten Alfisol ein Feldversuch durchgeführt, mit dem Ziel, den Einfluss von verschiedenen Brachesystemen auf den Unkrautbefall zu ermitteln. Die Versuchsfläche hatte seit 1989 brachgelegen, zwischen 1979 und 1989 wurde die Fläche alljährlich zum Anbau von Mais und Maniok genutzt. Der Versuch beinhaltete fünf Behandlungen mit verbesserter Brache: Acacia auriculiformis, A. leptocarpa, Leucaena leucocephala und Senna siamea als Baumleguminosen and Pueraria phaseoloides als stickstoffbinden Bodenbedecker. Als Kontrollbehandlungen dienten Naturbrache und jährlicher Anbau von Mais/Maniok. Alle Parzellen wurden nach 4- und 6-jähriger Brache in 1993 and 1995 kultiviert, die Bodenbearbeitung auf diesen Parzellen wurde jeweils im folgenden Jahr wiederholt. In allen Jahren waren die Unkrautdichte und Unkrauttrockenmasseerträge in den Baum- und P. phaseoloides Parzellen geringer als in den Kontrollparzellen. Die Abnahme war deutlich niedriger in A. auriculiformis und in S. siamea. Mit Ausnahme von A. auriculiformis, würden alle verbesserten Brachesysteme mehr als 6 Jahre benötigen, um die Wachstumrate der Unkrautpopulation zu hemmen. Die Unkrautsaatgutdichte im Boden war 75% niedriger in A. auriculiformis und in P. phaseoloides Parzellen als in der Kontrolle. Canonical Korrespondenz- und Redundanzanalysen zeigten, dass die Behandlungen die Zusammensetzung der Unkrautarten sowie die Unkrautsaatgutdichte beeinflussten. Cynodon dactylon und Digitaria horizontalis waren die dominanten Arten in den Parzellen, auf denen jährlich Mais/Maniok angebaut wurde. Chromolaena odorata war die dominante Art in Parzellen mit Naturbrache während einjährige, zweikeimblättrige Unkrautarten in den verbesserten Bracheparzellen vorherrschend waren. "

At both locations, the experiment was arranged as a split-plot design. The main plots were green manure legumes (Pueraria phaseoloides [Roxb.] Benth in Ibadan and Aeschynomene histrix Poir. in Zaria), a forage legume (Stylosanthes guianensis [Aubl.] Sw.), grain legumes (cowpea [Vigna unguiculata {L.} Walp ‘IT-90K-284-2’ or soybean [Glycine max {L.} Merr ‘TGx 1864 and \{TGx\} 1485-1 D’), natural bush fallow, and continuous cropping with maize [Zea mays L.]/cassava [Manihot esculenta Crantz] ‘82/00058’ at Ibadan and maize at Zaria.

Results showed that a single spray at budding, flowering and podding had the highest marginal returns (3.12) in comparison to spraying throughout the season (1.77) and at seedling, flowering and podding stages (2.18). The best treatments from these two experiments were combined and compared to the single control measures, and the untreated control.

Phenological traits such as plant height and number of days to flowering had low direct effects on bunch weight, but their indirect effects via fruit traits were high.

The present study is the first attempt to measure the impact of the biological control of mango mealybug over a large area, through a survey of mango producers. Most producers attributed the observed improvement of mango production to the success of biological control. Based on production estimates by producers, the negative impact of the pest on plant production and the positive impact of the introduced natural enemy were demonstrated. Interviewed mango producers gained on average US$ 328 per year by the biological control programme. Extrapolated to all producers of Benin, a yearly gain of US$ 50 million in mango production can be estimated. The present value of accrued benefits is estimated at US$ 531 million over a period of 20 years. The total cost of the biological control of mango mealybug is estimated at US$ 3.66 million, which includes initial costs in other African countries and the introduction of the natural enemy from India, resulting in a benefit–cost ratio of 145:1 for benefits in Benin alone.

Regular magnets can be used to separate TiO2/Fe3O4 particles from solution. There have not been any significant weight and photocatalytic activity lost during 2 reusings. After 60 min and 120 min \{VFL\} irradiation, the bactericidal efficiencies of TiO2/Fe3O4 are 35% and 72 % for Streptococcus iniae and 35% and 53% for Edwardsiella tarda, respectively.

Here, a three-dimensional conceptual framework of ‘power as domination’ is applied to the \{UNFCCC\} adaptation regime. We argue that this ‘power-over’ framing is an important lens through which to view adaptation, a field dominated by ‘power-to’, capacity-based constructs. The framework distinguishes between power-over manifesting through decision-making, agenda setting and preference shaping. Through a literature review we demonstrate that first and second dimension behavioral views of power-over fail to account for the subtle ways in which the interests and preferences of smallholder farmers are unknowingly shaped and restricted within the regime. Potential sources of third dimension preference shaping power are explored in a survey with high-level decision makers involved in National Adaptation Plans (NAP) development in seven countries. The results suggest that several inter-related features of the international agriculture adaptation regime collectively contribute to the shaping of interests and preferences of smallholders: prevailing discourses of uncertainty and the perceived limited capacity of smallholders; the resulting privileged status of ‘expert’ decision makers; the predominance of neoliberal development rationalities; and systemic biases resulting from the nation state as the principle unit of \{UNFCCC\} negotiation. These forces lie beyond the explanatory scope of first and second dimensions of power-over and help to explain why stakeholder engagement in adaptation decision making remains superficial in nature and why adaptation responses in agriculture can be considered ‘common and non-differentiated’. We argue for increased awareness of third dimension manifestations and impacts of power in adaptation literature to facilitate the improved participation of marginalized stakeholders in \{UNFCCC\} and domestic adaptation decision making forums, to increase the diversity of adaptation options available to smallholders, and ultimately, to improve the attribution of responsibility for adaptation outcomes.

Three selected provenances out of 23 provenances that had in an earlier experiment been examined at low and high P levels (20 mg and 80 mg P kg−1 soil) were further studied at four levels of P application in the greenhouse at IITA, Ibadan using an Alfisol collected from Fashola. The field experiment was conducted at Fashola (Guinea Savanna Zone), southwestern Nigeria. Large differences in growth occurred among the G. sepium provenances at both low and high P levels. Growth responses of the three provenances to increasing P levels were linear in the pot experiment but variable (linear and quadratic) in the field experiment. Field data show that the growth of one provenance (G1) did not respond to P application while provenance \{G3\} required 80 kg P ha−1 to achieve maximum biomass. Provenance \{G2\} responded to P application up to 40 kg P ha−1 and further addition of P depressed its growth, P uptake and \{N2\} fixation. The results of the pot experiment were not completely duplicated in the field experiments. Differences between G. sepium provenances to P uptake and growth were largely related to differences in physiological P use efficiency and root length, especially at low P, both in the pot and field experiments. In general, nodulation was improved by P application, but varied among provenances. G. sepium fixed approximately 61% and 40% of its N from atmospheric \{N2\} in pot and field, respectively. The percentage of N fixed was affected by the low rate of P application i.e. 20 kg P ha−1 and at high rates of P, no further increase in percentage \{N2\} fixed occurred. "

Both the 15N isotope dilution and A-value methods were used to estimate BNF. Soil in the uninoculated and inoculated treatments were labelled with either 20 mg N kg−1 soil of 10 atom % 15N excess \{KNO3\} (designated unfertilized), or 100 mg N kg−1 soil of 2 atom % 15N excess \{KNO3\} (designated fertilized). Significant variation was found between provenances in shoot dry weight within uninoculated (up to 62% differences) and inoculated (up to 35% differences) treatments. There were no significant differences in atom % 15N excess between the N-fertilized G. sepium provenances. Atom 15N excess of the uninoculated unfertilized plants varied significantly between 1.413 and 2.440, and nodules were observed on the roots. The method used to measure \{BNF\} influenced the values obtained; the isotope dilution method gave significantly lower values than the A value method. Lower values of the isotope dilution method were attributed to the nodulation which occurred when reference plants were grown at the lower, but not higher, N rate. The A value method was consequently judged to provide more reliable estimates of BNF. The percentage of N derived from atmospheric \{N2\} varied among provenances and ranged from 56% for provenance 24/86 to 74% for provenances 14/84 and 15/84 all from Guatemala. Growth of provenances 11/86 from Costa Rica and 41/85 from Mexico responded well to inoculation but not to fertilizer, although having similar total N with both treatments.

This study assessed trait relationships among 196 common bean genotypes exposed to stresses for drought and field infestation of bean fly or bean stem maggot (BSM). The study was carried out at two locations and data was analyzed with linear correlation, path coefficient and genotype × trait biplot analyses. Multiple trait data related to mechanisms of drought and bean fly tolerance were collected on 196 genotypes grown under i) water deficit at mid-pod fill, or ii) unprotected against bean fly; iii) irrigated, well watered conditions, or iv) bean fly protection with chemicals. Seed yield exhibited positive and significant correlations with leaf chlorophyll content, vertical root pulling resistance, pod harvest index, pods per plant and seeds per pod at both phenotypic and genotypic levels under stress and non-stress conditions. Genotypic correlations of traits with seed yield were greater than their respective phenotypic correlations across environments indicating the greater contribution of genotypic factors to the trait correlation. Pods per plant and seeds per pod had high positive direct effects on seed yield both under stress and non-stress whereas pods per plant had the highest indirect effect on seed yield through pod harvest index under stress. In general, our results suggest that vertical root pulling resistance and pod harvest index are important selection objectives for improving seed yield in common beans under non-stress and stress conditions, and particularly useful for drought and \{BSM\} tolerance evaluation.

The occurrence of significant year-to-year changes of δ13C values of the plant inputs may complicate the technique, as it would require a systematic isotopic analysis of all plant inputs over the entire life span of the experiment. By analyzing crop and tree samples from different sampling times in a long-term agroforestry experiment under a sub-humid tropical climate we established that year-to-year variations in plant δ13C values were of the order of only 0.4–0.6‰, i.e. only 3–4% of the maximum tracer signal difference between \{C3\} and \{C4\} plants (∼15‰). Hence plant sampling and isotopic analysis can be limited to 2–3 years or even a single representative year in terms of weather. Important and consistent within-year variations were, however, observed for legume tree prunings (up to 2.4‰) and weeds (up to 7‰), pointing to the need for frequent sampling within a single year if such seasonal variation is suspected. Observed δ13C values for the weed vegetation revealed a clear shift in weed composition in terms of \{C3\} and \{C4\} weeds within the season and across treatments, as was confirmed by a visual weed species identification in the field.

Three soils from the humid forest zone were also included. Microbial C values calculated using the CO2-C production of the fumigated soils from d 10 to d 20 as control (Bio-C (II)) were better correlated with the flush of ninhydrin reactive N (NRN) during 10 d of fumigation than those calculated with the CO2-C production in the unfumigated soils from d 10 to d 20 as control (Bio-C (I)). The Bio-C (II) values also showed a more consistent range of values (22–210 mg C kg−1 soil) than the Bio-C (I) values. Using a kC factor of 0.35, which was considered to be more appropriate for our soils than a kC factor of 0.45, kC,NRN could be estimated as 22 and 16, for a 5- and 10-d fumigation, respectively. For all savanna soils, the \{NRN\} flush after 5 d of fumigation was closely related to the \{NRN\} flush after 10 d, indicating that a 5-d fumigation was sufficient provided that the k-values are adapted. Mineral N flushes during incubation and incubation after fumigation were small. Although microbial N values calculated as [NH4+-N flush of the fumigated soils (0–10 d)]/kN with kN=−0.014×(CO2-C-flush-to-NH4+-N-flush during fumigation)+0.39, which gave values of 14.0–100.7 mg N kg−1 soil, showed the best relationship with the \{NRN\} flush after 10 d of fumigation, microbial N values calculated as [(mineral N flush of the fumigated soils after 10 d)−(mineral N flush of the unfumigated soils after 10 d)]/0.68, which gave values of 3.4–46.2 mg N kg−1 soil, including 3 values &lt;2 mg N kg−1 soil and 1 negative value, yielded microbial C-to-N ratios (4.7–16.4) which were better reflecting the ratio C-flush-to-N-flush of fumigated soils (5.2–13.5). Using a kN value of 0.68, kN,NRN could be estimated as 1.5. Between 7 and 17% and between 11 and 28% of the total soil C was part of the soil litter (SL) (organic particles larger than 250 μm) and the particulate organic matter (POM) (organic particles larger than 53 μm), respectively. The CO2-C production of the unfumigated soils was strongly (P&lt;0.01) related to the SL-C content. Inclusion of the silt and clay content in a linear regression equation increased the \{R2\} value from 0.70 to 0.91. The Bio-C (II) content showed the best relationship with the C content of the soil particles between 53 and 20 μm and the silt fraction. The \{NRN\} flush after 10 d showed the best relationship with the C content of the particles between 250 and 53 μm and between 53 and 20 μm. Maximally 48% of the variation in Bio-C (II) values was explained by the C content of the various fractions, indicating that the present methods do not exclusively measure the active microbial biomass.

The survey, which gathered information on horticultural production practices, found that the average expenditure on agro-chemical inputs by horticultural producers using monocrop production systems was 190 US$/ha, which greatly exceeds the \{FAO\} reported national average expenditure of 6.50 US$/ha. A logit model of monocrop adoption indicated that the size of land holding per household had a negative effect on adoption, congruent with population-driven technical change and that increases in unit transportation costs significantly decreased the probability of adoption. These findings suggest that policy makers should target horticultural intensification in areas of higher population density and promote investment in rural roads. The age of the household head had a significant negative and elastic effect on adoption, which in combination with an increase in the cohort of younger farmers in the rural population induced by macro-economic events contributed to the spread of intensified horticulture. In the study area, roughly two-thirds of rural households also produce cocoa and the quantity of cocoa produced was positively associated with adoption of intensive horticultural systems suggesting that export crop promotion indirectly facilitated diversification of agriculture. Women’s participation in intensive monocrop production was limited and efforts to promote their greater involvement are recommended. "

Selective logging is one of the main sources of \{GHG\} emissions; but few studies in Cameroon have analyzed the impact of selective logging activities on above-ground biomass (AGB). This has resulted in a gap in essential information needed for the design of suitable forest management policies that can guarantee reductions in \{GHG\} emissions. In this study, we assessed the impact of selective logging on \{AGB\} in a forest concession in South-East Cameroon by quantifying \{AGB\} logged and \{AGB\} damaged by logging. We equally investigated through linear regression modeling whether the density of logging roads and \{NDVI3\} Normalized difference vegetation index. 3 values (from \{MODIS\} 250 m) can be used to predict the quantity of \{AGB\} logged. Allometric equations were used to estimate \{AGB\} of trees, while the surface area of logging infrastructures and the unit area value (ha−1) of \{AGB\} for the forest zone of Cameroon permitted the calculation of \{AGB\} damaged by logging. The study reveals that 0.78 trees ha−1; an equivalence of 6.97 Mg ha −1 of \{AGB\} was logged. Logging affected a surface area of 85.04 ha; approximately 2% of the study area. This is equivalent to 0.02 ha ha−1 and 5.65 Mg ha−1 of \{AGB\} damaged. The density of the logging roads explained 66% of the variation in \{AGB\} logged, while the density of the logging roads and \{NDVI\} values together explained 73% of the variation. This study concludes as follows: (i) selective logging reduces \{AGB\} stock of the forest and the magnitude of the impact varies with the different activities of selective logging, (ii) ground-based measurements facilitated by \{GIS\} permitted to quantify the impact of selective logging on AGB, (iii) logging roads and \{NDVI\} (which can either be field measured or captured remotely) can be used to indirectly determine \{AGB\} logged, hence can contribute in the measurement and monitoring of forest degradation caused by selective logging, and (iv) the findings from this study can usefully support the design of sustainable forest management policies, which are beneficiary to the \{REDD\} + process in Cameroon.

One of CA's key principles is the maintenance of soil cover often by retaining a proportion of crop residues on the field as mulch. Yet smallholder crop–livestock systems across Africa and Asia face trade-offs among various options for crop residue use. Knowledge of the potential trade-offs of leaving more residues as mulch is only partial and the objective of this research is to address some of these knowledge gaps by assessing the trade-offs in contrasting settings with mixed crop–livestock systems. The paper draws from village surveys in 12 sites in 9 different countries across Sub-Sahara Africa and South Asia. Sites were clustered into 3 groups along the combined population and livestock density gradients to assess current crop residue management practices and explore potential challenges to adopting mulching practices in different circumstances. Results show that although high-density sites face higher potential pressure on resources on an area basis, biomass production tends to be more substantial in these sites covering demands for livestock feed and allowing part of the residues to be used as mulch. In medium-density sites, although population and livestock densities are relatively lower, biomass is scarce and pressure on land and feed are high, increasing the pressure on crop residues and their opportunity cost as mulch. In low-density areas, population and livestock densities are relatively low and communal feed and fuel resources exist, resulting in lower potential pressure on residues on an area basis. Yet, biomass production is low and farmers largely rely on crop residues to feed livestock during the long dry season, implying substantial opportunity costs to their use as mulch. Despite its potential benefit for smallholder farmers across the density gradient, the introduction of CA-based mulching practices appears potentially easier in sites where biomass production is high enough to fulfil existing demands for feed and fuel. In sites with relatively high feed and fuel pressure, the eventual introduction of \{CA\} needs complementary research and development efforts to increase biomass production and/or develop alternative sources to alleviate the opportunity costs of leaving some crop residues as mulch.

We observed \{SOC\} content changes in a 16-year continuously cropped agroforestry experiment in Ibadan, south-western Nigeria. \{SOC\} levels declined in all treatments. The decline was most pronounced in the no-tree control treatments with continuous maize and cowpea cropping, where \{SOC\} levels dropped from the initial 15.4 to 7.3–8.0 Mg C ha−1 in the 0–12 cm topsoil in 16 years. In the two continuously cropped alley cropping (AC) systems, one with Leucaena leucocephala and one with Senna siamea trees, \{SOC\} levels dropped to 10.7–13.2 Mg C ha−1. Compared to the no-tree control treatments, an annual application of an additional 8.5 Mg ha−1 (dry matter) of plant residues, mainly tree prunings, led to an extra 3.5 Mg C ha−1 (∼0.2% C) in the 0–12 cm top soil after 11 years, and 4.1 Mg C ha−1 after 16 years. The addition of \{NPK\} fertilizer had little effect on the quantities of above-ground plant residues returned to the soil, and there was no evidence that the fertilizer affected the rate of \{SOC\} decomposition.

Decomposition was very fast, illustrated by the fact that we had to double all decomposition rate constants in the model in order to simulate the measured contrasts in \{SOC\} contents and δ13C between the \{AC\} treatments and the no-tree controls. We hypothesized (1) that the pruning materials from the legume trees and/or the extra rhizodeposition from the tree roots in the \{AC\} treatments accelerated the decomposition of the \{SOC\} present at the start of the experiment (true C-priming), and/or (2) that the physical protection of microbial biomass and metabolites by the clay fraction on this site, having a sandy top soil in which clay minerals are mainly of the 1:1 type, is lower than assumed by the model.

Slashing the vegetation caused a severe decline in surface casting activity, whether or not the plot was cropped afterwards. There was a significant interaction between burning and mulching such that there was significantly lower cast production when mulch was removed by burning than when it was removed by mechanical means. Soil temperature was lower when plots were cropped and mulched but no discernible effects of treatments upon soil water content were found.

This paper aims to characterize the plant-to-plant variability in yield and to identify its underlying causes for the two major yam species (Dioscorea alata and Dioscorea rotundata). Four field experiments were carried out between 2006 and 2009 in Benin. Yams were grown using a traditional cropping method (i.e. in mounds at 0.7 plants m−2) without biotic or abiotic stresses. In order to test interplant competition, a low density treatment (0.08 plants m−2) was included for D. alata in the 2006 experiment. Throughout four years of experimentation, yields varied from 12 Mg ha−1 to 21 Mg ha−1. Both yam species presented a high interplant coefficient of variation (CV) for tuber yield (42–71%). The unbiased Gini coefficient (G′) was used to measure how steep a hierarchy is in an absolute sense. \{CV\} and G′ of individual plant biomass both confirm clear plant size hierarchies from early growth. However, no difference in the \{CV\} of plant size and plant tuber yield was observed between high and low plant density. This implies that, despite early interaction between neighbouring plants, competition was not the driving factor controlling plant variability. In fact uneven emergence proved to be the primary cause. Yam emergence takes place over a long period (e.g. it took 51 and 47 days for the 90% central range to emerge for D. alata and D. rotundata, respectively), creating an early inter-plant size hierarchy which later affected tuber production. For both species, plants which emerged early initiated their tuberization earlier in the growing season and reached higher maximum yield regardless of weather conditions (e.g. 1200 and 764 g plant−1 for early-emerging D. alata and D. rotundata plants respectively, and 539 and 281 g plant−1 for late-emerging plants). Plant size hierarchization together with its observed left-skewed distribution, led to reduce total and marketable yield by increasing the proportion of small tubers. These results highlight the need to better understand the underlying mechanisms controlling the yams’ uneven emergence before attempting to improve traditional cropping systems. "

In the present study, the effect of a low P supply on the distribution of photosynthetic carbon of one high-yielding improved hybrid cultivar, \{ICPH\} 8 and two low-yielding non-hybrid cultivars, \{ICPL\} 87 and \{UPAS\} 120, were compared by feeding the plants 13CO2 at the vegetative and reproductive stages of development. A low P supply significantly decreased plant biomass, P uptake, average leaf area and photosynthetic activity of all genotypes; the decrease was smallest in \{ICPH\} 8 and largest in \{UPAS\} 120. \{ICPH\} 8 retained more plant biomass at low P supply due to higher P-absorption capacity rather than high P-utilization efficiency. The tolerance of \{ICPH\} 8 to low P is mostly related to its maintenance of a high leaf area and rate of photosynthesis. In contrast, P deficiency severely reduced leaf initiation of the sensitive cultivar \{UPAS\} 120, and reduced its photosynthesis. Under limiting P supply, partitioning of 13C increased in favor of the roots in all cultivars, but the resistant cultivar \{ICPH\} 8 partitioned less 13C to roots, and invested more in shoot growth compared to the non-hybrid cultivars. Similarly, partitioning of 13C to the raceme was greater in \{ICPL\} 87 than in the highly sensitive \{UPAS\} 120. It is concluded that P deficiency affects primarily sink activity by restricting cellulose biosynthesis in the meristematic sink cells. "

Forage and seed yields were significantly correlated (r = 0.53), but seed yield was poorly correlated with forage quality indices examined.

Our protocol uses only one way hash functions and eliminates online dictionary attacks by implementing a challenge–response system. This challenge–response system is designed in a fashion that it hardly poses any difficulty to a genuine user but is extremely burdensome, time consuming and computationally intensive for an adversary trying to launch as many as hundreds of thousands of authentication requests as in case of an online dictionary attack.

As a result of the increasing demand and low availability of alternative resources, \{CR\} became an essential resource for household activities, especially for livestock keeping; a major livelihood element of smallholder farmers in the developing world. Farmers’ decisions on \{CR\} use are determined by farmers’ preferences, total crop production, availability of alternative resources and demand for CR. Interaction of these determinants can result in pressures and trade-offs of \{CR\} use. Determinants, pressures and trade-offs are shaped by the specific socio-economic and agro-ecological context of these mixed farms. The objective of this paper is to provide a comparative analysis of the determinants of \{CR\} use and to examine some options to cope with pressures and trade-offs in 12 study sites across Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Drawing on socio-economic data at household and village level, we describe how cereal intensification and livestock feed demand influence use, pressures and trade-offs of \{CR\} use across study sites, specifically cereal residue. Our results show that in low cereal production and livestock feed demand sites, despite a low demand for \{CR\} and availability of alternative biomass, pressures and trade-offs of \{CR\} use are common particularly in the dry season. In sites with moderate cereal production, and low–moderate and moderate livestock feed demand, alternative biomass resources are scarce and most residues are fed to livestock or used to cover household needs. Subsequently, pressures and potential trade-offs are stronger. In sites with low cereal production and high livestock feed demand, pressures and trade-offs depend on the availability of better feed resources. Finally, sites with high cereal production and high livestock feed demand have been able to fulfil most of the demand for CR, limiting pressures and trade-offs. These patterns show that agricultural intensification, better management of communal resources and off-farm activities are plausible development pathways to overcome pressures and trade-offs of \{CR\} use. Although technologies can largely improve these trends, research and development should revisit past initiatives so as to develop innovative approaches to tackle the well-known problem of low agricultural production in many smallholder mixed systems, creating more sustainable futures.

A combination of models was used to analyse land use and labour allocation strategies for optimizing income for wealthy (2.5 ha with eight cattle) and poor (0.9 ha without cattle) farms in Murewa, Zimbabwe. Trade-offs between profitability, labour use and partial nutrient balances were also evaluated for alternative resource management strategies. Farm data were captured using the Integrated Modelling Platform for Mixed Animal-Crop Systems (IMPACT), which was directly linked to the Household Resource use Optimization Model (HROM). \{HROM\} was applied to optimize net cash income within the constraints specific to the households. Effects of alternative nutrient resource management strategies in crop and milk production were simulated using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and \{RUMINANT\} models, respectively, and the output evaluated using HROM. The poor farm had a net income of US$ 1 yr−1 and the farmer relied on selling unskilled labour to supplement her income. The poor farm’s income was marginally increased by US$18 yr−1 and the soil nitrogen (N) balance was increased from 6 to 9 kg ha−1 yr−1 by expanding groundnut production from the previous 5–25% of the land area. Further increases in area allocated to groundnut production were constrained by lack of labour. On the poor farm, maize production was most profitable when cultivated on a reduced land area with optimal weeding. The wealthy farm had a maize-dominated cropping system that yielded a net cash balance of US$290 yr−1, mainly from the sale of crop produce. Net income could be increased to US$1175 yr−1, by re-allocating the 240 hired labour-days more efficiently, although this reallocation substantially reduced partial soil N and phosphorus (P) balances by 74 kg N ha−1 and 11 kg P ha−1, respectively, resulting in negative nutrient balances. Few opportunities existed to increase productivity and income of the smallholder farms without inducing negative nutrient balances. On the wealthy farm, groundnut was the least profitable crop; shifting its production to the most fertile field did not improve income unless the groundnut residues were fed to lactating cows. The analysis carried out in this paper highlights the need to develop practical technological recommendations and development interventions that consider farm resource endowment (land, fertilizers, manure and labour), variability in soil fertility within farms and competing resource use options.

abstract = "Abstract The greatest current threat to cassava in sub-Saharan Africa, is the continued expansion of plant virus pandemics being driven by super-abundant populations of the whitefly vector, Bemisia tabaci. To track the association of putatively genetically distinct populations of B. tabaci with pandemics of cassava mosaic disease (CMD) and cassava brown streak disease (CBSD), a comprehensive region-wide analysis examined the phylogenetic relationships and population genetics of 642 B. tabaci adults sampled from cassava in six countries of East and Central Africa, between 1997 and 2010, using a mitochondrial \{DNA\} cytochrome oxidase I marker (780 bases). Eight phylogenetically distinct groups were identified, including one, designated herein as ‘East Africa 1’ (EA1), not previously described. The three most frequently occurring groups comprised &gt;95% of all samples. Among these, the Sub-Saharan Africa 2 (SSA2) group diverged by c. 8% from two \{SSA1\} sub-groups (SSA1-SG1 and SSA1-SG2), which themselves were 1.9% divergent. During the 14-year study period, the group associated with the \{CMD\} pandemic expansion shifted from \{SSA2\} to SSA1-SG1. Population genetics analyses of SSA1, using Tajima's D, Fu's Fs and Rojas’ \{R2\} statistics confirmed a temporal transition in \{SSA1\} populations from neutrally evolving at the outset, to rapidly expanding from 2000 to 2003, then back to populations more at equilibrium after 2004. Based on available evidence, hybrid introgression appears to be the most parsimonious explanation for the switch from \{SSA2\} to SSA1-SG1 in whitefly populations driving cassava virus pandemics in East and Central Africa.

A hierarchical dendrogram based on partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) of FT-IR data from 7 African yam species show phylogenetic relationship. In addition, the content of dioscin, a steroidal saponin found in yam tuber, was predicted using a \{PLS\} regression model with regression coefficient \{R2\} = 0.7208 indicated that prediction model had average accuracy. Thus, considering these results we suggest that FT-IR combined with multivariate analysis could be applied as a novel tool for metabolic evaluation and high-throughput screening of African yam lines with higher content of dioscin.

By associating the model parameters with measured properties (the pool that decomposes most rapidly equates with water-soluble C and N; the pool that decomposes slowest equates with lignin-C) the model performed better than the unmodified model in simulating the N mineralization from a range of feeds and faecal materials measured in an incubation experiment.

There is a pressing need for wide-scale innovation leading to development that improves the livelihoods and food security of the world's population while at the same time addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation. A variety of promising climate-smart interventions have been identified. However, what remains is the prioritization of interventions for investment and broad dissemination. The suitability and adoption of interventions depends on a variety of bio-physical and socio-economic factors. Also their impacts, when adopted and out-scaled, are likely to be highly heterogeneous. This heterogeneity expresses itself not only spatially and temporally but also in terms of the stakeholders affected, some might win and some might lose. A mechanism that can facilitate a systematic, holistic assessment of the likely spread and consequential impact of potential interventions is one way of improving the selection and targeting of such options. In this paper we provide climate smart agriculture (CSA) planners and implementers at all levels with a generic framework for evaluating and prioritising potential interventions. This entails an iterative process of mapping out recommendation domains, assessing adoption potential and estimating impacts. Through examples, related to livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa, we demonstrate each of the steps and how they are interlinked. The framework is applicable in many different forms, scales and settings. It has a wide applicability beyond the examples presented and we hope to stimulate readers to integrate the concepts in the planning process for climate-smart agriculture, which invariably involves multi-stakeholder, multi-scale and multi-objective decision-making.

The most abundant species, namely Alstonia boonei, Ricinodendron heudelotti and Terminalia superba, each contribute 5% to the total number of trees. These, and many of the other species, are known to form vesicular-arbuscular (VA) (endo-) mycorrhizal associations. Using a modification of the sucrose centrifugation method, spores of \{VA\} fungi were extracted from soil of undisturbed forest. The spores were attributed to five species of Acaulospora (laevigatum, mellea, morrowae, scrobiculata and spinosa), seven og Glomus (clavisporum, etunicatum, fasciculatum, geosporum, macrocarpum, occultum and rubiformis) and two of Scutellospora (coralloidea and pellucida). There were two other distinctive types of spores, \{C4\} and C12, with affinities to spores of Acaulospora and Scutellospora respectively. A few spores seemed to be parasitized. Of the 250 spores per 100 g dry soil 63% were attributed to G. etunicatum and 18%, 6% and 5% to aggregates of G. occultum/A. scrobiculata, A. mellea/A. morrowae and C12/S. pellucida respectively. Although spores were very unevenly distributed (Simpson's equitability index = 0.025), mean numbers in replicate plots (each 1 ha) were fairly consistent. However, numbers of C4, A. spinosa, A. laevigatum and G. occultum/A. scrobiculata were significantly larger near the trunks of Terminalia superba than at a distance (7.5–10 m away). Total numbers of spores extracted on different occasions sometimes differed significantly, but effects of season were not established. However, during the 2 year period of the investigation numbers of spores of some relatively sparse species consistently decreased while those of others increased. Total numbers of spores in the rhizosphere soils of four tree species were usually twice as large as those of spores in bulk soil (440–600 compared with 250 per 100 g dry soil). As in bulk soil, numbers of spores in rhizosphere soils were dominated by G. etunicatum and G. occultum/A. scrobiculata, but spores of A. mellea/A. morrowae, which tended to be restricted to Entrandrophragma cylindricum and Khaya sp., were replaced by those of G. geosporum. G. etunicatum was more strongly associated with Lovoa trichilioides than Entrandrophragma cylindricum, Khaya sp. and Triplochiton scleroxylon. On the other hand, G. fasciculatum/G. macrocarpum was linked with Entrandrophragma cylindricum, Lovoa trichilioides and Triplochiton scleroxylon but not Khaya sp. "

Two rainfed field experiments were conducted in Samaru, Nigeria in the 1993 and 1994 growing seasons with five maize cultivars under various rates of nitrogen fertilizer. The capacity of maize for rapid early root growth and to later develop a deep, dense root system was assessed. In addition, the effect of N fertilization on root growth of maize was studied in 1994. The widely cultivated cultivar TZB-SR had a poor root system in the surface soil layer and was more susceptible to early-season drought, as indicated by low plant vigor and aboveground dry matter yield during that time. It had a lower grain yield and a relatively small harvest index, but ranked among the highest in total aboveground dry matter production compared to other cultivars. The size of root system alone did not always relate well with grain yield among cultivars. Partitioning of dry matter within the plant was important in determining differences in grain yield and N stress tolerance between cultivars. A semiprolific cultivar (SPL) had high seedling vigour and a dense root system in the surface soil layer that conferred a greater tolerance to early-season drought stress and improved uptake of the early-season N flush, as indicated by a greater dry matter yield at 35 days after sowing (DAS). It also had a fine, deep, dense root system at flowering that could have improved water- and N-use efficiency in the subsoil (&gt; 45 cm), thereby avoiding midseason drought stress in 1994. \{SPL\} had a large harvest index and the greatest yield among cultivars in 1994. Averaged across cultivars, greater root growth and distribution was observed at a moderate N rate of 0.56 g plant−1 than at zero-N or high N (2.26 g plant−1). Differences in root morphology could be valuable as selection criteria for N-efficient and drought-tolerant maize. "

The experiment was established using a randomized complete block design with four replications in a split-plot arrangement for three seasons. Cassava varieties intercropped with cowpeas, green gram, and groundnuts and cassava monocrops with and without \{NPK\} fertilizer constituted the main plot and sub-plots, respectively. Whitefly population counts and \{CMD\} severity and incidence were measured at regular intervals. Cropping system had a significant effect (P &lt; 0.05) on whitefly populations and \{CMD\} severity. Small whitefly populations (0–7.5 individuals per leaf) and low \{CMD\} severity (1–2.4 on a 5-point scale) were recorded in improved and local cassava varieties intercropped with green gram. The local cassava variety intercropped with green gram showed low \{CMD\} incidences (0%–40%) in all seasons. Generally, growing cassava with green gram proved effective in reducing whitefly populations and \{CMD\} incidence and severity.

A review of African smallholder experiences with integrated soil fertility management practices finds growing use, both indigenously and through participation in agricultural projects. Patterns of use vary considerably across heterogeneous agroecological conditions, communities and households, but are stimulated by profitable commercially oriented agricultural opportunities. The potential for integrated soil fertility management to expand markets for organic inputs, labor, credit, and fertilizer is explored.

Bio-economic evaluation of farmers’ perceptions of viable farms in western Kenya. Agric. Syst. 90, 243–271]: one in which high productivity is achieved through optimising crop-livestock interactions. We selected four case study crop-livestock farms of different resource endowment (Type 1–4 – excluding the poorest farmers, Type 5, who do not own livestock) and quantified all relevant physical flows through and within them. With this information we parameterised a dynamic, farm-scale simulation model to investigate (i) current differences in resource use efficiencies and degree of crop-livestock interactions across farm types; and (ii) the impact of different interventions in farm Types 3 and 4 on producing the desired shifts in productivity towards the ideal farm. Assuming no resource constraints, changes in the current farm systems were introduced stepwise, as both intensification of external input use (fertilisers and fodder) and qualitative changes in the configuration of the farms (i.e. changing land use towards fodder production, improving manure handling and/or changing cattle breeds). In 10-year simulations of the baseline, current scenario using historical weather data the wealthiest farms Type 2 achieved food self-sufficiency (FSS) in 20% of the seasons due to rainfall variability, whereas the poorer Type 4 only achieved \{FSS\} in 0 to 30% of the seasons; soil organic C decreased during the simulations at annual rates of −0.54, −0.73, −0.85 and −0.84 t C ha−1 on farms of Type 1–4, respectively; large differences in productivity and recycling efficiency between farm types indicated that there is ample room to improve the physical performance of the poorer farms (e.g. light and water use efficiency was 2–3 times larger on wealthier farms). Simulating different intensification scenarios indicated that household \{FSS\} can be achieved in all farm types through input intensification, e.g. using P fertilisers at rates as small as 15 kg farm−1 season−1 (i.e. from 7 to 28 kg ha−1). Increasing the area under Napier grass from c. 20 to 40% and reducing the area of maize, beans and sweet potato in farms of Type 3 and 4 increased their primary productivity by c. 1 t ha−1 season−1, their milk production by 156 and 45 L season−1, respectively, but decreased the production of edible energy (by 2000 and 250 \{MJ\} ha−1 season−1) and protein (by 20 and 3 kg ha−1 season−1). By bringing in a more productive cow the primary productivity increased even further in Farm Type 3 (up to 5 t ha−1 season−1), as did milk production (up to c. 1000 L season−1), edible energy (up to c. 10,000 \{MJ\} ha−1 season−1) and protein (up to c. 100 kg ha−1 season−1). The impact of livestock management on the recycling of nutrients and on the efficiency of nutrient use at farm scale can be large, provided that enough nutrients are present in or enter the system to be redistributed. An increase in N cycling efficiency through improved manure handling from 25 to 50% would increase the amount of N cycled in the case study farms of Type 1 and 2 by only ca. 10 kg season−1, and only 1–2 kg season−1 in Type 3 and 4. The various alternatives simulated when disregarding resource constraints contributed to narrow the productivity and efficiency gaps between poorer and wealthier farms. However, the feasibility of implementing such interventions on a large number of farms is questionable. Implications for system (re-)design and intensification strategies are discussed. "

The approach discusses possible cropping system improvements and alternatives in terms of crop combinations, external mineral supply, additional crops, and the potential for breeding staples in order to enhance their nutritional balance while maintaining or improving the sustainability and dietary, agronomic, and societal acceptability of the system. The conceptual framework calls for attention first to balancing crop nutrition that in nearly every case will also increase crop productivity, allowing sufficient staple to be produced on less land so that the remaining land can be devoted to more nutrient‐dense and nutrient‐balancing crops. Once this is achieved, the additional requirements of humans and animals (vitamins, selenium, and iodine) can be addressed. Case studies illustrate principles and strategies.

Better management of nitrogen (N) resources and maize cultivars with enhanced genetic capacity to capture and utilize soil and fertilizer N are strategies that could improve N-use efficiency. In two field experiments conducted at Zaria, northern Nigeria, five maize (Zea mays L.) cultivars planted early in the season were assessed under various N levels for differences in N uptake, soil N dynamics, and related N losses. Cultivar TZB-SR accumulated more N in the aboveground plant parts in both years than the other cultivars. All, except the semi-prolific late (SPL) variety, met about 50–60% of their N demand by the time of silking (64–69 DAP). In both years, \{SPL\} had the greatest capacity to take up N during the grain filling period, and it had the highest grain-N concentration and the least apparent N loss through leaching in the second year. There were no significant differences in soil N dynamics among cultivars in both years. At harvest, the residual N in the upper 90 cm of the profile under all the cultivars ranged from 56 to 72 kg ha−1 in the first year and from 73 to 83 kg ha−1 in the second year. Apparent N loss from 0 to 90 cm soil profile through leaching ranged from 35 to 122 kg ha−1 in both years. N application significantly increased N uptake by more than 30% at all sampling dates in the second year of the experiment, but had no effect on apparent N loss. Results indicate that the use of maize cultivars with high N uptake capacity during the grain filling period when maximum leaching losses occur could enhance N recovery and may be effective in reducing leaching losses of mineral N in the moist savanna soils.

abstract = "SummaryBackground Egg-laying animals, such as insects, ensure the survival of their offspring by depositing their eggs in favorable environments. To identify suitable oviposition sites, insects, such as the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster, assess a complex range of features. The fly selectively lays eggs in fermenting fruit. However, the precise cues and conditions that trigger oviposition remain unclear, including whether flies are also selective for the fruit substrate itself. Results Here, we demonstrate that flies prefer Citrus fruits as oviposition substrate. Flies detect terpenes characteristic of these fruits via a single class of olfactory sensory neurons, expressing odorant receptor Or19a. These neurons are necessary and sufficient for selective oviposition. In addition, we find that the Citrus preference is an ancestral trait, presumably representing an adaptation toward fruits found within the native African habitat. Moreover, we show that endoparasitoid wasps that parasitize fly larvae are strongly repelled by the smell of Citrus, as well as by valencene, the primary ligand of Or19a. Finally, larvae kept in substrates enriched with valencene suffer a reduced risk of parasitism. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that a single dedicated olfactory pathway determines oviposition fruit substrate choice. Moreover, our work suggests that the fly’s fruit preference—reflected in the functional properties of the identified neuron population—stem from a need to escape parasitism from endoparasitoid wasps.

Two storage systems were designed based on \{IPM\} principles, one using a local variety (chosen mainly for its excellent husk cover characteristics), the second including an improved variety (with higher yield and moderately good husk cover characteristics), and both depending on visual selection of cobs at harvest to reduce initial insect infestation. The experiment was conducted in a collaborative manner, including representatives of the SPV, farmers from the Plateaux region, and researchers from IITA. Population dynamics of major insects and associated losses to stored maize were monitored monthly over an 8-month period, while an on-site evaluation of pest infestation and losses was conducted after 6 and 8 months of storage. The performance of the different storage systems was evaluated in terms of pest densities, grain weight losses and cost-efficiency. The IPM-based systems were as effective as the pesticide-based \{SPV\} system in reducing infestation and grain losses. When only the incremental net returns from the storage practices were considered, both the \{IPM\} approach and the recommendations of the \{SPV\} performed better than the farmers’ methods of storage. However, when the yields (per hectare) of the different maize varieties used in the respective storage systems were included in the cost and return analysis, the \{IPM\} storage systems using the local variety performed worse.

R. maidis and C. palmae were non-colonizing, but were occasionally found transitory in fields. A. craccivora was the most abundant vector on cowpea both in the first and second growing seasons. Aphids were more abundant and virus disease-infection rate correspondingly faster in the wetter first growing season than in the second one. Although R. maidis and C. palmae may cause primary loci of infection, they may also bring about limited secondary spread, as they alight repeatedly on non-hosts (cowpea plants) during host finding. However, colonizing Aphis spp. would mainly be responsible for secondary spread within the field.

This is due in large part to the long and diverse list of devastating plant viruses transmitted by these vectors. Open-field production provides many challenges to manage these viruses and in many cases adequate management has not been possible. Diseases caused by whitefly-transmitted viruses have become limiting factors in open-field production of a wide range of crops, i.e., bean golden mosaic disease in beans, tomato yellow leaf curl disease in tomato, cassava mosaic disease and cassava brown streak disease in cassava, and cotton leaf crumple disease in cotton. While host resistance has proven to be the most cost-effective management solution, few examples of host resistance have been developed to date. The main strategy to limit the incidence of virus-infected plants has been the application of insecticides to reduce vector populations aided to some extent by the use of selected cultural practices. However, due to concerns about the effect of insecticides on pollinators, consumer demand for reduced pesticide use, and the ability of the whitefly vectors to develop insecticide-resistance, there is a growing need to develop and deploy strategies that do not rely on insecticides. The reduction in pesticide use will greatly increase the need for genetic resistance to more viruses in more crop plants. Resistance combined with selected \{IPM\} strategies could become a viable means to increase yields in crops produced in open fields despite the presence of whitefly-transmitted viruses. "

In laboratory experiments, we determined if intraguild predation occurs between Typhlodromalus manihoti and Euseius fustis, two phytoseiid mite predators of the cassava green mite Mononychellus tanajoa on cassava in Africa, and if the level of intraguild predation is affected by the availability of the primary prey, M. tanajoa, and maize pollen as alternative non-prey food. In the laboratory, the two predators attacked and killed heterospecific larvae but they did so only when prey mites and alternative food (maize pollen) were absent or scarce. On a diet of intraguild prey alone, the two predator species survived for several days but failed to reproduce. Addition of abundant levels of M. tanajoa and maize pollen increased survival and reproduction of the two predator species and reduced intraguild predation to very low levels. We then determined, on whole plants in pot experiments in a screenhouse, the effect of maize pollen (an alternative food) on the interactions between the two predator species and the impact of predator–predator interactions on suppression of M. tanajoa population densities. In single predator species treatments, both E. fustis and T. manihoti significantly reduced M. tanajoa densities; but surprisingly, E. fustis appeared to be superior to T. manihoti. The co-presence of the two predators on the same cassava plant resulted in similar suppression of M. tanajoa population densities, but greater suppression of M. tanajoa compared with T. manihoti alone, regardless of presence or absence of maize pollen. The presence of the two predator species together reduced their respective abundance compared with single predator species treatments. Addition of maize pollen, however, significantly increased densities of the generalist predator E. fustis, in both single and two predator species treatments; and tilted the balance of the interactions between the two predator species in favour of E. fustis. The findings of our research underscore the role of generalist predators like E. fustis in the suppression of M. tanajoa populations on cassava, and the potential role of alternative non-prey food in altering the interactions between co-occurring predators sharing the same primary prey (by favouring the generalist predators), and the effect of these interactions on suppression of population densities of the shared primary prey.

The Dobie method is preferred due to the lower total time required for assessment of relative susceptibility of maize varieties. The greatest disadvantage of the Urrelo method is the intensive labour requirements in the early stages of a trial, when numbers of eggs have to be counted, although it has the advantage that the assessment may be terminated upon emergence of the first \{F1\} adult. Two explanatory variables, kernel size and hardness, were investigated to determine whether they may be used as indicators of resistance. Results suggested that kernel size is the more important in determining resistance to attack by S. zeamais, with large kernels appearing to show greater resistance than small ones. Contrary to expectations, of the varieties tested, including local, hybrid and improved open pollinated (IOP) varieties, the local varieties were generally more susceptible. This may be related to kernel size, as all \{IOPs\} and hybrids tested had large kernels, whereas the majority of the local varieties had small ones. No clear relationship between weevil susceptibility and kernel hardness could be detected, although there was an indication that differences associated with kernel size varied depending on kernel hardness. None of the varieties tested showed high levels of resistance to attack by S. zeamais. "

To date, there have been no practical solutions to combat this emerging problem, due to the inability of the subsistence farmers that grow cassava to afford expensive inputs such as insecticides. A programme of research was carried out linking institutes in Africa, the \{UK\} and South America, to identify possible resistance sources in cassava to the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci. The South American genotype \{MEcu\} 72 and several Ugandan cassava landraces including Ofumba Chai, Nabwire 1 and Mercury showed good levels of resistance to B. tabaci. Field and screen-house experiments showed that all of the improved, high-yielding cassava mosaic disease (CMD) resistant cassava genotypes assessed were highly susceptible to B. tabaci and supported high populations of all life stages. These data support the hypothesis that the continuing high populations of cassava B. tabaci in Uganda are due, in part, to the widespread adoption of CMD-resistant cassava varieties during the \{CMD\} pandemic. They also show that the whitefly, Aleurotrachelus socialis, resistance present in the South American cassava genotypes could have broader applicability in the Old World. "

Predatory ants are increasingly being viewed as possible biological control agents of this pest because they are capable of entering banana plants and soil in search of prey. We studied ant predation on banana weevil in Uganda in crop residues and live plants in both laboratory and field experiments. Field studies with live plants used chemical ant exclusion in some plots and ant enhancement via colony transfer in others to measure effects of Pheidole sp. 2 and Odontomachus troglodytes Santschi on plant damage and densities of immature banana weevils. In crop residues, an important pest breeding site, twice as many larvae were removed from ant-enhanced plots as in control plots. In young (2 month) potted suckers held in shade houses, ant ability to reduce densities of banana weevil life stages varied with the weevil inoculation rate. At the lowest density (2 female weevils per pot), densities of eggs, larvae, and pupae were reduced by ants. At higher rates there was no effect. In older suckers (5–11 months) grown in larger containers, banana weevil densities were not affected by ants, but damage levels were reduced. In a field trial lasting a full crop cycle (30 months), we found that the ants tested reduced the density of banana weevil eggs in suckers during the crop, but did not affect larval densities in the sampled suckers. However, most larvae occur in the main banana plants, rather than associated suckers. Nevertheless, levels of damage in mature plants at harvest did not differ between Amdro-treated and ant-enhanced plots, suggesting the ant species studied were not able to provide economic control of banana weevil under our test conditions.

Gros Michel plantlets were inoculated with Bacillus, mycorrhizal and Trichoderma based products in a Vertisol, Humic Nitisol, Rhodic Ferralsol and conventional nursery media. Initial inoculation of plants with products was done at the acclimatization phase and subsequently at the potting phase. Survival of inoculated plantlets was recorded at the end of the acclimatization phase, 8 weeks after deflasking. Effect of products on growth was evaluated as ability to enhance height and girth of pseudostem, leaf length, leaf width, number of functional leaves and root and shoot biomass yield. The efficacy of products on survival of plants at hardening was variable and dependent on soil type. Inoculation with Bacillus enhanced survival of plants in the Vertisol, mycorrhiza and Trichoderma inoculation in the Rhodic Ferralsol and mycorrhiza in the Humic Nitisol and conventional media. Performance of inoculated plants was dependent on soil type. Application of Bacillus based products significantly increased plant growth (leaf length, leaf width, plant height, shoot dry weights) in the Vertisol and Rhodic Ferralsol in the nursery phase. Application of multiple species mycorrhiza and Trichoderma under field conditions significantly increased plant growth (apparent volume and leaf surface area) in the Vertisol by over 100% and 25% compared to the control and conventional practice respectively. Mycorrhizal colonization was not significantly affected by product inoculation. However, higher percentages of colonization were observed with Bacillus inoculation in the Vertisol and by mycorrhizae and Trichoderma in the Rhodic Ferralsol compared to the non-inoculated controls. Results demonstrate that tissue cultured bananas can benefit from application of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Trichoderma and Bacillus to improve survival and growth during the nursery phase as well as enhance plant performance under field conditions. The effect of microorganisms-based commercial inoculants is however dependent on soil type and the stage of plant development. "

This survey was done to identify potentially important predators of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar). Work was repeated in both one wet and one dry season at all locations. We sampled at 39 farms in four regions and found 55 species of ants in pitfall traps and 24 species in fish and honey baits. When banana weevil larvae were exposed as baits, 11 ant species were attracted, of which Pheidole sp. 1, Pheidole sp. 2, Pheidole sp. 3, Paratrechina sp. 1, and Lepisiota sp. 1 were the most abundant. Seventeen ant species were found in pseudostems and 34 in corms of live banana plants and residues of harvested plants. High species richness and abundance especially inside plants and residues, suggest that ants are important foragers in banana plantations. Seven of the ant species found in plants demonstrated significant ability to remove banana weevil eggs artificially inserted in corms. Two species, Odontomachus troglodytes Santschi and Pheidole sp. 2, were able to remove eggs from naturally infested corms. O. troglodytes removed 33–68% of the eggs in naturally infested corms, while Pheidole sp. 2 removed 38–60% of such eggs. The attraction of O. troglodytes and Pheidole sp. 2 to banana weevil-infested plant pieces, their close association with banana plants and residues, and their ability to extract artificially and naturally introduced banana weevil eggs from plant tissue suggest that these two species may have significant potential to consume weevil immature stages in plants and residues.

The accumulation of osmo-active compounds, which can be induced by drought and cold stress, is therefore important. In the present study, three-week old shoots from in vitro plantlets of the cultivated potato Solanum tuberosum and its frost-resistant relative Solanum commersonii were submitted to osmotic stress (by using sucrose) and chilling (6 °C). After 14 days of exposure, shoot tips were sampled in order to gain an insight into changes of the proteome and soluble sugars. Also, the effect of these treatments on growth performance behaviour and on the success of cryopreservation was evaluated. Identified proteins that changed in abundance due to stress were associated with stress response. Additionally, carbohydrate analyses in both species, after exposure to chilling, also indicated species-related differences; this observation could point towards a better-adapted physiological state of the donor plants of S. commersonii prior to the cryoprocedure and therefore a better recovery of the meristems. Biological significance To our knowledge, this is the first study in which cryopreservation experiments are combined with the observation of the responses to abiotic stress exposure involving the potato species S. commersonii and S. tuberosum. These two species are known to have a different cold-acclimation behaviour, which seems to be closely related to their tolerance towards cryopreservation. Furthermore, common and differential responses to abiotic stresses were observed in the two species indicating that some pathways could be crucial not only in the plant's response to stress but also in tolerance towards cryopreservation.

However, the survival of some of these wild plant species could be threatened because of climate change. We used current and projected future climate data for ∼2055, and a climate envelope species distribution model to predict the impact of climate change on the wild relatives of peanut (Arachis), potato (Solanum) and cowpea (Vigna). We considered three migrational scenarios for modeling the range shifts (unlimited, limited, and no migration). Climate change strongly affected all taxa, with an estimated 16–22% (depending on migration scenario) of these species predicted to go extinct and most species losing over 50% of their range size. Moreover, for many species, the suitable areas become highly fragmented. Arachis were the most affected group, with 24–31 (depending on the migration scenario) of 51 species projected to go extinct and their distribution area on average reduced by 85–94%, depending on the migration scenario, over the next 50 years. The number of patches was predicted to decrease by 19% under the no migration scenario or increase by 4% assuming unlimited migration. Patch size decreased by 55–60%. For Solanum, 7 (no migration) to 13 (unlimited migration) of 108 species were predicted to go extinct, and their range sizes were reduced by approximately 38–69%. The number of patches was predicted to decrease by 34% (no migration) or increase 7% (unlimited migration) and patch size decreased by 20 (unlimited migration) to 37% (no migration). In terms of species extinction, Vigna was the least affected of the three groups, losing no species (unlimited migration) to 2 species (no migration) of the 48 species in the genus. The mean range size was predicted to decrease by 65% (no migration) or increase 8% (unlimited migration), with 8–41 of the 48 species losing more than 50% of their current geographic range. The number of Vigna patches increased by 12–115%, but the size of those patches shrunk by 51–59%. Our results suggest that there is an urgent need to identify and effectively conserve crop wild relatives that are at risk from climate change. While increased habitat conservation will be important to conserve most species, those that are predicted to undergo strong range size reductions should be a priority for collection and inclusion in genebanks.

The objective of this research is to guide crop improvement efforts by prioritizing areas of high poverty, the key problem of high drought risk and the crops grown and consumed in these areas. Global spatial data on crop production, climate and poverty (as proxied by child stunting) were used to identify geographic areas of high priority for crop improvement. The analysis employed spatial overlay, drought modelling and descriptive statistics to identify where best to target technology generation to achieve its intended human welfare goals. Analysis showed that drought coincides with high levels of poverty in 15 major farming systems, especially in South Asia, the Sahel and eastern and southern Africa, where high diversity in drought frequency characterizes the environments. Thirteen crops make up the bulk of food production in these areas. A database was developed for use in agricultural research and development targeting and priority setting to raise the productivity of crops on which the poor in marginal environments depend. "

Extension and supply chain development efforts were required to make the \{PICS\} technology available to millions of farmers and other users. Several research and development organizations assisted in awareness building activities to develop the market and increase access. Thousands of village and market demonstrations were implemented by field technicians and supported by media activities. Supply chain development activities were led by the private sector with some support from the project. Overall, 40–70 adults attended demonstrations in each village, among which 38% were women. Large-scale extension activities substantially increased the demand for the technology and helped establish the supply chain. More than 2.4 million triple bags were sold in the first 5 years of the project. In some countries, up to 50% of bags ordered during the first year were bought by farmers; even though village demonstrations had not yet been completed. Market building activities helped convince the private sector that there were business opportunities in buying and selling \{PICS\} bags. Bags ordered by the private sector went from 0% in 2007 to 200% in 2010, proving that it is possible to commercialize a new agricultural technology in developing countries in a relatively short time.

Reliable indicators of farm performance are needed in order to model these links, and to therefore be able to design interventions which meet the differing needs of specific user groups. However, the lack of standardization of performance indicators has led to a wide array of tools and ad-hoc indicators which limit our ability to compare across studies and to draw general conclusions on relationships and trade-offs whereby performance indicators are shaped by farm management and the wider social-environmental context. \{RHoMIS\} is a household survey tool designed to rapidly characterise a series of standardised indicators across the spectrum of agricultural production and market integration, nutrition, food security, poverty and \{GHG\} emissions. The survey tool takes 40–60 min to administer per household using a digital implementation platform. This is linked to a set of automated analysis procedures that enable immediate cross-site bench-marking and intra-site characterisation. We trialled the survey in two contrasting agro-ecosystems, in Lushoto district of Tanzania (n = 150) and in the Trifinio border region of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras (n = 285). The tool rapidly characterised variability between farming systems at landscape scales in both locations identifying key differences across the population of farm households that would be critical for targeting \{CSA\} interventions. Our results suggest that at both sites the climate smartness of different farm strategies is clearly determined by an interaction between the characteristics of the farm household and the farm strategy. In general strategies that enabled production intensification contributed more towards the goals of climate smart agriculture on smaller farms, whereas increased market orientation was more successful on larger farms. On small farms off-farm income needs to be in place before interventions can be promoted successfully, whereas on the larger farms a choice is made between investing labour in off-farm incomes, or investing that labour into the farm, resulting in a negative association between off-farm labour and intensification, market orientation and crop diversity on the larger farms, which is in complete opposition to the associations found for the smaller farms. The balance of indicators selected gave an adequate snap shot picture of the two sites, and allowed us to appraise the ‘CSA-ness’ of different existing farm strategies, within the context of other major development objectives.

Whilst crop–climate relationships are still the most common agricultural study of this sort, on-farm management, hydrology, pests, diseases and livestock are now also examined. This paper introduces all of these areas of progress, with more detail being found in the subsequent papers in the special issue. Remaining scientific challenges are discussed, and a distinction is developed between projection- and utility-based approaches to agro-climate ensemble modelling. Recommendations are made regarding the manner in which uncertainty is analysed and reported, and the way in which models and data are used to make inferences regarding the future. A key underlying principle is the use of models as tools from which information is extracted, rather than as competing attempts to represent reality. "

The objective of this paper was to present an overview analysis of biogas-to-bioenergy in Taiwan, which included five elements: current status of biogas sources and their energy utilizations, potential of biogas (methane) generation from livestock manure management, governmental regulations and policies for promoting biogas, benefits of \{GHGs\} (i.e., methane) emission reduction, and research and development status of utilizing livestock manure for biofuel production. In the study, using the livestock population data surveyed by the Council of Agriculture (Taiwan) and the emission factors recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the potential of methane generation from livestock manure management in Taiwan during the period of 1995–2007 has been estimated to range from 36 to 56 Gg year−1, indicating that the biogas (methane) from swine and dairy cattle is abundant. Based on the characteristics of swine manure, the maximum potential of methane generation could reach to around 400 Gg year−1. With a practical basis of the total swine population (around 4300 thousand heads) from the farm scale of over 1000 heads, a preliminary analysis showed the following benefits: methane reduction of 21.5 Gg year−1, electricity generation of 7.2 × 107 kW-h year−1, equivalent electricity charge saving of 7.2 × 106 US$ year−1, and equivalent carbon dioxide mitigation of 500 Gg year−1.

It is also important to identify the parameters that are most responsive to the effects of these fallow systems on aggregate stability. This study was carried out in southwestern Nigeria to quantify the effects of various fallow management systems on the macroaggregate stability of surface soil (0–15-cm depth) using a long-term fallow management trial established in 1989 on an Alfisol toposequence. Data were collected between 1994 and 1995. Three fallow systems (bush fallow, Pueraria phaseoloides, and Leucaena leucocephala) and three fallow periods (1–3 years after 1-year cropping) were evaluated. Cropping consisted of maize+cassava intercropping. A split-plot design with fallow systems as main plot and cropping intensities as subplot in four replications was used in the trial. Soil aggregate samples were wet-sieved to evaluate their mean-weight diameter (MWD) and fractal dimension (D). The means of \{MWD\} for the fallow systems and cropping intensities ranged from 2.4 to 6.4 mm. The mean D values ranged from 2.29 to 2.72 while the mean intercepts (log k) of the regression ranged from 2.01 to 2.28. Low D values (cohesive and stable aggregates) were associated with fallowing whereas high D values (fragmented aggregates) were associated with cultivation. Fallowing enhanced soil aggregate stability. The Pueraria system also enhanced soil aggregate stability more than the bush fallow and Leucaena systems when continuous cropping was practised. The subplots, which were fallowed for 2 or 3 years after 1 year of cropping, were usually similar in aggregate stability to the secondary forest soil. Fractal analysis showed further that soil aggregates in the dry season and on the upper slope of the toposequence were more cohesive than in the wet season and on the lower slope. Observed D and log k values were also significantly influenced by laboratory method. "

Adjusting tree density may alter weed competition for light, water and nutrients, the storage of nutrients by weeds through growth and the release of nutrients via decomposition of slashed weed residues. The effects are reported of (1) two timber stand densities (TSDs) and, (2) retention versus burning of slashed vegetation at field preparation, upon Chromolaena odorata (kondengui), the dominant weed, in an agrisilvicultural system in southern Cameroon. The system comprised the timber species, Terminalia ivorensis, and plantain as an understorey crop. Total weed biomass was measured at the first weeding, 3 months after planting (MAP), and total weed biomass and aboveground biomass, partitioning and nutrient accumulation of C. odorata were measured at the second and third weedings, 7 and 12 MAP. Mass and nutrient loss were measured from stem and leaves placed separately in decomposition bags. Here, burning was not an appropriate weed management tool, as it resulted in greater weed biomass. A high \{TSD\} did reduce weed biomass. However, foliar nutrient concentrations were generally higher in high TSDs. Thus, retaining trees in the high \{TSD\} did not lead to any reduction in nutrient uptake by the C. odorata stand. Furthermore, in the high TSD, mass loss and nutrient release characteristics had higher coefficients, and a higher percentage of the total nutrients accumulated were released in the early stages of incubation, all increasing the risk of nutrients being lost from the topsoil. Thus, from a weed competition perspective, there were few benefits to retaining a high timber stand density. "

These results suggest that, at least between 6 and 20 years of age, T. ivorensis has a linear, rather than a sigmoid or ε-function-shaped growth pattern and that the increased growth rate in response to thinning is maintained for the following years. Estimated carbon accumulation in all tree species greater than 14 cm in girth in the high \{SD\} treatment was 71 Mg C ha−1 by year 9 in the younger plantation and 84 Mg C ha−1 by year 20 in the older plantation.

In vitro, a microsomal enzyme system isolated from cassava roots was shown to catalyse the conversion of valine to acetone cyanohydrin, the aglucone of linamarin. An antibody raised against cytochrome P450TYR, the enzyme which catalyses the initial step in the biosynthesis of the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin in sorghum, cross-reacts with a major polypeptide of similar molecular mass in cassava microsomes. Cyanogenic glucosides are known to accumulate in cassava roots, but hitherto de novo synthesis has only been demonstrated in the leaves, suggesting translocation of cyanogenic glucosides from leaves to roots. Our results show that at least part of the cyanogenic glucosides are synthesized in the roots. The data demonstrate that acyanogenic cassava roots cannot be obtained solely by blocking the transport of cyanogenic glucosides to the roots from other parts of the cassava plant. "

The characterization of the resulting biochars was examined for its relevance to its potential use as soil amendment. It was found that the pore properties, ash contents and pH values of all swine-manure-derived biochars basically increased as temperature increased, while the yield and nitrogen/oxygen contents decreased with increasing temperature as a result of pyrolytic volatilization during pyrolysis. From the organic and inorganic elements analyses, the manure-derived biochar was rich in soil nutrients such as N, P, Ca, Mg, and K.

The average annual rainfall was 2048 mm and the distribution pattern was unimodal. 49% of rainfall amount fell at 7.5-minute intensities exceeding 25 mm/h. A maximum 7.5-minute intensity of 240 mm/h was observed at the site. The median rain drop size (D50) was 2.3 mm. The mean monthly kinetic energy, using the Wischmeier and Smith (1978) recommended procedure, ranged from 1.5 to 87 MJ/ha; whereas the values ranged from 1.5 to 140 MJ/ha using the Kowal and Kassam (1976) equation. These results suggest that equations developed in the tropics would estimate kinetic energy higher than those developed in the temperate regions. The annual value of erosivity was 18510 MJ·mm/ha·h by the \{EI30\} index, 216 MJ/ha by the \{KE\} ≥ 25 mm/h index and 1329 cm2/h by the \{AIm\} index. The study indicates that rainfall of small and large amounts are capable of causing soil erosion at the site because they often fall at erosive intensities and contain big drops. The complementary role of the small- and large-amount storms made the cumulative erosivity of the rains at the study site very high. The information provided in this study shall be useful in estimating the erosive nature of rain in similar environments and will augment other available information in drawing an iso-erodent map for Nigeria. Furthermore, the erosivity factor for soil loss estimation on monthly basis in the area of study can be quantified by selecting the appropriate index values for soil loss equations. "

To investigate the underlying processes at one such location—the Luquillo Experimental Forest in eastern Puerto Rico—66 days of detailed throughfall and above-canopy climatic data were collected in 1996 and analysed using the Rutter and Gash models of rainfall interception. Throughfall occurred on 80% of the days distributed over 80 rainfall events. Measured interception loss was 50% of gross precipitation. When Penman–Monteith based estimates for the wet canopy evaporation rate (0.11 mm h−1 on average) and a canopy storage of 1.15 mm were used, both models severely underestimated measured interception loss. A detailed analysis of four storms using the Rutter model showed that optimizing the model for the wet canopy evaporation component yielded much better results than increasing the canopy storage capacity. However, the Rutter model failed to properly estimate throughfall amounts during an exceptionally large event. The analytical model, on the other hand, was capable of representing interception during the extreme event, but once again optimizing wet canopy evaporation rates produced a much better fit than optimizing the canopy storage capacity. As such, the present results support the idea that it is primarily a high rate of evaporation from a wet canopy that is responsible for the observed high interception losses. "

Second-instar Aphis craccivora Koch and Megalurothirps sjostedti Trybom nymphs, and third-instar M. vitrata larvae, all from laboratory colonies, were treated with various concentrations of one of the control agents separately or combined. Daily mortality was recorded for five days (A. craccivora and M. sjostedti nymphs) or fourteen days (M. vitrata) and the larval and pupal development as well as adult emergence were assessed. Combination of MaviMNPV resulted in a significantly higher larval mortality in M. vitrata than treatment with either virus or botanical insecticide alone at the corresponding concentrations. Larvae of M. vitrata infected with MaviMNPV and treated with botanical oils died sooner than those infected with only one control agent. Combinations of MaviMNPV and botanical oils produced additive or synergistic effects. No evidence of antagonistic effects was noted. In field experiments, the application of botanical insecticide and MaviMNPV either alone or in combination was effective in reducing insect abundance over the four weeks, and preventing yield loss. In the first field season, where the M. vitrata population was higher, the combination of the virus and either of the botanical pesticides induced significantly higher yields than spraying chemical insecticide. Application of MaviMNPV in combination with J. curcas and A. indica oil has proven to induce consistent MaviMNPV infection in M. vitrata populations. The combined application of MaviMNPV and botanical oils is discussed in the context of integrated pest management. "

A total of 1052 \{AFLP\} fragments (of which 94.1% were polymorphic) produced from twelve primer combinations indicate a relatively high level of polymorphism among the accessions. Three major genetic groups that do not strictly follow a geographic distribution pattern were identified using Neighbour-joining and the principal coordinate (PCo) analyses. Accessions from Togo showed higher numbers of private fragments and the highest percentage polymorphism (59.4%). The detection of highest genetic diversity in accessions from Nigeria and Togo and their relationship to other accessions suggest that these countries are the centre of origin and diversity of D. dumetorum. The moderately high genetic diversity (average of 61%) is suggesting great influence on the D. dumetorum germplasms through exchange and transfer of cultivars among local farmers in the sub-region. In contrast, \{DNA\} sequence data from the psbA-trnH and the rpoB-trnC chloroplast regions revealed no variation among accessions from the different localities and clearly differentiated by \{AFLP\} patterns.

Durations to flowering varied from 40 to &gt;88 days. Mean daily temperature and photoperiod between vine emergence and flowering varied from 25 to 27 °C and 13.1 to 13.4 h day−1, respectively.

Thermal durations to flowering were strongly related (r2 &gt; 0.75–0.83) to absolute photoperiod (h) at vine emergence as well as to rate of change of photoperiod (s day−1) at vine emergence. The response to absolute photoperiod suggests that white yams are quantitative LDPs, flowering sooner in long than short days. Yams also flowered earlier when the rate of change of photoperiod was positive but small, or was negative. It is suggested that yams may use a combination of photoperiod and rate of change in order to fine tune flowering time. "

The current study examined aflatoxin-producing fungi associated with maize grain intended for human consumption in 18 sub-Saharan African countries. 4469 Aspergillus sect. Flavi isolates were obtained from 339 samples. The majority (75%) of isolates belonged to the L strain morphotype of A. flavus. Minor percentages were A. tamarii (6%), A. parasiticus (1%), and isolates with S strain morphology (3%). No A. bombycis or A. nomius isolates were detected. Phylogenetic analyses of partial sequences of the nitrate reductase gene (niaD, 1.3 kb) and the aflatoxin pathway transcription factor gene (aflR, 1.7 kb) were used to verify isolate assignments into species and lineages. Phylogenetics resolved S strain isolates producing only B aflatoxins into two lineages fully supported by sizes of deletions in the gene region spanning the aflatoxin biosynthesis genes cypA (aflU) and norB (aflF). One lineage was the A. flavus S strain with either 0.9 or 1.5 kb deletions. The second lineage, recently described from Kenya, has a 2.2 kb deletion. Taxa with S strain morphology differed in distribution with strain \{SBG\} limited to West Africa and both A. minisclerotigenes and the new lineage from Kenya in Central and East Africa. African A. flavus L strain isolates formed a single clade with L strain isolates from other continents.

The efficacy of guava interplanting was evaluated from field assessment in 93 citrus orchards in southern Vietnam. The \{CG\} infection was lowest in orchards where either chemical control with both non-neonicotinoid insecticides and neonicotinoids or the interplanting with guava was performed. Three field experiments were then carried out investigating guava interplanting. In these experiments, no citrus trees in orchards interplanted with guavas were infected by \{CG\} for over one year and a few months, while about 20% of trees were infected during the same period in orchards without guavas. There were significantly fewer psyllids in guava interplanted orchards in the first year, but the insect increased thereafter. Almost all trees were infected by \{CG\} after two and a half years irrespective of the presence of guavas, indicating that guava interplanting was effective for one year at most.

The present study investigated the effect of two leguminous cover crops, Canavalia ensiformis (L.) \{DC\} and Sesbania rostrata Brem. &amp; Oberm., planted at different dates before maize (Zea mays (L.)), and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) planted as border rows on infestations of maize by the pyralid Mussidia nigrivenella Ragonot and of other cob-boring lepidopteran pests. In both trials, M. nigrivenella densities at harvest tended to be higher in the maize alone than the legume treatments, but the effect depended on the timing of planting of the cover crop in relation to that of maize. There were no discernible trends for other borers such as the noctuid Sesamia calamistis Hampson, the pyralid Eldana saccharina Walker, and the tortricid Thaumatotibia leucotreta Meyrick. Furthermore, M. nigrivenella pest loads were considerably higher on C. ensiformis than maize, indicating that the presence of alternative host plant species in the vicinity of maize fields did not increase M. nigrivenella attack on maize. Though in some of the legume treatments, grain damage and grain losses were higher than in the maize alone plots, per area yields did not vary significantly. "

Datasets of Musa multi-environment trials available from the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture were used for this study. Plant height and bunch weight showed the highest repeatability at two Nigerian locations, while days to harvest and fruit filling time had on average the lowest repeatability across locations. Plant height was the characteristic requiring the smallest plot among all traits, irrespective of location. This article provides a table showing the relationship between sample size (N), repeatability (R) and level of confidence for phenotypic discrimination of Musa breeding materials. For example, if one wishes to assess phenotypic values with an accuracy of 95% and the correlation between two measurements of phenotype is 50% (R = 0.50) then the sample size required is N = 10. "

Its molar ratio of hydrogen to carbon (H/C) is about 1.59, which is close to the cellulose (H/C = 1.67) and hemicellulose (H/C = 1.60). Under the pyrolysis temperature of 673–973 K and the heating rate of about 10 K/min studied, the yields and calorific values for the resulting biochar products reached to the maximum at the condition of around 673 K. The calorific value (around 31.9 MJ/kg) of the optimal biochar from \{ECR\} was relatively high as compared to that of coal. However, the resulting biochar has greater nitrogen content, which may contribute to greater nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions during combustion or co-firing. On the other hand, the resulting biochars were characterized using helium-based solid density (true density), showing that the density increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature in accord with the conversion of low-density disordered carbon to high-density turbostratic carbon.

In this study, coffee residue, a processing by-product from the soluble coffee industry, was torrefied at the temperature range of 503–623 K with residence time of 10 min by a commercial electric oven. The thermochemical properties of the torrefied biomass, such as elemental analysis and calorific value, were investigated. Furthermore, the information about microscopic and structural characteristics was also obtained by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and true density. It was found that the calorific value of the torrefied biomass increased with temperature, while its maximal increase occurred at around 563 K. This result was in high agreement with the observation from the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of coffee residue. More consistently, the carbon content of torrefied coffee residue increased significantly as temperature increased from 563 to 593 K, which should be the temperature window of torrefaction for this biomass. By contrast, the contents of hydrogen and oxygen decreased slightly due to the devolatilization as a result of thermal decomposition reactions like dehydration and depolymerization. On the other hand, the true density of torrefied coffee residue increased with temperature at above 563 K, making it more observable in the structural shrinkage as also depicted in the SEM. However, it may involve light gases released and loose structure remained at temperature of below 563 K, leading to decreased true density with temperature from 503 to 563 K. "

Its thermochemical characteristics were first investigated by the proximate analysis, calorific value, organic and mineral component analysis, showing that the biomass obviously comprises a large percentage of volatile matter and less amount of fixed carbon. A series of pyrolysis experiments were conducted to produce biochars (i.e., GMBC) from dry \{GM\} at different pyrolysis temperatures (673, 773, 873, 973, and 1073 K) held for 30 min. To evaluate their potential for soil amendment and energy use, the resulting biochars were subject to the analyses of chemical and physical properties, including proximate analysis, elemental analysis, calorific value, mineral components, true density, and surface area/pore volume. Based on the thermochemical properties, pyrolysis temperature at around 873 K seemed to be suitable for the production of GMBC, where its calorific value (CV) (i.e., 16.28 MJ/kg) only increased about 25% as compared to \{CV\} of the dry \{GM\} (i.e., 13.06 MJ/kg).

Ten isolates were tested for their potential to decompose lignocellulosic rice straw by assessing their growth rate and biomass production, as well as their ability to decompose lignin and cellulose on rice-straw-powder-amended media. Four isolates (F26, F28, F29, and F44) were selected as potential lignocellulolytic agents for in-vitro compatibility study based on their optimum growth rate, biomass production, and lignocellulolytic activities. Six different interactions were found among four interacting isolates in the form of mutual intermingling, partial mutual intermingling, and inhibition at the contact point. Finally, a consortium of Aspergillus niger (F44) and Trichoderma viride (F26) was tested for in-vitro biodegradation of rice straw. The fungal consortium was able to decompose cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin, and total carbon significantly (p ≤ 0.05) over the control. The C/N ratio was reduced to 19.5 from an initial value of 29.3 in three weeks of the biodegradation process, thus showing the potential of this method for use in large-scale composting of rice straw.

Gari (150 g) containing cyanohydrin, from which 128 μmol of cyanide ions could be released, was dissolved in 500 ml of cold water for each of the 12 healthy subjects to drink. Concentrations of cyanide in plasma and erythrocytes were determined at baseline and following the meal at 30 min, 1 h, hourly for 4 h and two hourly for 12 h. The mean concentrations of cyanide in the plasma were 6 μmol/l (95% \{CI\} 2–10) at baseline, 12 μmol/l (95% \{CI\} 6–17) at peak and 6 μmol/l (95% \{CI\} 2–10) on return to baseline. The mean amount of cyanide absorbed into the plasma was 13 μmol (S.D. 12), while the transit time of absorbed cyanide was 7.3 h (S.D. 2.1). This study shows that exposure to cyanide follows consumption of gari, but the amount of cyanide absorbed into the plasma from a single meal is small and unlikely to cause acute intoxication. The long transit time of absorbed cyanide in the plasma suggests that frequent intake of gari could cause cyanide to accumulate in the plasma. "

There was also a significant enhancement of the excretion of cholesterol, triglyceride and bile acid in the feces. Hepatic \{LDL\} receptor and cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) gene expressions were upregulated by fermented cereal pastes. Fermented cereal pastes lowered the levels of thiobarbituric-acid-reactive substances (TBARS), thus increasing total antioxidant levels (TAS) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Moreover, hamsters that were fed fermented cereal pastes harbored greater populations of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), while the count of coliform and Clostridium perfringens was significantly reduced in feces. These results demonstrated that the changes of lipid metabolism, antioxidant status and intestinal microflora in the hamster model can be mainly modulated by fermented cereal pastes. Thus, the results suggest that lactic-acid-fermented cereal pastes serve as potential agents for managing primary cardiovascular and intestinal diseases. "

The diversity of the world collection of 70 accessions classified as F. macrophylla was assessed using 14 morphological and phenological traits, and in terms of agronomic and forage potential. One erect and three semi-erect morphotypes were identified based on differences in plant height, flower and seed colour, inflorescence and peduncle length, and stem pubescence. Large variability in dry matter (DM) production (5–586 and 2–272 g plant−1 in the maximum and minimum rainfall periods, respectively), in vitro \{DM\} digestibility (IVDMD, 307–543 g kg−1) and crude protein content (169–237 g kg−1) was measured. The accessions \{CIAT\} 18437, \{CIAT\} 21083 and \{CIAT\} 21090 were identified as promising in terms of productivity and digestibility. Their \{IVDMD\} ranged up to 541 g kg−1 in the maximum and up to 507 g kg−1 in the minimum rainfall period. \{DM\} yield and \{IVDMD\} in the three selected accessions were superior to the control \{CIAT\} 17403. An exploratory cafeteria grazing trial showed that F. macrophylla was palatable in the minimum but not consumed in the maximum rainfall period. Further morphological studies on inflorescence characteristics of herbarium specimens and molecular marker studies are warranted to clarify the taxonomic status (subspecies or varieties) of the four morphotypes identified. Further development, such as palatability studies with a selected set of accessions, can make Flemingia a valuable feed alternative. "

If soils are to be managed sustainably, then more attention should be paid to the effects of cultivation and cropping practices upon earthworms. When forest vegetation is cleared, slashed, burned and land is tilled and cultivated, earthworm abundance, diversity and activity are reduced. Conversely, retaining trees in agroecosystems may maintain earthworm populations during the cropping phase. Here, we assessed the impact on earthworm species diversity and densities of crop cultivation in the understorey of timber plantations thinned to two tree densities and compared these with uncropped, undisturbed timber plantation controls. The plots were reassessed after two and a half years of fallow to see whether populations had recovered. The experiment was in central Cameroon. Seventeen earthworm species were recorded from Eudrilidae subfamilies Eudrilinae and Pareudrilinae, Ocnerodrilidae and Acanthodrilidae, most of which were endemics. This included two new species from two new genera from the sub-family Pareudrilinae, one new species from one new genus of Ocnerodrilidae, two new species of Dichogaster and one new species of Legonodrilus. Ten species were epigeic, six were endogeic and one was anecic. Generally, earthworm densities were lower in cropped plots than in the undisturbed plantation control. The most abundant species was a Legonodrilus sp. nov. with average densities of 49 individuals m−2 in the crop phase and 80 ind. m−2 in the fallow phase. By the fallow phase, densities in the low tree density (120 ind. m−2) were higher than in the high density (40 ind. m−2). The densities of the epigeic Acanthodrilidae were significantly reduced to 7 ind. m−2 in the cropped plots compared with 42 ind. m−2 in the control plots. The effects of cropping were thus species-specific and more work is required to identify which of these endemics are the ecosystem engineers in the system. "

During the same time, mean numbers of M. nigrivenella per cob decreased from 0.36 to 0.04 across both zones. All larval stages, but mostly 3rd–5th instars, were frequently found even after more than 12 weeks, indicating that M. nigrivenella may have reproduced in storage, although reinfestation or delayed development could also explain this observation. The highest M. nigrivenella incidences of 16.8% and 14.4% were found in the “Ava” and crib stores, respectively. Infestations were highest in “Ava” and lowest in maize grain stored in polyethylene bags or in mud silos.

Farmers are now comparing a new alley band concept, grouping trees in bands 20 m apart with five times less tree/crop competition. However, an improved planted fallow of A. auriculiformis to regenerate exhausted soils grew a great deal in popularity because of quick regeneration of yields and a profitable bonus of good quality firewood. Mucuna, which was grown by 15 farmers in 1987 for Imperata control, is now known by almost 100 000 farmers. The regular use for soil fertility enhancement is, however, hampered by the lack of known uses for mucuna products. We developed recently a farmer-applicable detoxifying method for mucuna seeds, allowing incorporation of protein-rich mucuna flour into main staple dishes in Benin.

Oxidation and acid thinning reduced swelling power and increased solubility starch. At all pHs, both oxidation and acid thinning reduced the swelling capacity of the native starch. Oxidation increased water and oil absorption capacity of the native starch, while both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties reduced following acid thinning. Least gelation concentration reduced in acid thinned starch but increased in oxidised derivative. Pasting temperature (Tp), peak viscosity (Pv), hot paste viscosity (Hv), and viscosity after 30 min holding at 95 °C (Hv30) reduced following both modifications. However, values for cold paste viscosity (Cv) and setback (SB) reduced in oxidised derivative and increased in acid thinned starch. Light transmittance of the starch pastes reduced with increase in storage days, however, reduction was more pronounced in native and acid thinned starches. Onset temperature (To), peak temperature (Tp) and conclusion temperature (Tc) of gelatinisation reduced in modified starches compared with native hybrid maize starch. Also, gelatinisation enthalpy reduced after oxidation and acid thinning. Enthalpy of regelatinisation increased as days of storage of starch paste increased. "

abstract = "Abstract In many parts of the humid Tropics, slash and burn shifting cultivation, incorporating a fallow phase, is the most common farming method, encompassing a broad diversity of techniques. The ecological productivity and sustainability of such systems depend upon the crop:fallow time ratio. Farmers often have biophysical criteria by which to match parcels to cropping systems and decide, for example, when to recultivate a fallow. In this paper, we collate reports of indicators used by farmers to aid in fallow choice from across the agronomic, forestry, ecological, and anthropological literature. We found 27 examples of farmers using such biophysical indicators. Examples found were from eight countries across West and Central Africa. The literature review showed that farmers rank fallow age usually first, followed by vegetation composition, the presence of indicator plants, and earthworm casts. 53 indicator plant species were identified across the region of which 37 were said to indicate soil fertility, 13 soil infertility and 3 either fertility or infertility, depending on their growth characteristics. The most exhaustive lists of indicator plants were reported from southern Cameroon, the Ashante region of Ghana and south west Nigeria. Chromolaena odorata was the most frequently mentioned plant indicator species. The trees Triplochiton scleroxylon and Terminalia superba and the grass were each mentioned, generally as soil fertility indicators, in three areas. Other species mentioned multiple times were Aframomum sp., Andropogon gayanus, Ceiba pentandra, Milicia excelsa, Triumfetta cordifolia and Trema guineensis. Farmers in West and Central Africa have identified indicators for selecting which fallow plots to recultivate. Fallow age, vegetation composition, the presence of indicator plants, particularly C. odorata, and earthworm casts all have some logical scientific basis and farmers observations are supported by the results of scientific studies. There is a lack of documentation of farmers’ knowledge and more studies should be conducted. Such knowledge should form the foundation of any suggested interventions in farming systems in the region and provide information to farmers in communities where such knowledge is not currently applied.

Hybrids of quality protein maize (QPM) have a crucial role here to play because \{QPM\} contains increased lysine and tryptophan concentrations and has a higher biological value than the normal maize. Information on the combining ability and heterotic patterns of \{QPM\} inbreds is crucial for the success of hybrid programs in the sub-region. Ninety-one diallel crosses derived from 14 early maturing yellow-endosperm \{QPM\} inbreds were evaluated from 2010 to 2012 under Striga infested, drought, low-N and optimal environments in Nigeria. The objectives were to (i) examine the combining ability of the set of early yellow \{QPM\} inbreds, (ii) classify the inbreds into heterotic groups and identify the best testers (iii) compare the efficiencies of the heterotic grouping methods in classifying the inbreds and (iv) determine the grain yield and stability of the inbreds in hybrid combinations under the research environments. General (GCA) and specific (SCA) combining ability effects were important in the inheritance of grain yield and other traits of the inbreds. However, \{GCA\} was more important than \{SCA\} under each contrasting environment and across environments suggesting that the additive gene action was more important than the non-additive in the set of inbreds. The \{SCA\} effects of grain yield and the heterotic group's \{SCA\} and \{GCA\} of grain yield (HSGCA) methods classified the inbreds into three groups each, while the heterotic grouping based on \{GCA\} of multiple traits (HGCAMT) and the SNP-based genetic distance (GD) methods had two groups each across research environments. There was close correspondence among the classifications of all the grouping methods in terms of placement of inbreds into the same heterotic groups. The SNP-based method was the most efficient and was used to identify \{TZEQI\} 87 and \{TZEQI\} 91 as the best testers for the SNP-based heterotic groups 1 and 2. The hybrids, \{TZEQI\} 87 × \{TZEQI\} 93, \{TZEQI\} 77 × \{TZEQI\} 91 and \{TZEQI\} 80 × \{TZEQI\} 91 were identified as the most stable and high yielding across research environments and should be commercialized.

The goal of this paper is to present an overview of the scientific literature on ecosystem services and food security, with a major focus on case studies of farming communities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, in order to answer the following research questions: (1) does ecosystem services research generate knowledge that helps to address the major imperatives of food security?, and (2) are the multiple linkages between ecosystem services and food security analyzed or assumed in research? The results of the study highlighted that food utilization, access and stability, which are the major food security challenges in the world, remained under-investigated. There is a major bias on food availability in relation to crop production, and most articles assumed that food security would improve by increasing crop productivity, but this hypothesis remained largely untested. Other research blind-spots were co-production, trade-offs and off-site effects of ecosystem services in relation to food security, gender and cultural services. The study concludes that ecosystem services research needs to improve efforts to generate knowledge that helps to address the main imperatives of food security. "

The effect of plant density on plant performance (growth and yield) over two cropping cycles in low input systems was determined. The effects of site × cultivar and site × density interactions on yield traits were significant (p &lt; 0.05). Annual yield increased with increasing plant density but strongly depended on agro-ecological site (from 6.1 to 9.2 t ha−1 yr−1 at Kibungo, 9.5 to 21.5 t ha−1 yr−1 at Rubona and 7.0 to 25.0 t ha−1 yr−1 at Ruhengeri). Yields of beer cultivars increased with density, but those of cooking cultivars decreased. Maximum yields were attained at 4444 plants ha−1 at Kibungo and Rubona whilst yields increased linearly beyond this level at Ruhengeri. Crop cycle duration was prolonged with increasing plant density. Relationships between bunch yield, the total above ground dry matter yields and soil chemical properties suggest that nutrient deficiencies were larger at Kibungo (e.g. K) and Rubona (e.g. K, P, Ca and Mg) compared with Ruhengeri, where yield correlated significantly with leaf area index (LAI). \{LAI\} increases up to 4, where 95% of solar radiation was intercepted by the crop canopy, indicating that increasing the \{LAI\} above 4 would have little effect on production. Evaporation was much greater at lower rainfall areas (e.g. Kibungo) and accompanied by negative annual water deficit (−135 mm yr−1) than at high rainfall areas (e.g. Ruhengeri) with positive water surplus (382 mm yr−1). Growing degree days from planting to bunch harvest were higher at Kibungo (3675 °C days) but much less at the Ruhengeri cooler site (1729 °C days), implying temperature is not restrictive at Ruhengeri. This study showed that the optimal density for bananas depends on water availability, soil fertility and cultivar, which serves as an entry point to maximize yield potential for the East African smallholder farmers rather than using a uniform blanket recommended density. We suggest that agronomic optimal plant density is lower (&lt;4444 plants ha−1) in low rainfall (&lt;1000 mm yr−1) and less fertile areas but seem to be higher (&gt;5000 plants ha−1) in areas with high fertility which receive high rainfall (&gt;1300 mm yr−1).

It was important for this study to understand farmer perceptions regarding the role of climate risks within a complex and multifarious set of risks to farmers’ livelihoods. This study used both qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate farmers’ perceptions regarding threats to livelihoods in southern Zambia and south-western Zimbabwe. While farmers report changes in local climatic conditions consistent with climate variability, there is a problem in assigning contribution of climate variability and other factors to observed negative impacts on the agricultural and socio-economic system. Furthermore, while there is a multiplicity of stressors that confront farmers, climate variability remains the most critical and exacerbate livelihood insecurity for those farmers with higher levels of vulnerability to these stressors.

However, reports of substantial yield increases and phenotypic changes resulting from \{SRI\} management have been challenged on various grounds in the scientific literature.

This paper reviews information now available in the scientific literature that supports the multiple agronomic, plant physiologic, and soil microbiologic foundations for the reported \{SRI\} performance, and discusses how these effects are becoming even more relevant in the context of changing climates.

Fingerprinting of soil elemental composition may form a useful basis for evaluating soils in a way that relates to soil-forming factors and inherent soil functional properties. The objectives of this paper are to quantify the proportion of variability in total elemental composition by total X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) method of 1074 soil samples from the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) Project baseline and to determine the relationships with soil forming factors. The samples were from 34 sentinel sites measuring 10 × 10 km, randomized within major climate zones in SSA. Within each sentinel site there were sixteen spatially stratified 1 km2 clusters, within which there were ten 100 m2 plots. The within and between site patterns of variation in total element composition of 17 elements; Al, P, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Sr, Y, Ta, and Pb, were explored. Total element concentration values were within the range reported globally for soil Cr, Mn, Zn, Ni, V, Sr, and Y and higher than reported range for Al, Cu, Ta, Pb, and Ga. There were significant variations (P &lt; 0.05) in total element composition within and between the sites for all the elements analyzed with the greatest proportion of total variance and number of significant variance components occurring at the site (55–88%) followed by the cluster nested within site (10–40%) levels. The explorations of the relationships between element composition data and site factors using Random Forest regression demonstrated that soil-forming factors have important influence on total elemental composition in the soil. The fact that the soil-forming factors are related to the concentration of naturally occurring elements in the soil gives rise to the notion that they might be predicted from the soils' element composition. Results implied that &gt; 70% of variation in soil element composition patterns can be predicted using information in existing databases or readily observable features. Successful use of \{TXRF\} technique would open up possibilities for using total soil elemental composition fingerprints as a useful basis for characterizing soils in a way that relates to soil-forming factors and inherent soil functional properties.

We review and analyze the literature on this structural approach and present a case study that follows this methodology, explicitly modeling drought and heat tolerant crop varieties. We show that yield gains from adoption of these varieties differ by technology and region, but are generally comparable in scale to (and thus able to offset) adverse effects of climate change. However, yield increases over the projection period are dominated by the effects of growth in population, income, and general productivity, highlighting the importance of joint assessment of biophysical and socioeconomic drivers to better understand climate impacts and responses.

The combined use of organic residue and fertilizer inputs is advocated for its positive effects on short-term nutrient supply, but the effect of the integrated use on long-term stabilization of soil organic C and N is still unclear. We conducted a 1.5-y soil incubation experiment with maize (Zea mays) residue and urea fertilizer to examine the stabilization of C and N in four Sub-Saharan African soils differing in texture (sand, sandy loam, clay loam, and clay). The inputs were enriched with 13C and 15N in a mirror-labelling design to trace the fate of residue-C and N, and fertilizer-N in combination. We hypothesized that combining inputs would enhance the stabilization of C and N relative to either input alone across a range of soil textures. The treatments were destructively sampled after 0.25, 0.5, and 1.5 y to assess input-derived C and N stabilization in soil macro- and microaggregate fractions. The combination treatment had a significant but small (2% of residue-applied C) increase in residue-C stabilized in the total soil after 0.25 y, but this increase did not persist after 0.5 and 1.5 y. While combining residue and fertilizer decreased the amount of residue-N stabilized within 53- to 2000-μm sized soil aggregates (e.g., 7% less at 1.5 y), it increased the stabilization of fertilizer-N at all sampling times (e.g., 20% more at 1.5 y). The increased amount of fertilizer-N stabilized was significantly greater than the amount of residue-N lost in the combined input treatments in the three finer textured soils at 1.5 y, indicating an interactive increase in the stabilization of new N. Our results indicate that combining residue with fertilizer inputs can increase the short-term stabilization of N, which has the potential to improve soil fertility. However, benefits to N stabilization from combining organic residues and fertilizer seem to be less in coarser-textured soils. "

Does the system of rice intensification outperform conventional best management? A synopsis of the empirical record. Field Crops Res. 96, 31–36] provides a good example where this was not done as it was preoccupied with avoiding false-positives only. It concluded, based on a desk study using secondary data assembled selectively from diverse sources and with a 95% level of confidence, that ‘best management practices’ (BMPs) on average produce 11% higher rice yields than \{SRI\} methods, and that, therefore, \{SRI\} has little to offer beyond what is already known by scientists. This conclusion is contradicted by evidence drawn from extensive field trials conducted in China, India and Indonesia, which was not assessed by McDonald et al., and from various other independent evaluations. Given the complexity of the comparison being made and the many unresolved empirical questions, no final conclusion comparing \{BMP\} and \{SRI\} is warranted. Rather than argue for the superiority of one production system over another, this paper considers reasons for the divergence in findings. Understanding these issues should contribute to designing future agronomic studies that can elucidate controversies such as that over \{SRI\} and other complex innovations and practices that may offer opportunities to improve agronomic productivity of rice.

Region-level surveys have revealed a continuing pattern of annual spread westward and southward along a contiguous ‘front’. More recently, outbreaks of cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) were reported from Uganda and other parts of East Africa that had been hitherto unaffected by the disease. Recent survey data reveal several significant contrasts between the regional epidemiology of these two pandemics: (i) severe \{CMD\} radiates out from an initial centre of origin, whilst \{CBSD\} seems to be spreading from independent ‘hot-spots’; (ii) the severe \{CMD\} pandemic has arisen from recombination and synergy between virus species, whilst the \{CBSD\} pandemic seems to be a ‘new encounter’ situation between host and pathogen; (iii) \{CMD\} pandemic spread has been tightly linked with the appearance of super-abundant Bemisia tabaci whitefly vector populations, in contrast to CBSD, where outbreaks have occurred 3–12 years after whitefly population increases; (iv) the \{CMGs\} causing \{CMD\} are transmitted in a persistent manner, whilst the two cassava brown streak viruses appear to be semi-persistently transmitted; and (v) different patterns of symptom expression mean that phytosanitary measures could be implemented easily for \{CMD\} but have limited effectiveness, whereas similar measures are difficult to apply for \{CBSD\} but are potentially very effective. An important similarity between the pandemics is that the viruses occurring in pandemic-affected areas are also found elsewhere, indicating that contrary to earlier published conclusions, the viruses per se are unlikely to be the key factors driving the two pandemics. A diagrammatic representation illustrates the temporal relationship between B. tabaci abundance and changing incidences of both \{CMD\} and \{CBSD\} in the Great Lakes region. This emphasizes the pivotal role played by the vector in both pandemics and the urgent need to identify effective and sustainable strategies for controlling whiteflies on cassava. "

To address these constraints, promising integrated crop management technologies were evaluated, using a multi-locational design in four sub-locations in Siaya and Vihiga district (western Kenya) for six cropping seasons. Technologies evaluated consisted of the traditional maize (Zea mays L.) – bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) intercrop, maize – Desmodium (Desmodium uncinatum (Jacq.) DC.) push–pull intercrop, Crotalaria (Crotalaria ochroleuca G. Don) – maize rotation, and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) – maize rotation. Within each of these systems, imazapyr-coated herbicide-resistant maize (IR-maize) and fertilizer were super-imposed as sub-plot factors. The push–pull system was observed to significantly reduce Striga emergence and stemborer damage from the second season onwards. IR-maize reduced and delayed Striga emergence from the first cropping season. Differences in Striga emergence and stemborer damage between the other systems were not significantly different. After five cropping seasons, the Striga seedbank was significantly higher in the maize-bean intercrop system than in the push–pull system under both maize varieties while the rotational systems had intermediate values not different from the day zero values. Under IR-maize, the Striga seedbank was significantly lower than under local maize for all cropping systems. Maize yields varied between seasons, districts, and cropping systems. Yields in the push–pull system were higher than in the maize-bean intercrop after two seasons and in the absence of mid-season drought stress. Both maize and soybean responded significantly to fertilizer application for both districts and for most seasons. The various interventions did not substantially affect various soil fertility-related parameters after five seasons. In the short term, IR-maize integrated in a push–pull system is the most promising option to reduce Striga while the rotational systems may need a longer timeframe to reduce the Striga seedbank. Finally, farmer-led evaluation of the various technologies will determine which of those is really most acceptable under the prevailing farming conditions. "

Innovative integrated technologies have been developed: the ‘push–pull’ system (intercropping with Desmodium and surrounded by Napier grass), soybean and Crotalaria rotations, and imidazolinone-resistant (IR) maize seed. In 12 demonstration trials in four villages in Siaya and Vihiga districts (Kenya) and two villages in Busia (Uganda) in 2003 and 2004, 504 farmers evaluated all cropping systems and a mono-cropped continuous maize, each cropped with \{IR\} or local maize, and supplemented or not with fertilizer, totaling 16 treatments. Farmers evaluated all treatments for yield, resistance to Striga and stem borer, improvement of soil fertility, and provided an overall evaluation score, using an ordered scale of 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). Data were analyzed using ordinal regression, estimating log odds ratios. The results show significant preferences for all treatments over the control. Push–pull with \{IR\} and fertilizer had the highest log odds ratio (2.93), so the odds of farmers preferring this treatment are 18.7 times the odds that farmers prefer the control. The odds ratios for the other push–pull combinations were generally highest (9–15), followed by the rotation systems with Crotalaria (3.5–7.0), and soybeans, especially with \{IR\} maize and fertilizer (odds ratio of 5.7). In mono-cropping systems, \{IR\} maize was only appreciated in combination with fertilizer, and then only in 2004. Push–pull and Crotalaria were more appreciated in 2004 than in 2003. Farmers in Vihiga had a stronger preference for push–pull, and those in Busia for soybean rotations. Significant differences among farmers were observed, but the effects were small. Women appreciated push–pull more than men, while other technologies were gender-neutral. Older farmers were more likely to prefer push–pull and Crotalaria with fertilizer. Livestock ownership was not found to have an effect on technology preferences. Measured yield, stem borer and Striga infestation all had significant but small effects, although their inclusion did not eliminate the treatment effects, indicating that other factors are still important. \{OLS\} of the scores for different criteria on the overall score shows yield to be the most important criterion (coefficient of 0.40), followed by soil fertility enhancement (0.25) and Striga resistance (0.13). Labor saving (0.09) and stem borer resistance (0.03) are relatively minor criteria. This research shows that scoring and analysis with ordinal regression is a convenient way to solicit and analyze farmers’ preferences for new technologies, with wide applicability in farming systems and participatory research. Its application here shows that farmers like the new technologies, especially push–pull, but that there are substantial differences between years, sites and farmers. The use of this method can be very helpful to define and focus further research and formulate specific and targeted recommendations for agricultural extension. "

abstract = "Knowledge of soil spatial variability is important in natural resource management, interpolation and soil sampling design, but requires a considerable amount of geo-referenced data. In this study, mid-infrared spectroscopy in combination with spatial analyses tools is being proposed to facilitate landscape evaluation and monitoring. Mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) and geostatistics were integrated for evaluating soil spatial structures of three land settlement schemes in Zimbabwe (i.e. communal area, old resettlement and new resettlement; on loamy-sand, sandy-loam and clay soils, respectively). A nested non-aligned design with hierarchical grids of 750, 150 and 30 m resulted in 432 sampling points across all three villages (730–1360 ha). At each point, a composite topsoil sample was taken and analyzed by MIRS. Conventional laboratory analyses on 25–38% of the samples were used for the prediction of concentration values on the remaining samples through the application of MIRS–partial least squares regression models. These models were successful (R2 ≥ 0.89) for sand, clay, pH, total C and N, exchangeable Ca, Mg and effective CEC; but not for silt, available P and exchangeable K and Al (R2 ≤ 0.82). Minimum sample sizes required to accurately estimate the mean of each soil property in each village were calculated. With regard to locations, fewer samples were needed in the new resettlement area than in the other two areas (e.g. 66 versus 133–473 samples for estimating soil C at 10% error, respectively); regarding parameters, less samples were needed for estimating pH and sand (i.e. 3–52 versus 27–504 samples for the remaining properties, at same error margin). Spatial analyses of soil properties in each village were assessed by constructing standardized isotropic semivariograms, which were usually well described by spherical models. Spatial autocorrelation of most variables was displayed over ranges of 250–695 m. Nugget-to-sill ratios showed that, in general, spatial dependence of soil properties was: new resettlement &gt; old resettlement &gt; communal area; which was potentially attributed to both intrinsic (e.g. texture) and extrinsic (e.g. management) factors. As a new approach, geostatistical analysis was performed using \{MIRS\} data directly, after principal component analyses, where the first three components explained 70% of the overall variability. Semivariograms based on these components showed that spatial dependence per village was similar to overall dependence identified from individual soil properties in each area. In fact, the first component (explaining 49% of variation) related well with all soil properties of reference samples (absolute correlation values of 0.55–0.96). This showed that \{MIRS\} data could be directly linked to geostatistics for a broad and quick evaluation of soil spatial variability. It is concluded that integrating \{MIRS\} with geostatistical analyses is a cost-effective promising approach, i.e. for soil fertility and carbon sequestration assessments, mapping and monitoring at landscape level.

abstract = "Abstract Crop residues are a key livelihood resource in smallholder mixed crop-livestock systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. With expansion of arable land and resultant decline in grazing resources, crop residues are becoming an increasingly important component of livestock feeds. This demand for livestock feeds has implications for the long-term sustainability of such systems since failure to return biomass to soils has implications for soil quality and the capacity of soils to support long-term productivity. Biomass allocation patterns are likely to vary with overall level of productivity and hence availability. In this study we used a household survey to quantify crop residue allocation patterns across a gradient of productivity in Eastern Africa focusing on two sites in Ethiopia and one in Kenya. We assessed the underlying determinants of crop residue allocation patterns with a view to understanding how productivity increases through intensification will influence biomass allocation in Eastern Africa and how livelihood and natural resource management objectives could be optimized. Results showed that farmers strongly favour allocation of residues to livestock feeding but that allocation to soil increases along the productivity gradient. This reduced feeding to livestock and increased allocation to soil fertility is associated with smaller farm sizes leading to reduced animal traction needs for tillage, increased overall livestock productivity, increased use of inputs and a reduced reliance on farm-based activities in overall livelihood strategies. The implications of these trends are that productivity increases in smallholder systems are likely to reduce pressure on biomass in the long term and that measures that enhance the prospects for farmers to intensify their production systems are likely to increase soil health and sustainability objectives in general. A key conclusion of the work is that intensification of livestock production could reduce crop residue allocation to soils with long term implications for soil productivity. "

In 1998, seed collections were made from Spanish cedar in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, for genetic conservation and tree improvement projects. Progeny from these collections were established in genetic trials at Bacalar, Noh Bec, and Zoh Laguna in the Yucatan. Survival at 2 years was 73.5% at Bacalar, 72% at Noh Bec, but only 20% after 6 months for several replicates at Zoh Laguna. Mean 2-year height, number of years of Hypsipyla attack on apical shoots (over 2 or 3 years) and total branching over 2 years, were 1.3 m, 0.04 years, and 2.5 branches at Bacalar, and 1.9 m, 0.35 years, and 1.6 branches at Noh Bec. Selection of the three best provenances (Escárcega, Bacalar, and Calakmul) would result in an estimated cross-site gain of 8.6% in 2-year height. Within-provenance, cross-site heritabilities for 2-year height, shoot borer attack, and branching were 0.1 ± 0.02, 0.0 ± 0.02, and 0.0 ± 0.02, respectively.

Given the known advantage of rapid growth to avoid Hypsipyla damage over the long term and the stable performance of provenances across sites for growth traits, we recommend provenance selection over multiple trials to reduce the risk of serious damage by the insect. Good provenances and other suitable seed sources, as well as proper site selection and silvicultural practices, are important tools for increasing yields from plantations of C. odorata. "

abstract = "Smallholder farms in sub-Saharan Africa face multiple trade-offs when deciding on the allocation of their financial, labour and nutrient resources. Day-to-day decisions have implications for the sustainability of their farming system, implying multiple trade-offs between short- and long-term objectives that have biophysical and socio-economic dimensions. We show that inverse modelling techniques can be used effectively for optimisation and trade-offs analysis of farming systems. By combining the multi-objective shuffled complex evolution metropolis algorithm and a crop/soil dynamic simulation model we were able to select farming strategies that resulted in the best possible trade-offs between different farming objectives. This integrated analytical tool allows optimisation of farmers’ goals similar to linear programming, but an advantage over linear programming is that the proposed method takes into account a wider spectrum of biophysical processes including their interactions and feedbacks. Tradeoffs between resource productivity, use efficiency and conservation in relation to different patterns of resource allocation were analysed for a maize-based, simplified case study farm from western Kenya (2.2 ha – comprising fields of poor, medium and high soil fertility), under three scenarios of financial liquidity to invest in labour and inputs (2000, 5000 and 10,000 \{KSh\} ha−1; 75 \{KSh\} = 1 US$). The maximum farm-scale maize production achieved was larger when financial resources increased. However, increasing maize yields above a certain threshold by applying mineral fertilisers was associated with larger N losses by leaching, runoff and soil erosion; such threshold was 2.7 t grain ha−1 for the scenario of no financial limitations (10,000 \{KSh\} ha−1). N losses at farm scale fluctuated between 36 and 54 kg N ha−1 season−1, while the maximum maize yields achieved were around 3.4 t grain ha−1. Soil losses by erosion increased abruptly beyond a certain maize yield (e.g. 1.8 t grain ha−1 for the 2000 \{KSh\} ha−1 scenario), while the minimum rate of soil loss differed between financial scenarios. Investments in hiring labour were prioritised over fertiliser use to obtain the greatest yields and the allocation of available resources favoured the more fertile fields. This inverse modelling exercise allowed us to analyse trade-offs between different farmers’ objectives and to compare potential resource allocation strategies to achieve them. The set of strategies to achieve different goals was more numerous and variable when the conditions were less conducive for farming. This questions the validity of the prevailing model of extension/communication, based on generalised recommendations for resource-poor farmers in Africa. "

abstract = "The decrease in crop yields at increasing distances from the homesteads within smallholder farms of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is normally ascribed to the existence of within-farm soil fertility gradients. Field observations also suggest that a large part of such variability is concomitantly caused by poor agronomy. To understand the interaction between soil fertility (S factors) and management decisions (M factors) affecting crop variability, we combined field research conducted in western Kenya (Vihiga, Kakamega and Teso districts; rainfall: 1600, 1800 and 1200 mm, respectively) with explorations using the simple dynamic crop/soil model for dynamic simulation of nutrient balances, previously tested for the region. Field measurements indicated within-farm differences in average maize grain yields of 48% (2.7 vs. 1.4 t ha−1) in Vihiga and of 60% (1.5 vs. 0.6 t ha−1) in Teso, between fields that were close and far from the homestead, respectively. Extreme values ranged widely, e.g. between 4.9 and 0.3 t ha−1 for all the farms surveyed in Vihiga, where the average farm size was 0.6 ha. Maize grain yields tended to increase with increasing contents of soil C, total N, extractable P and exchangeable bases. However, the negative relationship between S factors and distance from the homestead was not as strong as expected, and yield variability was better explained by multiple regression models considering M factors such as planting date, plant density, resource use and weed infestation (40–60% across sites). Then, we analysed the variation in resource (cash, labour, N) use efficiency within farms of different resource endowments with the aid of the simulation model. N balances at plot scale varied from ca. +20 to −18 kg ha−1, from −9 to −20 kg ha−1 and from −16 to −18 kg ha−1 for the different fields of the high, medium and low resource endowment case-study farms, respectively. Labour productivities ranged between ca. 10 and 38 kg grain man-day−1 across field and farm types. The results indicate the need of considering within farm heterogeneity when designing soil fertility management interventions. Resource use efficiency was strongly affected by soil quality. As farmers invest more effort and resources in the more productive and less risky fields, the interaction between S and M factors leads to farmer-driven resource use efficiency gradients within smallholder farms.

A simulation model that operates at field scale (DYNBAL-N: \{DYnamic\} simulation of Nutrient BALances) was used to understand the mechanisms leading to differences in resource use efficiency within a farm. We focused on N balances and use efficiencies, as the advantages of increasing the complexity of the calculations by considering the dynamics of the system (relative to the widely-used static approach) are expected to be large for a highly mobile nutrient such as N. The model was tested against a wide range of maize yield data (0.2–3.4 t ha−1) from on-farm measurements undertaken in western Kenya (Vihiga, Kakamega and Teso districts), producing reasonably accurate predictions (r2 = 0.72). Simulation scenarios were selected by considering multiple sources of variability affecting the N balances for typical households in Shinyalu, western Kenya, using field data collected by means of interviews, participatory resource flow mapping, soil sampling and laboratory analysis. The simulation results indicated that the use efficiencies of the biophysical resources radiation, water and N varied across the different fields of the farms, strongly affected by management decisions and soil fertility status. N balances varied between −38.0 and 21.9 kg N ha−1 for the different crop and soil management scenarios. The main N flows explaining the magnitude and the sign of the N balances were N removal by harvest, and N losses by leaching (2.3–18.3 kg ha−1) and by soil erosion (0.6–14.9 kg ha−1). Different options for soil fertility management (N fertilisation rates, manure applications) were then explored for different field types within a farm using the model. The use efficiency of the N applied as mineral fertiliser varied between 15.2 and 48.4 kg grain kg−1 applied N for different crop and soil management scenarios. The results illustrated the advantages of including the temporal dimensions and considering the spatial variability in the calculation of nutrient balances, when realistic scenarios are analysed. These results also indicated that nutrient balances at field scale are of limited value as indicators of resource use efficiency, and that nutrient stocks and corresponding crop yields need to be taken into account.

abstract = "To guide soil fertility investment programmes in sub-Saharan Africa, better understanding is needed of the relative importance of soil and crop management factors in determining smallholder crop yields and yield variability. Spatial variability in crop yields within farms is strongly influenced by variation in both current crop management (e.g. planting dates, fertilizer rates) and soil fertility. Variability in soil fertility is in turn strongly influenced by farmers’ past soil and crop management. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative importance of soil fertility and crop management factors in determining yield variability and the gap between farmers’ maize yields and potential yields in western Kenya. Soil fertility status was assessed on 522 farmers’ fields on 60 farms and paired with data on maize-yield and agronomic management for a sub-sample 159 fields. Soil samples were analysed by wet chemistry methods (1/3 of the samples) and also by near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (all samples). Spectral prediction models for different soil indicators were developed to estimate soil properties for the 2/3 of the samples not analysed by wet chemistry. Because of the complexity of the data set, classification and regression trees (CART) were used to relate crop yields to soil and management factors. Maize grain yields for fields of different soil fertility status as classified by farmers were: poor, 0.5–1.1; medium, 1.0–1.8; high, 1.4–2.5 t ha−1. The \{CART\} analysis showed resource use intensity, planting date, and time of planting were the principal variables determining yield, but at low resource intensity, total soil N and soil Olsen P became important yield-determining factors. Only a small group of plots with high average grain yields (2.5 t ha−1; n = 8) was associated with use of nutrient inputs and good plant stands, whereas the largest group with low average yields (1.2 t ha−1; n = 90) was associated with soil Olsen P values of less than 4 mg kg−1. This classification could be useful as a basis for targeting agronomic advice and inputs to farmers. The results suggest that soil fertility variability patterns on smallholder farms are reinforced by farmers investing more resources on already fertile fields than on infertile fields. \{CART\} proved a useful tool for simplifying analysis and providing robust models linking yield to heterogeneous crop management and soil variables.

We measured the variability of soil fertility with distance from homesteads on smallholder farms of different socio-economic groups on two soil types, a granite sand and a red clay, in Murewa, northeast Zimbabwe. Soil organic matter, available P and \{CEC\} decreased with distance from homestead on most farms. Soil available P was particularly responsive to management, irrespective of soil type, as it was more concentrated on the plots closest to homesteads on wealthy farms (8–13 mg kg−1), compared with plots further from homesteads and all plots on poor farms (2–6 mg kg−1). There was a large gap in amounts of mineral fertilizers used by the wealthiest farmers (&gt;100 kg N and &gt;15 kg P per farm; 39 kg N ha−1 and 7 kg P ha−1) and the poorest farmers (&lt;20 kg N and &lt;10 kg P per farm; 19 kg N ha−1 and 4 kg P ha−1). The wealthy farmers who owned cattle also used large amounts of manure, which provided at least 90 kg N and 25 kg P per farm per year (36 kg N ha−1 and 10 kg P ha−1). The poor farmers used little or no organic sources of nutrients. The wealthiest farmers distributed mineral fertilizers evenly across their farms, but preferentially targeted manure to the plots closest to the homesteads, which received about 70 kg N and 18 kg P per plot (76 kg N ha−1 and 21 kg P ha−1) from manure compared with 23 kg N and 9 kg P per plot on the mid-fields (26 kg N ha−1 and 10 kg P ha−1), and 10 kg N and 1 kg P per plot (and ha−1) on the outfields. Crop allocation on the homefields was most diversified on the wealthiest farms where maize was allocated 41% of the area followed by grain legumes (24%) and paprika (21%). Maize was allocated at least 83% of the homefields on farms with less access to resources. All the farmers invariably applied nutrients to maize but little to groundnut. Maize grain yields were largest on the homefields on the wealthy farms (2.7–5.0 t ha−1), but poor across all fields on the poor farms (0.3–1.9 t ha−1). Groundnut grain yields showed little difference between farms and plots. N and P partial balances were largest on the wealthy farms, although these fluctuated from season to season (−20 to +80 kg N per farm and 15–30 kg P per farm; average 21 kg N ha−1 and 8 kg P ha−1). The partial balances on the wealthy farms were largest on the homefield (20–30 kg N and 13 kg P per plot; &gt;26 kg N ha−1 and &gt;13 kg P ha−1), but decreased to 10–20 N and 6–9 kg P per plot (&lt;20 kg N ha−1 and 13 kg P ha−1) in mid-fields and −7 to +10 kg N and −1 to +1 kg P per plot (&lt;10 kg N ha−1 and &lt;2 kg P ha−1) in the outfields. N and P balances differed little across plots on the poor farms (−2 to +4 kg per plot; −5 to +4 kg ha−1) due to limited nutrients applied and small off-take from small harvests. This study highlights the need to consider soil fertility gradients and the crop and nutrient management patterns creating them when designing options to improve resource use efficiency on smallholder farms.

International Journal of Epidemiology, 32, 556–562] showed that aflatoxin exposure among these children is widespread (99%) and that growth faltering is associated with high blood aflatoxin-albumin adducts (AF-alb adducts), a measure of recent past exposure. The present report demonstrates that consumption of maize is an important source of aflatoxin exposure for the survey population. Higher AF-alb adducts were correlated with higher A. flavus (CFU) infestation of maize (p = 0.006), higher aflatoxin contamination (ppb) of maize (p &lt; 0.0001) and higher consumption frequencies of maize (p = 0.053). The likelihood of aflatoxin exposure from maize was particularly high in agro-ecological zones where the frequency of maize consumption (SGS and CS), the presence of aflatoxin in maize (SGS) or the presence of A. flavus on maize (NGS and SGS) was relatively high. Socio-economic background did not affect the presence of A. flavus and aflatoxin in maize, but better maternal education was associated with lower frequencies of maize consumption among children from the northernmost agro-ecological zone (SS) (p = 0.001). The impact of groundnut consumption on aflatoxin exposure was limited in this population. High AF-alb adduct levels were correlated with high prevalence of A. flavus and aflatoxin in groundnut, but significance was weak after adjustment for weaning status, agro-ecological zone and maternal socio-economic status (resp. p = 0.091 and p = 0.083). Ingestion of A. flavus and aflatoxin was high in certain agro-ecological zones (SS and SGS) and among the higher socio-economic strata due to higher frequencies of groundnut consumption. Contamination of groundnuts was similar across socio-economic and agro-ecological boundaries. In conclusion, dietary exposure to aflatoxin from groundnut was less than from maize in young children from Benin and Togo. Intervention strategies that aim to reduce dietary exposure in this population need to focus on maize consumption in particular, but they should not ignore consumption of groundnuts. "

Dieldrin resistance was detected in An. funestus populations from West (Burkina Faso) and central (Cameroon) Africa, but populations from East (Uganda) and Southern Africa (Mozambique and Malawi) were fully susceptible to this insecticide. Partial sequencing of the dieldrin target site, the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor, identified two amino acid substitutions, \{A296S\} and V327I. The \{A296S\} mutation has been associated with dieldrin resistance in other species. The \{V327I\} mutations was detected in the resistant sample from Burkina Faso and Cameroon and consistently associated with the \{A296S\} substitution. The full-length of the An. funestus GABA-receptor gene, amplified by RT-PCR, generated a sequence of 1674 bp encoding 557 amino acid of the protein in An. funestus with 98% similarity to that of Anopheles gambiae. Two diagnostic assays were developed to genotype the \{A296S\} mutation (pyrosequencing and PCR-RFLP), and use of these assays revealed high frequency of the resistant allele in Burkina Faso (60%) and Cameroon (82%), moderate level in Benin (16%) while low frequency or absence of the mutation was observed respectively in Uganda (7.5%) or 0% in Malawi and Mozambique. The distribution of the RdlR mutation in An. funestus populations in Africa suggests extensive barriers to gene flow between populations from different regions. "

As nutrient use efficiency varies strongly along these gradients, such heterogeneity must be considered when designing soil management strategies, aimed at an improved overall resource use efficiency at farm scale. Here, we quantify the magnitude and study the origin of farmer-induced, within-farm soil fertility gradients as affected by biophysical and socio-economic conditions, and investigate farmers’ perceptions of such heterogeneity. Farm transects, participatory resource flow mapping, farmers’ classification of land qualities, and soil sampling for both chemical and spectral reflectance analyses were performed across 60 farms in three sub-locations (Emuhaia, Shinyalu, Aludeka) representing the variability found in the highlands of western Kenya. Differences between the various field types of a farm were observed for input use (e.g. 0.7–104 kg N ha−1), food production (e.g. 0.6–2.9 t \{DM\} ha−1), partial C (e.g. −570 to 1480 kg ha−1) and N (e.g. −92 to 57 kg ha−1) balances and general soil fertility status, despite strong differences across sub-locations. Concentration of nutrients in the home fields compared with the remote fields were verified for extractable P (e.g. 2.1–19.8 mg kg−1) and secondarily for exchangeable K (e.g. 0.14–0.54 cmol(+) kg−1), on average, whereas differences for soil C and N were only important when considering each individual farm separately. Farmers managed their fields according to their perceived land quality, varying the timing and intensity of management practices along soil fertility gradients. Fields classified by them as poor were planted later (up to 33.6 days of delay), with sparser crops (ca. 30% less plants m−2) and had higher weed infestation levels than those classified as fertile, leading to important differences in maize yield (e.g. 0.9 versus 2.4 t ha−1). The internal heterogeneity in resource allocation varied also between farms of different social classes, according to their objectives and factor constraints. Additionally, the interaction of sub-location-specific socio-economic (population, markets) and biophysical factors (soilscape variability) determined the patterns of resource allocation to different activities. Such interactions need to be considered for the characterisation of farming system to facilitate targeting research and development interventions to address the problem of poor soil fertility. "

Causes of variability in soil fertility management at different scales of analysis are both biophysical and socio-economic. Such heterogeneity is categorised in this study, which quantifies its impact on nutrient flows and soil fertility status at region and farm scales, as a first step in identifying spatial and temporal niches for targeting of soil fertility management strategies and technologies. Transects for soil profile observation, participatory rural appraisal techniques and classical soil sampling and chemical analysis were sampled across 60 farms in three sub-locations (Emuhaia, Shinyalu, Aludeka), which together represent much of the variability found in the highlands of western Kenya. Five representative farm types were identified using socio-economic information and considering production activities, household objectives and the main constraints faced by farmers. Soil fertility management and nutrient resource flows were studied for each farm type and related to differences in soil fertility status at farm scale. Farm types 1 and 2 were the wealthiest; the former relied on off-farm income and farmed small pieces of land (0.6–1.1 ha) while the latter farmed relatively large land areas (1.6–3.8 ha) mainly with cash crops. The poorest farm type 5 also farmed small pieces of land (0.4–1.0 ha) but relied on low wages derived from working for wealthier farmers. Both farm types 1 and 5 relied on off-farm earnings and sold the least amounts of farm produce to the market, though the magnitude of their cash, labour and nutrient flows was contrasting. Farms of types 3 and 4 were intermediate in size and wealth, and represented different crop production strategies for self-consumption and the market. Average grain yields fluctuated around 1 t ha−1 year−1 for all farm types and sub-locations. Grain production by farms of types 4 and 5 was much below annual family requirements, estimated at 170 kg person−1 year−1. Household wealth and production orientation affected the pattern of resource flow at farm scale. In the land-constrained farms of type 1, mineral fertilisers were often used more intensively (ca. 50 kg ha−1), though with varying application rates (14–92 kg ha−1). The use of animal manure in such small farms (e.g. 2.2 t year−1) represented intensities of use of up to 8 t ha−1, and a net accumulation of C and macronutrients brought into the farm by livestock. In farms of type 5, intensities of use of mineral and organic fertilisers ranged between 0–12 kg ha−1 and 0–0.5 t ha−1, respectively. A consistent trend of decreasing input use from farm types 1–5 was generally observed, but nutrient resources and land management practices (e.g. fallow) differed enormously between sub-locations. Inputs of nutrients were almost nil in Aludeka farms. Both inherent soil properties and management explained the variability found in soil fertility status. Texture explained the variation observed in soil C and related total N between sub-locations, whereas P availability varied mainly between farm types as affected by input use. "

Important yield variability has been reported at different scales, reflecting the intensity and spatial distribution of growth-limiting and growth-reducing factors. Maize yield estimation represents a valuable tool to assess within-farm variability in soil fertility through crop performance. The objective of this study was to develop mathematical relationships between plant morphological attributes and grain yield of tropical maize genotypes, based on plant allometric characteristics. These models were used to estimate maize yields and the estimates were validated against independent data collected from experimental and farmers’ fields in western Kenya. Three commercial hybrids and three local varieties were considered. Multiple linear regression models including plant height and either ear length or ear diameter as explanatory variables, and simple linear regressions including only plant height, were the most accurate to estimate both total aboveground biomass and grain dry matter yields per plant (r2: 0.76–0.91). Average values for the harvest index ranged between 0.34 and 0.42, varying with the total aboveground biomass produced per plant. Yield estimations on ground area basis for farmers’ fields were acceptably accurate. Plant height measurements can be easily taken at any moment after maize flowering and used in simple models to estimate maize yield. This approach proved also a valuable tool to discuss yield variability with farmers. "

abstract = "Resources for crop production are often scarce in smallholder farming systems in the tropics, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Decisions on the allocation of such resources are often made at farm rather than at field plot scale. To handle the uncertainty caused by both lack of data and imperfect knowledge inherent to these agricultural systems, we developed a dynamic summary model of the soil–crop system that captures essential interactions determining the short- and long-term crop productivity, while keeping a degree of simplicity that allows its parameterisation, use and dissemination in the tropics. Generic, summary functions describing crop productivity may suffice for addressing questions concerning trade-offs on resource allocation at farm scale. Such functions can be derived from empirical (historical) data or, when they involve potential or water-limited crop yields, can be generated using process-based, detailed crop simulation models. This paper describes the approach to simulating crop productivity implemented in the model \{FIELD\} (Field-scale Interactions, use Efficiencies and Long-Term soil fertility Development), based on the availability of light, water, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, and the interactions between these factors. We describe how these interactions are simulated and use examples from case studies in African farming systems to illustrate the use of detailed crop models to generate summary functions and the ability of \{FIELD\} to capture long-term trends in soil C and crop yields, crop responses to applied nutrients across heterogeneous smallholder farms and the implications of overlooking the effects of intra-seasonal rainfall variability in the model. An example is presented that evaluates the sensitivity of the model to resource allocation decisions when operating (linked to livestock and household models) at farm scale. Further, we discuss the assessment of model performance, going beyond the calculation of simple statistics to compare simulated and observed results to include broader criteria such as model applicability. In data-scarce environments such as SSA, uncertainty in parameter values constrains the performance of detailed process-based models, often forcing model users to ‘guess’ (or set to default values) parameters that are seldom measured in practice. The choice of model depends on its suitability and appropriateness to analyse the relevant scale for the question addressed. Simpler yet dynamic models of the various subsystems (crop, soil, livestock, manure) may prove more robust than detailed, process-based models when analysing farm scale questions on system design and resource allocation in SSA.

This heterogeneity means that recommendations based on regional soil surveys are of limited value. The variability in soil qualities within farms must be considered when designing management strategies, and their feasibility analysed by integrating results at the farm livelihood scale. For this purpose, we have developed the model FARMSIM, a dynamic bio-economic model for analysis and exploration of trade-offs in resource and labour allocation in heterogeneous smallholder farms. Focusing on farm-scale strategies, the approach to simulation of soil and crop processes in \{FARMSIM\} (the sub-model FIELD) is designed to be simple, but to keep the necessary degree of complexity to capture heterogeneity in resource use efficiencies. To test our approach, the sub-model \{FIELD\} was calibrated against chronosequences of woodland clearance in three agroecological zones of Zimbabwe (with soil textures of 3, 10, 35% clay), and used to simulate: (i) the creation of soil fertility gradients, and (ii) different strategies of N, P and manure applications to maize and soyabean rotations in homefields and outfields of smallholder farms on clayey and sandy soils. The results of the simulation of management strategies were tested against on-farm experimental data from Murewa, Zimbabwe. The model produced satisfactory predictions (r2: 0.6–0.9) of long-term changes in soil organic C, of crop responses to N and P and of nutrient use efficiencies across a wide range of yields and different field types. This demonstrated the broad applicability of the model despite the sparse data required for initialisation. However, the model results were less accurate in predicting crop responses to N and P applications in the outfields on sandy soils. Experimental evidence indicated yield limitation by Ca and Zn deficiencies in highly depleted outfields on sandy soils, which were not included mechanistically in the current version of FIELD. Repeated applications of 16 t ha−1 year−1 of manure allowed larger responses to applied N and P after 3 years of experimentation; such a corrective effect of manure was simulated to be due to improved N and P recovery efficiencies in the model. In combination with the experimental data, the simulation results suggested that soil fertility gradients affect nutrient use efficiencies, operating mostly on the efficiencies of nutrient capture rather than conversion. A typology of fields according to the type of management interventions needed is introduced, based on a generic application of \{FIELD\} with this parameterisation. "

This paper focuses on farming systems in the semi-arid areas of Zimbabwe, where biomass production is limited and farmers integrate crop and livestock activities. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is promoted to intensify crop production, emphasizing the retention of surface mulch with crop residues (CR). This paper quantifies the associated potential economic trade-offs and profitability of using residues for soil amendment or as livestock feed, and explores alternative biomass production options. We draw on household surveys, stakeholder feedback, crop, livestock and economic modeling tools. We use the Trade-Off Analysis Model for Multi Dimensional Impact Assessment (TOA-MD) to compare different \{CR\} use scenarios at community level and for different farm types: particularly the current base system (cattle grazing of maize residues) and sustainable intensification alternatives based on a \{CA\} option (mulching using maize residues ± inorganic fertilizer) and a maize–mucuna (Mucuna pruriens) rotation. Our results indicate that a maize–mucuna rotation can reduce trade-offs between \{CR\} uses for feed and mulch, providing locally available organic soil enhancement, supplementary feed and a potential source of income. Conservation Agriculture without fertilizer application and at non-subsidized fertilizer prices is not financially viable; whereas with subsidized fertilizer it can benefit half the farm population. The poverty effects of all considered alternative biomass options are however limited; they do not raise income sufficiently to lift farmers out of poverty. Further research is needed to establish the competitiveness of alternative biomass enhancing technologies and the socio-economic processes that can facilitate sustainable intensification of mixed crop-livestock systems, particularly in semi-arid environments.

On-station trials were conducted at Minjibir near Kano during the 1994 and 1995 rainy seasons to determine the components of the water balance and compare water use (WU) and water productivity of millet planted sole (SM) at the recommended optimum densities and intercropped at farmers’ planting densities under two levels of soil fertility. Infiltration rates were generally high, with an overall mean in the porous sandy soil of 17 cm h−1. Deep drainage losses accounted for 15% of annual rainfall in a low rainfall season (1995) and an estimated more than 20% in the wet 1994 season. Additional top dress \{NPK\} fertilizers (OM+IF) to cereals prior to the commencement of reproductive stages, increased soil water extraction in the intercrops in the drier year, for which soil water status was, therefore, higher in plots where only organic manure (OM) was applied. The relatively higher annual rainfall in 1994 generally increased soil water use. Later maturity of sorghum in the M–S–C intercrop increased \{WU\} of this cropping system, particularly in 1995. \{SM\} produced significantly (P&lt;0.01 in 1994 and P&lt;0.05 in 1995) higher total dry matter (TDM) than the intercrops, a trend shown over the complete growing season most of the time, with the exception of \{OM\} \{SM\} in 1995. The total grain yield was significantly (P&lt;0.01) higher in \{SM\} in the wet 1994 season. Millet, particularly when intercropped, used water more efficiently for grain production in 1995 along with other limiting resources. It showed better adaptation to moisture stress by producing similar (P=0.79) harvest indices (HIs) in sole and intercropped millet. \{HIs\} of the sole cereals and the \{OM\} M–C were relatively higher in the 1995 than in the wet 1994 season.

Over all farms, net returns from aquaculture increased by 5 times over pre-project levels. Productivity, intensity and profitability increased more significantly in periurban areas with good market access, compared to rural areas. Among farmers with good market access, average net income from the aquaculture enterprise rose from $118 up to $1485. Research-Extension Team (RET) support cost an average of $61,300 per year. Over 5 years, rural farmers recaptured 23% of the relevant \{RET\} investment compared to 442% by periurban farmers. Likewise, increase in production attributable to \{RET\} intervention was higher for periurban (253%) compared to rural (11.3%) fish farmers. Within 3 years of the end of extension support, rural farmers had returned to pre-project production levels, whereas periurban farms had better maintained their productivity and profitability. Findings indicate that, in areas with little or no access to markets, the number of fishponds and fish farmers can be increased and yields improved, increasing local food supplies, but sustainability in the absence of extension subsidies is questionable. To achieve either of the two principal goals for the sector, food security and/or poverty alleviation, investments need to be made in improving the availability of quality technical assistance to targeted farmers and finding means of reducing social conflict arising from perceived inequalities in the accrual of the benefits of development.

The study established that even the most advanced broadband sensors (i.e., ETM+, IKONOS, and ALI) had serious limitations in modeling biomass and in classifying forest \{LULC\} classes. The broadband models explained only 13–60% of the variability in biomass across primary forests, secondary forests, and fallows. The overall accuracies were between 42% and 51% for classifying nine complex rainforest \{LULC\} classes using the broadband data of these sensors. Within individual vegetation types (e.g., primary or secondary forest), the overall accuracies increased slightly, but followed a similar trend. Among the broadband sensors, \{ALI\} sensor performed better than the \{IKONOS\} and ETM+ sensors. When compared to the three broadband sensors, Hyperion narrowband data produced (1) models that explained 36–83% more of the variability in rainforest biomass, and (2) \{LULC\} classifications with 45–52% higher overall accuracies. Twenty-three Hyperion narrowbands that were most sensitive in modeling forest biomass and in classifying forest \{LULC\} classes were identified and discussed. "

Protected areas were established decades ago in order to preserve the forest's unique biodiversity from being converted into agricultural land by the regions large number of small-scale farmers. Nonetheless, recent research shows that degradation continues at alarming rates. In this paper we address an important challenge faced by protected area management, namely, the design of a cost-effective incentive scheme that balances local demand for subsistence non-timber forest products against conservation interests. Using primary data collected from 369 randomly selected farm-households we combine a farm-household classification with mathematical programming in order to estimate the opportunity costs of conserving the Kakamega Forest and restricting access to non-timber forest product resources. We validate our model and analyze the impact of changes in major economic frame conditions on our results before we derive recommendations for an improved protected area management in the study region. Our findings suggest that a more flexible approach to determining the price of recently established forest product extraction permits would greatly enhance management efficiency without significantly compromising local wellbeing.

Grain losses, pest and predator numbers as well as infestations by Sitophilus zeamais were, in addition, assessed monthly in nearby grain stores. In southern Togo and Benin, a comparison with previous trap catches showed a steady decline in P. truncatus numbers after introduction of T. nigrescens in 1992. At the same time, grain losses decreased to levels corresponding with the average losses reported prior to the arrival of P. truncatus, which were mainly caused by S. zeamais. P. truncatus trap catches were lowest in the \{HFS\} and around double in the three northern zones while T. nigrescens in traps decreased rapidly from \{FSM\} to NGS/SS. The latter was probably due to the later arrival of T. nigrescens in those regions; thus, the pest–predator system might not yet be at equilibrium. Similar to previous studies, yearly fluctuations in P. truncatus flight behavior could not only be attributed to T. nigrescens, but were also a result of changing weather patterns. Moreover, it is suggested that the role of wild woody habitats in suppressing the pest via its predator T. nigrescens has so far been underestimated. "

The “Push–Pull” technology (“PPT”) has been described as an appropriate innovative technology capable of addressing these constraints. The technology involves intercropping maize with Desmodium and planting Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) around the intercrop, but in the current study a modified \{PPT\} was used and Napier grass was not included. Field trials were conducted in two locations in western Kenya during 4 subsequent seasons to test the hypothesis that maize yield, the degree of Striga suppression and economic benefits of intercropping maize with Desmodium are affected by: (i) the related biomass production by different Desmodium species and (ii) the cutting regime of the Desmodium. Maize was intercropped with Desmodium uncinatum (Jacq.) DC, cv Silverleaf or Desmodium intortum (Mill.) Urb. cv Greenleaf, and treatments with sole maize (with and without urea) were included for comparison. To eliminate phosphorus (P) deficiency, all treatments received basal P. The first two Desmodium cutting events were fixed at land preparation i.e. at the start of every season, and 4 weeks later, following the recommended practice, while the third cutting was varied and conducted at 9, 12 or 18 weeks after planting maize. Maize yield in the Desmodium–maize intercropping system was only higher than sole maize without urea from the third season. This implies that when P is not limiting inclusion of Desmodium spp. into the maize cropping system would provide a substitute for inorganic N fertilizers to enhance crop growth and yield after Desmodium becomes well established. Cumulative maize grain yield over the four seasons with the D. intortum and D. uncinatum intercrops were 6.3 and 7.0, and 10.9 and 11.6 t ha−1 in Busia and Siaya, respectively, and significantly higher than or comparable to a maize monocrop (5.8 and 11.8 t ha−1). Average net benefits from Desmodium intercropping over the four seasons were increased by 1290 and 918$ ha−1 relative to the maize monocrop in Busia and Siaya, respectively. Biomass yields were significantly higher for D. intortum than for D. uncinatum. Varying the time of the third Desmodium cutting had little effect on Desmodium biomass yields or maize grain yields in Busia, while in Siaya, D. intortum biomass yields were highest when cut at 12 weeks after planting. In the Desmodium intercropping systems, Striga counts were reduced by 95% in Busia and by 65–90% in Siaya with higher reductions when Desmodium was cut at 18 weeks after planting. In summary, the use of \{PPT\} provides robust and high economic benefits to smallholder farmers in western Kenya. The use of D. uncinatum with the third cutting at 18 weeks after planting is recommended, but can be modified according to the need for fodder without much effect on maize yield or revenue. "

However, growers have little reliable information on the factors that affect the development and yield of the crop, and therefore there is a dearth of information on how to effectively manage the crop. Site specific information recorded by small-scale producers of the Andean blackberry on their production systems and soils coupled with publicly available meteorological data was used to develop models of such production systems. Multilayer perceptrons and Self-Organizing Maps were used as computational models in the identification and visualization of the most important variables for modeling the production of Andean blackberry. Artificial neural networks were trained with information from 20 sites in Colombia where the Andean blackberry is cultivated. Multilayer perceptrons predicted with a reasonable degree of accuracy the production response of the crop. The soil depth, the average temperature, external drainage, and the accumulated precipitation of the first month before harvest were critical determinants of productivity. A proxy variable of location was used to describe overall differences in management between farmers groups. The use of this proxy indicated that, even under essentially similar environmental conditions, large differences in production could be assigned to management effects. The information obtained can be used to determine sites that are suitable for Andean blackberry production, and to transfer of management practices from sites of high productivity to sites with similar environmental conditions which currently have lower levels of productivity.

Rice (Oryza spp.) is a promising crop for farming in floodplains because of its high adaptability to a wide range of water environments. On the other hand, there is great variation in soil fertility and water availability even in a small area within a floodplain. Hence, we evaluated 27 rice genotypes in four fields in three years in a floodplain of the Northern Region of Ghana to investigate genotype × environment (G × E) interactions for rice yield and to identify stable, high-yielding genotypes. The genotypes consisted of O. sativa, O. glaberrima and New Rice for Africa (NERICA), and many were selected for their reported submergence resistance because of the anticipated submergence damage in the floodplain. There were large variations in yield, which ranged from 0.14 to 5.35 t ha−1 depending on the location within a floodplain, genotype and year, and there were significant genotype, environment and G × E interaction effects on yield, accounting for 24.8%, 20.2%, and 28.2%, respectively, of the total variation. The results suggested that selection of suitable location with high soil fertility and low risk of submergence is necessary to achieve high yield in a floodplain. In addition, early sowing would be effective high-yielding crop management, which reduced the risk of submergence-induced damage just after sowing and secured sufficient growth duration to achieve high yield. Genotype \{IR42\} showed the highest average yield among environments, but its yield stability was low. On the other hand, several genotypes including Amankwatia, a local aromatic cultivar adapted to irrigated and lowland environments, and IRBL9-W[RL], a blast-tolerant variety containing the Sub1 gene for submergence tolerance, showed high, stable yield. To put these results to practical use in other floodplain areas in West Africa, physiological mechanisms causing G × E interaction for rice yield should be further studied. "

We hypothesise that substitution of triple super phosphate (TSP) fertiliser with farmyard manure (FYM) and its localised application in the planting row increases the agronomic use efficiency (AE) of the P fertiliser applied. Field experiments were conducted during the 2009 long rains (LRs) and short rains (SRs) at three sites (Sega, Bokoli and Teso) located in western Kenya, to assess (i) the effect of concentrating \{FYM\} in different areas of the planting rows, (ii) \{FYM\} and \{TSP\} applications at different substitution rates and (iii) the effect of \{FYM\} and \{TSP\} additions and/or their combinations on soil pH, available P, maize yields, \{AE\} and economic benefits. Treatments included substituting \{TSP\} by \{FYM\} at 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% of the 26 kg P ha−1 recommended rate. Further, 13 kg P ha−1 \{FYM\} was either applied to 100% of planting area (i.e. broadcast) or localised in only 50% or 25%, of the planting area of the maize row. Results show that \{FYM\} and \{TSP\} combinations increased maize grain yields by over 200% in Sega, 90–150% in Teso and 20–50% in Bokoli relative to the control. The \{AE\} largely depended on the relative fertility of the soils but increased with an increase in \{FYM\} in the substitutions. Soil pH and available P were improved by \{FYM\} applications only in the second season (2009 SRs). Maximising P from \{FYM\} in the substitutions increased net benefits by over 33% with gross benefit cost ratios &gt; 4.5 $ $−1 relative to sole \{TSP\} application at 26 kg P ha−1. Concentrating \{FYM\} in 25% of the planting area gave over 32% increases in net benefits relative to broadcast.

In order to assess persistence of toxigenic fungi in cassava chips, aflatoxin-producing fungi (Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus nomius, and Aspergillus parasiticus) and aflatoxins were contrasted at regular intervals in home-stored cassava chips collected in two locations of southern Cameroon throughout a two-month monitoring period. Three hundred and forty-six isolates of aflatoxin-producing fungi were found to be associated with all samples. A. flavus contaminated more samples in both types of chips (267 isolates in 53 samples), followed by A. nomius (58 isolates in 15 samples), whereas A. parasiticus was rarest. A direct competitive Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based method was implemented to quantify the content in aflatoxins. Eighteen of the samples contained some aflatoxins at detectable levels whereas 54 did not. The levels of aflatoxin ranged between 5.2 and 14.5 ppb. The distribution of aflatoxin in positive samples depended on 8 parameters including pH, moisture content, storage duration, types of chips, level of contamination by aflatoxin-producing fungi, processing practices and storage facilities.

This study, carried out around the Pendjari National Park, determined factors which support local communities' positive perceptions towards biodiversity conservation in the park, analysed their assessment of current park management activities compared to former management approaches and draw the implications for effective participatory management of protected areas. We collected socio-demographic data from 164 residents on their awareness of conservation methods. We used Stepwise Discriminant Analysis to differentiate the variables that had the greatest power for discriminating between local residents' perception to conserve or not biodiversity and to manage the park. The findings indicated that the positive behavior of local communities towards conservation of biodiversity within Pendjari National Park was highly correlated with the current management strategy that involved more effectively local communities, the educational level of participants and their geographical origins. Participants' perceptions of biodiversity conservation were strongly related to locally perceived benefits. Although 89% of participants were favorable to the concept of biodiversity conservation within the park, the decision to ban encroachments due to agricultural activities increased negative opinion on this park management option. Our results suggested that understanding local residents' perceptions and using them as a starting point to improve the park–people relationship could help park management staff to involve more effectively local communities and improve their awareness about biodiversity conservation within the park.

However, ongoing habitat fragmentation, degradation and destruction of natural habitats threaten biodiversity. A set of seven threats to natural ecosystems derived from a previous study (Jarvis et al. 2010), combined with a dataset of occurrences from 16,339 species, and also with the World Database of Protected Areas were used to analyse the patterns of threats to flora in South America and its conservation. Species richness per ∼50 km side cell ranged from 1 to 2149 taxa, but with most of the areas presenting between 1 and 58 taxa. Population accessibility, expansion of agriculture and grazing pressure were found to be the key drivers of immediate extinction risk. A considerable (78.4%) number of species presented at least one population under high threat due to the expansion and intensification of these anthropogenic activities. In addition, some 13.8% of the analysed species presented up to 80% of their populations at risk of extinction (high threat index). On the conservation side, 82.3% of the analysed taxa have at least one population occurring within a protected site. However, it is important to note that for a protected area system to be effective and efficient, the conservation of within-taxon genetic diversity is required. The expansion, monitoring and strengthening of 24 existing protected areas holding up to 70% of South American plant diversity is suggested; as is the revision of seven additional sites where up to 200 species not currently conserved are present. Critical areas to monitor, expand and strengthen are mainly located in the Ecuadorian and Colombian Andes, southern Paraguay, the Guyana shield, southern Brazil, and Bolivia. "

Successful control depends on eliminating the seed reserves of Striga spp. in soil and preventing parasitism. A proven method of eliminating these seed reserves is soil-injection of ethylene gas. This method was used successfully in the United States to control Striga asiatica, but injection of ethylene gas is potentially dangerous, very costly, and generally unsuitable in Africa. The bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pathovar glycinea synthesizes relatively large amounts of ethylene. In this study a laboratory procedure was developed for testing strains of P. syringae pv. glycinea for efficacy in stimulating germination of seeds of Striga spp. The procedure allows comparisons among bacteria, volatile compounds, root exudates, and synthetic stimulants for germination of Striga spp. seeds. Seeds of three Striga spp. were tested over a 10-month period. No seed germination was ever observed with sterile water. When compared across Striga spp. the bacterial strains were consistently better stimulators of germination of seeds of the parasites than ethylene gas or root pieces of a Vigna unguiculata cultivar known to stimulate germination of parasite seeds. The strains were as effective in germinating S. aspera and S. gesnerioides seeds as a synthetic germination stimulant. Our results showing that ethylene-producing bacteria are highly effective in promoting seed germination in Striga spp. suggest that these bacteria may provide a practical means of biological control of Striga spp. in Africa and other locations.

In some situations, the uncertainties associated with choices in model structure, model inputs and parameters can exceed the spatiotemporal variability of simulated yields, thus limiting predictability. For Indian groundnut, we used the General Large Area Model for annual crops (GLAM) with an existing framework to decompose uncertainty, to first understand how skill changes with added model complexity, and then to determine the relevant uncertainty sources in yield and other prognostic variables (total biomass, leaf area index and harvest index). We developed an ensemble of simulations by perturbing \{GLAM\} parameters using two different input meteorology datasets, and two model versions that differ in the complexity with which they account for assimilation. We found that added complexity improved model skill, as measured by changes in the root mean squared error (RMSE), by 5–10% in specific pockets of western, central and southern India, but that 85% of the groundnut growing area either did not show improved skill or showed decreased skill from such added complexity. Thus, adding complexity or using overly complex models at regional or global scales should be exercised with caution. Uncertainty analysis indicated that, in situations where soil and air moisture dynamics are the major determinants of productivity, predictability in yield is high. Where uncertainty for yield is high, the choice of weather input data was found critical for reducing uncertainty. However, for other prognostic variables (including leaf area index, total biomass and the harvest index) parametric uncertainty was generally the most important source, with a contribution of up to 90% in some cases, suggesting that regional-scale data additional to yield to constrain model parameters is needed. Our study provides further evidence that regional-scale studies should explicitly quantify multiple uncertainty sources. "

Farmers selected preferred varieties and explained their reasons (criteria) for making the selections. Seven promiscuous varieties had better yields than a local one. Farmers’ selection criteria fell into three broad categories relating to yield, appearance and labour. Selection criteria were not primarily aimed to improve soil fertility. This created a challenge to embed the new varieties within the local farming systems for soil fertility improvement.

Bituminaria breeding programs aim to develop and conserve hybrids with desirable traits such as high forage quality, tolerance to biotic or abiotic stresses, and high contents of furanocoumarins. In this work we present a cryopreservation study of different B. bituminosa accessions: two varieties and eight intervarietal hybrids resulting from crosses between the three botanical varieties: var. bituminosa, var. crassiuscula, and var. albomarginata. No previous work on cryopreservation of Bituminaria species has been reported. We applied the ultra-fast cooling method, using droplet vitrification on aluminum foil strips. First, we investigated the \{PVS2\} toxicity and cryopreservation damage in two genotypes, comparing three \{PVS2\} treatments and two culture media. An incubation of 30 min in \{PVS2\} resulted in regeneration rates after cryopreservation higher than 80%. The \{MS\} medium was selected for optimal meristem outgrowth, in order to avoid the prominent callus formation that was observed in the presence of BAP. These conditions were subsequently used to cryopreserve eight other genotypes. The results were highly variable; 45 days after cryopreservation, survival ranged between 22% and 98% while regeneration ranged between 0% and 96%, depending on the accession. A significant and positive correlation was observed between survival and regeneration. At 90 days post culture plantlets could be recovered from cryopreserved explants of all genotypes. This study shows that the droplet vitrification method is promising for the cryopreservation of eight of the 10 genotypes assayed and the method can thus be applied to develop a cryobank of B. bituminosa.

Success with adopting \{CA\} on farms in Africa has been limited, despite more than two decades of research and development investments. Through analyzing past and on-going \{CA\} experiences in a set of case studies, this paper seeks to better understand the reasons for the limited adoption of \{CA\} and to assess where, when and for whom \{CA\} works best. \{CA\} is analyzed and understood within a framework that distinguishes the following scales of analysis: field, farm, village and region. \{CA\} has a potential to increase crop yields in the fields, especially under conditions of erratic rainfall and over the long-term as a result of a gradual increase of overall soil quality. The impact on farm income with the practice of \{CA\} on some fields of the farm is far less evident, and depends on the type of farm. The lack of an immediate increase in farm income with \{CA\} explains in many cases the non-adoption of CA. Smallholders have often short-term time horizons: future benefits do not adequately outweigh their immediate needs. Another key factor that explains the limited \{CA\} adoption in mixed crop-livestock farming systems is the fact that crop harvest residues are preferably used as fodder for livestock, preventing their use as soil cover. Finally, in most case studies good markets for purchase of inputs and sale of produce – a key prerequisite condition for adoption of new technologies – were lacking. The case studies show clear evidence for the need to target end users (not all farmers are potential end user of CA) and adapt \{CA\} systems to the local circumstances of the farmers, considering in particular the farmer's investment capacity in the practice of \{CA\} and the compatibility of \{CA\} with his/her production objectives and existing farming activities. The identification of situations where, when and for whom \{CA\} works will help future development agents to better target their investments with CA. "

Environmental differences between coffee-growing areas in the departments of Cauca and Nariño were statistically significant for several characteristics, including the number of dry months, annual precipitation and diurnal temperature range. The dominant varieties (Caturra and Colombia) did not show major differences in quality attributes, and were pooled for the analyses with the environmental data. There are significant differences in biochemical and sensorial product characteristics between the two departments. The spatial patterns in product characteristics exhibit a non-random, regionally-changing structure that is related to those in the environmental data. The generated results provided ample evidence to support the application for regionally-based denominations of origin. Recommendations were derived to help mainstreaming the developed approach and thereby facilitate policy decisions for its use in other geographies and with other crops. Furthermore, the importance of systematic interdisciplinary institutional collaboration for large-scale denomination of origin projects was corroborated for food policy dialogue and decision making. It seems plausible that producers of high-quality products within other commodities are likely to follow the \{FNC\} in seeking denomination of origin for their goods.

However this legume contribution varies with the physico-chemical and biological conditions of the nodulated-root rhizosphere. In order to assess the abiotic and biotic constrains that might limit this symbiosis at the agroecosystem level, a nodular diagnosis is proposed with common bean as a model grain-legume, and a major source of plant proteins for world human nutrition. The engineering of the legume symbiosis is addressed by participatory assessment of bean recombinant inbred lines contrasting for their efficiency in use of phosphorous for symbiotic nitrogen fixation. With this methodology, in field-sites chosen with farmers of an area of cereal-cropping in the Mediterranean basin, a large spatial and temporal variation in the legume nodulation was found. Soil P availability was a major limiting factor of the rhizobial symbiosis. In order to relate the field measurements with progress in functional genomics of the symbiosis, in situ RT-PCR on nodule sections has been implemented showing that the phytase gene is expressed in the cortex with significantly higher number of transcripts in P-efficient RILs. It is concluded that various tools and indicators are available for developing the ecological engineering of the rhizobial symbiosis, in particular for its beneficial contribution to the bio-geochemical cycle of N, and also P and C.

Many tropical forests are exploited both commercially for timber and by forest-dependent communities for non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Divergences between these two uses may have significant implications for forest-dependent livelihoods. This article gathers existing examples of conflicts and complementarities between selective logging and non-timber uses of forest from the livelihood perspective. Additionally it draws on three case studies from Brazil, Cameroon and Indonesia to examine by what mechanisms, and to what extent, logging impacts forest resources of livelihood importance, as well as to consider how factors such as logging regime and forest management system may mediate such influences. By doing so we aim to shed further light on a relatively unacknowledged issue in tropical forest management and conservation. Four specific mechanisms were identified; conflict of use and the indirect impacts of logging being those most commonly implicated in negative effects on livelihood-relevant NTFPs. Eighty two percent of reviewed articles highlighted negative impacts on \{NTFP\} availability. Examples of positive impacts were restricted to light demanding species that respond to the opening of forest structure and typically represent a small subset of those of livelihood value. Despite considerable impacts on livelihoods, in all three case studies we found evidence to support the potential for enhanced compatibility between timber extraction and the subsistence use of NTFPs. Drawing on this evidence, and findings from our review, we make specific recommendations for research, policy and management implementation. These findings have significant implications for reconciling timber and non-timber uses of tropical forests. "

The objective of this paper is to illustrate the benefits of systematically targeting management practices by coffee growers to improve attributes of their product. Data from case studies in Colombia and Mexico show statistically significant differences in beverage quality of coffees grown under different production conditions such as slope aspect, varieties, times of harvest, and shade levels. Possible intervention options can be selected by growers in terms of their ease of implementation, the likely improvement of quality that they achieve and the resource intensiveness they require. The conclusion is that optimum management is site specific so that it is not possible to make any blanket recommendations. Using continuous management cycles of implementation, observation, interpretation and evaluation the site specificity provides growers an opportunity to improve management over time to produce a higher quality product.

The formation of the volatile compounds, β-ionone; 5,6-epoxy-β-ionone; dihydroactinidiolide; β-cyclocitral, was measured by SPME-GC-MS and was clearly related to the degradation of trans-β-carotene.

Information linked to milk and cattle production such as activities, inputs (labour, means of production, capital) and outputs (milk, cheese, animals) were recorded using a closed-ended questionnaire. The communities were divided into two groups with low (LC) and high (HC) level of dependence on income from milk and animal sales. The survey results showed that cattle production on the \{LC\} farms was based on less land and a smaller herd (3.32 ha/farm, 1.06 lactating cows) than on \{HC\} farms (10.28 ha/farm, 4.19 lactating cows). The data from the survey and the results of the nutritional analyses of 74 feed samples were introduced into a model that applied linear programming techniques in order to estimate the farm household income under the current production systems and evaluate the economic impact of improved forage varieties for hay production. Furthermore, the economic viability of other changes in fodder and herd management was tested. Both groups were characterised by a dual-purpose system generating a gross income from the sale of both, milk and live animals in the amount of -21 (LC) and +1057 US$/farm and year (HC). Due to higher production costs for forages and better access to markets, \{LC\} communities were characterised by an integrated crop–livestock system whereas in the \{HC\} group income was mainly based on livestock. Introduction of improved and fertilized barley for hay production, was estimated to increase the annual farm income to 127 and 1257 US$ for \{LC\} and HC, respectively. This increase was accompanied by an increment of the animal number. Maintaining the animal number but increasing the milk production/cow by feeding additional forage was a less profitable option generating 50 and 1221 US$ of income per farm and year for \{LC\} and HC, respectively. The production of hay was limited by high costs (external labour) in \{LC\} communities and the restricted availability of family labour in the \{HC\} group. A scenario based on the use of improved cow genotypes led to the highest estimated annual farm income for \{HC\} communities (1280 US$) but was less favourable for LC. The modelling results showed that the best development strategy depends on various factors such as production costs, access to the markets and to irrigation and availability of different feed resources.

Photosynthate production as well as water and nitrogen acquisition was simulated with a demand-driven ratio-dependent functional response model. Carbohydrate, water and nitrogen supply-demand ratios were calculated to control the growth of different populations of plant. The metabolic pool model was used to allocate carbohydrates to plant subunits. The model was validated with published observations and field data from a 95- and a 120-day variety grown at the Research Station of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in Calavi, in the southern part of the Republic of Benin (West Africa). It was concluded to satisfactorily represent crop phenology and growth patterns. Moreover, the model permitted the assessment of drought stress, soil nitrogen, and planting density effects on maize growth and development. "

In many regions, however, daily weather data of sufficient quality and duration are not available. To overcome this limitation, we evaluated a new method to create long-term weather series based on a few years of observed daily temperature data (hereafter called propagated data). The propagated data are comprised of uncorrected gridded solar radiation from the Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource dataset from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA–POWER), rainfall from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) dataset, and location-specific calibration of NASA–POWER Tmax and Tmin using a limited amount of observed daily temperature data. The distributions of simulated yields of maize, rice, or wheat with propagated data were compared with simulated yields using observed weather data at 18 sites in North and South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Other sources of weather data typically used in crop modeling for locations without long-term observed weather data were also included in the comparison: (i) uncorrected NASA–POWER weather data and (ii) generated weather data using the MarkSim weather generator. Results indicated good agreement between yields simulated with propagated weather data and yields simulated using observed weather data. For example, the distribution of simulated yields using propagated data was within 10% of the simulated yields using observed data at 78% of locations and degree of yield stability (quantified by coefficient of variation) was very similar at 89% of locations. In contrast, simulated yields based entirely on uncorrected NASA–POWER data or generated weather data using MarkSim were within 10% of yields simulated using observed data in only 44 and 33% of cases, respectively, and the bias was not consistent across locations and crops. We conclude that, for most locations, 3 years of observed daily Tmax and Tmin data would allow creation of a robust weather data set for simulation of long-term mean yield and yield stability of major cereal crops.

For semi-arid regions in particular, inadequate and highly variable rainfall and short growing periods limit yield potential and create a risky primary production environment. However, short-season crop varieties offer a promising option for farming with increased uncertainties. Against this background, the aim of this work was to collect field trial data for multiple seasons in Eastern Kenya to better calibrate the existing \{APSIM\} (Agricultural Production System sIMulator) legume models for short-season varieties of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)., cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) and lablab (Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet) and to evaluate the performance of the adapted models in terms of biomass production and yield. Finally with the use of a simulation study, the impact of management options (e.g. sowing time, planting density) and future climate predictions on the overall production potential of the different short-season grain legumes was explored. Results indicate that decisions on optimal sowing times will become more important with shortened growing periods to take full advantage of in-season rainfall. Short-season cultivars of beans were advantageous in extreme short growing periods with external droughts due to their very short maturity time. Lablab seemed to cope best with high in season rainfall variability producing stable yields across a range of rainfall scenarios independent of future climate predictions. Cowpea instead was out yielding beans and lablab in wet years and had a very high biomass production. Consequently, using the full diversity of available short-season legumes can function as an essential part of a sustainable risk management strategy to design more resilient farming systems and increase food security in semi-arid Eastern Kenya. Finally, if well calibrated and tested, simulations models have proved to be an excellent tool for ex-ante assessment of agricultural management interventions in the view of future climate change. "

Legumes may improve the immediate availability of P from \{RP\} and eventually benefit subsequent maize crops. The ability of Mucuna pruriens (L.) var utilis (Wright) Burck and Lablab purpureus L. to use P from \{RP\} and the changes in selected plant and symbiotic properties and in the soil available P and particulate organic matter (POM) pool as affected by the addition of \{RP\} were measured for a set of soils on a representative toposequence (‘plateau’, ‘slope’ and ‘valley’ field) in the Northern Guinea savanna zone of Nigeria. At 18 weeks after planting (WAP), Mucuna accumulated significantly more N and P in the total biomass in the plots treated with \{RP\} compared to the plots without \{RP\} addition on all fields. Nitrogen accumulation of Mucuna reached 175, 177 and 164 kg N ha−1 in the treatments with \{RP\} on the ‘plateau’, ‘slope’ and ‘valley’ fields, respectively. Phosphorus accumulation of Mucuna was highest at 18 \{WAP\} in all sites and reached 10, 14 and 10 kg P ha−1 in the treatments with \{RP\} on the ‘plateau’, ‘slope’ and ‘valley’ fields, respectively. Lablab accumulated significantly more N and P at 18 \{WAP\} only on the ‘plateau’ field, but some of the potential differences in N or P accumulation may have been masked by various pests especially affecting Lablab. A highly significant negative correlation was observed between the aboveground biomass at 16 \{WAP\} and the nematode population. The addition of \{RP\} significantly increased arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) infection of the Mucuna (from 24 to 33%) and Lablab roots (from 15 to 28%) to a similar extent in all fields. This increased \{AMF\} infection was most likely caused by specific processes in the rhizosphere of the legumes as \{AMF\} infection of the maize roots (8%) was not affected by \{RP\} addition. Increases in nodule numbers and fresh weight were site- and species-specific and highest for the ‘plateau’ and ‘slope’ fields. The number of nodules increased on average from 8 to 19 (3 plants)−1 and from 7 to 30 (3 plants)−1 for Mucuna and Lablab, respectively, after \{RP\} addition. Although nearly all the aboveground legume biomass had disappeared from the soil surface at 51 WAP, both the Olsen-P status and \{POM\} N concentration were increased by the presence of legumes. Mucuna significantly enhanced the Olsen-P content of the soil after \{RP\} addition compared to the Lablab or maize treatments on the ‘plateau’ and ‘valley’ fields. Due to the relatively high initial Olsen-P content of the ‘slope’ field (14 mg kg−1), differences between treatments were not significant. The N concentration of the \{POM\} pool was significantly higher under legumes than under maize on the ‘slope’ and ‘valley’ fields, and indicates incorporation of part of the legume biomass in the \{POM\} pool. The addition of \{RP\} to herbaceous legumes was observed to lead to site- and species-specific changes in the tripartite legume–rhizobium–mycorrhizal fungus, driven by processes taking place in the rhizosphere of the legumes, and in the soil available P pool. A cereal following these herbaceous legumes could benefit from this improvement in soil fertility status. "

It occurs throughout Africa and is particularly prevalent in the Great Lakes region. Production of sweet potato is largely by resource-poor farmers, growing mostly local landraces and for home consumption and so control strategies need to be appropriate to these circumstances. Most high yielding and/or early maturing landraces in Uganda are susceptible to \{SPVD\} and most resistant landraces are low-yielding, forcing farmers to compromise between the conflicting requirements of large and/or early yields, and food security. Accordingly, two strategies were tested to avoid the disadvantages associated with such compromises. These were deploying high-yielding SPVD-resistant cultivars and phytosanitation practices to enable susceptible landraces to be grown successfully. In on-farm trials in Masaka and Rakai Districts of Uganda, some SPVD-resistant cultivars bred at Namulonge Agricultural and Animal Research Station (NAARI), in Wakiso District, out-yielded local landraces. Other trials at \{NAARI\} and at nearby farms showed that roguing diseased cuttings within 1 month of planting and isolation from diseased crops, even by as little as 15 m, can considerably decrease spread of \{SPVD\} to susceptible cultivars. This indicates that phytosanitation can protect desirable susceptible cultivars, even if adopted only locally. A dual approach of deploying both resistant varieties and phytosanitation provides farmers with a valuable increase in their choice of control strategies for SPVD. "

The labile and moderately labile phosphorus fractions and adsorption characteristics of surface and subsurface horizons of eleven soil profiles in the derived savanna (DS) and the northern Guinea savanna (NGS) of West Africa were assessed. The labile P fractions are the resin and HCO3-extractable inorganic (Pi) and organic (Po) P. The moderately labile fractions are the NaOH-extractable portion of soil P in the Hedley sequential procedure. In the \{DS\} soils, the resin P, considered the most readily available fraction, varied from 1 to 14 mg kg−1, HCO3-Pi ranged from 3.3 to 11, and HCO3-PO was between 4 and 12 mg kg−1 in the surface horizon. In the NGS, the topsoil contained 1.5–3 mg kg−1 of resin P, 5–8 mg kg−1 of HCO3-Pi, and 7.5–9.7 mg kg−1 of HCO3-Po. Sodium hydroxide-Po was the largest of the fractions in all the soils studied. It ranged from 23 to 55 mg kg−1 in the topsoil. In general, the labile P levels were higher in soils of the \{DS\} than of the \{NGS\} and were related to the oxalate-extractable Fe (Feox), and Al (Alox) as well as to soil texture. The subsoil of Kasuwan Magani (profile \{KS\} 9–21 cm) required 153 mg P kg−1 to maintain 0.2 mg P l−1 in solution (standard P requirement), and Danayamaka (profile \{DD\} 7–32 cm) required 145 mg P kg−1. These could translate to 214 and 200 kg P ha−1 if a plow layer of 10 cm is assumed. Because these are within the plow layer, more P fertilizer would be needed for crop production than in the other soils. The standard P requirement and the adsorption maxima were related to Feox and Alox, dithionite-Fe (Fed), and texture. The increase in labile P content with decreasing Feox and Alox could imply that management practices capable of reducing the activities of Fe and Al in solution might improve P availability. "

This paper argues that certain international forest policies, although aiming at fostering well-intentioned reforms, may cause further expansion and power concentration of the already dominant large concession groupings and simultaneous marginalization and fragmentation of smaller forestry enterprises in the Congo Basin. We explore this argument through twenty-four semi-structured interviews with large and small scale enterprises to better understand how they think they may benefit (or not) from the changes foreseen by \{VPA\} implementation. The perceived benefits include the elimination of illegal players, a reduction in corruption and poverty, the promotion of business opportunities, and the valorization of investments. The way in which some of these benefits are expected to materialize may suggest a lack of congruence between the aims of Cameroon's \{VPA\} and private sector expectations. Not only may this lead to disappointment and a sense of demotivation among some of the main stakeholders, it also may lead to further fragmentation in the forest sector. The results therefore indicate that the success of \{VPA\} implementation in Cameroon depends on its ability to go beyond the timber legality verification for European markets argument and uphold its stated socioeconomic development objectives.

Standard protocols were used for the assessment of the major cassava pests and diseases. Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) was shown to be the most serious constraint to cassava in CAR, with symptoms observed at all localities surveyed. \{CMD\} is distributed throughout the country, with an average incidence of 85%. Importantly, 94% of diseased plants had cutting-derived \{CMD\} infection suggesting that farmers mostly use virus-infected cuttings for planting. \{PCR\} amplification and direct sequencing of partial fragments of the Rep \{ORF\} revealed that the causal agents of \{CMD\} in \{CAR\} are African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV) and the Uganda strain of East African cassava mosaic virus (EACMV-UG). We also demonstrated that 58% of \{CMD\} samples present mixed infections (ACMV and EACMV-UG) and that these samples had significantly higher symptom severities.

This scientific network brings together research and academic institutions, with expertise spanning a multidisciplinary perspective from biology and ecology to remote sensing, agronomy and integrated pest management. Its main scientific objective is to explore the potential of biodiversity and ecological processes such as pest regulation, enabling novel ecologically-based models for productive systems, reduction of pesticide use, and adaptation or resilience of farming systems in the face of environmental disruptions. From Northern Senegal to Southern Benin, the research group explores a wide range of ecoregions and socio-ecological contexts, including stakeholders and their objectives, land use and agricultural practices, and management of biodiversity for enhancing biological control. Main challenges to be turned into opportunities include (i) encouraging collaborations amongst researchers from different scientific fields, (ii) fostering interactive research and synergies among research institutions and among countries, and (iii) developing an ecological engineering approach for the design of sustainable agricultural systems for smallholder farmers.

Improvements of maize yields on the ‘plateau’ field were the results of an improvement in the soil P status after growing legumes supplied with RP, as maize did not respond to the addition of urea in the absence of \{RP\} addition to the preceding legumes. Recovery of RP-P by the maize varied between 3.1 and 5.8%. On all fields, legumes also improved the soil N status, giving average apparent legume N recoveries of 17% for Mucuna and 32% for Lablab. The results clearly show that soil fertility management in the \{NGS\} needs to take into consideration both N and P. The studied legume–maize rotations supplied with \{RP\} during the legume phase and minimal amounts of inorganic N during the maize phase are good examples of promising soil fertility management technologies alleviating N and P deficiencies. Recommendations need to be diversified following the position of the field on the toposequence and previous P application history. "

Improved cultivars generally showed lower friability scores, independently of plant age (10–14 months) or season. Rainfall before harvest directly lowers dry matter and mealiness of boiled roots.

Most producers, wholesalers and retailers complained about storage problems and particularly about insect proliferation, but less than 15% mentioned mould growth as a problem. Mouldy chips are generally washed and dried again. Very rarely are mouldy chips discarded and lack of moulds is not a quality attribute for dried yam chips.

Thus, we sought to determine how farming practices might affect the natural compartment of agroecosystems and the sustainable use of land. In particular, we examined ant biodiversity and community composition as related to orchard design and management practices in the mango- and citrus-based orchard agroecosystems of Senegal. Ants were collected using pitfall traps in 49 orchards classed in four types based on their design and management. The results showed that the effect of practices was significant, albeit weak, and a typology of orchards based on design and management practices was congruent with a typology based on the composition of ant communities. The different types of orchard were seen to differ in the richness and diversity ant species. Moreover, ant richness and diversity was positively correlated with tree richness. We were also able to identify some ant species as being related to agricultural practices. For instance, Monomorium salomonis (L.) was closely associated with high irrigation, fertilization and pesticide use, whereas Paltotyreus tarsatus was associated with greater tree richness, high local ground coverage by the tree canopy, more leaf litter and great variation in the local tree planting density. This study appears to be the first attempt to characterise the relations existing between orchard design and management practices and the functioning of Sahelian fruit-based agroecosystems thereby furthering the goal of providing recommendations for sustainable management strategies.

Since then, frequent outbreaks have been observed on Solanaceae and other leafy vegetables such as purple amaranth (Amaranthus cruentus L.; Amaranthaceae) and bitter leaf (Vernonia amygdalina D.; Asteraceae) in all growing areas in southern Benin. The objective of this study was to evaluate the intensity of damage by this invasive pest and the impact of farmers' control practices on purple amaranth, African eggplant (Solanum macrocarpon L.; Solanaceae) and tomato crops. A survey was carried out in January 2013 among 150 farmers in the three major growing areas in southern Benin: Sèmè-Kpodji, Grand-Popo and Pahou. Tetranychus evansi was the only mite observed, causing production losses estimated at 65% for African eggplant, 56% for tomato and 25% for purple amaranth. Previously encountered species such as Tetranychus urticae Koch, Tetranychus ludeni Zacher (Acari: Tetranychidae) and Polyphagotarsonemus latus Banks (Acari: Tarsonemidae) were not observed in any of the 45 samples. To protect the infested crops, growers sprayed various synthetic pesticides at high frequencies according to crop phenology 3, 6 and 12 times per month, respectively, on purple amaranth, African eggplant and on tomato, on average. The most frequently used pesticides were pyrethroids and organophosphate compounds. Farmers reported that these compounds were largely ineffective against T. evansi. The risks posed to human and environmental health, as well as existing alternatives to chemical pesticide use, are discussed. "

Although the causes of this phenomenon are not fully known, yams, like other vegetatively propagated crops, have heavy planting material that is liable to induce such interplant variability. In addition, planting practices may mitigate this phenomenon via the selection of the seed-tuber size or state. To gain further insight into yam interplant variability, this study identified and quantified, for the first time, the direct and indirect dependency between planting practices, early growth variables and yield components of Dioscorea rotundata and Dioscorea alata, the two main food yam species. The experimental dataset came from six field trials carried out in Benin at two locations between 2007 and 2009. Additive Bayesian network modeling was used for structure discovery—its directed acyclic graph offers an ideal background for discussing complex systems when theoretical knowledge is lacking, e.g., for yams. Here we found that the emergence date was the only direct cause of plant yield variability common to both species. For D. rotundata, we observed a direct contribution of the cataphyll number to the plant tuber weight. These combined results suggest the existence of some uncontrolled latent variables (i.e., seed-tuber physiological age and reserves). For D. alata, the model did not reveal any effect of seed-tuber size, despite a strong effect noted for D. rotundata. We suggest that the transposition of traditional native D. rotundata planting practices may have led to oversized D. alata seed-tubers, resulting in wastage of planting material. This study demonstrated that traditional West African cropping systems have a serious drawback concerning the uncontrolled wide range of physiological ages and reserves in seed-tuber lots, which affect the plant size hierarchy and ultimately the marketable yield.

More recently modern science and research methods based on controlled experiments became the most visible instrument of technological change in agriculture, nevertheless farmers continued to develop and implement new technologies based on their own observations made under commercial conditions. Modern information technology and social organization of producers make it possible to use operational research, which is based on the observation and analysis of operations so as to improve them, to manage crops better. The article describes two cases, coffee and sugarcane, in which observation of the results obtained by farmers, with the natural variation in the environment and the distinct management practices they apply can be used to determine site specific crop management practices. The basis of the methodology is to (a) obtain data from a series of cropping events that characterizes the conditions under which each crop is grown, how it is managed and how it performs under commercial conditions (data capture), (b) to manage and analyze the data in centralized databases (data management and analysis) and (c) make the information derived from the data analysis available to growers so that they can use it to make better informed decisions (interpretation). All aspects of the methodology depend on the social organization of the growers and the supply chain of which they form a part, and hence social organization is an integral part of the methodology. The processes of characterization of the growing conditions, including both environmental and management parameters, the establishment of databases, the data analysis and interpretation, and mechanisms of interacting with producers are described with emphasis on the importance of social organization and farmers’ groups. Examples are given of how this approach can be used to better understand the crop response to variation in the environment and management, and how this can be used by farmers to improve productivity and quality in two contrasting crops. The paper demonstrates that operational research can be used to evaluate farmers’ experiences and to share that knowledge amongst them so as to improve their production practices in the context of their particular environment. It is suggested that the operation research approach is particularly effective in heterogeneous landscapes with perennial crops that have not been the subject of intense research. Furthermore operational research is effective in determining the crop response to variables that are not readily studied in small plots and in determining optimal combinations of multiple variables. Producers believe in the results obtained as there are none of the problems of scaling up from experimental plots to commercial conditions. It is proposed that the approaches described can readily be applied to other crop species. "

Our premise is that if it were possible to characterize the production system in terms of management and the environmental conditions, and if information on the harvested product were collected from a large number of harvesting events under varied conditions, it should be possible to develop data-driven models that describe the production system. These models can then be used to identify appropriate growing conditions and improved management practices for crops that have received little attention from researchers. The analysis and interpretation of commercial production data in the context of naturally occurring variation in environmental and management, as opposed to controlled experimental data, requires novel approaches. Information was available on both variation in commercial production of the tropical fruit, lulo (Solanum quitoense), and the associated environmental conditions in Colombia. This information was used to develop and evaluate procedures for the interpretation of the variation in commercial production of lulo. The most effective procedures depended on expert guidance: it was not possible to develop a simple effective one step procedure, but rather an iterative approach was required. The most effective procedure was based on the following steps. First, highly correlated independent variables were evaluated and those that were effectively duplicates were eliminated. Second, regression models identified those environmental factors most closely associated with the dependent variable of fruit yield. The environmental factors associated with variation in fruit yield were then used for more in depth analysis, and those environmental variables not associated with yield were excluded from further analysis. Linear regression and multilayer perceptron regression models explained 65–70% of the total variation in yield. Both models identified three of the same factors but the multilayer perceptron based on a neural network identified one location as an additional factor. Third, the three environmental factors common to both regression models were used to define three Homogeneous Environmental Conditions (HECs) using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). Fourth, yield was analyzed with a mixed model with the categorical variables of HEC, location, as a proxy for cultural factors associated with a geographic region, and farm as proxy for management skills. The mixed model explained more than 80% of the total variation in yield with 61% associated with the \{HECs\} and 19% with farm. Location had minimal effects. The results of this model can be used to determine the appropriate environmental conditions for obtaining high yields for crops where only commercial data are available, and also to identify those farms that have superior management practices for given environmental conditions.

Ten strains of T. evansi and 11 strains of T. equiperdum originating from Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America were tested. Rabbit pre-infection sera and sera of days 7, 14, 25, 35 post-infection (p.i.) were analyzed for the presence of antibodies reactive with RoTat 1.2 in immune trypanolysis, ELISA/T. evansi and CATT/T. evansi.

Research efforts to improve farm productivity increasingly focus on resource interactions and trade-offs operating at farm-scale. Farm-scale models that integrate summary models of the various subsystems (crops, livestock, household) are proposed to analyse the complexity of management systems. NUANCES-FIELD is a summary model of the crop/soil system that calculates seasonal crop production based on resource availability, capture and utilization efficiencies. A detailed mechanistic crop growth model, APSIM, was used to generate parameters and variables that can be introduced as descriptive functions in NUANCES-FIELD. To such end, we first parameterized and tested \{APSIM\} based on several field experiments carried out on different soil types in western Kenya farms where nitrogen and/or phosphorus were applied. The model was further configured to generate nitrogen and phosphorus response curves as a function of soil condition (carbon content, clay content, phosphorus-sorption characteristics) and the effects of alternative weed management scenarios in relation to labour availability. Nitrogen, phosphorus and rainfall capture efficiencies ranged between 0.22–0.85 kg kg−1, 0.05–0.29 kg kg−1 and 0.10–0.53 mm mm−1, respectively, depending on soil nutrient and physical conditions. Variation in the integrated seasonal fraction of radiation intercepted (intFRINT) with plant density was adequately described by the function y = 0.058x + 0.11 within a range of 1.5–5.5 maize plants per m2. Investigation of weed management using the \{APSIM\} model identified a weed-free period of at least five weeks from maize emergence for minimum yield loss from weed–crop competition. The simulation exercises confirmed that resource-use efficiencies sharply decrease on moving from relatively fertile fields ‘close’ to the homestead towards degraded ‘remote’ fields within the same farm, giving impetus to expedite the search for better targeted management strategies for spatially-heterogeneous farms.

A. guerreronis is one of the most important coconut pests but knowledge of its population dynamics is scant. We quantified seasonal and fruit age-related population fluctuations of A. guerreronis and its predator Neoseiulus paspalivorus DeLeon in Benin. N. paspalivorus was the most common and abundant beneath the bracts compared with other predators, which were very scarce and were largely found outside the bracts. Both percent fruit occupation and abundance of A. guerreronis and N. paspalivorus varied across sampling months as well as among coconut plantations and fruit age classes. Both parameters peaked in the middle of the rainy season and at the end of the dry season. Fruit age at which A. guerreronis and N. paspalivorus started to colonize the fruits was 0.9 and 1.2 months, respectively. The two species reached their peak abundance (1512 A. guerreronis and 2.3 N. paspalivorus per fruit) on 3 months-old fruits. Peak percent fruit occupation by A. guerreronis (∼70%) occurred after 4.3 months, which was ∼0.7 months earlier than that by N. paspalivorus (∼22%). Difficulties encountered by the predators in accessing the area beneath the perianth on the very young fruits allowed A. guerreronis a head-start in population build-up leading to strongly diverging population curves as a function of fruit age (higher population increase compared to N. paspalivorus). Protecting the very young fruits from A. guerreronis colonization should be a key issue for developing successful control strategies of this pest. "

Following a baseline study on current trypanosomiasis knowledge, attitudes and practices by smallholder farmers, a communication intervention strategy was developed involving dissemination through school children, village elders, animal health centres and Agrovet shops, and using layered messages in posters and leaflets. A participatory research approach was used to develop, design and assess the impact of animal health messages on the control of bovine trypanosomiasis for smallholder farmers in tsetse and trypanosomiasis endemic areas in Busia (two administrative divisions) and Kwale Districts (two administrative divisions) of Kenya. Communication intervention materials (in poster and leaflet formats) were developed and disseminated to residents in villages in one administrative division in each district (intervention area) while those from the other division in each district were not deliberately exposed to the animal health messages (control area). Several communication impact indicators were derived and these were measured 4–6 weeks after dissemination of the print media through questionnaires on trypanosomiasis knowledge administered to school children and cattle-keeping smallholders in the intervention and control study sites. School children’s post-communication intervention trypanosomiasis signs knowledge was much higher than that observed during the pre-communication intervention survey. More trypanocides were named by school children during the post-intervention questionnaire survey compared to those known during the pre-intervention survey. The trypanosomiasis signs knowledge score obtained by the smallholder farmers exposed to the extension materials was higher than that obtained by those not exposed to them. Similarly, farmers’ exposure to extension materials resulted in higher trypanocidal drug knowledge scores among exposed farmers than among those not exposed. These results indicate that over the period monitored, the routes (i.e. school children, village elders, animal health centres and Agrovet shops) and media (posters and leaflets) selected were effective in promoting a significant increase in knowledge of trypanosomiasis, its causes and ways of dealing with it among livestock keepers.

Eight commonly used pesticides were applied onto passion fruits cultivated in Colombia. Pesticide concentrations were measured periodically (between application and harvest) in whole fruits and fruit pulp. Measured concentrations were compared with predicted residues calculated with a dynamic and crop-specific pesticide uptake model, namely dynamiCROP. The model accounts for the time between pesticide application and harvest, the time between harvest and consumption, the amount of spray deposition on plant surfaces, uptake processes, dilution due to crop growth, degradation in plant components, and reduction due to food processing (peeling). Measured and modelled residues correspond well (r2 = 0.88–0.99), with all predictions falling within the 90% confidence interval of the measured values. A mean error of 43% over all studied pesticides was observed between model estimates and measurements. The fraction of pesticide applied during cultivation that is eventually ingested by humans is on average 10−4–10−6, depending on the time period between application and ingestion and the processing step considered. Model calculations and intake fractions via fruit consumption based on experimental data corresponded well for all pesticides with a deviation of less than a factor of 2. Pesticide residues in fruits measured at recommended harvest dates were all below European Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) and therefore do not indicate any violation of international regulatory thresholds.

In this study, the expression of eight defense-related genes in banana was investigated using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. Plants of susceptible (cv. Nabusa, genomic group AAA-EA) and tolerant (cv. Kayinja, genomic group ABB) banana cultivars were inoculated with endophytic F. oxysporum strain V5w2. Gene expression levels were analysed following endophyte inoculation and nematode challenge. Endophyte colonization of roots of the tolerant cultivar induced transient expression of \{POX\} and suppressed expression of PR-3, lectin, PAE, \{PAL\} and PIR7A. Catalase and PR-1 activities were up-regulated in the tolerant cultivar 33 days after endophyte colonization of roots, but their expressions were further up-regulated following nematode challenge. Apart from \{POX\} and lectin, the other genes analysed were not responsive to endophyte colonization or R. similis challenge in the susceptible cv. Nabusa.

Historical data on land use, channel morphology and sedimentology were collected, based on a spatial analysis of aerial photographs (1963–1995) and a field survey (2002). Analysis of channel cross-sectional profiles and sedimentological data revealed a major change in morphology and sedimentology of the Deleg River during the past four decades: (i) the active river channel narrowed by over 45%, (ii) the riverbed incised on average by over 1.0 m and (iii) the median grain size of the bed surface decreased from 13.2 cm to 4.7 cm. The spatial pattern of land cover within the Deleg catchment also changed considerably: highly degraded agricultural land in the low-lying areas was abandoned and partially afforested for timber and wood production, whereas secondary upland forest was increasingly cleared for expansion of cropland and pastures. Notwithstanding large changes in the spatial organization of land use within the catchment, the overall land use did not change significantly during the past four decades. This suggests that the response of the Deleg River to land-use change not only depends on the overall land-use change, but also on the spatial pattern of land-use/cover change within the catchment. Although forestation and regeneration of bare gully slopes and floors throughout the catchment only represented a minor part of the total land-use change, these land-use/cover changes had a major impact on the hydrological and sediment connectivity in the landscape.

In this study, the importance of a broad range of plant species as overwintering hosts for each Adelphocoris sp. was compared. Nymphal emergence from a total of 126 plant species was monitored at two distinct locations. The eggs of A. suturalis successfully eclosed from un-plowed cotton field soil and 115 plant species, primarily pastures, weeds and agricultural crops. The eggs of A. lineolatus successfully eclosed from 40 plant species, mainly pastures and weeds. Finally, A. fasciaticollis overwintered on 35 plant species, primarily tree species, weeds and agricultural crops. In conclusion, the most common and widely distributed mirid species, A. suturalis, overwintered on a comparatively broader range of plants compared to the other two species. These observations help to understand the differences in geographical distribution and abundance of the three Adelphocoris species, and constitute the basis for forecasting and pest management protocols for Adelphocoris spp. in China.

abstract = "Abstract Banana-bean intercropping systems are common in the bimodal rainfall areas of the East African Highlands and are characterized by low banana productivity. In these systems, the soil is tilled manually twice a year before bean planting with potentially damaging effects to the shallow banana root system. No-tillage with mulching (NT + M) may constitute an interesting alternative to conventional manual tillage (CMT) to avoid such root damage and improve banana productivity. The objectives of this study were therefore (i) to assess tillage-induced damage to the banana rooting system and its subsequent recovery, and (ii) to evaluate the impact of three \{NT\} + M systems vs. \{CMT\} on banana root distribution and banana bunch weight. At two sites in the D.R. Congo, the cord root length density (RLD) and fresh weight (FW) were monitored monthly in the top 0.2 m of the soil over a 5 to 6-month period following manual tillage, and compared with \{NT\} + M plots. Immediately after tillage and on average over the two sites, cord \{RLD\} and \{FW\} in the top 0.1 m of the soil were reduced on average to 15% and 16%, respectively, of the levels observed under \{NT\} + M. At 0.3 m from the rhizome, cord roots needed 2–4 months to recover to a level similar to the one observed prior to tillage. On average over the two sites, direct root damage by tillage caused the loss of 47% and 63% of the \{RLD\} and \{FW\} observed in \{NT\} + M plots, respectively. The remaining rooting deficit (38% of \{RLD\} and 21% of FW) was hypothesized to originate from differences in root growth conditions unrelated to immediate mechanical root damage. There was no evidence that the mechanical damage of roots by tillage affected banana growth in the short term. The medium-term effect of \{CMT\} and \{NT\} + M treatments was evaluated at three sites (two in D.R. Congo and one in Rwanda) 30 months after banana planting. At two sites out of three, root density profiles indicated lower rooting densities in the top 0.1 m of the soil in \{CMT\} plots compared with \{NT\} + M plots. Banana bunch weight was consistently lower in \{CMT\} plots compared with \{NT\} + M plots. Compared with \{NT\} + M, \{CMT\} appears to affect banana rooting and bunch weight in the medium term under the pedo-climatic conditions of the East African Highlands. No-tillage with mulching may constitute an alternative to manual tillage to enhance the sustainability of these systems but its impact on the whole intercropping system's productivity must be verified.

Legumes have shown great potential to enhance system productivity. On-farm experiments were conducted in different agro-ecological zones (AEZ) in Western Kenya to assess the agronomic and economic benefits of promising legumes. In each zone, trials were established in fields of high, medium and low fertility to assess the effect of soil fertility heterogeneity on legume productivity and subsequent maize yield. Common bean, soybean, groundnut, lima bean, lablab, velvet bean, crotalaria, and jackbean were grown in the short rains season, followed by maize in the long rains season. Alongside, continuous maize treatments fertilised at different rates were established. \{AEZs\} and soil fertility gradients within these zones greatly affected crop productivity, returns to land and labour of rotations, as well as the relative performance of rotations. Poorer soil fertility and \{AEZs\} with lower rainfall gave smaller legume and maize yields and consequently, smaller returns to land and labour. The cultivation of legumes increased maize yields in the subsequent long rains season compared with continuous maize receiving fertiliser at a similar rate, while the increase of maize after green manure legumes was stronger than that after grain legumes. Maize yield responded strongly to increasing amounts of N applied as legume residues with diminishing returns to legume-N application rates above 100 kg N ha−1. In the low potential zones, factors other than improved N availability likely also stimulated maize yield. Rotations with grain legumes generally provided better returns than those with green manures. Intercropping bean with maize in the long rains season provided an additional bean yield that did not come at the expense of maize yield and improved returns to land and labour, but more so in the high potential zones. The results demonstrate the strong impact of biophysical diversity on the productivity of the legumes and suggest the need for careful targeting of legume technologies to the different biophysical conditions.

As Brazil is presently considered the putative origin of A. guerreronis, a large effort is presently underway to develop a classical biological control strategy for this pest in Africa and Asia. In this study, we investigated the life history of a Brazilian (NbBr) and a Beninese (NbBe) population of N. baraki on prey and non-prey diets under laboratory conditions (25 ± 1 °C 70–90% \{RH\} and 12:12 h L:D). Both populations were able to complete juvenile development and reproduce when feeding on A. guerreronis, Tetranychus urticae Koch eggs—a prey commonly used in the maintenance of phytoseiid mite colonies—and maize pollen. The two predators developed faster on A. guerreronis than on any other diet. The longest developmental time was recorded for NbBe on castor bean pollen (12.3 days), which also was not suitable at all for the development of NbBr. The longest developmental time of NbBr was 8.94 days on T. urticae eggs, whereas NbBe needed only 5.86 days to develop from eggs to adult stage on the same diet. For both populations, oviposition rate and longevity as well as demographic parameters were most favorable on A. guerreronis, the target prey. Intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm) and net reproductive rate (Ro) were significantly higher for NbBr (0.19 and 24.9) than for NbBe (0.16 and 18.0). Taken together, the life history data from this study predict that NbBr is a more specialized and efficient predator of A. guerreronis compared with NbBe. The ability of the latter to utilize alternative food types, however, predicts that it would be able to persist longer in coconut habitat in the absence of its primary prey A. guerreronis. Implications for the implementation of a sustainable control strategy against A. guerreronis are discussed. "

This pest invaded China at the onset of the 20th century, possibly through repeated introductions from several different locations worldwide. In this paper, we describe different behavioral parameters of this Hubei P. gossypiella strain under laboratory and field conditions. Using an infra-red video recorder, we observed (nocturnal) emergence, flight and mating activities, and oviposition patterns. Moth emergence started from 13:00 and continued up till 23:00. Under laboratory and field conditions, 2-7-d-old moths initiated flight around sunset, peaked 50 min later and gradually declined until 04:00. Although mating started immediately after darkness (i.e., 20:00), mating behavior was most intense from 23:00 to 03:40. Oviposition also showed distinct time-related patterns, with approx. 70% eggs laid between 20:00 and 22:00. In the studies of the relationship between flight and oviposition, the duration of flight had an effect on oviposition. The 1-d-old moths flown for 6 and 12 h began oviposition earlier than the unflown ones, and the 6-h flight had no effect on the egg production. However, the longevity of the flown moths was shortened after flight. In addition, the peaks of oviposition for the flown moths were advanced 2–3 d. The age when the moths flied affected the oviposition of adult moths. The earlier the moths started to fly after emergence, the greater the fecundity they had. The average egg production of moths flown for 24 h was less than that of non-flown moths which were of the same age. Both flight and delay in mating could advance the oviposition peak. Our study provides detailed insights in nocturnal activities and the reproductive biology of local P. gossypiella populations, which could be employed to fine-tune current pest management programs in China.

To analyze the gains from cooperation, we simulate various cooperative game solutions over seven cotton producing farms in a bio-economic model of a water users association. The study results show that cooperation can fulfill multiple objectives: ensure the cotton production targets, increase farm profits and grain production, and reduce the pressure on water resources. We investigate a situation where farms differ in soil quality and distance to irrigation canals. The proposed modification in the national cotton procurement policy that utilizes the comparative advantages of cooperating cotton-producing farms can make the cooperative agreements economically attractive even among heterogeneous farms. It should be noted that the benefits offered from farm cooperation may be smaller or even vanish if transaction costs grow excessively in response to the heterogeneity of participating farms and the size of the cooperative. In addition, the economic benefits will not necessarily be distributed equally among participating farms and thus require the development of fair division rules. In this respect, net gain allocation schemes based on production costs, size and cotton output of farm cooperation are presented and discussed against the distinct social features of rural Uzbekistan.

It is actively promoted by international research and development organisations, with such strong advocacy that critical debate is stifled. Claims for the potential of \{CA\} in Africa are based on widespread adoption in the Americas, where the effects of tillage were replaced by heavy dependence on herbicides and fertilizers. \{CA\} is said to increase yields, to reduce labour requirements, improve soil fertility and reduce erosion. Yet empirical evidence is not clear and consistent on many of these points nor is it always clear which of the principles of \{CA\} contribute to the desired effects. Although cases can be found where such claims are supported there are equally convincing scientific reports that contradict these claims. Concerns include decreased yields often observed with CA, increased labour requirements when herbicides are not used, an important gender shift of the labour burden to women and a lack of mulch due to poor productivity and due to the priority given to feeding of livestock with crop residues. Despite the publicity claiming widespread adoption of CA, the available evidence suggests virtually no uptake of \{CA\} in most \{SSA\} countries, with only small groups of adopters in South Africa, Ghana and Zambia. We conclude that there is an urgent need for critical assessment under which ecological and socio-economic conditions \{CA\} is best suited for smallholder farming in SSA. Critical constraints to adoption appear to be competing uses for crop residues, increased labour demand for weeding, and lack of access to, and use of external inputs. "

Di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) was compared to manure, ashes, combinations of those, 1/2 Tithonia 1/2 \{DAP\} (TD) and no input. 1/3rd of the labour was saved when placing seeds in trenches as compared to individual holes without losing significant grain yield.

The time saved at planting can be more productively invested in collecting inputs. Plots without input yielded 537 kg ha−1 grain and 642 kg ha−1 biomass in 2006. Inputs increased both grain and biomass yields significantly with 27–51%, without significant difference between local and mineral inputs (with exception of TD).

This means that single solutions (or ‘silver bullets’) for improving farm productivity do not exist. Yet to date few approaches to understand constraints and explore options for change have tackled the bewildering complexity of African farming systems. In this paper we describe the Nutrient Use in Animal and Cropping systems – Efficiencies and Scales (NUANCES) framework. \{NUANCES\} offers a structured approach to unravel and understand the complexity of African farming to identify what we term ‘best-fit’ technologies – technologies targeted to specific types of farmers and to specific niches within their farms. The \{NUANCES\} framework is not ‘just another computer model’! We combine the tools of systems analysis and experimentation, detailed field observations and surveys, incorporate expert knowledge (local knowledge and results of research), generate databases, and apply simulation models to analyse performance of farms, and the impacts of introducing new technologies. We have analysed and described complexity of farming systems, their external drivers and some of the mechanisms that result in (in)efficient use of scarce resources. Studying sites across sub-Saharan Africa has provided insights in the trajectories of change in farming systems in response to population growth, economic conditions and climate variability (cycles of drier and wetter years) and climate change. In regions where human population is dense and land scarce, farm typologies have proven useful to target technologies between farmers of different production objectives and resource endowment (notably in terms of land, labour and capacity for investment). In such regions we could categorise types of fields on the basis of their responsiveness to soil improving technologies along soil fertility gradients, relying on local indicators to differentiate those that may be managed through ‘maintenance fertilization’ from fields that are highly-responsive to fertilizers and fields that require rehabilitation before yields can improved. Where human population pressure on the land is less intense, farm and field types are harder to discern, without clear patterns. Nutrient cycling through livestock is in principle not efficient for increasing food production due to increased nutrient losses, but is attractive for farmers due to the multiple functions of livestock. We identified trade-offs between income generation, soil conservation and community agreements through optimising concurrent objectives at farm and village levels. These examples show that future analyses must focus at farm and farming system level and not at the level of individual fields to achieve appropriate targeting of technologies – both between locations and between farms at any given location. The approach for integrated assessment described here can be used ex ante to explore the potential of best-fit technologies and the ways they can be best combined at farm level. The dynamic and integrated nature of the framework allows the impact of changes in external drivers such as climate change or development policy to be analysed. Fundamental questions for integrated analysis relate to the site-specific knowledge and the simplification of processes required to integrate and move from one level to the next. "

The economy was broadly affected by experiencing temporary halt in some production sectors of country. The study found that most of this was to the Thailand's agricultural products, as major agricultural products were Thai Rice, and Thailand was one of major rice producer and exporter in the world. In 2011, a total export value of Thai Rice was 210,527 million baht. However, the impact of tropical cyclone Nock-Ten on Thai Rice export was reinforced by an economic slowdown in Thailand during 2011-2012. Hence, this study diagnoses the impacts of flood on Thai Rice in CPRB, and recommends the guidelines for management of climate change impacts. "

Winged aphids bearing parasitoid eggs or young larvae can potentially still engage in long-distance flights and thereby facilitate parasitoid dispersal, which has important implications for biological control of aphids by parasitoids. In this study, we determined the effect of parasitism by Binodoxys communis (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) on wing development and flight of the summer alate stage of the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines (Hemiptera: Aphididae), and quantified the effect of aphid flight duration on subsequent B. communis development. Parasitism by B. communis was allowed at alatoid 3rd (L3) and 4th instar (L4) nymphal stages of A. glycines and subsequent aphid flight was measured using a computer-monitored flight mill. Only 25% of aphids parasitized as \{L3\} alatoid nymphs produced normal winged adults, compared to 100% of \{L4\} alatoids. While flight performance of aphids that had been parasitized as 4th-instar alatoid nymphs 24 or 48 h prior to testing was similar to that of unparasitized alates of identical age, it declined sharply for alates that had been parasitized as 4th-instar alatoid nymphs 72 and 96 h prior to testing. Parasitoid larval and pupal development times, percent mummification and adult emergence rates did not differ between treatments in which aphids had flown over varying durations. Our results have implications for natural biological control of A. glycines in Asia and classical biological control of the soybean aphid in North America. "

Field trials were therefore conducted in 1995 in four Guinea savanna sites to monitor the effect of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) cultivation on the N balance of the soil. In trial 1, an early (TGx1485-1D) and a late (TGx1670-1F) soybean were grown to maturity along with a maize (Zea mays L.) reference plot. In trial 2, six varieties of soybean (early: TGx1485-1D, TGx1805-2E and TGx1681-3F; medium: TGx1809-12E and TGx923-2E; late: TGx1670-1F) were grown to maturity along with a reference maize plot. The total nitrogen (N) content, aboveground \{N2\} fixed, and N remaining in the stover were higher in the medium and the late varieties than in early varieties. Also, the early varieties had higher nitrogen harvest indices (81–84%) than medium and late varieties (74–79%). From the N balance calculation, it was found that medium and late maturing soybean resulted in an addition of 4.2 kg N ha−1 to the soil, whereas the early maturing varieties resulted in depletion of the soil N reserve by 5.6 kg N ha−1 (P&lt;0.05). On average, among the medium and late varieties, late maturing TGx923-2E resulted in an addition of 9.5 kg N ha−1 to the soil. When the stover was not returned to the field, early soybean resulted in more negative N balance than the medium and late soybean (P&lt;0.05). Therefore, planting an early variety of soybean for one season resulted in net depletion of soil N, even when the soybean residues were returned to the soil and \{N2\} fixed in the roots and N in the fallen leaf litter were included in the N balance calculations. Contrary to this, planting medium and late soybean for one season resulted in an addition of N to the soil. Therefore, medium and late soybean should be used as a preceding crop in legume–cereal rotation, if possible, to minimize or avoid depletion of soil N by early varieties of soybean. "

However, there are very limited data available on the farmed tilapia value chain. The aim of this study therefore was to characterise production, marketing and consumption patterns of farmed tilapia in the Nile Delta of Egypt. A cross sectional study was conducted to collect data from tilapia producers (100), transporters (32), retailers (100), fish fry shops (20) and households (300) in three case study communities (fish producing, peri-urban and rural community). We conducted structured questionnaire interviews and participatory assessments for producers and consumers. Focus group discussions with mothers were also held to collect data for the availability, sources and consumption patterns of tilapia. Results showed that, more than half of producers were small scale, having a farm size of 10 feddan or less (1 feddan = 4200 m2). The main water supply for almost all farms was agricultural drain water, a potential source of contamination with chemical and biological hazards. The main production constraints were reported to be feed prices, water quality and availability, land rent, fuel and energy sources and environmental conditions. The farmed tilapia value chain was short with some value added in the form of marketing fresh and live fish as well as selling tilapia in fried or grilled form. The majority of produced tilapia was transported to retail sale and sold to consumers as fresh, while only a small proportion was processed by cleaning, grilling or frying. A lack of hygiene during transportation and marketing of farmed tilapia was found that could be potential sources for post-harvesting contamination. The availability and frequency of tilapia consumption were higher in the community in the production areas than in other communities. In non-producing areas, tilapia may be available in the market once a week during the village market day. Potential areas for further research in order to improve safety, quality and production of farmed tilapia were identified. "

Such procedure can effectively relieve two constraints that haunt TiO2 sterilization applications: 1) the need for \{UV\} for overcoming the wide band gap of pure TiO2 and 2) the difficulty of its recovering from water for reuse. In the process, visible light responsive Fe3O4/TiO2 nanoparticles are synthesized and immobilized on glass using TiO2 sol–gel as the binder for fish bacterial pathogen disinfection test. After 3 h of visible light irradiation, the immobilized Fe3O4@TiO2's inhibition efficiencies for fish bacterial pathogen are, respectively, 50% for Edwardsiella tarda (BCRC 10670) and 23% for Aeromonas hydrophila (BCRC 13018).

Results indicated that the leaf laminas were poor candidates for shoot induction whereas the petioles showed potential for adventitious shoot production at frequencies of 2.8–11.1% in two of the cultivars tested. Stem nodal segments were the most responsive among the three as shoots formed directly following the \{TDZ\} treatment at frequencies of 16.7–41.7% depending on the cultivar. When comparing the effectiveness of different cytokinins to induce shoot proliferation on stem nodal segments, it was found that the 0.5 and 1 mg l−1 of kinetin (Kn) and 6-benzyladenine (BA) treatments resulted in higher shoot formation percentages compared to the 0.5 and 1 mg l−1 of \{TDZ\} treatments in two of the three cultivars. Furthermore, more shoots were produced on \{BA\} than on Kn-supplemented media in all the three cultivars. Shoots derived from the 0.5 mg l−1 of \{BA\} treatment can be induced to root following one month incubation with 0.1–1 mg l−1 of indole-3-butyric-acid (IBA). The rooted shoots showed 100% survival after acclimatization in the greenhouse. The procedure reported in the present study can assist in the large-scale multiplication of elite self-heading cultivars of Philodendron in the future. "

The field trial datasets that provide a knowledge base for \{SDSS\} such as this are characterised by ordinal response variables. Our approach has been to apply Bayes’ formula as a prediction model. This paper does not describe the entire CaNaSTA system, but rather concentrates on the algorithm of the central prediction model. The algorithm is tested using a simulated dataset to compare results with ordinal regression, and to test the stability of the model with increasingly sparse calibration data. For all but the richest input datasets it outperforms ordinal regression, as determined using Cohen’s weighted kappa. The model also performs well with sparse datasets. Whilst this is not as conclusive as testing with real world data, the results are encouraging. "

The Zagros oak forests in western Iran have undergone dramatic changes in cover and structure in recent decades, with negative consequences for the communities that depend upon them. This study had three objectives: (1) evaluate the nature and magnitude of these changes from 1972 to 2009 through trends in forest area and connectivity; (2) evaluate the changes in forest area and landscape connectivity across a climatic gradient; and (3) evaluate the effect of topographical variations. Landsat MSS, TM, and ETM+ images for the region were preprocessed and corrected prior to classification of 167 landscape units (LU; 400 km2 each). We developed two measures – deforestation sensitivity (DS) and connectivity sensitivity (CS) – for each LU. A considerable but relatively linear loss in forest area and connectivity was detected. Connectivity loss occurred more rapidly than forest loss due to the loss of connecting patches. More connectivity was lost in southern Zagros due to climatic differences and different forms of traditional land use. Steep slopes and high elevations experienced more forest loss and connectivity. In northern Zagros the coppice form of forest management should be supported as a method that maintains connectivity. In southern Zagros, restoration projects should focus on regeneration in forest gaps to restore connectivity between isolated forest fragments. The study provides large scale information for restoration projects across a spatial climatic gradient. "

A reliable assay protocol, (RAPID)-bioactive amplification with probing (BAP), for detection of \{NDV\} that uses a nested \{PCR\} and magnetic bead-based probe to increase sensitivity and specificity, was developed. Primers and probes were designed based on the conserved region of the F protein-encoding gene sequences of all \{NDV\} Taiwan isolates. The optimal annealing temperature for nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to amplify the gene was 61 °C and optimal hybridization occurred when buffer 1× \{SSC\} and 0.5% \{SDS\} were used at 50 °C. The sensitivity of RAPID-BAP was 1 copy/μl for standard plasmids and 10 copy/μl for transcribed F protein-encoding gene of \{NDV\} with comparable linearity (R2 = 0.984 versus \{R2\} = 0.99). This sensitivity was superior to that of other techniques currently used. The assay was also highly specific because the negative controls, including classical swine fever virus, avian influenza virus, avian reovirus, and infectious bursa disease virus could not be detected. Thirty-four field samples were tested using conventional RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR, real-time quantitative RT-PCR, and RAPID-BAP assay and the positive rates were 24%, 30%, 41%, and 53%, respectively. The developed assay allows for rapid, correct, and sensitive detection of \{NDV\} and fulfils all of the key requirements for clinical applicability. It could reliably rule out false negative results from antibody-based assays and also facilitate a rapid diagnosis in the early phase of the disease for emergency quarantine that may help prevent large-scale outbreaks.

The two systems of nutritive value assessment for tree fodder are described and evaluated through detailed investigation of eight types of tree fodder (one leguminous and seven non-leguminous), used to supplement crop residue-based diets for cattle during the dry season. Both systems are shown to provide means of discriminating fodder sources in terms of their nutritive value that are comparable in terms of discriminatory power and consistency. This research suggests that laboratory assessment of the feed quality of tropical tree fodder may be used to build on and enhance rather than replace local classification. "

Current remote-sensing data and spatio-temporal analyses allow the distinction of climate and human-induced land degradation on a sub-continental scale, but the underlying processes cannot be discerned at this scale. This study is conducted at a river-basin scale to (1) identify land degradation hotspots in a basin or sub-basin, and (2) assess the correspondence and divergence of land degradation assessed by \{NDVI\} shifts with and without accounting for atmospheric fertilization with that based on soil erosion assessment at a sub-basin scale. Long-term remote sensing (NDVI) and rainfall data were used to identify human-induced land degradation hotspot areas in the Volta basin. The results were compared with the critical zone of soil loss in the White Volta sub-basin derived from a spatially distributed soil erosion model, validated by field-measured data. A spatial comparison of the above studies revealed that the biomass productivity (NDVI)-based land degradation assessment grossly underestimated the extent to which soil is being lost, unless a correction was included to account for atmospheric fertilization. Based on inter-annual \{NDVI\} signals land degradation was evident in about 8% of the Volta basin's landmass, but when accounting for atmospheric fertilization, as much as 65% of the land is losing some of its vital attributes such as soil quality or vegetation productivity. The study demonstrates the need for using a multi-pronged assessment strategy in land degradation assessment that offers an insight of the processes involved in land degradation. "

Western blot analyses showed that \{AS\} and \{FA\} significantly blocked the protein expression of iNOS and COX-2 in LPS-induced macrophages. Moreover, \{AS\} and \{FA\} inhibited the activation of NF-κB and the production of LPS-induced TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, in a concentration-dependent manner. The results showed that anti-inflammatory properties observed in \{FA\} and \{AS\} may vary with fermentation processing. Fermentation was observed to increase the anti-inflammatory properties of the adlay-soymilk. In conclusion, our study shows that the application of L. plantarum for \{FA\} production contributes anti-inflammatory effects by attenuating the generation of excessive NO, PGE2, and ROS, and by suppressing the expression of pro-inflammatory genes through inhibiting NF-κB activation, which could be serve as potential strategy in the prevention of inflammation-related diseases.

The majority of the viruses infecting legumes are vectored by insects, and several of them are also seed transmitted, thus assuming importance in the quarantine and in the epidemiology. This review is focused on the economically important viruses of soybean, groundnut, common bean, cowpea, pigeonpea, mungbean, urdbean, chickpea, pea, faba bean, and lentil and begomovirus diseases of three minor tropical food legumes (hyacinth bean, horse gram, and lima bean). Aspects included are geographic distribution, impact on crop growth and yields, virus characteristics, diagnosis of causal viruses, disease epidemiology, and options for control. Effectiveness of selection and planting with virus-free seed, phytosanitation, manipulation of crop cultural and agronomic practices, control of virus vectors and host plant resistance, and potential of transgenic resistance for legume virus disease control are discussed.

In the agriculture sector of Uzbekistan, Central Asia, several reforms have been implemented to increase the operational autonomy of agricultural producers. However, land and water use in agriculture remains directly linked to the centrally regulated cotton production. Still partly resembling the design of the state orders imposed during the planned economy, cotton production policy is used to ensure the stability of national export revenues at the expense of farm incomes. In this paper we argue that modifying the cotton policy may improve the situation with farm incomes and food production, and reduce pressure on water resources, the availability of which in Central Asia is expected to decrease. To conduct an ex ante analysis of cotton policy modifications intended to improve rural incomes, a bio-economic optimization model was developed at the level of a water users association in the Khorezm region of Uzbekistan. Policy simulations showed that abolishing the current cotton policy would be a more economically attractive option for farmers and also increase grain production rather than various forms of this policy modification. However, abolishing the current cotton policy can present pressure on irrigation water resources as farmers would opt to cultivate water-intensive crops, thus requiring supplemental policies and institutions for sustainable resources use.

In the tropics, ants are generally considered as the most efficacious among them. In the face of such predation, wasps have developed over the course of evolution a great number of strategies. In addition to guarding and defensive behaviours displayed by workers, social wasps have nests whose structure is a response to the predation pressure exerted by ants. Thus, the presence of a petiole attaching the nest to a natural support itself sometimes selected because of its limited accessibility constitutes a frequent example of architectural defence. The effectiveness of the petiole is often improved through the repeated application of repellent substances on its surface. In the same way, wasps that found their new societies through swarming construct nests protected by an envelope. In the American tropics, army ants which hunt on the ground and can rapidly take over a tree, regularly pillage wasp nests. Because no defensive strategy is efficacious against such predators, the choice of nest site becomes decisive. Paradoxically, it is by nesting in close proximity to an arboreal ant nest that certain wasp species have been able to find a way of responding to the threat exerted by other ants. These ants, which tolerate the presence of the wasp nest, are capable of efficaciously protecting the tree or the branch sheltering the nest. "

Along with the fast development in molecular biology and biotechnology, a large amount of biological data is available for genetic studies of important breeding traits in plants, which in turn allows the conduction of genotypic selection in the breeding process. However, gene information has not been effectively used in crop improvement because of the lack of appropriate tools. The simulation approach can utilize the vast and diverse genetic information, predict the cross performance, and compare different selection methods. Thus, the best performing crosses and effective breeding strategies can be identified. QuLine is a computer tool capable of defining a range, from simple to complex genetic models, and simulating breeding processes for developing final advanced lines. On the basis of the results from simulation experiments, breeders can optimize their breeding methodology and greatly improve the breeding efficiency. In this article, the underlying principles of simulation modeling in crop enhancement is initially introduced, following which several applications of QuLine are summarized, by comparing the different selection strategies, the precision parental selection, using known gene information, and the design approach in breeding. Breeding simulation allows the definition of complicated genetic models consisting of multiple alleles, pleiotropy, epistasis, and genes, by environment interaction, and provides a useful tool for breeders, to efficiently use the wide spectrum of genetic data and information available.

The metapopulation model is based on a single patch age-structured population dynamics model reported by Gutierrez et al.

The same model simulates the mass number dynamics of each plant or animal species in each patch and the movement of animals between patches. Movement is based on species specific supply–demand relations. The pathogen mortality rate is a simple function of rainfall intensity. The within-patch species composition, their initial densities, and the initial values of edaphic variables may be assigned stochastically. Sensitivity, graphical and multiple linear regression analyses are used to summarize the effects of spatial and resource heterogeneity on species dynamics. Important plant level effects on higher trophic levels are demonstrated, and recommendations are made as to the appropriate model for different ecological studies. "

Replication of viroids—in the nucleus or chloroplasts through a rolling-circle mechanism involving polymerization, cleavage and circularization of \{RNA\} strands—dealt three surprises: (i) certain \{RNA\} polymerases are redirected to accept \{RNA\} instead of their \{DNA\} templates, (ii) cleavage in chloroplastic viroids is not mediated by host enzymes but by hammerhead ribozymes, and (iii) circularization in nuclear viroids is catalyzed by a \{DNA\} ligase redirected to act upon \{RNA\} substrates. These enzymes (and ribozymes) are most probably assisted by host proteins, including transcription factors and \{RNA\} chaperones. Movement of viroids, first intracellularly and then to adjacent cells and distal plant parts, has turned out to be a tightly regulated process in which specific \{RNA\} structural motifs play a crucial role. More recently, the advent of \{RNA\} silencing has brought new views on how viroids may cause disease and on how their hosts react to contain the infection; additionally, viroid infection may be restricted by other mechanisms. Representing the lowest step on the biological size scale, viroids have also attracted considerable interest to get a tentative picture of the essential characteristics of the primitive replicons that populated the postulated \{RNA\} world.

Seventy samples from fourteen villages were used. Aflatoxins occurrence was analysed on 84 samples by ultra–high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The average water content and the cashew nuts count were respectively 8.6% and 172 nuts/kg in \{NG\} and 8.7% and 174 nuts/kg in SS. Significant differences between villages in both zones were found for both water content and nuts count. In disinfected samples, strains of Aspergillus section Nigri were predominant, in \{NG\} and \{SS\} zones (90.2% and 87.2%) respectively. When non disinfected kernels were plated, A. section Nigri was predominant in both \{NG\} and \{SS\} zones, with percentages of 89.7% and 93.4%, respectively.

It is frequently found associated with the ground nesting ant, Anoplolepis tenella, under cassava plant. Amdro fire ant bait granules (contains 7.3 g/kg Hydramethylnon), borax and boric acid solution were evaluated in the laboratory for toxicity against A. tenella colonies. Workers were exposed to bait for ten days during primary screening and colonies for six weeks during secondary screening. Mortality was recorded daily for each toxicant. In a field experiment, the effect of a 1% boric acid-sucrose solution was evaluated on A. tenella and its impact on the density of S. vayssierei on cassava. Each of the three toxicants displayed delayed toxicity with less than 15% mortality after the first day. In comparison to Amdro and borax, the 1% boric acid-sucrose solution was more effective in killing ant workers. The boric acid-sucrose solution reduced the numbers of workers and brood by 90% within 6 weeks. In the field experiment, monthly ant and scale sampling showed significant reductions in ant density in treated fields which resulted in a reduction of scale infestation on cassava. We recorded a 16% yield increase in treated plots compared to control plots. These results outline the dependence of S. vayssierei survival on A. tenella attendance and demonstrate that control of the ant in cassava fields can help in developing control options for the scale insect pest in the Congo Basin.

In doing so we evaluate the quality and scientific rigor of that evidence, identify the key conclusions that emerge from the literature, and assess whether these conclusions are consistent across the sources. The results of the assessment show that while some specific topics are consistently and rigorously documented, thus substantiating some of the claims found in the literature, other areas of research still lack the level of disaggregated data or an appropriate methodology to reach consistency and robust conclusions. More specifically, the analysis reveals that while fish contributes undeniably to nutrition and food security, the links between fisheries/aquaculture and poverty alleviation are complex and still unclear. In particular national and household level studies on fisheries’ contributions to poverty alleviation lack good conceptual models and produce inconsistent results. For aquaculture, national and household studies tend to focus on export value chains and use diverse approaches. They suggest some degree of poverty alleviation and possibly other positive outcomes for adopters, but these outcomes also depend on the small-scale farming contexts and on whether adoption was emergent or due to development assistance interventions. Impacts of fish trade on food security and poverty alleviation are ambiguous and confounded by a focus on international trade and a lack of consistent methods. The influences of major drivers (decentralization, climate change, demographic transition) are still insufficiently documented and therefore poorly understood. Finally the evaluation reveals that evidence-based research and policy narratives are often disconnected, with some of the strongest and long-lasting policy narratives lacking any strong and rigorous evidence-based validation. Building on these different results, this paper identifies six key gaps facing policy-makers, development practitioners, and researchers. "

We now provide the first evidence of upregulation of p53 and Bax and specifically for Bax translocation from cytosol to mitochondria following infection with a cytoplasmically replicating \{RNA\} virus. Bax translocation to the mitochondria led to the release of mitochondrial proapoptic factors cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria to the cytosol, but not the release of apoptosis-inducting factor. Activation of caspases-9 and -3 which cleaves the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in ARV-infected BHK-21 cells was also detected. Internucleosomal \{DNA\} cleavage was prevented by caspase inhibitors, further demonstrating that ARV-induced apoptosis was executed through caspase-dependent mechanisms. Stable expression of human bcl-2 in BHK-21 cells not only blocked ARV-induced apoptosis and \{DNA\} fragmentation but also reduced the level of infectious virus production and its spread in BHK-21 cells infected with \{ARV\} at a low multiplicity of infection. All our data suggest that p53 and the mitochondria-mediated pathway played an important regulatory role in ARV-induced apoptosis in BHK-21 cells. To further study the pathogenesis of \{ARV\} infection, a dual-labeling assay was used for the simultaneous detection of cells containing viral antigen and apoptotic cells. Dual-labeling assay revealed that the majority of antigen-expressing cells were not apoptotic. Remarkably, some apoptotic but non-antigen-expressing cells were frequently located in the vicinity of antigen-expressing cells. Syncytium formation in ARV-infected BHK-21 cells undergoing apoptosis, was apparent in large syncytia at late infection times, indicating a correlation between virus replication and apoptosis in cultured cells.

Since then, the eruption of the Soufriere Hills volcano has destroyed more than half of the species’ range. Recent intensive monitoring has indicated that the species has also declined dramatically within the remaining intact forest, and is now critically threatened. Different monitoring and analytical methods indicate a decline of 8–52% p.a., and a remaining global population of ca. 100–400 pairs. This case study justifies the use of the restricted range criterion in designating threatened species. Despite intensive monitoring and the use of several analytical methods, it has proved surprisingly difficult to estimate the magnitude of the oriole’s decrease, or to control for potential artefacts in the census method. We discuss the reasons for this. The cause(s) of population decline in the intact forest are unclear, though two hypotheses appear plausible: a decrease in arthropod food, a result of volcanic ash fall, and an increase in nest predation as a result of increases in populations of opportunistic omnivores.

We collected diverse biophysical data to allow spatial variability of soil organic carbon and factors contributing to this variation to be determined statistically, and used well established simulation models to interpret the data, predict long-term carbon dynamics and determine the potential for improvements in soil quality and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. The spatial variation in soil organic carbon in the 0–20 cm soil depth was significant across study areas (P &lt; 0.01, 21.6 g kg−1–37.8 g kg−1), and between land-uses (P &lt; 0.05, 27.9 g kg−1 in cropland and 43.0 g kg−1 soil in forestland). In a multiple linear regression model, among the 11 explanatory variables used, four (total nitrogen, shrubs, trees and land use) showed a significant positive effect (P &lt; 0.01), while three (impact of grazing, impact of erosion and clay) showed a significant negative effect (P &lt; 0.01). Simulations using the assumption of steady state to estimate carbon dynamics suggested that plant inputs from croplands are generally lower than grass or shrublands, resulting in build-up of recalcitrant organic matter in shrublands compared to grass or croplands. Erosion results in a decline in both the absolute and relative amounts of carbon in recalcitrant pools, but the more active pools remained unchanged, meaning that the overall activity of soil organic matter is increased when the soil is eroded, and it becomes more difficult to sequester soil carbon. More rapid decrease in soil organic carbon is likely to be due to increased erosion, persistent removal of organic materials, grazing pressures, and higher rate of decompositions in cropland and grazing land-uses. Conversion to shrubland shows high potential to quickly restore eroded soils and build up a pool of recalcitrant soil carbon, suggesting that management of land using periodic 20 year exclosures, preventing cropping and grazing and allowing shrubland succession, could be beneficial in restoring degraded soils. Simulations using a calibration approach, rather than assuming steady state, corroborated these findings, suggesting that after 30 years of current management, croplands will deplete soil organic carbon by 5.6, 7.1 and 7.2 t ha−1, and grasslands by 3.5, 3.9 and 2.7 t ha−1, while shrublands will build-up soil organic carbon by 0.6, 0.1 and 1.3 t ha−1 at study sites. At one study site, forests, will further increase soil organic carbon by 6.7 t ha−1 after 30 years. The significant positive impact of shrubs and trees on soil organic carbon suggests the need to focus on introduction of agroforestry systems in crop and grasslands. "

Wild food plants are important elements of biodiversity in rice fields and are critical components to the subsistence of poor farmers. The spatial and seasonal distribution of wild food plants were analysed across different sub-systems occurring within paddy ecosystems in two adjacent rice farming villages in Kalasin, Northeast Thailand. Data were collected in 102 sampling sites corresponding to seven sub-systems including tree rows, mounds, field margins, shelters, ponds, pond margins and levees. Frequency of occurrence and absolute abundance were quantified for each species in the two seasons of two years, and data on uses of wild food plant species were collected through focus group discussions. A total of 42 species from 28 botanical families were reported, and one third of these have been classified as weeds of rice by other authors. Results show that species abundance, frequency of occurrence and diversity varied seasonally and spatially within paddy rice ecosystems. Higher diversity indexes were observed in the monsoon in most sub-systems. The most diverse sub-systems in the monsoon were shelters, mounds and pond margins, and tree rows and mounds in the dry season. Field margins, ponds and levees presented lower diversity, but are habitat of aquatic species important for the local diet, such as Ipomoea aquatica and Marsilea crenata. The herbs Lobelia sp. and Glinus oppositifolius, classified as rice weeds, were most abundant species in the dry season and frequently consumed. Leucaena leucocephala, of which the roots, leaves and fruits are commonly consumed as vegetable, was the most abundant tree in most sub-systems. More than half of the species were specific to one or two sub-systems due to particular niche requirements. Three quarters of wild food plant species had additional uses besides food; with ten different types of use and multiple use categories occurring in the different sub-systems. This study highlights that the development of more productive lowland rice systems may jeopardize the diversity of wild food plant species in the rice landscape, which is important for the food security of the rural poor.

Reconstructed embryos cloned by transfer of non-heated Holstein donor cells to heat-shocked Holstein ooplasm (Ho+–Hd−) had a lower (P &lt; 0.05) blastocyst rate than those cloned from non-heated Holstein ooplasm receiving heated (Ho−–Hd+) or non-heated (Ho−–Hd−) Holstein donor cells (11.3 vs. 34.3 or 36.8%). Heat-shocked donor cells from either Holstein or \{TY\} cows did not significantly affect blastocyst rates of reconstructed embryos produced from Holstein ooplasm (30.6–32.9%). In contrast, blastocyst rates of reconstructed embryos generated with heat-shocked Holstein ooplasm were lower (P &lt; 0.05) than that with heat-shocked \{TY\} ooplasm (11.2 vs 45.2%). Without heat shock, embryos reconstructed by transferring donor cells to ooplasm of Holstein or \{TY\} cows had similar (P &gt; 0.05) blastocyst rates (28.9–33.3%). Transplantation of reconstructed embryos (n = 30) to recipients (n = 23) resulted in three live calves, derived from embryos cloned with \{TY\} ooplasm and donor nuclei from either Holstein (n = 2) or \{TY\} cows (n = 1).

We determined with repeated field surveys the changes in abundance and distribution of the phytoseiid mite fauna in cassava fields resulting from the introduction of the neotropical phytoseiid Typhlodromalus aripo into two countries—Malawi and Mozambique—in southern Africa for the biological control of Mononychellus tanajoa. Typhlodromalus aripo abundance was similar, while the abundance of the target pest M. tanajoa declined progressively, during the 2 years after the introduction of T. aripo into the target countries. We did not detect any changes in the abundance of the most common native phytoseiids mites—Euseius baetae, Euseius bwende and Ueckermannseius saltus—on cassava in Mozambique. In contrast, the abundance of two of the most common native phytoseiids, Euseius fustis and Iphiseius degenerans, on cassava in Malawi were apparently facilitated—i.e., their abundance was enhanced by the introduction of T. aripo; while the abundance of a third species, U. saltus, was not affected. For only one species, E. baetae, within-plant distribution shifted to the lower parts of the cassava canopy as a result of the introduction of T. aripo, which resides in the upper parts of the cassava canopy, but without any measurable negative effects on biological control of M. tanajoa. While the overall abundance of phytoseiid mites found on non-cassava vegetation was not affected by T. aripo introduction, there were some changes in relative abundance of some species in Malawi. Possible mechanism for the increase in abundance of I. degenerans and E. fustis in Malawi, and changes in within-plant distribution of E. baetae and I. degenerans in Mozambique and Malawi, respectively, are discussed. The methodology developed for assessing potential non-target effects of T. aripo introduction into southern Africa has significantly advanced classical biological control efforts against an economically important cassava pest.

In this study, in addition to morphological and geographical analyses, maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference analyses were performed based on nucleotide sequences of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer and cpDNA genes of 88 taxa representing the major clades of the Calanthe alliance in China. The results indicated that Cephalantheropsis is monophyletic, while both Phaius and Calanthe are polyphyletic. In Phaius, a total of three species, P. flavus, P. columnaris, and P. takeoi, were segregated to form a new genus, Paraphaius. In Calanthe, subgenus Preptanthe and sect. Styloglossum were both categorized as distinct genera from Calanthe. Our results also confirm that Calanthe delavayi and C. calanthoides are members of Calanthe. Previous studies assigned C. delavayi to Phaius and C. calanthoides to Ghiesbrechtia. Five sections, namely, Alpinocalanthe, Puberula, Ghiesbrechtia, Tricarinata, and Calanthe, three of which are new taxa, were recognized in Calanthe. Therefore, we propose that the Calanthe alliance is composed of six genera: Calanthe, Cephalantheropsis, Paraphaius, Phaius, Preptanthe and Styloglossum. "

The effect of two preculture treatments (sucrose pretreatment medium or cold-culturing during two weeks) on donor plants of four potato species (Solanum commersonii, S. juzepcukii, S. ajanhuiri, and Solanum tuberosum) was studied. Post-cryopreservation meristem growth and plant recovery were influenced by the treatments, but the effect on the regeneration was strongly genotype-dependent. The highest post-rewarming plant recovery percentage was obtained using meristems dissected from donor plants of S. commersonii cultured on sucrose pretreatment medium or cold-cultured. Both preculture conditions also enhanced plant recovery in S. juzepcukii compared to control cultures. Cold preculture, however, proved to be undesirable for S. tuberosum whereas sucrose pretreatment had a positive impact on the plant regeneration of this species. The determination of changes in the concentration of soluble sugars revealed sugar accumulation, especially of sucrose and the raffinose family of oligosaccharides (RFOs), which can be linked to tolerance towards the cryopreservation. Additionally, a study of the proteome of the donor plantlets after the pretreatments by 2D-fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) was carried out to identify differentially abundant proteins. Carbon metabolism-related proteins, together with stress-response and oxidative-homeostasis related proteins were the main class of proteins that changed in abundance after the pretreatments. Our results suggest that oxidative homeostasis-related proteins and sugars may be associated with the improved tolerance to cryopreservation and the ability to cold acclimate by S. commersonii in contrast to the other genotypes. The increased accumulation of sucrose and \{RFOs\} play a fundamental role in the response to stress in potato and may help to acquire tolerance to cryopreservation. "

Initially, 1046 animals from 26 private N'Dama cattle herds, were monitored from October 1989 to December 1994. Each herd was stratified by age and the animals were randomly allocated to two groups with a similar average age. One group received a single anthelmintic treatment of fenbendazole (PanacurTM, 7.5 mg/kg BW, Hoechst Veterinä AG) in October 1989, whereas the other group remained untreated. In July 1990, the herds were subdivided into two different treatment schemes. In the herds of scheme 1, the treated animals (Treatment group I) were treated once (in August), whereas in the herds of scheme 2, the treated animals (Treatment group II) were treated twice (in July and September). The same treatment schedule was used in the subsequent rainy seasons until December 1994. One group in every herd of both schemes served as control (Treatment group 0) and received no anthelmintic treatment throughout the study. The average and annual cumulative incidence mortality between 0–1 year was more than two times higher in treated animals compared to their controls (21% against 7.5%). No differences were found in older age categories. Survival analysis confirmed differences in mortality from 0–1 year, but were not significant in proportional hazard models. The 25% quantities of age at first calving was used to quantify differences between twice treated animals (50.2 months) and its controls (58.3 months) which represents a decrease of 8 months in twice treated animals. Annual calving rates of twice treated animals were 52.2% compared to 43.6% in the control group (P&lt;0.001), which is an increase of 8.6% to the control rate. Possible causes of increased mortality in 0–1 year old treated calves are discussed. We can conclude that in the present epidemiological situation and the given parasite spectrum, gastro-intestinal nematodes mainly affect host fertility. Strategic control of gastro-intestinal nematodes is thus recommended for young heifers up to their age of first calving provided the overall financial analysis of the intervention is beneficial. "

However, the many changes that threaten the actual functioning of the systems and trigger many uncertainties concerning capacities to adapt to external shocks require new research approaches. In this paper, we explore the links between capital assets, risk perception, measure of income, and livestock adaptation using a typology value based on multiple factorial analyses. We examine the specific role of livestock in the processes of adaptation to a 15-year drought. The study is based on a farm survey of 182 Bedouin families in the Coastal Zone of Western Desert of Egypt in 2011. Our results show that livestock is still a core component of Bedouin society with a significant typology value. However, for Bedouin families located inland, livestock is mainly an economic safety net in the case of drought; whereas for family members who recently moved to town, livestock is a social safety net vis-à-vis the traditional society which enables them to cope with economic hardship and participate in social events. How livestock is managed during drought events and the role of livestock in the process of adapting to drought depends less on the size of the herd before the drought in the rain-fed zone and more on traditional social and official networks. Consequently, limiting the impact of drought in this zone requires paying more attention to the management of collective action, including livestock policies and feed subsidies. "

Comparison of model outputs with data can be used to estimate the former. The latter has a squared bias term, which can be estimated using hindcasts, and a model variance term, which can be estimated from a simulation experiment.

Previous studies have provided evidence that non-covalent biomolecular complexes can be observed by \{ESI\} mass spectrometry; it is not clear, however, whether the native conformation of the biomoleculas is maintained throughout the ionization and analysis process. We set out to address this question using live viruses. Results: Viral ions have been generated in the gas phase using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. These ions have been collected, following ion filtering through the mass analyzer, and then analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that rice yellow mottle virus and tobacco mosaic virus retained their respective spherical and rod-like ultra-structure. The viability of the isolated tobacco mosaic virus was confirmed by inoculation and infection of tobacco plants. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the utility of electrospray for supramolecular complexes with molecular weights of over 40 million Da and offer conclusive evidence that native biomolecular structures can be conserved through the electrospray process.

abstract = "Abstract In the past decade, oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) has become the world’s most important oil crop. The large demand for palm oil has resulted in a rapid expansion of oil palm cultivation across the globe. Because of the dwindling availability of land in Southeast Asia, most expansion of the industry is expected in Central and South America and sub-Saharan Africa, where land with suitable agro-ecological conditions is available. Using Ghana as a case study, a method for evaluating areas that are both suitable and available for oil palm production is presented. Our assessment used spatial data and \{GIS\} techniques, and showed that areas with suitable climatic conditions (annual average water deficit &lt;400 mm) is about 20% greater than was previously identified. The observed differences are the result of using different methods to determine suitability, and climate change. A major climatic factor limiting suitability for oil palm production in Ghana is the annual water deficit, with the most suitable areas located in the rainforest and semi-deciduous forest zones with higher rainfall in southern Ghana. Opportunities for large-scale oil palm plantation development is limited, however, because of the lack of availability of large and contiguous tracts of land that are required for commercial plantation oil palm development. A feasible strategy for oil palm expansion is therefore smallholder production, which can make use of smaller parcels of land. Alternatively, oil palm production in Ghana can be increased by yield intensification on land already planted to oil palm. This can also reduce the requirement for further land clearance for new plantations to meet the growing demand for palm oil. Such assessments will be essential for guiding government policy makers and investors considering investments in oil palm development. "

Using species distribution models, we assess possible future changes in the diversity and climatic niche size of an unprecedented number of species for the region. We modeled a broad range of taxa (11,012 species of birds and vascular plants), including both endemic and widespread species and provide a comprehensive estimation of climate change impacts on the Andes. We find that if no dispersal is assumed, by 2050s, more than 50% of the species studied are projected to undergo reductions of at least 45% in their climatic niche, whilst 10% of species could be extinct. Even assuming unlimited dispersal, most of the Andean endemics (comprising ∼5% of our dataset) would become severely threatened (&gt;50% climatic niche loss). While some areas appear to be climatically stable (e.g. Pichincha and Imbabura in Ecuador; and Nariño, Cauca, Valle del Cauca and Putumayo in Colombia) and hence depict little diversity loss and/or potential species gains, major negative impacts were also observed. Tropical high Andean grasslands (páramos and punas) and evergreen montane forests, two key ecosystems for the provision of environmental services in the region, are projected to experience negative changes in species richness and high rates of species turnover. Adapting to these impacts would require a landscape-network based approach to conservation, including protected areas, their buffer zones and corridors. A central aspect of such network is the implementation of an integrated landscape management approach based on sustainable management and restoration practices covering wider areas than currently contemplated.

We compare two carbon tax scenarios with a business-as-usual scenario of anticipated future energy demand. In the short term, with carbon prices reaching around $15/tCO2 by 2030, most models agree that the reduction in consumer spending, as a proxy for welfare, is limited to about 0.3%. By 2050, at carbon prices of $165/tCO2, there is much more divergence in the estimated impact on consumer spending as well as \{GDP\} across models and regions, which reflects uncertainties about technology costs and substitution opportunities between technologies. We observe that the consequences of increasingly higher carbon prices, in terms of reduced consumer spending and GDP, tend to be fairly linear with the carbon price in our \{CGE\} models. However, the consequences are divergent and nonlinear in our econometric model, that is linked to an energy system model that simulates step-changes in technology substitution. The results of one model show that climate policy measures can have positive effects on consumer spending and GDP, which results from an investment stimulus and the redistribution of carbon price revenues to consumers.

The use of mineral N fertilizer was found to be profitable with economically optimal rates of 40 and 80 kg N ha−1 for more intensively managed homestead fields and less intensively managed bush fields respectively. Agronomic N use efficiency varied from 21 to 37 kg grain kg−1 N for the homestead fields and from 15 to 49 kg grain kg−1 N in the bush fields. Simulated grain yield for homestead fields at 40 kg N ha−1 application was equal to yield for bush fields at 80 kg N ha−1. Water use efficiency generally increased with increased mineral N rate and was greater for the homestead fields compared with the bush fields. Grain yield per unit of cumulative evapo-transpiration (simulated) was consistently higher compared with yield per unit of cumulative precipitation for the season, probably because of runoff and deep percolation. In the simulation experiment, grain yield variability was less with mineral N application and under higher soil fertility (organic matter) condition. Application of mineral N reduced variability in yield from a \{CV\} of 37 to 11% in the bush farm and from 17 to 7% in the homestead fields. The use of mineral fertilizer and encouraging practices that retain organic matter to the soil provide a more sustainable system for ensuring crop production and hence food security. "

Of 21 insect projects, 81% (17) provided benefits to protection of biodiversity, while 48% (10) protected products harvested from natural systems, and 5% (1) preserved ecosystem services, with many projects contributing to more than one goal. In contrast, of the 49 projects against invasive plants, 98% (48) provided benefits to protection of biodiversity, while 47% (23) protected products, and 25% (12) preserved ecosystem services, again with many projects contributing to several goals. We classified projects into complete control (pest generally no longer important), partial control (control in some areas but not others), and “in progress,” for projects in development for which outcomes do not yet exist. For insects, of the 21 projects discussed, 62% (13) achieved complete control of the target pest, 19% (4) provided partial control, and 43% (9) are still in progress. By comparison, of the 49 invasive plant projects considered, 27% (13) achieved complete control, while 33% (16) provided partial control, and 49% (24) are still in progress. For both categories of pests, some projects’ success ratings were scored twice when results varied by region. We found approximately twice as many projects directed against invasive plants than insects and that protection of biodiversity was the most frequent benefit of both insect and plant projects. Ecosystem service protection was provided in the fewest cases by either insect or plant biological control agents, but was more likely to be provided by projects directed against invasive plants, likely because of the strong effects plants exert on landscapes. Rates of complete success appeared to be higher for insect than plant targets (62% vs 27%), perhaps because most often herbivores gradually weaken, rather than outright kill, their hosts, which is not the case for natural enemies directed against pest insects. For both insect and plant biological control, nearly half of all projects reviewed were listed as currently in progress, suggesting that the use of biological control for the protection of wildlands is currently very active.

The first set of advanced lines derived from crosses of high yielding wheats with genetic resources possessing high Zn and Fe such as Triticum spelta, landraces and synthetic wheat based on Triticum dicoccon were tested at nine locations in South Asia and Mexico for Zn and Fe concentration, grain yield and other traits. Analyses of variance across locations revealed significant genotypic, environmental and genotype × environment (G × E) effects for grain Zn and Fe concentrations and grain yield. Variances associated with environmental effects were larger than the genotypic and G × E effects for all three traits, suggesting that environmental effects have relatively greater influence. Although G × E interaction was significant, high heritabilities were observed for Zn and Fe concentrations at individual sites and across environments, reflecting non-crossover type of interaction. This trend was confirmed by the high genetic correlations between locations that showed similar ranking of entries across locations, indicating that it is possible to select the best adapted entries with high Zn and Fe concentration. Pooled data across locations showed increments of 28% and 25% over the checks for Zn and Fe. A considerable number of entries exceeded intermediate to full breeding target Zn concentrations, indicating that it is possible to develop Zn-biofortified varieties with competitive yields and other farmer preferred agronomic traits. The positive and moderately high correlation between Zn and Fe concentration suggest good prospects of simultaneous improvement for both micronutrients. "

Therefore, the early detection of pathogens is crucial for protecting aquaculture species with a premium commercial value. This study reports an integrated microfluidic system for the rapid detection of aquaculture pathogens. In this new device, the \{DNA\} (deoxyribonucleic acid) of the target pathogen was first isolated by magnetic beads coated with specific nucleotide probes after cell lysis. Then the extracted \{DNA\} fragments were amplified by the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) process and the amplified products were detected optically. This device contained normally closed microvalves, micropumps, \{LAMP\} reaction chambers and wash units such that the entire process for isolation of pathogen DNA, nucleic acid amplification and optical detection was performed automatically in the developed microfluidic system. Experimental data showed that the developed system can automatically complete the entire process within 65 min with a detection limit of 20 copies. Another advantage of this device is that the chip is comprised of four identical modules. Therefore, this device could carry out detection of four different pathogens simultaneously. In this study, four pathogens common to cultured ornamental fishes, namely Streptococcus agalactiae, koi herpes virus, Iridovirus and Aeromonas hydrophila were analyzed by this integrated device. This device successfully completed four simultaneous detections from infected fishes in a short period of time. Compared to previous studies, this microfluidic system could complete all processes involved in pathogen detection including sample pre-treatment, nucleic acid amplification and optical detection without any manual operation. As a whole, the developed microfluidic system is promising for rapid isolation and detection of aquaculture pathogens. "

Part of the amplified F protein \{DNA\} product (nucleotide sequence 47–418) and the deduced amino acid sequences were compared phylogenetically with those from strains previously reported in Taiwan and other geographic regions. Our results showed that all Taiwanese isolates (n = 20) collected during 2003–2006, according to the phylogenetic tree, belong to the genotype VIId. In addition, all the six Taiwanese isolates obtained in 2003, carry the motif 112R-R-Q-K-R116 and have the amino acid \{L23\} replaced by \{F23\} (assigned as Group 1). On the other hand, 12 out of the 14 Taiwanese isolates obtained during 2004–2006 possess the motif 112R-R-K-K-R116 and have the amino acid G74, instead of \{E74\} (assigned as Group 2). To our best knowledge, this is the first reported \{VIId\} isolates that possess the sequences of G74/112R-R-K-K-R116 within the \{F0\} protein. Since a high mortality, severe clinical signs, typical postmortem lesions, and a high intra-cerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) were observed in the NDV-infected chickens, these isolates acquired between 2003 and 2006 are considered as the velogenic type. The Group 2 viruses have become dominant and responsible for the majority of Taiwanese outbreaks during recent years. Based on our phylogenetic analysis, it can be postulated that these isolates were evolved from previously reported local strains, and the Group 2 family emerged the latest in the genotype VIId. The information is fundamental to improving the efficiency of controlling strategies and vaccine development for NDV. "

The resulting phylogeny confirms the monophyly of the morphologically defined fusca, morsitans and palpalis subgenera. Genetic distances between palpalis and morsitans subspecies suggest that their status needs revision. In particular, cytochrome oxidase 1 sequences showed large geographical differences within G. palpalis palpalis, suggesting the existence of cryptic species within this subspecies. The morphology of palpalis group female genital plates was examined, and individuals were found varying outside the ranges specified by the standard identification keys, making definitive morphological classification impossible. A diagnostic \{PCR\} to distinguish G. palpalis palpalis, G. tachinoides and G. palpalis gambiensis based on length differences of internal transcribed spacer 1 sequences is presented. "

This antibody detection test is based on lyophilised bloodstream form trypanosomes propagated in rats and presenting the predominant variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) RoTat 1.2 on their surface. Recently, the N-terminal fragment of \{VSG\} RoTat 1.2 has been expressed as a recombinant protein in the yeast Pichia pastoris and showed diagnostic potential in ELISA. This recombinant antigen has now been incorporated in a latex agglutination test, the rLATEX/T. evansi. In this study, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of rLATEX/T. evansi and CATT/T. evansi with immune trypanolysis (TL) as reference test on a total of 1717 sera from camels, horses, bovines, water buffaloes, dogs and sheep. The rLATEX/T. evansi displayed a slightly better agreement with \{TL\} than CATT/T. evansi (kappa [κ] respectively 0.84 and 0.72). The sensitivities of rLATEX/T. evansi (84.2%, 95% \{CI\} 80.8–87.1) and CATT/T. evansi (84.0%, 95% \{CI\} 80.6–87.0) were similar, but rLATEX/T. evansi was significantly more specific (97.7%, 95% \{CI\} 96.7–98.4) than CATT/T. evansi (89.4%; 95% \{CI\} 87.6–91.1). We consider the rLATEX/T. evansi an alternative for the CATT/T. evansi, with the advantage that the use of a purified recombinant antigen leads to a more standardised diagnostic test with an improved specificity. Moreover, it eliminates the use of laboratory animals and can be easily scaled-up, e.g. in biofermentors. "

This paper proposes a categorisation of household diversity based on a functional typology of livelihood strategies, and analyses the influence of such diversity on current soil fertility status and spatial variability on a sample of 250 randomly selected farms from six districts of Kenya and Uganda. In spite of the agro-ecological and socio-economic diversity observed across the region (e.g. 4 months year−1 of food self-sufficiency in Vihiga, Kenya vs. 10 in Tororo, Uganda) consistent patterns of variability were also observed. For example, all the households with less than 3 months year−1 of food self-sufficiency had a land:labour ratio (LLR) &lt; 1, and all those with \{LLR\} &gt; 1 produced enough food to cover their diet for at least 5 months. Households with \{LLR\} &lt; 1 were also those who generated more than 50% of their total income outside the farm. Dependence on off/non-farm income was one of the main factors associated with household diversity. Based on indicators of resource endowment and income strategies and using principal component analysis, farmers’ rankings and cluster analysis the 250 households surveyed were grouped into five farm types: (1) Farms that rely mainly on permanent off-farm employment (from 10 to 28% of the farmers interviewed, according to site); (2) larger, wealthier farms growing cash crops (8–20%); (3) medium resource endowment, food self-sufficient farms (20–38%); (4) medium to low resource endowment relying partly on non-farm activities (18–30%); and (5) poor households with family members employed locally as agricultural labourers by wealthier farmers (13–25%). Due to differential soil management over long periods of time, and to ample diversity in resource endowments (land, livestock, labour) and access to cash, the five farm types exhibited different soil carbon and nutrient stocks (e.g. Type 2 farms had average C, N, P and K stocks that were 2–3 times larger than for Types 4 or 5). In general, soil spatial variability was larger in farms (and sites) with poorer soils and smaller in farms owning livestock. The five farm types identified may be seen as domains to target technological innovations and/or development efforts. "

The occurrence and prevalence of sorghum downy mildew (SDM) caused by Peronosclerospora sorghi [(Weston and Uppal) Shaw] was assessed in regions of each country. In Nigeria only maize was systemically infected in the southern humid zone, where rainfall was 1200–1800 mm and the altitude 300–1000 m. This epidemic zone appeared to be geographically isolated from other areas of Nigeria where \{SDM\} was observed. Within the southern epidemic zone, yield loss was estimated to be 11.7%. Individual fields had up to 95% incidence of systemically infected plants. In the arid north of Nigeria (rainfall &lt; 1300 mm, altitude 600–1200 m) both maize and sorghum were infected, and disease incidence was invariably low (&lt;5%). Systemic \{SDM\} incidence on maize was negatively correlated with growth stage (r = −0.7746, P = 0.01). In Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mozambique and Rwanda sorghum and maize were infected with \{SDM\} in areas with an annual rainfall of 600–1200 mm and an altitude range of &lt;300–1800 m. Incidence of infection within crops was generally low, and sites with infected crops were scattered in these countries. \{SDM\} local lesion infection was observed only on sorghum. Yield loss due to \{SDM\} in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Rwanda at the time of the survey was negligible. However, \{SDM\} is widespread in Africa and occurs in many different agricultural areas, and thus remains a threat to sorghum and maize production. Management of the disease using resistant varieties, cultural and chemical control should reduce the risk of future epidemics. "

Incidence of infection at different temperatures was correlated with germ tube growth (r = 0.8, P &lt; 0.001). Germination and germ tube growth occurred from 5 h after commencing incubation of infected leaf material, although immature conidia harvested at 3 h caused a low incidence of infection. Plant age also affected the incidence of infection. Container grown sorghum plants older than 20 d, and maize plants older than 15 d were resistant to systemic infection by conidia. The results indicate that germination, germ tube growth and infection take place over a wide temperature range, and that some limited biotypic variation may exist when these data are compared to other reports of the environmental requirements of P. sorghi from the U.S.A. and India.

However, its higher composition of reducing sugars (i.e., glucose and fructose), which inhibit sucrose crystallization, hinders the production of sugar from high yield sugarcane. Under the conventional integrated sugar–ethanol manufacturing system, high biomass yield causes only the increase of ethanol production because of the increase in unrecovered sugar after extraction, which represents a failure in resolving the competition. The technology presented here is the world's first to solve this problem via selective ethanol fermentation using Saccharomyces dairenensis, an unconventional yeast that ferments only reducing sugars and leaves sucrose untouched. A laboratory-scale test using sugarcane juices with a high composition of reducing sugars (100 g kg−1) resulted in a sucrose crystal yield increase from a single extraction, from 16.2 to 65.1%, by introducing selective fermentation. The second extraction, from the molasses, which was enabled by the lowered residual reducing sugar composition, further enhanced the total sugar crystal yield (up to 83.4%). A simulation of the application of this technology in the U.S.A. revealed that both sugar and ethanol production were enhanced, whereas sugar production declined by the mere adoption of high yield cultivar, even with the increase in sugarcane yield.

Improving the conservation tools available to restore lost mangroves would benefit from a better understanding of how human activities influence the conservation of these ecosystems. We took advantage of historical information and long-term landscape analyses to relate land use change with the area of mangroves in Puerto Rico. We found that mangroves experienced dramatic changes over the last 200 years, and four distinct eras of change were visible. During the agricultural era (1800–1940) the area of mangroves declined 45%. As the economy changed to industrial in the late 1940s the area of mangrove increase due to reduced land use pressure on the wetlands. Nevertheless, urban expansion between 1960s and 1970s produced another decline. Public concern for mangrove conservation resulted in the legal protection of all the mangroves in 1972, and since then their area has expanded. We found that past human activity altered the original proportion of mangrove species. The number and size of mangrove-forest fragments was impacted by land use, and urban areas had fewer and smaller fragments than vegetated areas. Uncontrolled expansion of urban areas emerged as a major threat to mangrove conservation. Mangroves are resilient and recover quickly when given an opportunity if the geomorphological and hydrological features of the habitat are not changed by their use. The key to conservation appears to be a combination of the type of human activity in mangrove watersheds combined with strong legal protection. The following steps are recommended: (1) identify the areas that satisfy the ecological requirements of mangrove development; (2) incorporate better zoning regulations to maintain these areas natural and to protect the fluxes of water, nutrients, and organisms in and out of the system; and (3) monitor results.

Sampling was by standardised 100 m×2 m transects in: primary forest, several ages of regenerating forest, agroforestry plots, short fallows, mixed food crop fields, and mechanically cleared plots. Most sites were in southern Cameroon—two additional transects were conducted in primary forest in Congo (Brazzaville). Species richness was negatively correlated with the disturbance gradient, although transects in areas with a complete or near-complete canopy were broadly similar in species richness. The strongest negative correlation was found for termite species feeding furthest down the humification gradient (group \{IV\} soil feeders) probably because these species are energetically constrained from living in non-forest habitats. In contrast species feeding and nesting in dead wood (group I wood feeders) termites, which live in the most protected micro-habitats, were significantly positively correlated with the disturbance gradient. Species composition was also strongly correlated with disturbance level in multivariate redundancy analyses. Pest species were an insignificant element of the assemblage, in part because of the distance of the sites from savanna source pools. Overall, it appears that termite-mediated wood and litter decomposition may be relatively unaffected by light to moderate disturbance intensity, but that soil-conditioning by termites might be greatly reduced in agricultural land cleared from tropical forest.

We measured the effects of mineral fertilizers on crop performance at two sites over two to three crop cycles; Kawanda in central Uganda and Ntungamo in southwest Uganda. Fertilizers were applied at rates of 0N–50P–600K, 150N–50P–600K, 400N–0P–600K, 400N–50P–0K, 400N–50P–250K and 400N–50P–600K kg ha−1 yr−1. In addition 60Mg–6Zn–0.5Mo–1B kg ha−1 yr−1 was applied to all treatments, with the exception of the control plots which received no fertilizer. Fresh bunch mass and yield increased with successive cycles. Yield increases above the control ranged from 3.1 to 6.2 kg bunch−1 (average bunch weight for all treatments 11.5 kg bunch−1) and 2.2–11.2 Mg ha−1 yr−1 (average yield for all treatments 15.8 Mg ha−1 yr−1) at Kawanda, compared with 12.4–16.0 kg bunch−1 (average bunch weight for all treatments 14.7 kg bunch−1) and 7.0–29.5 Mg ha−1 yr−1 (average yield for all treatments 17.9 Mg ha−1 yr−1) at Ntungamo. The limiting nutrients at both sites were in the order K &gt; P &gt; N. Potassium, N and P foliar nutrient mass fractions were below previously established Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) norms, with the smallest K mass fractions observed in the best yielding plots at Ntungamo. Total nutrient uptakes (K &gt; N &gt; P) were higher at Ntungamo as compared with Kawanda, probably due to better soil moisture availability and root exploration of the soil. Average N, P and K conversion efficiencies for two crop cycles at both sites amounted to 49.2 kg finger \{DM\} kg−1 N, 587 kg finger \{DM\} kg−1 P and 10.8 kg finger \{DM\} kg−1 K. Calibration results of the model \{QUEFTS\} using data from Ntungamo were reasonable (R2 = 0.57, \{RMSE\} = 648 kg ha−1). Using the measured soil chemical properties and yield data from an experiment at Mbarara in southwest Uganda, the calibrated \{QUEFTS\} model predicted yields well (R2 = 0.68, \{RMSE\} = 562 kg ha−1). We conclude that banana yields can be increased by use of mineral fertilizers, but fertilizer recovery efficiencies need to improve substantially before promoting wide-scale adoption. "

A total of 12 \{AMF\} morphotypes comprising of 4 Glomus, 1 Claroideoglomus, 5 Acaulosporaceae, 1 Racocetra sp. and 1 Gigaspora were isolated from the study site. Occurrnace of Acaulospora denticulata, Glomus ambisporum and Claroideoglomus etunicatum was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) affected by LUT; A. denticulata, Acaulospora laevis, G. ambisporum, Glomus sp. 1, Glomus sp. 2 and Gigaspora margarita were common in all LUT; C. etunicatum and Glomus sp. 3 were restricted and Acaulospora scrobiculata and two additional undescribed morpotypes were found only in trap cultures. Mean spore abundance was significantly (p = 0.007) different in cropped systems with \{CO\} (35), \{HT\} (36.6) and \{MA\} (41.7) recording lower mean spore abundance compared to non-cropped systems with \{PF\} (130), \{NA\} (91.3), \{FA\} (89.7) and \{NA\} (84.3). \{AMF\} species showed preference for either cropped or non-cropping systems and species diversity and richness were maintained despite dramatic changes in LUT.

However, the causal relationships between (l) composition, diversity and abundance of soil organisms and (2) sustained soil fertility are unclear. Furthermore, in tropical agricultural systems undergoing intensification, large numbers of farmers have limited access to inputs, and therefore the maintenance and enhancement of soil biodiversity may be particularly relevant to such farmers. In this paper we propose a number of hypotheses which could be tested to explore the relationships between agricultural intensification, biodiversity in tropical soils and ecosystem functions. We also provide a conceptual framework within which such hypotheses can be tested. "

It is now widely accepted that this is because farmers try to meet a wide range of objectives in feeding their animals. Their decision making can be supported by a sophisticated, indigenous knowledge. When researcher-developed technologies fail to account for this, they may be deemed unacceptable by the farmer. This paper explores one example of an indigenous knowledge system that relates to the quality of tree fodder used by farmers in Nepal. Our results suggest that the knowledge of tree fodder quality possessed by the farmers is quite consistent with the level of information that may be generated from the laboratory analyses that are commonly used by nutritional researchers for the same purpose. Of the two distinct indigenous knowledge systems from Nepal used, one (obanopan) appeared to relate to digestibility of tree fodder (as predicted by an in vitro test) and the other (posilopan) that was perceived as an indicator of general nutritional quality may relate to the ability of a tree fodder to promote the supply of protein at the duodenum. However, the relationship between obanopan and in vitro digestibility indicated that Nepalese farmers, in preferring to use obano fodder, also preferred less digestible fodder due to its ability to fill animals in times of feed shortage. This observation – and the fact that recommendations derived from a panel of nutritionists viewing a set of laboratory indicators describing the tree fodder studied did not appear to account, in any way, for the posilopan criterion, judged important by farmers – highlight the paramount importance of interpreting nutritional information against farmers objectives for a given set of circumstances. An initial analysis of complementarity between the information provided by farmers' perceptions of fodder quality and those generated in a laboratory would appear encouraging for a more integrated approach to assessing fodder quality for the smallholder farmer.

N-terminal protein sequencing of purified lectins from four different Sphenostyles accessions shows that the four polypeptides have largely identical amino acid sequences. The sequences contain the conserved consensus sequence F-F–LILG characteristic of legume lectins, as well as Phaseolus vulgaris proteins in the arcelin-α-amylase inhibitor gene family.

Although increases are reported for all plantations sizes, half of the seized plantations contain less than 50 plants. In this study, factors and variables that influence costs and benefits of indoor cannabis cultivation are investigated as well as how these costs and benefits vary between different cannabis grower types. Methods Real-situation data of four growers were used to perform financial analyses. Costs included fixed and variable material costs, as well as opportunity costs. Gross revenue per grow cycle was calculated based on most recent forensic findings for illicit Belgian cannabis plantations and was adjusted for the risk of getting caught. Finally, gross revenues and return on costs (ROC) were calculated over 1 year (4 cycles). Findings Financial analysis shows that in all cases gross revenues as well as \{ROC\} are considerable, even after a single growth cycle. Highest profitability was found for large-scale (600 plants, \{ROC\} = 6.8) and mid-scale plantations (150 plants, \{ROC\} = 6.0). However, industrial plantations (23,000 plants, \{ROC\} = 1.4) and micro-scale plantations (5 plants, \{ROC\} = 2.8) are also highly remunerative. Shift of police focus away from micro-scale growers, least likely to be involved in criminal gangs, to large-scale and industrial scale plantations would influence costs as a result of changing risks of getting caught. However, sensitivity analysis shows that this does not significantly influence the conclusions on profitability of different types of indoor cannabis growers. Conclusion Seizure and confiscation of profits are important elements in the integral and integrated policy approach required for tackling illicit indoor cannabis plantations. The large return of costs evidenced in the present study, underpin the policy relevance of confiscating those illicit profits as part of enforcement. "

The panicle weight (PW), PW/total plant weight (PW/TW), number of fertile spikelets (FS), and FS/total number of spikelets per panicle (FS/TS) of the \{INLs\} increased, while the culm weight (CW) and panicle number (PN) decreased. Most \{INLs\} produced more dry matter in the \{UP\} than in the \{IL\} culture. The \{INLs\} were clustered into three groups (A–C) according to their traits in the \{UP\} culture, and four groups (I–IV) according to their traits in the \{IL\} culture. They were then sorted into six groups (A-I, A-II, B-II, B-III, C-III, and C-IV) according to the relationships between culture conditions. The \{INLs\} of group A-II had increased panicle length (PL), PW, PW/TW, FS, and TS, and these traits were stable in both \{IL\} and \{UP\} culture. In the other groups, the trait values changed with the conditions and season. Association analyses using trait phenotype and genotype data of \{SSR\} markers detected 166 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for 10 traits, distributed on all chromosomes except 3 and 10. Of these, 81 \{QTLs\} for DH, CL, PL, CW, PW, PW/TW, PN, FS, TS, and FS/TS were newly detected. The \{INLs\} were characterized under different conditions, and dramatic trait modifications in \{IR64\} rice were associated with these QTLs, through introgression from the donor cultivars. Thus, these \{INLs\} and \{QTLs\} will be useful in genetic studies to identify the gene(s) that modified IR64, and as breeding materials for genetic improvement of Indica-type cultivars. "

We focused the analysis on two types of change: (1) changes in the location of ecosystem services provisioning areas and (2) changes in the stock of ecosystem services. The focal ecosystem services include services such as provision of food, raw materials and medicinal resources. Results from the study show that in the past two decades the demand for food and raw materials has intensified and, as a result, locations of provisioning areas and the stocks of ecosystem services have changed. We found anecdotal evidence that these changes correlate well with socio-economic factors such as greater need for income generation, change in livelihood practices and consumption patterns. We discuss the use of participatory mapping techniques in the context of marginalized and data-poor regions. We also show how this kind of information can strengthen existing ecosystem-based management strategies used by indigenous peoples in the Colombian Amazon. "

Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric analysis revealed 24 and 33 fungal metabolites in kunu-zaki and pito respectively, and their cereal inputs. Among the metabolites were 12 mycotoxins (alternariol, alternariolmethylether, beauvericin, deoxynivalenol, enniatin A and B, fumonisin \{B1\} (FB1), \{FB2\} and FB3, fusaproliferin, moniliformin and zearalenone). Mycotoxin levels were higher in the maize-based kunu-zaki (&lt;LOQ–123 μg/kg) and its cereal ingredients (0.1–31,200 μg/kg) than in the sorghum-based pito (&lt;LOQ–5 μg/kg) and its cereal base (1.2–85 μg/kg) respectively.

Oryza glaberrima the cultivated rice species that originated from West Africa is well-adapted to its growing ecologies. The aim of this study was to identify the promising O. glaberrima accessions tolerant to Fe toxicity from the 2106 accessions held at the AfricaRice gene bank. The screenings were conducted over a four-year period and involved evaluating the entries under Fe-toxic field conditions in West Africa, selecting good yielding accessions and repeating the testing with newly selected lines. Three accessions (TOG 7206, \{TOG\} 6218-B and \{TOG\} 7250-A) were higher yielding than O. sativa checks under stress but with similar yields under control conditions. These accessions yielded over 300 g/m2 under both Fe toxicity and control conditions. In conclusion, these materials could be used as donors in breeding programs for developing high yielding rice varieties suited to Fe toxicity affected areas in West Africa. "

Agricultural production is highly vulnerable even to 2C (low-end) predictions for global mean temperatures in 2100, with major implications for rural poverty and for both rural and urban food security. Agriculture also presents untapped opportunities for mitigation, given the large land area under crops and rangeland, and the additional mitigation potential of aquaculture. This paper presents a summary of current knowledge on options to support farmers, particularly smallholder farmers, in achieving food security through agriculture under climate change. Actions towards adaptation fall into two broad overlapping areas: (1) accelerated adaptation to progressive climate change over decadal time scales, for example integrated packages of technology, agronomy and policy options for farmers and food systems, and (2) better management of agricultural risks associated with increasing climate variability and extreme events, for example improved climate information services and safety nets. Maximization of agriculture's mitigation potential will require investments in technological innovation and agricultural intensification linked to increased efficiency of inputs, and creation of incentives and monitoring systems that are inclusive of smallholder farmers. Food systems faced with climate change need urgent, broad-based action in spite of uncertainties. "

Although it is well known that the frequent occurrence of dense fog is a common climatic characteristic of cloud forests around the world, it is poorly understood how fog processes shape and influence these ecosystems. Our study focuses on the physical characteristics of fog and quantifies the fogwater input to elfin cloud forest using direct eddy covariance net flux measurements during a 43-day period in 2002. We used an ultrasonic anemometer–thermometer in combination with a size-resolving cloud droplet spectrometer capable of providing number counts in 40 droplet size classes at a rate of 12.5 times per second. Fog occurred during 85% of the time, and dense fog with a visibility &lt; 200 m persisted during 74% of the period. Fog droplet size depended linearly on liquid water content ( r 2 = 0.89 ) with a volume-weighted mean diameter of 13.8  μ m. Due to the high frequency of occurrence of fog the total fogwater deposition measured with the eddy covariance method and corrected for condensation and advection effects in the persistent up-slope air flow, averaged 4.36 mm day−1, rainfall during the same period was 28 mm day−1. Thus, our estimates of the contribution of fogwater to the hydrological budget of elfin cloud forests is considerable and higher than in any other location for which comparable data exist but still not a very large component in the hydrological budget. For estimating fogwater fluxes for locations without detailed information about fog droplet distributions we provide simple empirical relationships using visibility data. "

Microscopic evidence of trypanosomes of the congolense group (sub-genus Nannomonas) was found in 0.8% of the animals (8/970) and in two cases the species identified was confirmed by \{PCR\} as Trypanosoma congolense savannah type. Non-pathogenic Trypanosoma theileri were detected in 3.2% (31/970) of the samples using the Dark Ground-Buffy Coat (DG-BC) technique. For survey 1 (S1), detection of antibodies (Ab-ELISA) against pathogenic trypanosomes indicated a seroprevalence of 14.2% (68/480). Of the samples, either \{DG\} positive or with a \{PCV\} lower then 25, examined by PCR, a total of 8.4% (5/59) (selected from 970 samples), were found positive for T. congolense. The low prevalence of pathogenic trypanosomes on Mafia Island is intriguing, especially in view of the omnipresence of the tsetse fly Glossina brevipalpis. Although the presence of detected trypanosomal antibodies does not necessarily indicate a current infection, the combination of serological/parasitological examinations and the results of the \{PCR\} do support this low prevalence of trypanosomosis in cattle. Despite the low prevalence, pathogenic trypanosomes are present on Mafia Island and possible reasons for this low infection rate, taking account of the relation between Glossina species present, transmission risk and trypanosomes found in cattle, are discussed also in view of a future appropriate intervention strategy.

To understand the events that occur in soil after the addition of different organic amendments, we evaluated the nitrogen (N) mineralization dynamics in soil after adding organic amendments, and evaluated changes in the microbial population. The four organic amendments were fresh dairy cattle manure, fresh white clover, vegetable, fruit, and yard waste compost, and poplar tree compost. The N mineralization potential of each organic amendment was determined by analyzing total mineral nitrogen during a 97-day laboratory incubation experiment. Soils amended with clover released 240 μg N g−1 soil during the 97-day incubation, more than twice as much as that released from soils amended with manure or composts (76–100 μg N g−1 soil). At the end of the incubation, the net N mineralization in clover-amended soils was 54%, more than five times higher than that in soils amended with composts or manure (4%–9%). Nitrogen was mineralized faster in clover-amended soil (1.056 μg N g−1 soil day−1) than in soil amended with composts (0.361–0.417 μg N g−1 soil day−1). The microbial biomass carbon content was higher in clover-amended soil than in the soils amended with manure or composts. We monitored changes in the microbial population in amended soils by a phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. On day 97, there were higher concentrations of total \{PLFAs\} in soils with organic amendments (e.g., 14.41 nmol g−1 in clover-amended soil) than in control soil without amendments (9.84 nmol g−1). Bacteria (Gram-positive and Gram-negative), actinomycetes, and fungi were more abundant in clover-amended soils than soils amended with manure or composts. The N mineralization potential varied among the four organic amendments. Therefore, the timing of application and the type of organic amendment should be matched to the nutrient needs of the crop. "

A comparison of the sequence of \{PHY7\} phytase gene of M. jalaludinii with various microbial phytase gene sequences showed that it was not similar to those from other bacteria except Selenomonas ruminatium, thus suggesting that they may both express a new class of phytase. The \{PHY7\} phytase gene was subsequently subcloned into bacterial expression vector, pET32a, for expression in Escherichia coli strain Rosetta-gami. Expression of the recombinant phytase gene was optimised and characterised. The recombinant phytase was estimated to be approximately 55 kDa by SDS-PAGE analysis. The recombinant phytase exhibited optimum activity at 55°C, pH 4.5 and showed good pH stability from pH 3.5 to 5.5 (&gt;78% relative activity). Metal ions such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ were found to exert significant stimulatory effect on the recombinant phytase activity while Cu2+, Fe3+, and Zn2+ greatly inhibited the enzyme activity. The recombinant phytase showed moderate resistance to trypsin proteolysis, but susceptible to pepsin proteolysis. The results of the study showed that several characteristics of recombinant phytase were slightly different from the native enzyme. Unfavourable characteristics such as reduced pH stability and metal ion effects should be taken into consideration during feed enzyme formulation. "

Although there were significant differences in isolate morphology, all conformed to the known range for P. sorghi. Mean conidial length × width ranged from 21–23 μm × 16·9–19·2 μm, and mean conidiophore length (basal cell-branching) ranged from 116·3–135·6 μm. All isolates sporulated in the range 14–26°C (optimal at 16–23°), although one isolate from maize from Umbeluzi in Mozambique had a broader optimal range for sporulation (12–25°). Conidia of all isolates germinated between 10° and 34°. Germ-tube response to temperature was similar for all isolates (10–34°). The isolates varied in their pathogenicity towards sorghum cultivars, with an isolate from Rwanda being pathogenic to more sorghum differentials than any other. Cluster analysis of isolates based on host reaction indicated five groups at the 85% similarity level. The existence of pathogenic variability has ramifications for the breeding of sorghum for resistance to downy mildew in Africa. "

The sequence identity between the PfPrx-1 and the previously reported 1-Cys Prx of P. falciparum (PfPrx-2), which corresponded to mammalian type \{VI\} Prx, was 25%. This suggests that the parasite possesses two Prx subfamilies. The PfPrx-1 showed significant sequence similarities with those of 2-Cys peroxiredoxins of plants in the \{BLASTX\} search. This may reflect the consequences of a genetic transfer from an algal endosymbiont to the parasite nucleus during evolution. The recombinant PfPrx-1 protein (rPfPrx-1) was expressed as a histidine fusion protein in Escherichia coli and purified with Ni chromatography. The rPfPrx-1 existed as dimers under non-reducing conditions and dissociated into monomers in the presence of dithiothreitol. The PfPrx-1 protein also exists as a dimer in the parasites themselves. The reduction of the oxidized enzyme by the donation of electrons from E. coli thioredoxin (Trx)/Trx reductase system was demonstrated in its reaction with H2O2, using the rPfPrx-1 protein. These results suggested that the PfPrx-1 can act as a terminal peroxidase of the parasite Trx system. An elevated expression of the PfPrx-1 protein seen in the trophozoite, the stage with active metabolism, suggests an association of the parasite Trx system with its intracellular redox control. "

These mycotoxin biomarkers were present in samples from all age categories, suggestive of chronic (lifetime) exposures. Rough estimates of mycotoxin intake suggested some exposures were higher than the tolerable daily intake. Overall, rural consumer populations from Nasarawa were more exposed to several mixtures of mycotoxins in their diets relative to those from Kaduna as shown by food and urine biomarker data.

The extraction yield of triglycerides (TG) and fatty acid (FA) compositions were significantly influenced by the concentration of polar cosolvents. The SC–CO2 extraction efficiency was increased with cosolvent significantly. Ethanol was found to be the best cosolvent for cocoa butter extraction using SC–CO2 followed by isopropanol and acetone. The triglycerides of 1,3-dipalmitoyl-2-oleoylglycerol (POP), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-stearoyl-glycerol (POS) and 1,3-distearoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol (SOS) were contained in the extracted cocoa butter with \{POS\} being the major component. Where palmitic, stearic and oleic were the main fatty acids in the cocoa butter samples, with stearic being the highest component. The lower molecular weight (MW) of \{TGs\} and \{FAs\} showed the higher selectivity compared to the high \{MW\} of \{TGs\} and FAs. Thus, they were fractionated during the first stage of SC–CO2 process. Industrial relevance The cocoa butter was successfully extracted from cocoa liquor by SC–CO2 at 35 MPa, 60 °C and 2 mL/min using different concentrations of polar cosolvents (ethanol, isopropanol and acetone). The extraction yield was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) influenced by the concentration of polar cosolvents. Similarly, polar cosolvent concentration had significant (p &lt; 0.05) effects on the \{TG\} and \{FA\} compositions. Ethanol was found to be the most efficient polar cosolvent for cocoa butter extraction compared to isopropanol and acetone. \{POS\} (42.2–45.9%) being the major triglycerdies component, followed by \{SOS\} (27.6–31.4%) and \{POP\} (20.3–22.7). Palmitic, stearic and oleic acids were the main fatty acids in the extracted cocoa butter, with stearic being the highest (34.9-37.8%), followed by oleic (30.3-31.8%) and palmitic (28.3-30.0%) acids, respectively. The choice of modifiers becomes a great challenge and ethanol was shown to be the best polar cosolvent, and it enhanced the solubility during the cocoa butter extraction by SC–CO2. This method can be feasibly implemented in the cocoa industry for the production of high quality cocoa butter. "

Method A total of 240 V. cholerae El Tor, \{O1\} strains, isolated from patients with cholera in Thailand during two different periods, i.e. 1999–2000 (200 strains; 193 Ogawa and 7 Inaba) and 2001–2002 (40 strains; all Inaba), were analyzed for the presence of virulence genes, namely ctxA, ctxB, zot, ace, toxR, tcpA, hlyA, nanH and ninT by PCR. For ribotyping, genomic \{DNA\} segments of the 240 strains and 10 reference V. cholerae strains isolated before 1999 from Thailand and elsewhere were digested with BglI endonuclease, subjected to a 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted onto a nylon membrane and probed with enzyme-labeled Escherichia coli rRNA. The \{DNA\} bands were visualized by autoradiography. Results Genes encoding the A and B subunits of CT, Zot, Ace, ToxR, TcpA, HlyA, NanH and NinT could be amplified from all of the 10 V. cholerae \{O1\} reference strains and from 239 of the 240 studied isolates. One Inaba isolate of 2001–2002 gave only amplicons of toxR and hlyA. For ribotyping, the 10 reference strains revealed six different patterns designated A to F. None of the 240 strains isolated in Thailand during the two periods had the A–C, E and F ribotypes. The isolates of 1999–2000 revealed ribotype D and three other ribotypes, designated G, H and I. The majority of the isolates of 2001–2002 showed ribotype G. The remaining showed other new ribotypes, J and K. Conclusions The clinical V. cholerae isolates of two epidemics from Thailand showed a sustained appearance of one epidemic V. cholerae clone, and a constant, but gradual and minor change in the genetic constituent of the other V. cholerae strains as indicated by the change of the ribotypes of the strains in the two study periods. Moreover, we found that a V. cholerae strain which cannot produce CT, Zot, Ace, TcpA, NanH and NinT can still cause symptomatic cholera. "

Thus, monitoring E. coli concentrations is critical to evaluate current conditions, determine restoration effectiveness, and inform model development and calibration. An often overlooked component of these monitoring and modeling activities is understanding the inherent random and systematic uncertainty present in measured data. In this research, a review and subsequent analysis was performed to identify, document, and analyze measurement uncertainty of E. coli data collected in stream flow and stormwater runoff as individual discrete samples or throughout a single runoff event. Data on the uncertainty contributed by sample collection, sample preservation/storage, and laboratory analysis in measured E. coli concentrations were compiled and analyzed, and differences in sampling method and data quality scenarios were compared. The analysis showed that: (1) manual integrated sampling produced the lowest random and systematic uncertainty in individual samples, but automated sampling typically produced the lowest uncertainty when sampling throughout runoff events; (2) sample collection procedures often contributed the highest amount of uncertainty, although laboratory analysis introduced substantial random uncertainty and preservation/storage introduced substantial systematic uncertainty under some scenarios; and (3) the uncertainty in measured E. coli concentrations was greater than that of sediment and nutrients, but the difference was not as great as may be assumed. This comprehensive analysis of uncertainty in E. coli concentrations measured in streamflow and runoff should provide valuable insight for designing E. coli monitoring projects, reducing uncertainty in quality assurance efforts, regulatory and policy decision making, and fate and transport modeling.

This study was conducted in the highlands of western Kenya, a region with high potential for agroforestry, with the objectives of assessing current biodiversity and aboveground C stocks in perennial vegetation growing on farmland, and estimating C sequestration potential in aboveground C pools. Allometric models were developed to estimate aboveground biomass of trees and hedgerows, and an inventory of perennial vegetation was conducted in 35 farms in Vihiga and Siaya districts. Values of the Shannon index (H), used to evaluate biodiversity, ranged from 0.01 in woodlots through 0.4–0.6 in food crop plots, to 1.3–1.6 in homegardens. Eucalyptus saligna was the most frequent tree species found as individual trees (20%), in windrows (47%), and in woodlots (99%) in Vihiga and the most frequent in woodlots (96%) in Siaya. Trees represented the most important C pool in aboveground biomass of perennial plants growing on-farm, contributing to 81 and 55% of total aboveground farm C in Vihiga and Siaya, respectively, followed by hedgerows (13 and 39%, respectively) and permanent crop stands (5 and 6%, respectively). Most of the tree C was located in woodlots in Vihiga (61%) and in individual trees growing in or around food crop plots in Siaya (57%). The homegardens represented the second C pool in importance, with 25 and 33% of C stocks in Vihiga and Siaya, respectively. Considering the mean total aboveground C stocks observed, and taking the average farm sizes of Vihiga (0.6 ha) and Siaya (1.4 ha), an average farm would store 6.5 ± 0.1 Mg C farm−1 in Vihiga and 12.4 ± 0.1 Mg C farm−1 in Siaya. At both sites, the C sequestration potential in perennial aboveground biomass was estimated at ca. 16 Mg C ha−1. With the current market price for carbon, the implementation of Clean Development Mechanism Afforestation/Reforestation (CDM A/R) projects seems unfeasible, due to the large number of small farms (between 140 and 300) necessary to achieve a critical land area able to compensate the concomitant minimum transaction costs. Higher financial compensation for C sequestration projects that encourage biodiversity would allow clearer win–win scenarios for smallholder farmers. Thus, a better valuation of ecosystem services should encourage C sequestration together with on-farm biodiversity when promoting \{CDM\} A/R projects. "

We argue first that the reductions in water hyacinth on Lake Victoria were ultimately caused by the widespread and significant damage to plants by Neochetina spp., although this process was increased by the stormy weather associated with the El Niño event; second that increased waves and current on Lake Victoria caused by El Niño redistributed water hyacinth plants around the lake; and third that a major lake-wide resurgence of water hyacinth plants on Lake Victoria has not occurred and will not occur unless the weevil populations are disrupted. We conclude that the population crash of water hyacinth on Lake Victoria would not have occurred in the absence of the weevils, but that it may have been hastened by stormy weather associated with the El Niño event.

Zoonotic disease organisms include those that are endemic in human populations or enzootic in animal populations with frequent cross-species transmission to people. Some of these diseases have only emerged recently. Together, these organisms are responsible for a substantial burden of disease, with endemic and enzootic zoonoses causing about a billion cases of illness in people and millions of deaths every year. Emerging zoonoses are a growing threat to global health and have caused hundreds of billions of \{US\} dollars of economic damage in the past 20 years. We aimed to review how zoonotic diseases result from natural pathogen ecology, and how other circumstances, such as animal production, extraction of natural resources, and antimicrobial application change the dynamics of disease exposure to human beings. In view of present anthropogenic trends, a more effective approach to zoonotic disease prevention and control will require a broad view of medicine that emphasises evidence-based decision making and integrates ecological and evolutionary principles of animal, human, and environmental factors. This broad view is essential for the successful development of policies and practices that reduce probability of future zoonotic emergence, targeted surveillance and strategic prevention, and engagement of partners outside the medical community to help improve health outcomes and reduce disease threats.

In areas where rainfall is the limiting factor for primary production, recovery of primary and secondary production after the dry season depends on soil type. On sandy soils a large fraction of rainfall infiltrates and becomes available for plant growth, stimulating fast herbage growth, while on clayey and loamy soils low infiltration rates generate runoff, leading to slower herbage growth rates. The very different moisture retention characteristic of sands and clays is another possible cause for the observed differences in growth rates. In this paper we investigate the herbage growth rate from the onset of the rainy season. We hypothesise that, in areas where rainfall is the limiting factor for primary production, the vegetation growth rate on clayey soils is lower than that on sandy soils. We will test this hypothesis using long-term rainfall, soil types and satellite derived normalised difference vegetation index data. This research shows that the growth rates on sandy soil are significantly greater than that on clayey soils during the early part of the rainy season. We also show that these differences can be detected at large scales using satellite imagery. We also conclude that, at this scale, movement strategies of pastoralists would be intrinsically linked to not only rainfall patterns and distribution, but also to the underlying soil types in the region as this affects the quality and quantity of fodder available.

The use of crop wild relatives (CWR) in pigeonpea breeding has been successful in providing important resistance, quality, and breeding efficiency traits to the crop. Current breeding objectives for pigeonpea include increasing its tolerance to abiotic stresses, including heat, cold, drought, and waterlogging. Here we assess the potential for pigeonpea \{CWR\} to be further employed in crop improvement by compiling wild species occurrence and ex situ conservation information, producing geographic distribution models for the species, identifying gaps in the comprehensiveness of current germplasm collections, and using ecogeographic information to identify \{CWR\} populations with the potential to contribute agronomic traits of priority to breeders. The fifteen prioritized relatives of pigeonpea generally occur in South and Southeast Asia to Australia, with the highest concentrations of species in southern India and northern Australia. These taxa differ considerably among themselves and in comparison to the crop in their adaptations to temperature, precipitation and edaphic conditions. We find that these wild genetic resources are broadly under-represented in ex situ conservation systems, with 80% of species assessed as high priority for further collecting, thus their availability to plant breeders is insufficient. We identify species and highlight geographic locations for further collecting in order to improve the completeness of pigeonpea \{CWR\} germplasm collections, with particular emphasis on potential traits for abiotic stress tolerance.

Updated costs were derived for five intervention techniques: trypanocides, targets, insecticide-treated cattle, aerial spraying and the release of sterile males. Two strategies were considered: continuous control and elimination. For mapping the costs, cattle densities, environmental constraints, and the presence of savannah or riverine tsetse species were taken into account. These were combined with maps of potential benefits to produce maps of benefit-cost ratios. The results illustrate a diverse picture, and they clearly indicate that no single technique or strategy is universally profitable. For control using trypanocide prophylaxis, returns are modest, even without accounting for the risk of drug resistance but, in areas of low cattle densities, this is the only approach that yields a positive return. Where cattle densities are sufficient to support it, the use of insecticide-treated cattle stands out as the most consistently profitable technique, widely achieving benefit-cost ratios above 5. In parts of the high-potential areas such as the mixed farming, high-oxen-use zones of western Ethiopia, the fertile crescent north of Lake Victoria and the dairy production areas in western and central Kenya, all tsetse control strategies achieve benefit-cost ratios from 2 to over 15, and for elimination strategies, ratios from 5 to over 20. By contrast, in some areas, notably where cattle densities are below 20 per km2, the costs of interventions against tsetse match or even outweigh the benefits, especially for control scenarios using aerial spraying or the deployment of targets where both savannah and riverine flies are present. If the burden of human African trypanosomosis were factored in, the benefit-cost ratios of some of the low-return areas would be considerably increased. Comparatively, elimination strategies give rise to higher benefit-cost ratios than do those for continuous control. However, the costs calculated for elimination assume problem-free, large scale operations, and they rest on the outputs of entomological models that are difficult to validate in the field. Experience indicates that the conditions underlying successful and sustained elimination campaigns are seldom met. By choosing the most appropriate thresholds for benefit-cost ratios, decision-makers and planners can use the maps to define strategies, assist in prioritising areas for intervention, and help choose among intervention techniques and approaches. The methodology would have wider applicability in analysing other disease constraints with a strong spatial component. "

abstract = "Rapid changes in land use, food systems, and livelihoods require social–ecological systems that keep multiple options open and prepare for future unpredictability. Sustainagility refers to the properties and assets of a system that sustain the ability (agility) of agents to adapt and meet their needs in new ways. In contrast, sustainability tends to invoke persistence along current trajectories, and the resilience to return to current baselines. With three examples, the use and conservation of agrobiodiversity is explored along temporal, spatial, and human institutional scales for its role in sustainagility: first, farmers’ seed systems; second, complex pollination systems; and third, wildlife conservation in agricultural areas with high poverty. Incentives are necessary if agrobiodiversity is to provide benefits to future generations. "

abstract = "Abstract A number of international donors, national governments and project proponents have begun to lay the groundwork for REDD+, but tenure insecurity – including the potential risks of land grabbing by outsiders and loss of local user rights to forests and forest land – is one of the main reasons that many indigenous and other local peoples have publicly opposed it. Under what conditions is REDD+ a threat to local rights, and under what conditions does it present an opportunity? This article explores these issues based on available data from a global comparative study on REDD+, led by the Center for International Forestry Research, which is studying national policies and processes in 12 countries and 23 REDD+ projects in 6 countries. The article analyses how tenure concerns are being addressed at both national and project level in emerging REDD+ programs. The findings suggest that in most cases REDD+ has clearly provided some new opportunities for securing local tenure rights, but that piecemeal interventions by project proponents at the local level are insufficient in the absence of broader, national programs for land tenure reform. The potential for substantial changes in the status quo appear unlikely, though Brazil – the only one with such a national land tenure reform program – offers useful insights. Land tenure reform – the recognition of customary rights in particular – and a serious commitment to REDD+ both challenge the deep-rooted economic and political interests of ‘business as usual’. "

We used geostatistical modelling to produce high-resolution risk estimates of infection with Schistosoma spp and of the number of doses of praziquantel treatment needed to prevent morbidity at different administrative levels in 44 countries. Methods We did a systematic review to identify surveys including schistosomiasis prevalence data in sub-Saharan Africa via PubMed, \{ISI\} Web of Science, and African Journals Online, from inception to May 2, 2014, with no restriction of language, survey date, or study design. We used Bayesian geostatistical meta-analysis and rigorous variable selection to predict infection risk over a grid of 1 155 818 pixels at 5 × 5 km, on the basis of environmental and socioeconomic predictors and to calculate the number of doses of praziquantel needed for prevention of morbidity. Findings The literature search identified Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma mansoni surveys done in, respectively, 9318 and 9140 unique locations. Infection risk decreased from 2000 onwards, yet estimates suggest that 163 million (95% Bayesian credible interval [CrI] 155 million to 172 million; 18·5%, 17·6–19·5) of the sub-Saharan African population was infected in 2012. Mozambique had the highest prevalence of schistosomiasis in school-aged children (52·8%, 95% CrI 48·7–57·8). Low-risk countries (prevalence among school-aged children lower than 10%) included Burundi, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, and Rwanda. The numbers of doses of praziquantel needed per year were estimated to be 123 million (95% CrI 121 million to 125 million) for school-aged children and 247 million (239 million to 256 million) for the entire population.

Model improvements can improve the accuracy of simulations and reduce the uncertainty of climate change impact assessments. Furthermore, they can reduce the number of models needed in a MME. Herein, 15 wheat growth models of a larger \{MME\} were improved through re-parameterization and/or incorporating or modifying heat stress effects on phenology, leaf growth and senescence, biomass growth, and grain number and size using detailed field experimental data from the \{USDA\} Hot Serial Cereal experiment (calibration data set). Simulation results from before and after model improvement were then evaluated with independent field experiments from a \{CIMMYT\} world-wide field trial network (evaluation data set). Model improvements decreased the variation (10th to 90th model ensemble percentile range) of grain yields simulated by the \{MME\} on average by 39% in the calibration data set and by 26% in the independent evaluation data set for crops grown in mean seasonal temperatures &gt;24 °C. \{MME\} mean squared error in simulating grain yield decreased by 37%. A reduction in \{MME\} uncertainty range by 27% increased \{MME\} prediction skills by 47%. Results suggest that the mean level of variation observed in field experiments and used as a benchmark can be reached with half the number of models in the MME. Improving crop models is therefore important to increase the certainty of model-based impact assessments and allow more practical, i.e. smaller \{MMEs\} to be used effectively. "

Our results show that 5% (210 km2) of evergreen forest and 43% (2060 km2) of miombo woodland was lost in the Eastern Arc Mountains between 1975 and 2000. Important predictors of habitat conversion included distance to natural habitat edge, topography and measures of remoteness. The main conservation strategy in these mountains for the past 100 years has been to develop a network of protected areas. These appear to have reduced rates of habitat loss and most remaining evergreen forest is now within protected areas. However, the majority of miombo woodland, an important source of ecosystem services, lies outside formal protected areas, where additional conservation strategies may be needed. "

Although this country is one of the most important rice exporters worldwide, a comprehensive picture of the occurrence of M. graminicola in Vietnamese rice fields is still not available. Therefore a nematode survey was carried out with the aim of better understanding the geographical distribution, and the pathogenic and genetic variability of the \{RKN\} in Vietnam. From the fields surveyed in a range of ecosystems, 21 \{RKN\} populations were recovered from infected rice roots. A diagnostic \{SCAR\} marker was developed showing that all Vietnamese populations belong to M. graminicola. Furthermore, sequencing of the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) of the rDNA genes confirmed this identification. These populations were then characterised using morphometrics and pathogenicity tests (host plant range diversity, reproduction and virulence diversity) revealing intraspecific variability. We showed that morphometric traits are mainly genetically heritable characters with significant differences among the studied populations. Finally, a distinctive trait signature was found for the populations isolated from the upland rice cultures. All together, our study reveals the prevalence of M. graminicola populations in Vietnamese rice. Further investigations need to be developed to explore the population dynamics and evolutionary history of this species in South East Asia. "

Soil-transmitted helminths (hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Trichuris trichiura) are the most widespread NTDs, but broad geographical analyses are scarce. We aimed to predict the spatial and temporal distribution of soil-transmitted helminth infections, including the number of infected people and treatment needs, across sub-Saharan Africa. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and African Journal Online from inception to Dec 31, 2013, without language restrictions, to identify georeferenced surveys. We extracted data from household surveys on sources of drinking water, sanitation, and women's level of education. Bayesian geostatistical models were used to align the data in space and estimate risk of with hookworm, A lumbricoides, and T trichiura over a grid of roughly 1 million pixels at a spatial resolution of 5 × 5 km. We calculated anthelmintic treatment needs on the basis of \{WHO\} guidelines (treatment of all school-aged children once per year where prevalence in this population is 20–50% or twice per year if prevalence is greater than 50%). Findings We identified 459 relevant survey reports that referenced 6040 unique locations. We estimate that the prevalence of hookworm, A lumbricoides, and T trichiura among school-aged children from 2000 onwards was 16·5%, 6·6%, and 4·4%. These estimates are between 52% and 74% lower than those in surveys done before 2000, and have become similar to values for the entire communities. We estimated that 126 million doses of anthelmintic treatments are required per year. Interpretation Patterns of soil-transmitted helminth infection in sub-Saharan Africa have changed and the prevalence of infection has declined substantially in this millennium, probably due to socioeconomic development and large-scale deworming programmes.

abstract = "Abstract Ensembles of process-based crop models are increasingly used to simulate crop growth for scenarios of temperature and/or precipitation changes corresponding to different projections of atmospheric \{CO2\} concentrations. This approach generates large datasets with thousands of simulated crop yield data. Such datasets potentially provide new information but it is difficult to summarize them in a useful way due to their structural complexities. An associated issue is that it is not straightforward to compare crops and to interpolate the results to alternative climate scenarios not initially included in the simulation protocols. Here we demonstrate that statistical models based on random-coefficient regressions are able to emulate ensembles of process-based crop models. An important advantage of the proposed statistical models is that they can interpolate between temperature levels and between \{CO2\} concentration levels, and can thus be used to calculate temperature and [CO2] thresholds leading to yield loss or yield gain, without re-running the original complex crop models. Our approach is illustrated with three yield datasets simulated by 19 maize models, 26 wheat models, and 13 rice models. Several statistical models are fitted to these datasets, and are then used to analyze the variability of the yield response to [CO2] and temperature. Based on our results, we show that, for wheat, a [CO2] increase is likely to outweigh the negative effect of a temperature increase of +2 °C in the considered sites. Compared to wheat, required levels of [CO2] increase are much higher for maize, and intermediate for rice. For all crops, uncertainties in simulating climate change impacts increase more with temperature than with elevated [CO2]. "

The dioxin content in duck meat sampled from supermarkets was also reported to be substantially higher than in products from other farm animals. Despite increased awareness of the potential for contamination and exposure to dioxins, the accumulation and elimination of dioxins in ducks have not been well characterized. In the present study, mule ducks were fed capsules containing polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) for 14 days and the trial was continued for another 28 days without PCDD/Fs supplementation. Ducks were sacrificed on the 14th, 28th, and 42nd days from the beginning of administration and samples of abdominal fat, breast, and liver tissue were obtained. The concentrations of PCDD/Fs were analyzed in the samples to investigate their distribution and elimination in various duck tissues. The bioaccumulation of PCDD/Fs in ducks was found to be tissue-dependent. In the abdominal fat, the bioconcentration factor was negatively correlated with the degree of chlorination. Conversely, more chlorinated PCDD/Fs (hexa- or hepta-congeners) were associated with higher bioconcentration in the liver and breast tissue. In terms of the efficiency of PCDD/Fs elimination, the liver was found to be the fastest, followed by the breast and the abdominal fat. The clearance rate positively correlated with the degree of chlorination, as determined by comparing the apparent elimination rate constant (k) of PCDD/Fs in various tissues. Overall, lower k values observed in this study imply that mule ducks have a reduced clearance of PCDD/Fs in comparison with layer and broiler chickens. "

In this context it would be imperative that released sterile tsetse flies are incompetent to transmit the disease-causing trypanosome parasite. Therefore, development of tsetse fly strains refractory to trypanosome infection is highly desirable as a simple and effective method of ensuring vector incompetence of the released flies. This new \{IAEA\} Coordinated Research Project (CRP) focuses on gaining a deeper knowledge of the tripartite interactions between the tsetse fly vectors, their symbionts and trypanosome parasites. The objective of this \{CRP\} is to acquire a better understanding of mechanisms that limit the development of trypanosome infections in tsetse and how these may be enhanced. "

That option seems far off for Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) where technology-driven productivity growth has largely failed. The article revisits this issue from a number of angles: current approaches to enlisting \{SSA\} smallholders in agricultural development; the history of the phenomenal productivity growth in the USA, The Netherlands and Green Revolution Asia; and the current framework conditions for \{SSA\} productivity growth. This analysis shows that (1) the development of an enabling institutional context was a necessary condition that preceded the phenomenal productivity growth in industrial and Green Revolution countries; and that (2) such a context is also present for successful \{SSA\} export crop production, but that (3) the context is pervasively biased against SSA’s smallholder food production. The article traces the origins of technology supply push (TSP) as a dominant paradigm that hinders recognition of the role of enabling institutions. The article then reviews the literature on institutional change and zooms in on Innovation Platforms (IPs) as a promising innovation system approach to such change. We describe the concrete experience with \{IP\} in the Sub-Sahara Challenge Program (SSA-CP) and in the Convergence of Sciences: Strengthening Innovation Systems (CoS-SIS) Program.

Each model simulated 1981–2010 grain yield, and we evaluate results against the interannual variability of growing season temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation. The amount of information used for calibration has only a minor effect on most models' climate response, and even small multi-model ensembles prove beneficial. Wheat model clusters reveal common characteristics of yield response to climate; however models rarely share the same cluster at all four sites indicating substantial independence. Only a weak relationship (R2 ≤ 0.24) was found between the models' sensitivities to interannual temperature variability and their response to long-term warming, suggesting that additional processes differentiate climate change impacts from observed climate variability analogs and motivating continuing analysis and model development efforts.

Little is known about the genetic makeup of P. falciparum populations, despite variation in genetic diversity being a key factor in morbidity, mortality, and the success of malaria control initiatives. Here we analyze a worldwide sample of 519 P. falciparum isolates sequenced for two housekeeping genes (63 single nucleotide polymorphisms from around 5000 nucleotides per isolate). We observe a strong negative correlation between within-population genetic diversity and geographic distance from sub-Saharan Africa (R2 = 0.95) over Africa, Asia, and Oceania. In contrast, regional variation in transmission intensity seems to have had a negligible impact on the distribution of genetic diversity. The striking geographic patterns of isolation by distance observed in P. falciparum mirror the ones previously documented in humans [4–7] and point to a joint sub-Saharan African origin between the parasite and its host. Age estimates for the expansion of P. falciparum further support that anatomically modern humans were infected prior to their exit out of Africa and carried the parasite along during their colonization of the world.

While production must increase in the coming decades to meet demand, such increases will be accompanied by diminished natural resources and rising production costs that will alter how rice is grown and managed. Such resource constraints are the impetus for the ongoing transition from traditional flooding and transplanting to direct-seeded rice (DSR). However, such a transition can result in an increase in pest pressures, especially weeds. Rice production can be particularly vulnerable to weed competition, with significant yield losses (i.e., &gt;50%) occurring. Among pernicious weeds, weedy (red) rice (Oryza sativa L.) is increasingly recognized as a major constraint in achieving maximum yield in DSR. Weedy rice is congeneric to crop rice with phenotypic similarity; hence, its ability to negatively influence qualitative and quantitative aspects of production is substantial. As rice will continue to serve as a cornerstone for future food security and sustainability, a comprehensive assessment of weedy rice impacts associated with increasing adoption of \{DSR\} is both timely and critical. In this chapter, we examine the biological basis for the competitive ability of weedy rice, including its evolution, ecophysiology, and genetics; quantify spatial–temporal shifts in its distribution and spread; and emphasize and outline a number of regional and global management strategies for its detection and control. Lastly, a number of critical research areas are suggested that deserve additional scrutiny with respect to weedy rice management. "

Mass rearing and changes in global climate may exacerbate disease and more efficient transmission of parasites in stressed or immune-deficient hosts. Further, human microsporidiosis appears to be adventitious and primarily associated with an increasing community of immune-deficient individuals.

However, these methods are under threat from, amongst other issues, the development of insecticide resistance and the practical difficulty of maintaining long-term community-wide efforts. The sterile insect technique (SIT), whose success hinges on having a good understanding of the biology and behaviour of the male mosquito, is an additional weapon in the limited arsenal against mosquito vectors. The successful production and release of sterile males, which is the mechanism of population suppression by SIT, relies on the release of mass-reared sterile males able to confer sterility in the target population by mating with wild females. A five year Joint FAO/IAEA Coordinated Research Project brought together researchers from around the world to investigate the pre-mating conditions of male mosquitoes (physiology and behaviour, resource acquisition and allocation, and dispersal), the mosquito mating systems and the contribution of molecular or chemical approaches to the understanding of male mosquito mating behaviour. A summary of the existing knowledge and the main novel findings of this group is reviewed here, and further presented in the reviews and research articles that form this Acta Tropica special issue.

Until now, probably the cleanest and the most efficient method of producing hydrogen has been MEC. However, this technology is still in its infancy period and poses various challenges towards up-scaling and widespread applications, such as such as lower hydrogen production rate (HPR), high internal resistance, complicated architecture, and expensive materials. New advances are needed in biofilm engineering, materials for electrodes and reactor configuration for successful real-world application of this technology. Thus, the present review deals with development of practical \{MEC\} technology and includes the following sections: firstly a general introduction to MECs; their operating principles, thermodynamics of MEC, and energy or voltage losses in the \{MEC\} system were provided. Followed by a section on the critical factors affecting \{MEC\} performance; microorganisms, anode, cathode, membrane or separator, fuel sources, the state-of-art \{MECs\} designs, other key operational factors, and its potential application in microbial production of value added products are discussed in detail. Afterwards, current challenges involved in developing practical \{MEC\} systems are highlighted, and outlooks for future development are also suggested. The review aims to assist researcher and engineers to gain fundamental understandings of MEC, and it also provides several future research directions and a road map on how to overcome the barriers, so the \{MEC\} technology can be further advanced and applied in larger scale.

Thus, it is essential to increase the efficiency in using water to ensure crop productivity. Quantifying crop water use (WU; i.e. actual evapotranspiration) is a critical step towards this goal. Here, sixteen wheat simulation models were used to quantify sources of model uncertainty and to estimate the relative changes and variability between models for simulated WU, water use efficiency (WUE, \{WU\} per unit of grain dry mass produced), transpiration efficiency (Teff, transpiration per kg of unit of grain yield dry mass produced), grain yield, crop transpiration and soil evaporation at increased temperatures and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations ([CO2]). The greatest uncertainty in simulating water use, potential evapotranspiration, crop transpiration and soil evaporation was due to differences in how crop transpiration was modelled and accounted for 50% of the total variability among models. The simulation results for the sensitivity to temperature indicated that crop \{WU\} will decline with increasing temperature due to reduced growing seasons. The uncertainties in simulated crop WU, and in particularly due to uncertainties in simulating crop transpiration, were greater under conditions of increased temperatures and with high temperatures in combination with elevated atmospheric [CO2] concentrations. Hence the simulation of crop WU, and in particularly crop transpiration under higher temperature, needs to be improved and evaluated with field measurements before models can be used to simulate climate change impacts on future crop water demand.

However, it is now known that cross infections can occur and authentication of identity based on the host animal species from which the strain was first isolated, is not valid and should be replaced with molecular techniques to allow unequivocal strain differentiation. To identify a diagnostic target for strain genotyping, the CaPV homologue of the Vaccinia virus \{E4L\} gene which encodes the 30 kDa DNA-dependant \{RNA\} polymerase subunit, \{RPO30\} was analyzed. Forty-six isolates from different hosts and geographical origins were included. Most CaPVs fit into one of the three different groups according to their host origins: the SPPV, the \{GTPV\} and the \{LSDV\} group. A unique 21-nucleotide deletion was found in all \{SPPV\} isolates which was exploited to develop a RPO30-based classical \{PCR\} test to differentiate \{SPPV\} from \{GTPV\} that will allow rapid differential diagnosis of disease during CaPV outbreaks in small ruminants.

Methods A total of 207 fly specimens were trapped in areas of Africa in which T. pallidum-induced skin ulcerations are common in wild baboons; 88 flies from Tarangire National Park and 119 from Lake Manyara National Park in Tanzania were analyzed by \{PCR\} for the presence of T. pallidum DNA. Findings We report that in the two study areas, T. pallidum \{DNA\} was found in 17–24% of wild-caught flies of the order Diptera. Treponemal \{DNA\} sequences obtained from many of the flies match sequences derived from nearby baboon T. pallidum strains, and one of the fly species with an especially high prevalence of T. pallidum DNA, Musca sorbens, has previously been shown to transmit yaws in an experimental setting. Interpretation Our results raise the possibility that flies play a role in yaws transmission; further research is warranted, given how important understanding transmission is for the eradication of this disfiguring disease.

abstract = "Abstract The financial benefit derived from nature-based tourism in the Eastern Arc Mountains (EAMs) of Tanzania has never been assessed. Here, we calculate the producer surplus (PS) related to expenditure on accommodation in the EAMs. This estimate is based on the number of visitor bed-nights collected from a representative sample of hotels, coupled with spatially explicit regression models to extrapolate visitor numbers to unsampled locations, and adjusted to account for how far visits were motivated by nature. The estimated annual \{PS\} of nature-based tourism is ~US$195,000. In order to evaluate the future impact of different forest management regimes on \{PS\} over a 25 year period, we compare two alternative scenarios of land use. Under a ‘hopeful expectations’ scenario of no forest loss from protected areas, the present value of \{PS\} from nature-based tourism is ~US$1.9 million, compared with US$1.6 million under a ‘business-as-usual’ scenario. Although the value of nature-based tourism to the \{EAMs\} is lower than that generated by Tanzania׳s large game reserves, these revenues, together with other ecosystem services provided by the area, such as carbon storage and water regulation, may enhance the case for sustainable forest management.

For the first time, the probability of extinction is determined for the world’s seagrass species under the Categories and Criteria of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Several studies have indicated that seagrass habitat is declining worldwide. Our focus is to determine the risk of extinction for individual seagrass species, a 4-year process involving seagrass experts internationally, compilation of data on species’ status, populations, and distribution, and review of the biology and ecology of each of the world’s seagrass species. Ten seagrass species are at elevated risk of extinction (14% of all seagrass species), with three species qualifying as Endangered. Seagrass species loss and degradation of seagrass biodiversity will have serious repercussions for marine biodiversity and the human populations that depend upon the resources and ecosystem services that seagrasses provide.

abstract = "SummaryBackground The eastern Mediterranean region is comprised of 22 countries: Afghanistan, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Since our Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010), the region has faced unrest as a result of revolutions, wars, and the so-called Arab uprisings. The objective of this study was to present the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors in the eastern Mediterranean region as of 2013. Methods \{GBD\} 2013 includes an annual assessment covering 188 countries from 1990 to 2013. The study covers 306 diseases and injuries, 1233 sequelae, and 79 risk factors. Our \{GBD\} 2013 analyses included the addition of new data through updated systematic reviews and through the contribution of unpublished data sources from collaborators, an updated version of modelling software, and several improvements in our methods. In this systematic analysis, we use data from \{GBD\} 2013 to analyse the burden of disease and injuries in the eastern Mediterranean region specifically. Findings The leading cause of death in the region in 2013 was ischaemic heart disease (90·3 deaths per 100 000 people), which increased by 17·2% since 1990. However, diarrhoeal diseases were the leading cause of death in Somalia (186·7 deaths per 100 000 people) in 2013, which decreased by 26·9% since 1990. The leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) was ischaemic heart disease for males and lower respiratory infection for females. High blood pressure was the leading risk factor for \{DALYs\} in 2013, with an increase of 83·3% since 1990. Risk factors for \{DALYs\} varied by country. In low-income countries, childhood wasting was the leading cause of \{DALYs\} in Afghanistan, Somalia, and Yemen, whereas unsafe sex was the leading cause in Djibouti. Non-communicable risk factors were the leading cause of \{DALYs\} in high-income and middle-income countries in the region. \{DALY\} risk factors varied by age, with child and maternal malnutrition affecting the younger age groups (aged 28 days to 4 years), whereas high bodyweight and systolic blood pressure affected older people (aged 60–80 years). The proportion of \{DALYs\} attributed to high body-mass index increased from 3·7% to 7·5% between 1990 and 2013. Burden of mental health problems and drug use increased. Most increases in DALYs, especially from non-communicable diseases, were due to population growth. The crises in Egypt, Yemen, Libya, and Syria have resulted in a reduction in life expectancy; life expectancy in Syria would have been 5 years higher than that recorded for females and 6 years higher for males had the crisis not occurred. Interpretation Our study shows that the eastern Mediterranean region is going through a crucial health phase. The Arab uprisings and the wars that followed, coupled with ageing and population growth, will have a major impact on the region's health and resources. The region has historically seen improvements in life expectancy and other health indicators, even under stress. However, the current situation will cause deteriorating health conditions for many countries and for many years and will have an impact on the region and the rest of the world. Based on our findings, we call for increased investment in health in the region in addition to reducing the conflicts. Funding Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. "
