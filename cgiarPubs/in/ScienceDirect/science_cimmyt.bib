abstract = "Abstract Crossing programs based on phenomics have resulted in a new generation of drought adapted wheat lines based on strategic crossing of complementary physiological traits (PT) that have been included in CIMMYT's international distribution system since 2010. New \{PT\} lines have shown superior performance over conventional material in most international environments. For example, in the 17th \{SAWYT\} the average yield of \{PT\} lines was larger than the group of conventionally bred lines at 75% of international sites. This ongoing effort has involved broadening the genetic base of conventional wheat genepools through extensive use of genetic resources, including landraces and products of inter-specific hybridization with members of the Triticeae tribe. One of the prerequisites for successful application of phenomics in breeding is the establishment of reliable screening tools and platforms that can precisely measure expression of physiological traits in realistic field environments. Genetic gains associated with selection for canopy temperature and spectral water indices have shown that such remotely sensed traits can serve as proxies that reliably estimate water relations characteristics impacting on yield. The first aerial remote sensing platforms for large scale genetic resource screening was developed at \{CIMMYT\} in Mexico and more than half of the accessions of the World Wheat Collection have been screened. These high throughput field phenotyping tools have application in gene discovery and \{QTL\} for both drought and heat adaptive traits have been identified on 4 different chromosomes of the Seri/Babax \{RILs\} population, showing for the first time a common genetic basis for these key abiotic stresses. Similarly the phenology- controlled ‘Wheat Association Mapping Initiative’ panel has been used for gene discovery work. To define the best constellation of traits for application in breeding -and determine priorities for genetic understanding- it is necessary to develop conceptual models of adaptive traits that highlight wheat's genetic limitations under water limitation; pre-breeding serves as a practical tool to test different models.

abstract = "Drought is a major source of grain yield instability in maize (Zea mays L.) grown in the lowland tropics, and use of cultivars with improved drought tolerance may be the only affordable option for many small-scale farmers. Eight cycles of full-sib recurrent selection were carried out in the population ‘Tuxpeño Sequía’ during the rain-free winter season at Tlaltizapán, Mexico, under controlled moisture stress timed to coincide either with flowering or grain-filling. Selection was based on an index comprising grain yield and physiological and morphological traits with presumed adaptive value under drought. The objectives of this study were to evaluate direct and correlated responses to selection in grain yield and its components, total biomass, and radiation-use efficiency (RUE). Cycles 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 of Tuxpeño Sequía, and a check cultivar representing the results of six cycles of selection based primarily on multilocation testing, were evaluated under three moisture regimes at Tlaltizapán during two consecutive winter seasons. Grain yield (GY) increased at 108 kg ha−1 cycle−1 across 12 yield environments ranging in yield potential from 1 to 8 Mg ha−1, with no significant interaction between gains and moisture environments. Yield gains resulted from an increase of 0.03 ears per plant (EPP) cycle−1 under drought, and small but significant increases in EPP, kernel number per ear and kernel weight in well-watered environments. Selection had no effect on biomass production, so yield increases were due to a gain in harvest index (HI) of 0.0058 to 0.0067 cycle−1 in either wet or dry environments. Seasonal readiation-use efficiency averaged 1.48 g MJ−1 \{PAR\} under well-watered conditions, a value lower than expected for maize. Although selection slightly reduced radiation interception and slightly increased \{RUE\} during the pre-anthesis phase, both changes were relatively unimportant. The regression of \{GY\} on biomass (B) (GY = −1.85 + 0.47B; \{R2\} = 0.94∗∗) predicted zero \{GY\} at biomass yields of less than 4 Mg ha−1. The check entry showed only limited progress in drought tolerance, EPP, HI, and GY. These results suggest that drought stress, when managed to coincide with flowering, can be an effective selection environment for increasing HI, yield stability, and \{GY\} of lowland tropical maize across a wide range of moisture environments.

Eight cycles of full-sib recurrent selection in the population ‘Tuxpeño Sequía’ were carried out with the objective of improving performance under moisture stress targeted to coincide with flowering and grain-filling. Selection was based on an index comprising increased grain yield, the maintenance of a constant number of days to 50% anthesis, reduced anthesis-silking interval (ASI, or days from 50% anthesis to 50% silking) and other drought-adaptive traits. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the direct and correlated selection responses in days to flower, ASI, and biomass of reproductive organs at anthesis. During two consecutive winter seasons, Cycles 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 of Tuxpeño Sequía and a check representing six cycles of international multilocation testing in the same population, were evaluated under three moisture regimes at Tlaltizapán, Mexico. Selection resulted in significant per cycle responses in days to 50% anthesis (−0.4 days or −0.5%), time to 50% silking (−3.4 days or −3.2%) and in \{ASI\} (−3.0 days or −16.1%) under drought. Comparable figures under well-watered conditions were −0.4 days or −0.5%, −0.8 days or −0.9%, and −0.4 days or −23.0%, respectively. Grain yield and its components, especially kernel number per plant, showed a strong statistical dependence upon ASI. The regression of best fit between grain yield and \{ASI\} across cultivars and moisture regimes showed that 76% of the variation in grain yield was accounted for by variation in ASI. Grain yield declined by an average of 8.7% day−1 increase in \{ASI\} up to 10 days. Selection resulted in a significant increase in ear biomass at 50% anthesis (EB) of 0.004 Mg ha−1 (14.7%) cycle−1, and a significant reduction in tassel biomass at 50% anthesis of −0.008 Mg ha−1 (−1.7%) cycle−1 under drought. Comparable figures under well-watered conditions, also significant, were 0.007 Mg ha−1 (14.7%) and −0.014 Mg ha−1 (−2.6%) cycle−1, respectively. \{ASI\} and the percentage biomass distributed to the tassel and ear at anthesis were not significantly affected by selection in the check entry. These data suggest that selection for reduced \{ASI\} under carefully managed moisture stress imposed at flowering provides an effective and rapid route to higher and more stable grain yield in lowland tropical maize.

abstract = "Selection for grain yield under severe drought stress has often been considered inefficient because the estimate of heritability of grain yield has been observed to decline as yields fall. Under these conditions secondary traits may increase selection efficiency, provided they have adaptive value, high heritability, and are easy to measure. Increased relative stem and leaf elongation rate (RLE), delayed foliar senescence, reduced canopy temperatures and reduced anthesis-silking interval (ASI) were used to augment efficiency of selection for grain yield under drought during eight cycles of recurrent fullsib selection in the lowland tropical maize (Zea mays L.) population, ‘Tuxpeño Sequía’. Six cultivars comprising Cycles 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 of Tuxpeño Sequía, and a check cultivar were grown for two consecutive years at Tlaltizapán, Mexico, under three moisture regimes that provided a well-watered control, a severe moisture stress during flowering, and a severe stress during grain-filling. Previous reports have documented significant improvements in grain yield and \{ASI\} in this population. When observed under drought, no significant differences were detected among cultivars in \{RLE\} or canopy-air temperature differentials, nor in chlorophyll per unit leaf area during grain-filling (an indicator of foliar senescence). Cultivars did not differ in seasonal pre-dawn or diurnal courses of leaf water potential, in leaf osmotic potential, in capacity to adjust osmotically, nor in their seasonal profiles of soil water content with depth to 140 cm. Selection significantly altered final plant height, total leaf number, and tassel primary branch number by −0.9%, −0.5% and −2.6% cycle−1, respectively. Observations on root growth in 2-m deep pots showed that eight cycles of selection had reduced root biomass in the upper 50 cm by 33%, consistent with a significant change of −1.2% cycle−1 in vertical root-pulling resistance. The lack of direct and correlated changes in traits related to plant water status due to selection suggests that in this population heritabilities of such traits are low, or that the traits are only weakly associated with grain yield under severe moisture stress. The present study indicates that improved drought tolerance in Tuxpeño Sequía was due to increased partitioning of biomass towards the developing ear during a severe drought stress that coincided with flowering, rather than to a change in plant water status.

Field research has identified that gendered vulnerability to climate change is intricately connected to local and macro level political economic processes. Rather than being a single driver of change, climate is one among several stresses on agriculture, alongside a broader set of non-climatic processes. While these pressures are linked to large scale political–economic processes, the response on the ground is mediated by the local level relations of class and caste, creating stratified patterns of vulnerability. The primary form of gendered vulnerability in the context of agrarian stress emerges from male out-migration, which has affected the distribution of labour and resources. While migration occurs amongst all socio-economic groups, women from marginal farmer and tenant households are most vulnerable. While the causes of migration are only indirectly associated with climate change, migration itself is rendering women who are left behind from marginal households, more vulnerable to ecological shocks such as droughts due to the sporadic flow of income and their reduced capacity for investment in off-farm activities. It is clear that policies and initiatives to address climate change in stratified social formations such as the Eastern Gangetic Plains, will be ineffective without addressing the deeper structural intersections between class, caste and gender.

Fourteen genotypes were tested in Bangladesh, India and Nepal during 6 years (2000–2005) to determine disease severity and resistance stability over these years. We analyzed the area under the disease progress curve per day (AUDPC/day) to assess spot blotch severity, and examined grain yield, 1000-kernel weight (TKW), days to heading, and plant height. Disease severity differed in the 6 years and several genotypes showed low disease severity in all years. A few genotypes had high grain yield and low disease severity in all years. Genotype Altar-84/Ae. Sq. (224)//Yaco, with the lowest disease severity and highest 1000-kernel weight (TKW) and grain yield was also the most stable for spot blotch resistance, \{TKW\} and grain yield. Results demonstrated that wheat genotypes with improved spot blotch resistance, high grain yield, acceptable TKW, and plant height are available as a result of the regional and international collaboration in South Asia. Despite this progress, the challenge lies ahead because of an apparent tendency of increasing spot blotch overall severity in the region and decreasing \{TKW\} over 6 years (2000–2005). Higher, average night time temperature during the month of March is an indicator showing that wheat crop performance is challenged in two ways—increasing spot blotch severity and decreasing \{TKW\} causing lower yield. The results underline the possible effect of changing climatic factors on disease pressure and the continuous need to identify new resistance sources to develop more spot blotch resistant wheat for the warmer Eastern Gangetic Plains of South Asia.

HarvestPlus, the CGIAR's biofortification initiative, seeks to breed and disseminate crop varieties with enhanced micronutrient content that can improve the nutrition of the “hard to reach” (by fortification or supplementation programmes) rural and urban poor in targeted countries/regions.

Biofortified maize and wheat varieties must have the trait combinations which encourage adoption such as high yield potential, disease resistance, and consumer acceptability. When defining breeding strategies and targeting micronutrient levels, researchers need to consider the desired micronutrient increases, food intake and retention and bioavailability as they relate to food processing, anti-nutritional factors and promoters. Finally, ex ante studies are required to quantify the burden of micronutrient deficiency and the potential of biofortification to achieve a significant improvement in human micronutrient status in the deficient target population in order to determine whether a biofortification program is cost-effective.

Technologies must be effective within farmer resource constraints, increase food production, reduce risk and enhance the soil fertility. Results from on-farm participatory research were used to quantify the effects of agronomic practices on soil resources. Agricultural productivity is primarily nitrogen (N) limited throughout Malawi, and sub-humid Zimbabwe. Tightening economic constraints faced by farmers in the region have reduced inorganic fertilizer inputs and necessitate increased reliance on biologically-fixed N and N cycling. Three components of organic matter technology were evaluated: (1) the effects of residue quality; (2) the role of deep rooting systems; and (3) tradeoffs between legumes grown for grain versus soil regeneration. Perennial systems investigated include improved fallows, intercropping, and biomass transfer. Annual systems include intercrops and rotations of cereals with legumes. The most promising non-food legumes were Tephrosia and Sesbania. Interestingly, high quality residues of perennial legumes were most effective at supplying N in the short to medium term, whereas low quality residues immobilised N. Low quality residues were problematic for smallholder farmers who need immediately available N. Challenges to adoption of perennial system technologies include establishment costs, resource competition and delayed benefits. Farmer adoption of annual grain legumes is promoted by the simultaneous production of food; however, those species which have a high N harvest index add little to no net N to the soil. Species that combine some grain yield with high root and leaf biomass, thus a low N harvest offer a useful compromise of meeting farmer food security concerns and improving soil fertility. Promising genotypes include Arachis, Cajanus, Dolichos and Mucuna spp. On-farm N budgets indicate that legumes with high quality residues and deep root systems are effective ways at improving nutrient cycling. Areas of future research priority for smallholder farms in southern Africa were identified, including technologies which combine inorganic and organic fertilizer and improve legume growth and establishment on degraded soils.

abstract = "Information from adaptive research programs is usually summarized into ‘recipes’ for crop production that do little justice to the increasing complexity of farmers' decisions or to the large amount of useful information generated by mature research programs. A major challenge for exploiting the benefits of adaptive research is to find ways to synthesize and simplify information generated by research, into a form that can be effectively used by farmers. The concept of farmer recommendations and farmer stratification for extension advice, and farmers' needs for increasing amounts of specific information and conditional recommendations are discussed. But even with specific recommendations, there always remains substantial opportunity for farmers to adapt technology to their own needs, and this calls for a wider array of auxiliary information, improvements in farmers' understanding of the technology and increases in farmers' technical and managerial skills. Some implications for the organization, methods and philosophy of extension systems are also briefly reviewed. "

Conservation agriculture (CA) has been proposed as one of those solutions and field level data show marked benefits of this new cropping system. Nevertheless, the use of rotations and/or associations in \{CA\} systems is challenging at both the farm and community level. Intercropped maize (Zea mays L.) with grain legumes, cowpea and pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L. (Millsp.)), as well as maize rotated with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. (Walp)) and sunnhemp (Crotalaria ochroleuca L.) was studied for up to eight seasons under \{CA\} and conventional agriculture in Zimbabwe. The objective of this study, carried out on-farm and on-station, was to highlight the effects of \{CA\} systems on some soil quality indicators and crop productivity. Where possible the specific effects of rotation and intercropping was separated and compared with monocropping. The on-station and on-farm results show: an increase of up to 331% in water infiltration, a 31% greater soil carbon in the top 60 cm than on adjacent conventionally ploughed fields, a 6% lower bulk density in the top 10 cm and 32.5–36 t ha−1 less cumulative soil erosion in \{CA\} fields after seven cropping seasons compared with the conventional control treatment. The comparative productivity analysis between continuous maize, maize intercropped with cowpea or pigeonpea and maize in rotation with cowpea or sunnhemp, shows marked benefits of rotation especially in \{CA\} systems. The benefits of \{CA\} especially when rotated with leguminous crops, increase over time, suggesting that there are improvements in soil structure and fertility. However, field level benefits will not increase the overall adoption of rotations and intercropping in \{CA\} systems, unless the socio-economic constraints at the farm and community level are addressed.

In the course of recurrent selection for drought tolerance in six tropical maize (Zea mays L.) populations, a total of 3509 inbred progenies (S1 to \{S3\} level) were evaluated in 50 separate yield trials under two or three water regimes during the dry winter seasons of 1986–1990 at Tlaltizapán, México. In over 90% of the trials, ears plant−1, kernels plant−1, weight kernel−1, anthesis-silking interval (ASI), tassel branch number and visual scores for leaf angle, leaf rolling and leaf senescence were determined. Low scores indicated erect, unrolled or green leaves. Canopy temperature, leaf chlorophyll concentration and stem-leaf extension rate were measured in 20–50% of the trials. Across all trials, linear phenotypic correlations (P &lt; 0.01) between grain yield under drought and these traits, in order listed, were 0.77, 0.90, 0.46, −0.53, −0.16, 0.06NS, −0.18, −0.11, −0.27, 0.17 and 0.10. Genetic correlations were generally similar in size and sign. None of physiological or morphological traits indicative of improved water status correlated with grain yield under drought, although some had relatively high heritabilities. Genetic variances for grain yield, kernels ear−1, kernels plant−1 and weight kernel−1 decreased with increasing drought, but those for \{ASI\} and ears plant−1 increased. Broad-sense heritability for grain yield averaged around 0.6, but fell to values near 0.4 at very low grain yield levels. Genetic correlations between grain yield and \{ASI\} or ears plant−1 were weak under well-watered conditions, but approached −0.6 and 0.9, respectively, under severe moisture stress. These results show that secondary traits are not lacking genetic variability within elite maize populations. Their low correlation with grain yield may indicate that variation in grain yield under moisture stress is dominated by variation in ear-setting processes related to biomass partitioning at flowering, and much less by factors putatively linked to crop water status. Field-based selection programs for drought tolerance should consider these results. "

The weather was close to normal and supplemental spring irrigations eliminated the possibility of water stress. Crop management was otherwise optimal and there was no disease or lodging. Grain yield ranged from 170 to 750 g m−2 across N fertilizer treatments the response to N was not reduced with applications as late as the onset of stem elongation. Grain yield was very closely correlated with kernels m−2 and with total biomass production. Kernel number was in turn closely correlated with spike dry weight (g m−2) at anthesis and with crop dry weight accumulation during the spike growth phase commencing 1 week before fag leaf emergence. Kernels per unit spike weight was unaffected by N but dry matter partitioning to spikes as increased by early N stress. Numerical components of kernel number did not give a useful quantitative explanation of these N responses. Delay in N application up until the onset of stem elongation did not limit N response because N uptake and leaf area responded quickly enough for close to full radiation interception to be reached before the onset of spike growth. Crop dry weight accumulation, generally directly related to absorbed photosynthetically-active radiation (PARA), was also assisted by small increases in radiation-use-efficiency (RUE, g top dry matter MJ−1 PARA) with higher N content in foliage. Peak \{RUE\} values (mean 2.86±0.03 g MJ−1) were close to other published values for wheat. The apparent recovery of N fertilizer was little affected by N amount and timing (average 63%). N uptake continued throughout grain filling in almost all treatments but especially those with late applications. N-utilization efficiency (grain yield/N uptake), however, declined with large N doses and with applications after the onset of stem elongation: values ranged from 30 to 60 g g−1. Utilization efficiency declines were largely associated with increases in grain N concentration and, to a lesser extent, reinforcing decreases in N harvest index. "

For the HYPT, the main objectives were to determine the environmental variables during different phenological stages associated with: (i) G×E among the three crop species, (ii) G×E within each species, and (iii) underlying physiological causes of G×E. For ESWYT, meteorological data were not available and so mean site values of certain crop parameters were used as proxy environmental data to determine whether conditions either pre- or post-anthesis were more influential in determining G×E. Partial least squares analysis (PLS) and factorial regression (FR) models were used to identify the environmental factors best explaining G×E independent of the main effects. Of the three crops, durums were shown to be the most sensitive to conditions pre-anthesis, requiring higher radiation and cooler average temperatures (Txs) in order to set high grain number. TCL, despite having the highest average yield and biomass, performed relatively poor when conditions from spike growth stage onwards were sunny and warm. \{BW\} appeared to be the most robust of the three species. Considering yield, biomass, and yield components, it was apparent that the spike primordia growth stage was generally the most sensitive to environmental factors causing G×E. Results for the \{ESWYT\} suggested that conditions post-anthesis were more influential on G×E than conditions pre-anthesis. Implications for how such analysis may assist with both conventional and molecular approaches to breeding are discussed. "

One of the immediate benefits of \{CA\} in dryland agriculture is improved rainfall-use efficiency through increased water infiltration and decreased evaporation from the soil surface, with associated decreases in runoff and soil erosion. This paper focuses on the effect of \{CA\} techniques on soil moisture relations in two researcher-managed trials in Zambia and Zimbabwe. In 2005/2006 and 2006/2007, we found significantly higher water infiltration on both sites on \{CA\} fields compared to conventionally ploughed fields. At Henderson Research Station, Zimbabwe, on a sandy soil, a direct seeded \{CA\} treatments had a 49% and 45% greater infiltration rate than the conventionally tilled plots after a simulated rainfall in both seasons. At Monze Farmer Training Centre, Zambia, on a finer-textured soil, the same treatment had 57% and 87% greater infiltration rate than the conventionally tilled control treatment in both seasons. Treatments that included reduced tillage and surface residue retention had less water runoff and erosion on runoff plots at Henderson Research Station, Zimbabwe. On average, soil moisture was higher throughout the season in most \{CA\} treatments than in the conventionally tilled plots. However, the full potential of \{CA\} in mitigating drought was not evident as there was no significant drought period in either season. Results suggest that \{CA\} has the potential to increase the productivity of rainfall water and therefore reduce the risk of crop failure, as was apparent at the Monze Farmer Training Centre, Zambia, in 2005/2006 when a period of moisture stress at tassling affected \{CA\} treatments less than the conventionally tilled treatment.

To study the effectiveness and economics of a new storage method, hermetic bags, a randomized controlled trial was organized in Kenya with 300 farmers in the treatment group using hermetic bags and 300 in the control group using conventional farmer practices. A subsample of 224 farmers was visited three times during the 2012–2013 major storage season: at baseline and after two and four months. Grain samples were taken and insect infestation, damage and weight loss observed. Results show that hermetic bags were highly effective in controlling storage insect pests: after four months, grain damage was 14% in the control and only 4% in the treatment; weight loss due to insect pests was 1.7% among control farmers, but only 0.4% in the treatment group. Economic analysis shows that hermetic bags become potentially profitable, under basic price and loss assumptions, if farmers use hermetic bags for storage for at least four months per season, and if the bags last for at least four seasons.

Genotype-by-environment interactions in southern African maize growing environments result from factors related to maximum temperature, season rainfall, season length, within-season drought, subsoil pH and socio-economic factors that result in sub-optimal input application. In 1997, \{CIMMYT\} initiated a product-oriented breeding program targeted at improving maize for the drought-prone mid-altitudes of southern Africa. Maize varieties were selected in Zimbabwe using simultaneous selection in three types of environments, (i) recommended agronomic management/high rainfall conditions, (ii) low N stress, and (iii) managed drought. Between 2000 and 2002, 41 hybrids from this approach were compared with 42 released and pre-released hybrids produced by private seed companies in 36–65 trials across eastern and southern Africa. Average trial yields ranged from less than 1 t/ha to above 10 t/ha. Hybrids from CIMMYT's stress breeding program showed a consistent advantage over private company check hybrids at all yield levels. Selection differentials were largest between 2 and 5 t/ha and they became less significant at higher yield levels. An Eberhart–Russell stability analysis estimated a 40% yield advantage at the 1-t yield level which decreased to 2.5% at the 10-t yield level. We conclude that including selection under carefully managed high-priority abiotic stresses, including drought, in a breeding program and with adequate weighing can significantly increase maize yields in a highly variable drought-prone environment and particularly at lower yield levels.

Gas exchange and fluorescence parameters were assessed on the flag leaf during the day. Carbon isotope discrimination (Δ) was analysed in flag leaf at anthesis and in grain at maturity.

Analysis of their respective variation indicated the occurrence of photo-respiration and photo-inhibition, particularly in Tlaltizapan, the warmest environment, and in Siete Cerros. In Ciudad Obregon (high-yielding environment) lower Ci (internal \{CO2\} concentration) and ΔLa (carbon isotope discrimination of the leaf) suggested a higher intrinsic photosynthetic capacity in the variety Bacanora.

When present alone, the \{APR\} genes do not confer adequate resistance especially under high disease pressure; however, combinations of 4 or 5 minor genes usually result in “near-immunity” or a high level of resistance. Although only a few \{APR\} genes are catalogued, various \{APR\} \{QTLs\} are now known and could lead to further characterization of additional genes. Four characterized genes have pleiotropic effects in conferring partial \{APR\} to all 3 rusts and powdery mildew, thus simplifying the task of breeding wheat varieties that are resistant to multiple diseases. Significant progress was made recently in developing high-yielding wheat germplasm that possesses high levels of \{APR\} to all three rusts by implementing a Mexico-Kenya shuttle breeding scheme. Parents with \{APR\} to Ug99 were hybridized with high-yielding parents that had adequate to high levels of \{APR\} to leaf rust and yellow rust. Segregating populations and advanced lines from these crosses were selected under high rust pressures in Mexico (leaf rust and yellow rust) and Kenya (Ug99 stem rust and yellow rust) to identify high-yielding progenies that possess high to adequate \{APR\} to all three rusts. International distribution of these high-yielding wheats is underway through \{CIMMYT\} international yield trials and screening nurseries. It is expected that several wheat varieties with \{APR\} to three rusts will be released and grown in various countries in the near-future that will allow determining the durability of resistance. "

Using survey data from Kenya and applying bivariate ordered Probit and bivariate Tobit models, this paper analyzes the tradeoffs in maize residue use as soil mulch and livestock feed in mixed farming systems. Results show that both the proportion and quantity of maize residue used for soil mulch and livestock feed are strongly affected by livestock holding. More livestock holding decreases the proportion of maize residue retained as soil mulch and increases the proportion used as feed. Farmer knowledge about alternative use of crop residues and farmer perception of soil erosion risk (proxied through plot steepness) positively affect the amount of residue farmers retain on maize plots. Results imply that crop residue use assoil mulch in conservation agriculture is challenged in mixed crop–livestock systems and particularly by smallholder farmers owning cross-bred and exotic dairy animals. In general, reducing the use of crop residues as livestock feed through the introduction of alternative feed sources, better extension services on the use of crop residue as soil mulch and designing context specific strategies and interventions could facilitate the adoption and expansion of CA-based practices in mixed crop–livestock systems.

There were two hot low-altitude sites (60 and 940 m) and two cool highland sites (2249 and 2640 m); mean January temperatures were 21, 20, 11 and 7°C, respectively. Cloudiness reduced solar radiation and diurnal temperature range at the lowest site. Crops were grown under optimal agronomy and irrigation, with disease control, although it was not possible to prevent serious foliar disease (Helminthosporium saticum subsp. tritici) during grain filling at the lowest site. Environment (site and sowing date) had a major effect on grain yield, which ranged from 74 to 587 g m−2 across the eleven sowings made. Yield was clearly poorest at the lowest site, increasing markedly at the higher hot site and still further at the cooler sites. At the hot sites November-December sowing yielded more than January sowing. The variation in yield was closely associated with variation in kernel number m−2 (r = 0.98), which in turn was associated with total dry weight m−2 at anthesis (r = 0.97) and photothermal quotient (mean solar radiation divided by mean temperature) over the 30 days preceding anthesis (r = 0.88). Poorest growth, kernel number and hence yield at the lowest site was probably due to higher temperatures accelerating development, to lower solar radiation reducing assimilation rates, and possibly to reduced diurnal temperature range; specific leaf area was however greatest at this site. Genotypic effects were small relative to environmental ones, and genotype x site interaction for grain yield was not significant. Within each site yield showed stronger phenotypic correlations with kernal number m−2 and with harvest index, than with kernel weight and biological yield, respectively. Genotypes which were relatively insensitive to photoperiod and vernalization, and hence early, were best throughout, and especially at the hot lower sites. Late genotypes, sensitive to vernalization or very sensitive to photoperiod, gave a poor relative performance at the lowland site, where yield and kernel number m−2 showed negative phenotypic correlations with days to anthesis. This occurred despite more tillering and more initiated spikelets per spike, and could be only partly attributed to higher temperatures encountered by these genotypes during their later stages of development.

Technologies are typified in terms of their orientation – land or labour saving – and market dependence for their procurement and reviews the factors driving and modifying their use in lowlands. The factors associated with technology use are analyzed empirically using geo-referenced lowland data around four urban centers along an ecological gradient in Côte d’Ivoire and Mali. The technologies analyzed include both external inputs (fertilizer, pesticide, herbicide, improved varieties) and crop management practices (plot level bunding, rice transplanting and rice direct seeding). Results from binomial logit models highlight the prominent positive and non-linear role of proximity to urban markets for the technological intensification of lowlands – an issue associated with factor scarcities and the transaction costs for procurement and marketing. Technology use in lowlands is also associated with the agro-ecological gradient, lowland development and non-native lowland users. A common thread linking these variables is that they modify resource scarcity and therefore intensification incentives. Lowlands are not always as valuable as they may seem and there may be limited incentives to intensify. Instances of significant lowland cultivation and intensification in the study sites tend to be associated with specific opportunities – driven by market opportunities and modified by seasonal, institutional or development-induced relative land scarcity. Market access is therefore a necessary but not sufficient factor for the technological intensification of lowland use. There is a need for better targeting of development efforts in terms of enabling lowland intensification or extensification as appropriate. "

However, this is only true for minor improvements along stable technological paths. In most cases, other factors, such as policies and markets, influence adoption and, consequently, impact. The problem is compounded because impacts often appear after many years and usually cannot be measured. Since many factors influence adoption, research impacts should be analyzed as part of a complex adaptive system that depends on external forces (e.g., markets), the direct and indirect interactions among agents (e.g., researchers, input suppliers and farmers), and the technology's nature and evolution. The complexity framework has broad consequences for agricultural and research policies. Since impacts result from the actions of the whole network, they cannot generally be attributed to individual agents. In evaluating networks, the relevant parameters to study are the rules for generating, collecting and sharing information, financing procedures, intellectual property-rights regulations and availability of human and financial resources. For individual agents the relevant indicators are their patterns of participation in particular networks, benefits and costs of participation, evaluation criteria, financial arrangements and institutional cultures.

Since the 1960s, yield gains, rather than area expansion, have fuelled increases in maize production in Asia. Yield gains, in turn, have been due to the shift in maize cultivation from mostly open-pollinated varieties (OPVs) to mostly hybrids. This transition also shifted the locus of modern maize breeding research from government research organisations to private national and multinational seed companies. In countries where both the public and private sectors participated in maize research, private sector research investment far exceeded that of the public sector. With more aggressive marketing programmes, the private sector captured 89% of the Asian maize seed market in the late 1990s. National public seed research agencies (including universities and cooperatives) developed and produced more maize \{OPVs\} than hybrids, mass-produced and distributed seed cheaply, addressed location-specific production problems, and provided agricultural extension services. The private seed companies developed, produced, sold and promoted their own proprietary hybrids. The reluctance of the private sector, however, to address the needs of marginal maize farmers should encourage the public sector to continue playing an active role in maize research and development (R&amp;D), seed production and modern maize technology dissemination, especially with adequate support from appropriate government policies.

First tested as soil and water conservation measures, large-scale promotion followed a reframing of \{CA\} as a production-enhancing set of practices. Different definitions of what constitutes and is promoted as \{CA\} in southern Africa complicates the assessment of adoption across the region, while a commonly used, reductionist notion of \{CA\} adoption – as the uptake of minimum tillage – in adoption data collection, casts doubts on the validity of adoption figures. As \{CA\} uptake is often also incentivized by means of input support (fertilizers, seeds, herbicides) provided by promotional projects, adoption claims have limited value. Current \{CA\} adoption studies are methodologically weak as they are biased by the promotional project context in which are carried out, and build on farm-scale analyses of standard household surveys. A more thorough analysis of farming households and their resource allocation strategies is required to understand the farm-level adoption constraints different types of farmers face. As contextual factors appear key influences on smallholders’ farming practices, studies focusing on the wider market, institutional and policy context are also needed if we are to understand (limited) \{CA\} adoption in southern Africa.

The comparative advantages of each sector depend on: (i) whether the targeted disease can affect humans; (ii) its degree of contagiousness; (iii) whether it is endemic or exotic; and (iv) the economic costs associated with the disease. The rationale for public intervention is weaker for non-contagious than for contagious diseases; governments, though, can play a support role in several areas: e.g. generation and dissemination of information on health management, fostering participation of producers' organization in the eradication of endemic diseases, or helping private research institutions and funders to overcome the hurdles posed by widespread uncertainty and high costs associated with basic research. Control and eradication of contagious diseases in characterized by strong externalities; bio-security measures implemented by any producer affect his/her neighbors. A major factor affecting the design of appropriate health policies for contagious diseases is whether the disease is endemic or exotic in a particular population. The externality exists for endemic diseases—but for exotic diseases there is only the possibility of an externality (which materializes solely in the case of an outbreak). For exotic diseases, therefore, the perception of the risk of an outbreak is a major determinant of producers' behavior and of public prevention policies. The perception by producers and policy makers of the probability of occurrence of an outbreak of an exotic disease depends on the time elapsed since the last outbreak in the country or in neighboring countries. In general, perception of the risk of an outbreak will be lower than the true risk for most exotic diseases that have been absent for many years—but might be higher than the true risk if an outbreak was recently reported in the region. Taxes and private insurance have been proposed to internalize the externality; however, these policies cannot solve the health externality. Alternative programs (such as joint public–private eradication campaigns) are proposed as a means to minimize the externality. "

abstract = "Abstract Two strategies for seeding irrigation are used for irrigated wheat. Wet sowing utilizes pre-sowing irrigation to germinate weed seeds and thus control weeds, followed by sowing. Dry sowing plants into dry soil that is irrigated soon afterward, resulting in higher soil moisture during germination and emergence than wet sowing. Field observations have indicated reduced emergence, plant stands and yield in dry compared to wet sowing on a Vertisol in northwestern Mexico. This disadvantage is more acute when dry sowing is conducted in permanent beds with residue retention (conservation agriculture) compared to the conventional system involving tillage with residue incorporation. To identify the causes of reduced plant stand and yield and examine control options, chemical seed treatment effects on durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) performance under wet and dry sowing were investigated over three seasons in a permanent bed system. Four seed treatments were applied: Control (no seed treatment); Carboxin + thiram + chlorothalonil (Vit-Dac; fungicides); Difenoconazole + mefenoxam (Dif-Mef; fungicides); and Thiamethoxam + difenoconazole + mefenoxam (TMX-Dif-Mef; insecticide and fungicides). Plant stands, root rot scores, normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI), and grain yield were determined. Under dry sowing, Dif-Mef and TMX-Dif-Mef increased plant stands by 87% and 104%, respectively, compared to Vit-Dac, and by 152% and 172%, respectively, compared to the control. Under dry sowing, TMX-Dif-Mef increased yield by 9.76% and 17.7% compared to Vit-Dac and the control, respectively. Bread and durum wheat were significantly different for both emergence and yield every growing season. Seed treatments effects were not significant under wet sowing. Treatment differences were not linked with root rot incidence later in the season. Several mechanistic hypotheses to explain the results were explored. \{TMX\} has been reported to alter genetic expression to enhance response to early season abiotic stresses, but this has not been reported for Dif-Mef. The different physical conditions during stand establishment, i.e. increased moisture and reduced temperature, under dry sowing compared to wet sowing, could have affected microbial populations which induced biological suppression of germination and/or emergence. Although more research is required to explain the underlying mechanism, wheat producers transitioning to a dry sowing system under conservation agriculture with permanent raised beds may avoid yield loss by utilization of a Dif-Mef or TMX-Dif-Mef seed treatment.

Five problems associated with estimating sources of yield gains were considered, namely: (1) adjusting yield gains for variation in weather over the study period; (2) considering annual cultivar-by-weather interactions, which are potentially problematic when relative yields of cultivars are generated over only part of the study period; (3) overestimating relative yields of cultivars if the check cultivar(s) become susceptible to disease; (4) ensuring that yields as estimated from research station trials represent cultivar performance under farmers' conditions; and (5) allowing for cultivar-by-management interactions. With these factors considered, 28% of the weather-adjusted yield gain of 103 kg ha−1 y−1 was attributed to genetic gain (i.e., cultivar improvement). If the yield gains had not been adjusted for annual weather variation, genetic gain would have been overestimated at 50%. By contrast, 48% of the gain was attributed to increased use of N fertilizer, driven at least in part by a decline in N prices; no N-by-cultivar interactions were apparent. The remainder of the yield gap (24%) could not be attributed to specific factors, although P application rates increased over time, and negative deviations from linearity were associated with years having greater than normal rainfall in November and December (a phenomenon which can delay sowing and/or reduce crop stand). In addition to identifying factors contributing to yield gains, technologies that have contributed benefits not measured by yield are discussed. "

Emphasis has been placed on development of hybrids for areas with high yield potential and open-pollinated cultivars (OPCs) for environments limited by biotic or abiotic stresses. This study was conducted to determine the physiological, phenological and morphological bases for yield differences in a group of representative hybrids and \{OPCs\} available in the region. Nine cultivars (five hybrids and four OPCs) were evaluated in 11 diverse environments of the region ranging in mean grain yield from 0.5 to 8.0 Mg ha−1. Hybrids consistently outyielded \{OPCs\} by 1.0 to 1.5 Mg ha−1 across the range of environments tested. Differences in grain yield between hybrids and \{OPCs\} were mostly due to greater biomass production, higher harvest index and a larger daily ear growth rate (2.2 g d−1 ear−1 for hybrids versus 1.8 g d−1 ear−1 for OPCs). Within hybrids or OPCs, however, differences in yield depended on the duration of grain filling and not on ear growth rate. For example, grain filling in higher-yielding hybrids CB-HS7 and HB-85 required about 7 more days than the lower-yielding hybrids P-8916 and H-5. A similar situation existed within the OPCs. A strong negative relationship was detected between grain-filling length and maturity, indicating that earliness and smaller leaf number were associated with longer grain-filling duration and yield. Grain moisture was strongly related to grain phenological development and was independent of cultivar. These results reveal that an effective mechanism to increase maize yield is to select for extended grain filling. Breeding schemes in use should consider these selection criteria. "

Levels of competition were altered, in both leaf canopy and underground, by manipulating rows of plants in eight-row yield plots. Competition for light was decreased by bending adjacent rows away from the central two rows thus permitting greater penetration of light to lower leaves of the central rows (light treatment). Reduced competition underground was realized, simultaneously with reduced competition for light, by uprooting the plants adjacent to the central two rows (root/light treatment). These treatments were implemented at the developmental stage of flag-leaf ligule emergence (FLLE), when interplant competition was assumed to become maximal. While the average yield responses were 25%, and 40% to the light and root/light treatments respectively, there was a significant interaction with genetic material. Low-yield-potential (LYP) lines responded more to reduced competition than high-yield-potential (HYP) lines suggesting that the greater efficiency of the \{HYP\} lines, reflected in their higher yield, is related to their better adaptation to interplant competition. Physiological bases for improved performance are examined and discussed in relation to ideas about crop ideotypes and possible implications to breeding. These data appear to support the idea that genes conferming yield potential through improved adaptation to the crop environment are associated with a less competitive phenotype. "

The irrigated valley is representative of regions producing 40% of the developing world's wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and has been the subject of intensive wheat research investment during the last 30 years. Over the 1968–1990 (year of planting) study period, the linear increase in yield (± standard error) was 57.2 (± 12.8) kg ha−1 y−1 (r2 = 0.49) or 1.27 (± 0.26) % y−1 (r2 = 0.51). However, considerable variation in both yield and average growing season temperature were observed over the period. In an attempt to allow for yearly weather variation, two yield models (one simulation-based and one regression-based) assuming no change in cultivar or management were used to predict the weather-based potential yield of each year. These predicted yields showed a significant linear decline over the study period apparently due to a small increase in temperature. When average Valley yields were adjusted against simulated yields to take into account the variation in weather, the overall linear rate of yield gain increased to 103 (± 14.8) kg ha−1 y−1 (r2 = 0.69) or 1.91 (± 0.22) % y−1 (r2 = 0.78). Consequently, the allowance for the temporal temperature change showed that the returns to improved crop management and breeding have been superior to those suggested by the increase in actual Valley yields.

abstract = "Germplasm conservation aims to preserve at least one copy of each allele in a population. The sample size for regeneration depends on the frequency and number of alleles at a locus. Modes of gene action and interaction (neutral, recessive, dominant, codominant, or overdominant) affect the distribution of allelic frequencies in a finite population. The objectives were to: (1) study the distribution of neutral and overdominant allelic frequencies in a finite population and the relationship of the distribution to the sample size and mutation rate in seed regeneration and (2) examine the effect of a founder event (bottleneck) on the allelic frequency and number of alleles present during regeneration of small collections. Finite populations contain, on the average, up to 11 neutral alleles at low frequency and from one to three neutral alleles at intermediate frequency. In general there is no more than one neutral allele at high frequency. For a high mutation rate (5 × 10−3), samples of 100 to 250 individuals will have a large proportion of the neutral alleles at low frequency and smaller samples will contain a lesser degree of neutral polymorphism. For a mutation rate of 5 × 10−4 collections of more than 250 individuals are required for a high degree of neutral polymorphism at a single locus. Overdominance is inefficient for maintaining a large number of alleles in a finite population. The usual sample for regeneration of 100–300 individuals would not maintain many overdominant alleles if the regenerations were affected by selection. If the original collection is small (less than 10 individuals), a bottleneck effect will result in the loss of some alleles present in the original population at low frequency. Therefore, the first priority is to insure appropriate sampling during collection. A sample of at least 100 individuals from the original population should be sufficient for this purpose. It is recommend that 150 to 250 individuals and crossing procedures that maximize effective population size be utilized for the regeneration of collections of cross pollinated species containing a high level of heterozygosity. A balanced bulk should be prepared for use in further regenerations, thus avoiding changes in allele frequency caused by selection and the effects of overdominant alleles on seed production. Mutation is not a significant factor in regenerations based on 150–250 plants. "

The yield response to IR-maize seed was categorized at two levels. The germplasm effect was estimated at 0.37 tons/ha. The herbicide effect was estimated at 0.13 tons/ha (49 kg/ha for each reduction of the Striga numbers/m2). With maize prices at US$202/ton, seed prices at US$34/ha and herbicide cost at US$4/ha, the overall marginal rate of return (MRR) was 2.4 (good), with an \{MRR\} of 1.9 (respectable) for the germplasm and an \{MRR\} of 5.6 (very good) for the IR-maize technology. Farmers generally appreciated the technology and indicated their willingness to pay (WTP), which was, however, very price-sensitive. The methodology of on-farm work can be improved substantially by including a sufficient number of sites, by measuring compounding factors (soil fertility, Striga seed bank, rainfall), by involving the farmers more (explain the design better, visit more often), by inviting more farmers for the evaluation and by using experimental auctions of IR-maize seed to estimate their \{WTP\} for this new technology.

Performance of normal hybrids was slightly better than DTP-topcrosses under unstressed conditions. However, under stress normal hybrids performed poorly with an average yield of 3.3–4.8% under drought and 34.8–36.2% under low-N stress. Hybrid progenies from \{DTP\} yielded up to 31.8–42.4% under drought and 48.9–63.6% under low-N as compared with their yields with out stress. Estimation of gains with selection for mid-season drought stress in \{DTPs\} over selection for improved yields under optimal input conditions showed that the gains were remarkable for drought (89.6%), and also for low-N stress (39.3%). The improved performance of \{DTP\} hybrids across environments was due to improvements in secondary traits such as reduced anthesis–silking interval, increased ears per plant, delayed senescence and relatively high leaf chlorophyll during late grain filling. Correlations between the performance of genotypes under drought and low-N stresses were positive and fairly high for \{DTP\} progenies, both white (r2=0.45∗,r=0.56∗) and yellow (r2=0.42∗,r=0.52∗), while it was not significant with normal hybrids.

Policy makers in Zimbabwe and elsewhere must decide whether increased domestic wheat production might reduce dependency on imports and at the same time contribute to economic efficiency and food security goals. The domestic resource cost framework was used to assess Zimbabwe's comparative advantage among six major irrigated crops and to measure the effects of current government policies on producer incentives. The results indicate that irrigated wheat production represents an efficient use of Zimbabwe's resources during times of abundant rainfall, but the nation enjoys a comparative advantage in tobacco, maize, and cotton production during times of water scarcity. Existing agricultural policies provide disincentives for commercial farmers, because private profitability is less than social profitability for the major irrigated crops. However, this tax occurs across all commodities with similar incidence, so that the private incentives among crops are not greatly distorted from their social pattern. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of these findings under a range of possible future economic and political developments. The domestic resource cost approach used in this study provides an operational method for measuring comparative advantage and should be of interest to policy analysts throughout sub-Saharan Africa.

For the HYPT, the main objectives were to determine the environmental variables during different phenological stages associated with: (i) G×E among the three crop species, (ii) G×E within each species, and (iii) underlying physiological causes of G×E. For ESWYT, meteorological data were not available and so mean site values of certain crop parameters were used as proxy environmental data to determine whether conditions either pre- or post-anthesis were more influential in determining G×E. Partial least-squares analysis and factorial regression models were used to identify the environmental factors best explaining G×E independent of the main effects. Of the three crops, durums were shown to be the most sensitive to conditions pre-anthesis, requiring higher radiation and cooler average temperatures in order to set high grain number. Triticale, despite having the highest average yield and biomass, performed relatively poor when conditions from spike growth stage onwards were sunny and warm. Bread wheat appeared to be the most robust of the three species. Considering yield, biomass, and yield components, it was apparent that the spike primordia growth stage was generally the most sensitive to environmental factors causing G×E. Results for the \{ESWYT\} suggested that conditions post-anthesis were more influential on G×E than conditions pre-anthesis. Implications for how such analysis may assist with both conventional and molecular approaches to breeding are discussed. "

Highest maize yield was observed under zero-tillage with retained residues. Simulation results indicated that this was due to more favorable moisture conditions, attenuating water stress in adverse years. Soil mineral N concentration measured in 1998 indicated the likelihood for N-stress under zero-tillage with residues retained. CropSyst additionally predicted N-stress as a yield limiting factor in other years, despite a seemingly optimal N supply by mineral fertilizer. CropSyst could predict yield under conventional tillage with residues retained and under zero-tillage with residues removed reasonably well, indicated by a modified Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (E1) of 0.32 and 0.48. Yield predictions for conventional tillage with residues removed were poor (E1 = −0.05) and those for zero-tillage with residues retained insufficient (E1 = −0.20). Nonetheless, simulation results highlighted systematic differences between treatments with regard to water and N-dynamics. CropSyst lacks routines to account for soil crusting, the temporal impact of tillage on soil hydraulic conditions and the effect of surface residues physically restraining surface water runoff.

Findings reveal significant pitfalls in \{PVS\} that resulted from emergence of spoiler factors such as new crop disease and unpredictable floods. Spoiler factors curtailed sustainability of participatory gains. Besides, learning during critical field stages was thin due to participatory lapses. For instance, an average of only 8% (total = 1488) consistently participated in each key stage of \{PVS\} learning trials in western Kenya. The majority (92%) participated on average once, especially in the end-of-season field day when final ranking of crop varieties was done. Consequently, this majority engaged in impulse buying, due to poor grasp of salient productivity factors underlying attractive traits of the new germplasm. Essentially, post-PVS sustainability conditions were elusive. Scaling out of \{PVS\} gains was hence compromised and early adopters often fell back to old varieties, to experience, or to sporadic extension advice. \{PVS\} therefore has to be anchored within an integrated knowledge exchange system that addresses challenges emanating from interaction of smallholder social, spatial and temporal contexts.

To assist vulnerable rural households improve their food security, the British Department for International Development implemented a seed relief program from 2003/2004 to 2005/2006 that emphasized recycling of maize open pollinated varieties (OPV). Using data collected from 597 households in six districts in 2006, this study assesses the effectiveness of the program in terms of its targeting of beneficiaries, the flow of information from participating \{NGOs\} to beneficiaries on the need to recycle the seeds, and the level of recycling done at the end of the program. The empirical results suggest that the targeting method participating \{NGOs\} use inadvertently excludes relatively vulnerable households while including large proportions of relatively well-endowed households in the program. The choice of varieties to distribute is guided more by the ecological adaptability of available commercial seeds and less by preferences of beneficiaries. Notwithstanding the fact that seed selection information is critical in encouraging beneficiaries to recycle distributed seed, not all of them received it. In conclusion, it may be stated that the program undoubtedly contributed to increased food productivity by vulnerable households but its overall effectiveness could have been enhanced through (i) the involvement of the beneficiaries in the choice of types of seed to be distributed, (ii) better targeting of beneficiaries, and (iii) improved information flow between \{NGOs\} and beneficiaries.

Farmers have to store maize to bridge seasons, for food security and to protect against price fluctuations. However, the traditional storage methods do not protect grain well, resulting in large postharvest losses. Hermetically sealed metal silos kill storage pests by oxygen deprivation without pesticides. Popular in Central America, they are now being promoted in Africa, but their impact here has not yet been studied. This study used propensity score matching to evaluate the impact of metal silos on duration of maize storage, loss abatement, cost of storage, and household food security. Metal silo adopters (N = 116) were matched with non-adopting farmers from a representative sample of 1340 households covering the major maize-growing zones in Kenya. The major effect of the metal silos was an almost complete elimination of losses due to insect pests, saving farmers an average of 150–200 kg of grain, worth \{KSh9750\} (US$130). Metal silo adopters also spent about \{KSh340\} less on storage insecticides. Adopters were able to store their maize for 1.8–2.4 months longer, and to sell their surplus after five months at good prices, instead of having to sell right after the harvest. The period of inadequate food provision among adopters was reduced by more than one month. We conclude that metal silos are effective in reducing grain losses due to maize-storage insects, and that they have a large impact on the welfare and food security of farm households. The initial cost of metal silos is high (KSh20,000/1.8 ton) and therefore policies to increase access to credit, to reduce the cost of sheet metal, and to promote collective action can improve their uptake by smallholder farmers.

Interventions are urgently needed, but information is lacking on its geographic distribution and losses caused. Group discussions were held in 2013 in 121 sublocations in the major maize zones, and respondents were asked if they had heard about MLN, when they first observed it, the proportion of households affected, and the estimated yield loss in affected areas. Responses were used to estimate the proportion of maize lost in the community, and these results were interpolated and combined with maize production data to estimate quantities lost. Western Kenya suffered most with more than half of farmers affected, followed by Central and Eastern Kenya, with up to a third of farmers. Yield losses in affected areas were highest in Western Kenya, followed by the highlands (in Central Kenya and the Rift Valley) and at the coast, but were low in the drylands (in Eastern Kenya). Total maize losses in Kenya were estimated at 0.5 million ton per year, or 22% of the average annual production before MLN, with a value estimated at $180 million. Losses were concentrated in Western Kenya, in particular the moist transitional zone (58% of all maize lost) and the moist mid-altitudes (19%), but also in the highlands (17%). Losses were small in the drylands and at the coast. Urgent action is needed to help farmers cope. In the short term, they need to be informed about the disease and provided with advice on appropriate agronomic practices. In the long term, varieties resistant to \{MLN\} need to be developed, first for the moist transitional and moist mid-altitude zones and followed by the highlands, but ultimately for all agroecological zones.

One option for tackling this problem is the use of such rapid-small-scale methods as Solvent Retention Capacity (SRC), \{SDS\} Sedimentation (SDSS) and Swelling Index of Glutenin (SIG) to predict flour performance. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of genotypes, contrasting environmental conditions and their interactions (GxE) on different rapid-small-scale tests, and to identify their suitability for use in prediction of quality traits. A significant GxE effect was observed for all three methodologies. Overall, \{SIG\} was found to be the best predictor of gluten strength across different environments. It was also best at determining bread-making quality in some environments, followed by \{SDSS\} for bread making. \{SRC\} was found to be useful to select for gluten strength, but for extensibility and bread-making more grain data is needed.

To assess this, we used data collected from 208 wheat farmers in Haryana, India in 2013–14 (a period with normal rainfall i.e., normal year) and 2014–15 (a period with untimely excess rainfall i.e., bad year) wheat seasons. Our analysis shows that whilst average wheat yield was greater under \{CAW\} than \{CTW\} during both bad and normal years, the difference was two-fold greater during the bad year (16% vs. 8%). This provides new evidence that \{CAW\} can cope better with the climatic extremes, in this case untimely excess rainfall, compared to CTW. Absolute yield of the \{CAW\} and \{CTW\} was 10% and 16% lower in the bad year compared to the normal year, respectively. Extreme climate events, such as excess rainfall during wheat season, can occur once in every four years in Haryana and result in a loss of income to both farmers, through a loss of yield, and the government, through compensatory payments to farmers. If, as targeted by the Haryana government in 2011, one million ha of wheat was brought under CAW, the state would have produced an additional 0.66 million Mg of wheat in 2014–15, equivalent to US$ 153 million. This is an important finding given the increased vulnerability of wheat production to climatic variability in this region. "

Drought, in particular, represents one of the most important natural factors contributing to malnutrition and famine in many parts of the region. The overall impact of drought on a given country/region and its ability to recover from the resulting social, economic and environmental impacts depends on several factors. The economic, social and environmental impacts of drought are huge in \{SSA\} and the national costs and losses incurred threaten to undermine the wider economic and development gains made in the last few decades in the region. There is an urgent need to reduce the vulnerability of countries to climate variability and to the threats posed by climate change. This paper attempts to highlight the challenges of drought in \{SSA\} and reviews the current drought risk management strategies, especially the promising technological and policy options for managing drought risks to protect livelihoods and reduce vulnerability. The review suggests the possibilities of several ex ante and ex post drought management strategies in \{SSA\} although their effectiveness depends on agro-climatic and socio-economic conditions. Existing technological, policy and institutional risk management measures need to be strengthened and integrated to manage drought ex ante and to minimize the ex post negative effects for vulnerable households and regions. A proactive approach that combines promising technological, institutional and policy solutions to manage the risks within vulnerable communities implemented by institutions operating at different levels (community, sub-national, and national) is considered to be the way forward for managing drought and climate variability.

Maize grain is the key Mexican staple produced for home consumption and the market. Maize crop residues (stover) are an important by-product, primarily for feed use, often through in situ stubble grazing and/or as ex situ forage. This paper explores maize stover use along the agro-ecological gradient and the potential trade-offs, particularly the widespread use of maize stover as feed against its potential use as mulch (soil cover) to manage soil health within the context of conservation agriculture. The paper builds on three case study areas in Mexico in contrasting agro-ecologies: (semi-)arid, temperate highland and tropical sub-humid. Data were obtained through expert consultation and semi-structured farmer group/community surveys. Although in situ grazing is found in all three study sites, it represented the bulk of stover use in only one site (70% of stover in the sub-humid tropics), with ex situ feed dominating in the other two sites (&gt;80%). Maize stover commercialization is limited and mainly restricted to households with no livestock and often within the local context. Farmers are generally hesitant to adopt conservation agricultural practices that require the retention of stover as mulch, as this competes with their livestock feed needs and purchased feed is expensive. To reduce trade-offs, a portfolio of options could be adapted to these mixed systems, including partial residue retention, cover and feed crops and sustainable intensification. Promising but yet to be explored, are investments in the genetic improvement of maize stover feed quality. "

Field experiments were carried out in high radiation, irrigated conditions in \{NW\} Mexico in two seasons. Comparing the two groups of +Tin1 and −Tin1 \{DH\} lines, results showed the presence of the +Tin1 gene for tiller inhibition increased spike partitioning index (spike DM/above-ground \{DM\} at \{GS61\} + 5 d; SPI) from 0.32 to 0.34 (+6.3%) (P &lt; 0.01) and grains spike−1 by 5.1 (+13.9%) (P &lt; 0.001), but reduced spikes m−2 by 20.7 (−5.7%) (P &lt; 0.01). Overall a significant increase in grains m−2 of 865 (+6.6%) was observed in +Tin1 \{DH\} lines compared to −Tin1 \{DH\} lines (P &lt; 0.05), but the effect on grain yield was not statistically significant. Above-grouund biomass at anthesis was not significantly affected by the presence/absence of the Tin1 gene; although results indicated the presence of the Tin1 gene increased photosynthetically active radiation interception from onset of stem elongation to anthesis, but decreased radiation-use efficiency during this phase. Our results indicated that introgressing the +Tin1 gene into modern wheat germplasm may offer scope to increase grains spike−1 and grains m−2 in irrigated, high radiation environments. "

To address these challenges, conservation agriculture (CA) based crop management practices are being developed, adapted and promoted in the region. We evaluated agronomical productivity and economical profitability of various combinations of tillage, crop establishment and residue management practices in rice–wheat rotation of Eastern \{IGP\} of India: a smallholder, poorly resourced and most vulnerable regions for the climatic variability. The long-term trial was initiated in 2006 having 7 combinations of tillage, crop establishment and residue management in rice–wheat rotation. These consisted of conventional till puddled transplanted rice followed by conventional tilled wheat (CTR–CTW); \{CTR\} followed by zero tilled wheat (CTR–ZTW); direct seeded rice followed by wheat both on permanent raised beds (PBDSR–PBW); zero-till direct seeded rice followed by \{CTW\} (ZTDSR–CTW); \{ZTDSR\} followed by \{ZTW\} without residues (ZTDSR–ZTW); \{ZTDSR\} followed by \{ZTW\} with residues (ZTDSR–ZTW + R) and unpuddled transplanted rice followed by \{ZTW\} (UpTPR–ZTW). All these treatments were completely randomized and replicated thrice within a block. During the initial three years of experimentation, we recorded higher rice grain yield in conventional tillage based rice systems (i.e. CTR–CTW and CTR–ZTW) than in \{CA\} based systems (i.e. ZTDSR–ZTW, UpTPR–ZTW). During the fourth and fifth years, the rice yields under \{CT\} and \{CA\} were comparable whereas sixth year onwards, higher yields were recorded under \{CA\} based system than in \{CT\} based systems. However, the wheat yield was higher in \{CA\} based system right from second year onwards. We observed the lowest wheat yield in the system where preceding rice crop was grown with intensive tillage operations (CTR). \{RW\} system productivity was higher in almost all the \{CA\} based systems than in the \{CT\} based and mixture of \{CT\} and \{CA\} based systems from the second year onwards. The net returns were always higher in \{CA\} based systems than in \{CT\} based system although the significant differences were obvious only from fourth year onwards in rice and second year onwards in wheat as well as at the system level. The higher grain yields and economical advantage of \{CA\} was realized after 2–3 years as the adaptation of \{CA\} based component technologies evolved over the time. In medium term, we found \{CA\} based systems to be agronomically and economically superior to \{CT\} based systems for rice–wheat rotation in a smallholder production system of Eastern \{IGP\} of South Asia. Hence, \{CA\} based \{RW\} production system is one of the pathways for improving productivity, income and food security while sustaining the natural resources in smallholder production systems of Eastern IGP.

In financial terms, boro (winter) rice is the most profitable crop in irrigated zones, but wheat often generates the highest returns in non-irrigated zones and in areas that are unsuitable for boro rice production. When inputs and outputs are assigned economic prices, wheat production represents the most efficient use of domestic resources in most non-irrigated zones and in one irrigated zone. Should present trends continue and Bangladesh become self-sufficient in rice, wheat production would become even more attractive. In view of these findings, recent calls to scale back wheat promotion activities and curtail investment in wheat research must be questioned. "

When kept on the soil surface instead of feeding them to livestock, crop residues can contribute to increasing soil fertility and maintaining crop productivity in the short- and the long-term. We explored these trade-offs for smallholder cotton–sorghum farming systems in the semi-arid Zambezi Valley, northern Zimbabwe. The analysis was done using simulation models at three scales, the plot, the farm and the territory, to simulate the effects of different sorghum residue allocations to livestock feeding vs. soil mulching, in combination with different application rates of mineral nitrogen fertilizer on crop productivity. The plot-scale simulations suggest that without N fertilization soil mulching has a positive effect on cotton yields only if small quantities of sorghum residues are used as mulch (average cotton yields of 2.24 ± 0.41 kg ha−1 with a mulch of 100 kg ha−1 vs. 1.91 ± 0.29 kg ha−1 without mulch). Greater quantities of mulch have a negative effect on cotton yield without N fertilization due to N immobilization in the soil microbial biomass. With applications of 100 kg N ha−1, quantities of mulch up to 3 t ha−1 have no negative effect on cotton yield. Results at farm-scale highlight the fundamental role of livestock as a source of traction, and the need to feed a greater proportion of sorghum residues to livestock as herd and farm sizes increase. Farmers with no livestock attained maximum crop production when 100% of their sorghum residue remained in the field, as they do not have access to cattle manure. The optimum fraction of crop residue to be retained in the fields for maximum farm crop production varied for farmers with 2 or less heads of cattle (80% retention), with 2–3 heads (60–80%), with 4 or more heads (40–60%). At the scale of the entire territory, total cotton and sorghum production increased with the density of cattle, at the expense of soil mulching with crop residues. The results of our simulations suggest that (i) the optimum level of residue retention depends on the scale at which trade-offs are analyzed; (ii) the retention of all of the crop residue as mulch appears unrealistic and undesirable in farming systems that rely on livestock for traction; and (iii) crop residue mulching could be made more attractive to farmers by paying due attention to balancing C to N ratios in the soil and by promoting small-scale mechanization to replace animal traction.

The results indicated that consumption of \{QPM\} instead of conventional maize leads to a 12% (95% CI: 7–18%) increase in the rate of growth in weight and a 9% (95% CI: 6–15%) increase in the rate of growth in height in infants and young children with mild to moderate undernutrition from populations in which maize is the major staple food.

The study is based on a comprehensive dataset of 4173 rural households from all the agro-ecological regions of Bhutan. The probit estimation on the factors influencing household participation indicates that educated, young and wealthy households are more likely to participate in the community forest management program. The propensity score matching (PSM) approach was employed to correct for potential sample selection bias that may arise due to systematic differences between the participant and non-participant households. The \{PSM\} analysis was carried out by employing different matching algorithms i.e. nearest neighbor matching, kernel-based matching, radius matching and mahalanobis metric matching. The empirical results indicate that participating households have higher income levels in the range of Ngultrum 2605–3169. In addition, the study finds that the participation in community forest management by households may reduce poverty in the range of 5–12 percentage point. The participating households have higher food security levels in the range of 12%–19% as compared to non-participating households. "

Nitrogen (N) is the key nutrient for crop production in rice–wheat cropping systems in this region. Nitrogen dynamics of dry seeded rice-(aerobic, anaerobic) planted in rotation with wheat (well drained, aerobic) can differ greatly from those of conventional rice cultivation. Soil mineral N dynamics in flood irrigated rice has extensively been studied and understood, however, the impact of establishment method and residue levels on this dynamics remains unknown. Experiments on resource conservation technologies were conducted between 2008 and 2009 to assess the impact of two establishment methods (beds and flats) in combination with three (R0, \{R50\} and R100) residue levels and two irrigation modes (alternate wet and dry (AWD) irrigation (all zero till), and a continuously flooded conventional tillage (dry tillage)) with water seeded rice (WSR) on the mineral N dynamics under dry seeded rice (DSR)-surface seeded wheat systems. N balance from the top 80 cm soil layers indicated that 32–70% (122–236 kg ha−1) mineral N was unaccounted (lost) during rice cropping. The amount of unaccounted mineral N was affected by the irrigation method. Residue retention increased (p &lt; 0.001) the unaccounted mineral N content by 38%. With \{AWD\} irrigation, the N loss was not different among dry seeded rice in flat (DSRF), dry seeded rice in bed (DSRB), and conventional tillage WSR. Under different irrigation, establishment methods and residue levels, unaccounted mineral N was mainly affected by plant N uptake and soil mineral N content. Major amounts (43–58%) of unaccounted mineral N from \{DSR\} field occurred between seeding and panicle initiation (PI). During the entire rice and wheat growing seasons, \{NH4N\} consistently remained at very high levels, while, \{NO3N\} remained at very low levels in all treatments. In rice, the irrigation method affected \{NH4N\} content. Effect of residue retention and establishment methods were not significant on \{NH4N\} and \{NO3N\} dynamics in both crops and years. Further evidence of the continuously fluctuating water filled pore spaces (WFPS) of 64% and the microbial aerobic activity of 93% at the top 10 cm soil surface during rice growing season indicates soil in the \{DSR\} treatments was under frequent aerobic–anaerobic transformation, a conditions very conducive for higher amounts of N loss. In \{DSR\} treatments, the losses appeared to be caused by a combination of denitrification, leaching and N immobilization. When intending to use a \{DSR\} management strategies need to be developed for appropriate N management, irrigation scheduling, and residue use to increase mineral N availability and uptake before this practices can be recommended.

During the last decade significant numbers of Bhutanese households have switched to cleaner energy sources. Empirical results show that a household׳s choice of cleaner energy sources is driven by income level and household wealth, the age, gender and education of the household heads, access to electricity, and location. Education and income have a differential role on the choice of clean or dirty fuel; wealthier and more educated households use and rely more on clean sources of energy like electricity and liquid petroleum gas while poorer households use and rely on dirty fuel such as fuelwood and kerosene. The study shows that female-headed households are more likely to choose cleaner fuels and, above all, the availability of a clean and cost-effective source of energy within proximity to the household is an important factor in the adoption of clean energy. Several models using a variety of alternative independent variables, such as proxies for education and wealth, were estimated and confirmed the robustness of the results. "

abstract = "Abstract There is strong advocacy for agricultural machinery appropriate for smallholder farmers in South Asia. Such ‘scale-appropriate’ machinery can increase returns to land and labour, although the still substantial capital investment required can preclude smallholder ownership. Increasing machinery demand has resulted in relatively well-developed markets for rental services for tillage, irrigation, and post-harvest operations. Many smallholders thereby access agricultural machinery that may have otherwise been cost prohibitive to purchase through fee-for-service arrangements, though opportunity for expansion remains. To more effectively facilitate the development and investment in scale-appropriate machinery, there is a need to better understand the factors associated with agricultural machinery purchases and service provision. This paper first reviews Bangladesh’s historical policy environment that facilitated the development of agricultural machinery markets. It then uses recent Bangladesh census data from 814,058 farm households to identify variables associated with the adoption of the most common smallholder agricultural machinery – irrigation pumps, threshers, and power tillers (mainly driven by two-wheel tractors). Multinomial probit model results indicate that machinery ownership is positively associated with household assets, credit availability, electrification, and road density. These findings suggest that donors and policy makers should focus not only on short-term projects to boost machinery adoption. Rather, sustained emphasis on improving physical and civil infrastructure and services, as well as assuring credit availability, is also necessary to create an enabling environment in which the adoption of scale-appropriate farm machinery is most likely.

Conservation agriculture (CA) based management practices such as conservation tillage, permanent raised beds and relay planting have the potential to improve sustainability, profitability, and water use efficiency in CWS. A two-year (2013–2015) field experiment was conducted to evaluate \{CA\} based management practices such as zero tillage (ZT), permanent beds, relay seeding (RS) of wheat, seeding configuration, and integration of mungbean (MB) in terms of crop productivity, input use efficiency (water and energy) and profitability in the \{CWS\} system. Treatments included; permanent narrow (67.5 cm, PNB) and broad (102 cm, PBB) raised beds with cotton planted in the centre of beds, \{ZT\} narrow flats (67.5 cm, ZTNF) and broad flats (102 cm, ZTBF), and \{PBB\} with cotton planted on one side of bed and intercropped with \{MB\} (PBBc + MB) or no \{MB\} (PBBc). In the above treatments, wheat was relay seeded in standing cotton after second picking. In addition, conventional till (CT) \{CWS\} on flats was included as control treatment. \{PBBc\} + \{MB\} produced 37% and 10% higher system productivity (2 yrs’ mean) over \{CT\} and PBB, respectively. Relay seeded wheat on \{PBB\} produced 50% higher yield and required 40% less irrigation water compared to \{CT\} wheat in both the years. Mean system irrigation water productivity (WPI) was 131% higher with \{PBBc\} + \{MB\} compared with CT. The energy input was 61% higher in \{CT\} compared to \{PBB\} but energy output was 21% higher with \{PBB\} than with CT. \{PBB\} and \{PBBc\} + \{MB\} recorded 52–54% higher energy productivity and 64–69% higher net returns compared to CT.

The \{SWCB\} infests maize in the high latitude and mid-altitude areas and \{SCB\} infests maize in the lowland tropical areas in Mexico. The hybrids tested were Ki3 × CML131, \{CML67\} × 135 and \{CML139\} × 135, and the inbreds tested were Ki3, CML67, CML131, \{CML135\} and CML139. Nonpreference and/or antibiosis were the mechanisms of resistance expressed by the hybrids \{CML67\} × 135 and \{CML139\} × 135 grown in the fields as indicated by the low leaf feeding damage, low larval survival of the two species. The resistance in the two resistant hybrids evidently came from the resistant inbreds \{CML67\} and \{CML139\} because the parameters measured for non-preference and antibiosis were also very low in these resistant inbreds in comparison to CML131, Ki3 and CML135. Laboratory studies also indicated that feeding non-preference and/or antibiosis was the first line of defence in the resistant hybrids (CML67 × 135 and \{CML139\} × 135) and inbreds (CML67 and 139) against the attack of stem borers. The survival and growth of the larvae were then adversely affected because of antibiosis in resistant plants to two species of borers. Because of non-preference and antibiosis mechanisms of resistance, the hybrids \{CML67\} × 135 and \{CML139\} × 135 suffered little from leaf and stalk damage, and thus lost little grain yield (3–4%) in comparison to the susceptible hybrid Ki3 × \{CML131\} (35–40%) under heavy infestation by the \{SWCB\} and \{SCB\} in the fields. These resistant hybrids can be readily used in the integrated pest management (IPM) programs under subsistance farming conditions in the subtropical and tropical environments to reduce yield reductions and increase food production, if grain color, texture, taste and grain quality are acceptable.

abstract = "The spotted stem borer (SSB) Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is an important pest of maize in several countries of Asia and Africa. Serious crop losses have been reported, mostly in experiments conducted under artificial infestations at experimental stations. In order to develop an economical and environmentally friendly method of pest management, a large number of maize genotypes with varying levels of resistance to \{SSB\} have been identified. In resistant germplasm, all three components of resistance, namely, nonpreference, antibiosis, and tolerance, have been identified. In Asia, various studies have been conducted to elucidate the mechanism of resistance/susceptibility in two maize genotypes, Antigua Group 1 (Resistant) and Basi Local (Susceptible), against SSB. Several biological parameters including \{SSB\} larval and pupal survival, larval and pupal weights, larval and pupal period and fecundity were adversely affected due to unknown factors in the resistant source but not in the susceptible source. An ethanolic extract of Mex 17 has also been reported to inhibit the growth and development of SSB. The studies in Africa show that ovipositional nonpreference by \{SSB\} on maize genotypes was due to the presence of trichomes and surface waxes. One genotype, ICZ-T, with trichomes on both the leaf surfaces was developed. In some studies, using regression of grain yield reduction on foliar injury due to \{SSB\} attack on two maize genotypes, namely, ICZ1-CM and ICZ2-CM, both antibiosis and tolerance were reported to be the components of resistance. In more detailed studies in Africa, nonpreference, antibiosis and tolerance types of resistance mechanisms have been reported to be operating within maize genotypes Mp704, Poza Rica 7832 and ER-29SVR. The resistance mechanisms operating within these sources have also been reported in crosses with agronomically desirable sources. "

A significant quality trait variability was observed for all parameters evaluated. Comparison of sister lines with and without the 1B/1R translocation showed that variations in SDS-sedimentation volume. Alveograph characteristics, dough mixing and baking properties cannot be attributed exclusively to the presence of the 1B/1R translocation. Finally, the poor breadmaking properties, particularly dough stickiness, associated with one Mexican (Glennson 81) and two Australian (QT-2870 and SUN-89D) cultivars could not be confirmed when doughs were mixed under medium-speed mixing conditions.

For natural infestation, genotypes were grown under the prevailing natural population of C. partellus. At harvest, data were recorded on individual plants. A highly significant correlation was observed between number of holes and stem tunneling (expressed as the absolute tunnel length or the percentage of stem length tunneled) by C. partellus on four maize genotypes. The relationships between the parameters varied with genotype and plant phenological stages at infestation. Damage by C. partellus to grain and stem was not consistently correlated among genotypes and phenological stages at infestation. These results indicate that number of holes can be used in place of the laborious method of splitting stalks for determining resistance in maize against C. partellus. The solitary parasitoid Dentichasmias busseolae Heirc. was found to parasitize C. partellus pupae. Parasitization was highest on \{PR\} 7832 (50–57%) followed by Inbred A (40%), \{MMV\} 400 (37%) and \{MBR\} 8637 (29%).

Her specific hypothesis for Malawi is that the removal of the fertilizer subsidy affects women farmers more than men farmers because it reduces fertilizer use on local maize. As part of the structural adjustment program, a major purpose of removing the fertilizer subsidy is to reallocate resources from food production for domestic consumption to cash crop production for export. In Gladwin's analysis, men farmers produce hybrid maize and tobacco for export and women produce the subsistence food crop, local maize. Gladwin's main contention is probably correct. For the Malawi case, the presentation does not support the hypothesis because two of the major underlying assumptions are inappropriate and the evidence provided is inconclusive. This comment proceeds by discussing the two assumptions and corresponding evidence. The purpose of this comment is not to contradict the hypothesis, but to clarify the Malawi situation and to suggest that a different analytical approach is needed in that context. "

The same randomization plan was used for each comparison. Traits examined were anthesis date, plant height, ear-leaf chlorophyll concentration, number of green leaves below the ear at two dates during grain filling, leaf disease (Exserohilum turcicum) score, and grain yield. Significant correlations between the difference of progeny performance in non- versus self-bordered plots and mean performance of adjacent plots were detected, indicating the presence of intergenotypic competition under both N levels. Changes in rank that occurred between progenies grown in non- versus self-bordered plots did not, however, lead to statistically significant progeny × plot-size interactions. With limited N supply, the residual variance of progenies when grown in the smaller non-bordered plots was usually less than when grown in the larger, self-bordered plots, indicating that soil heterogeneity was probably the main source of residual variance in that trial. Generally, intergenotypic competition explained less than 10% of the difference in performance of progenies in non- versus self-bordered plots. It is concluded that statistical procedures and additional bordering, which would reduce the effects of intergenotypic competition, would only marginally improve selection efficiency in progeny trials, and that under most conditions the extra expenditure on seed and land that these entail would not be justified.

The objective of this study was to evaluate potential selection criteria for improving the tolerance of maize cultivars to low soil N supply. Relationships among primary (grain yield) and secondary traits were examined at two N levels among full-sib families forming part of two selection cycles (C0 and C2) of a recurrent selection scheme in the tropical maize population Across 8328 BN. This population was undergoing improvement for grain yield under low soil N while maintaining yield potential under fertile conditions. The phenotypic correlations (rp) between grain yields at +N and −N, among full-sib progenies, were weak (rp=0.11 to 0.38, with 224 to 251 df), though the genetic correlation (rg) was stronger (rg = 0.51). Significant values of rp between grain yield under low N and ear-leaf chlorophyll concentration, ear-leaf area, plant height, the anthesis-silking interval and senescence rate were detected under low soil N (−N). These associations were less strong when traits were measured under high soil N (+N). Genetic and phenotypic correlations were generally similar in sign and magnitude, except in the case of ear-leaf chlorophyll concentration, which showed no genetic correlation with grain yield −N, even though the value of rp ranged from 0.45 to 0.74. Divergent full-sib selection was performed for grain yield and for correlated secondary traits in \{C0\} and \{C2\} of Across 8328 BN. When divergent selections from both cycles were evaluated under two N levels, the largest grain yields under − N were obtained from direct selection for that trait. Simultaneous selection for yield and secondary traits in \{C0\} resulted in increased biomass production at both N levels. The realized heritability (h2) for grain yield at − N was: 0.32 to 0.58; grain yield at + N: 0.20 to 0.46; grain yield across N levels: 0.16 to 0.27; ear-leaf area at − N: 0.18 to 0.74; ear-leaf chlorophyll concentration at − N: 0 to 0.21; and green leaf number below the ear at − N: 0.13 to 0.23. These results indicate that selection for yield and correlated traits under low N should result in improved maize performance in the low-N target environment, with modest increases in yield potential in fertile environments.

Superior families were identified from an index of traits comprising high grain yields under high (200 kg N ha−1) and low N (zero applied), and, under low N, high chlorophyll concentration per unit ear-leaf area, slow leaf senescence, and increased plant height. An attempt was made to keep plant height and time to flower under high N unchanged. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes which resulted from this selection program. Cycles 0, 1, 2, and 3 were evaluated under two N levels (0 and 200 kg N ha−1) in four seasons. The per cycle linear increase in grain yield under low N was 2.8% (0.075 Mg ha−1) (P &lt;0.10), and under high N was 2.3% (0.137 Mg ha−1) (P&lt;0.01), indicating that improved performance at low N is not incompatible with yield gains under high N. Increased grain yields were associated with significant linear increases per cycle, measured across N levels, in kernels ear−1 (4.6 kernels ear−1; 1.6%), plant height (8 cm; 4.4%), days to anthesis (0.3 d; 0.4%), aboveground biomass at silking (0.182 Mg ha−1; 3.5%) and at maturity (0.205 Mg ha−1; 1.9%), and N loss from vegetative parts during grain-filling (0.14 g m−2; 4.8%). Across N levels, there was a significant decrease in the number of florets formed per ear (−8 florets ear−1; −1.5%), but an increase in the proportion of florets that formed kernels (0.016 cycle−1; 3.1%). Leaf senescence rate decreased with selection. Selection cycles differed significantly in total N uptake and patterns of N and biomass accumulation with time, but no consistent trends were observed for those traits. Selection for performance under low N in elite maize germplasm appears to improve the efficiency with which N is utilized to produce biomass and grain. "

The objective of this study was to identify the possible causes of increase variation in grain yield with selection for tolerance to low soil N in four cycles of selection (C0 to C3) of the lowland tropical maize population, Across 8328 BN, when grown in 12 irrigated environments characterized by different radiation and N availabilities. Yield components and patterns of biomass and N partitioning were examined. Correlation analysis of the data collected indicated that some relationships among traits thought to be important to performance differed in magnitude and sign among environments. For example, a positive correlation was observed between grain yield and preflowering N accumulation in the high-N environments, but no association was observed among these traits at low N. Correlations also differed significantly among seasons within an N level for some traits. For example, the correlation between final grain N concentration and N floret−1 at flowering under low N was 0.97 (P &lt; 0.03) in one season, and that correlation was -0.98 in a subsequent season. An analysis of yield components and N concentrations in plant parts indicated that yield variation in \{C1\} (the selection cycle which had the greatest variation among environments) was associated with an over-investment in preflowering vegetative biomass, without a concomitant increase in post-flowering grain sink size. By C3, the number of kernels plant−1 had been increased, but yield apparently was limited by inadequate source capacity in the latter stages of grain-filling. Cycle 3 also produced 25% more root biomass than \{C0\} when grown with adequate N supply in pots, while aboveground biomass increased by a smaller proportion (9%). Changes in biomass partitioning to roots may be an important adaptation to low-N environments. These results indicate that seasonal differences in the timing and magnitude of N and C supply play a large role in determining the adaptive value of a given trait, even when environments may be similar in the amount of N applied to, or absorbed by, the under nonlimiting N levels, and extensive testing in environments differing in C and N abundance seems essential to establishing progress from such breeding schemes. In addition, more effort to quantify the extent and timing of N stress in each season appears justified. "

To make selections, the breeder must weight the importance of yield to stability. On the assumption that the plant breeder prefers varieties which minimize the probability of disastrously low yields, a general index is proposed which explicitly shows how the plant breeder weighs the importance of mean yield to stability. This index was applied to six internationamaize (Zea mays L.) yield trials using various stability models. Results indicated that the choice of a stability model can have a substantial effect on the desirability of a variety, and that inclusion of a measure of stability in the index may significantly alter the ranking of varieties compared with considering only the mean yield. The proposed index approach can be a practical way of making selectionsin the presence of cultivar × environment interaction when stability is a major concern. "

The synthetics were produced from various crosses involving several Triticum lurgidum cultivars and Triticum lauschii (coss.) Schmal accessions. The Glu-A1 null allele as well as three Glu-B1 (subunits 7 + 8, 6 + 8 and 20), 13 Glu-D1 and two Glu-B3 (LMW-1 and LMW-2) allelic variants were present in the synthetic population. Thirty-six different glutenin subunit combinations, including the Glu-B1, Glu-D1 and Glu-B3 encoded alleles, were observed. The synthetic hexaploids showed large variations for all quality parameters evaluated. All quality characteristics except one (P/G ratio, which showed no association with allelic variations at Glu-B3) were influenced by allelic variations at the Glu-B1 and Glu-B3 loci; subunits 6 + 8 and 7 + 8 showed significantly better quality effects than subunit 20. Low Mr glutenin subunits LMW-1 and LMW-2 showed both negative and positive quality effects. The Glu-D1 locus of T. tauschii contributed various alleles not found in bread wheat. The influence of new Glu-D1 alleles on the bread-making quality characteristics of the synthetic wheats could not be established, partly because there was a limited frequency of some of the alleles in the population, and partly because some synthetics, having a common Glu-D1 allele, showed quality differences associated with allelic variation at Glu-B1 and/or Glu-B3. Differential quality effects could be observed, however, among some Glu-D1 alleles. Synthetics derived from a common durum wheat source showed better overall quality characteristics and bread loaf volume when they possessed subunits 5 + 12 or 1·5 + 10 than when they had any other Glu-D1 encoded glutenin subunit.

A variety of crops, such as peanut, soybean, sunflower, pigeon pea showed greater economic potential than maize. The productivity of the best rotation under low soil fertility conditions was five times greater than maize mono-cropping. All crop rotation treatments reduced Striga seed numbers in the soil. Less Striga emerged if maize was planted after a two- season rotation that included pigeon pea.

These hybrids were sown on land with conventional tillage, minimum tillage and zero tillage, with and without mulch, in infested and insecticide—protected plots. The resistance/susceptibility of these hybrids against FAW, \{SCB\} and \{SWCB\} was not altered by the tillage systems. Hybrids planted under zero-tillage+mulch suffered significantly higher damage by \{SCB\} and \{FAW\} probably because of the retention of moisture in the mulch, which provided optimum conditions for larval feeding. Damage by \{SWCB\} on hybrids was the same in different tillage systems because of relatively dry conditions prevailing in the trial. Grain yield of the four hybrids was generally higher in zero-tilled plots in comparison to conventional or minimum tillage systems. These observations support the use of zero-tillage for maize production. Data also show that \{FAW\} infestation at 4–5 leaf stage caused grain yield reduction of 10–13% across all tillage systems in the tropical environment but in a subtropical environment, yield reduction was only 1–2%. Grain yield of the hybrids Ki3×CML139 and Ki3×CML69 was affected by \{SCB\} infestation in all the tillage systems but that of CML67×135 and Ki3×CML131 was not affected. \{SWCB\} infestation on the hybrid Ki3×CML131 was less in the infested plots but that of remaining hybrids was the same in infested and protected plots in different tillage systems.

The diverging institutional environment including varying levels of intervention in produce and input markets contributed to the evolution of the Pakistani production model as relatively ‘medium input–medium output’ and the Indian production model as ‘high input–high output’.

On a theoretical basis, it is concluded that larger primary ears lead to greater grain yields at all plant growth rates, and that increased prolificacy leads to greater grain yields only if plant growth rate exceeds a threshold. Under nitrogen limited growing conditions, selecting for genotypes that extract more nitrogen from soils, and for delayed leaf senescence, show promise for increasing yields. For crop growth limited by moisture availability around flowering, continued selection for improved kernel set leads to greater grain yields. "

It occurs either singly or as a complex of spot blotch (caused by Cochliobolus sativus) and tan spot (caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis). Several abiotic stresses in the region affect the development and severity of HLB. A field study was conducted using three wheat cultivars (Sonalika=RR21, Bhrikuti and BL1473) during the 2001 and 2002 wheat seasons at two sites (farmer’s field and research station) in Nepal, where \{HLB\} is a serious problem every year. The objective was to determine the effect of low soil moisture and poor soil fertility in combination with foliar blight severity under natural inoculum pressure on the agronomic performance of timely and late-seeded wheat. The experiment was conducted in a multiple-strip layout in a randomized block with three replicates. Soil fertility stress was evaluated by using the recommended doses of N, P and K as opposed to no chemical fertilizer. Three irrigations and no irrigation were used to assess the effect of soil moisture stress. The experiment included normal and late seeding dates to take into account the average air temperature which increases as the wheat season progresses. Multiple \{HLB\} scores were recorded to calculate the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) and \{AUDPC\} per day was determined. Soil fertility stress increased \{AUDPC\} by 28.4%. Overall, soil fertility stress had a more pronounced effect on disease levels than reduced moisture stress, probably because rain had diminished the difference between moisture stress. \{HLB\} induced reductions of 20.5 and 15.5% in grain yield and thousand-kernel weight (TKW), respectively, under late seeding, compared to 13 and 7.8% under timely sown conditions. Under low soil fertility, reductions in grain yield and \{TKW\} due to \{HLB\} were 52.1 and 15.5%, respectively, compared to 26.1 and 8.0% under optimum soil fertility. \{HLB\} caused yield reduction of 22.1% under low soil moisture compared to 11.8% under optimum soil moisture. Compared to timely sown wheat, \{AUDPC\} per day and reductions in grain yield due to \{HLB\} were always higher under late seeding suggesting that \{AUDPC\} per day explained yield losses better than AUDPC. These findings demonstrate the joint effects of crop management factors on \{HLB\} severity and associated grain yield losses both under farmer’s field and research station conditions. The results imply that optimum crop husbandry must be adopted to minimize wheat yield losses due to HLB. "

On-farm impacts of zero tillage wheat in South Asia's rice–wheat systems. Field Crop Res. 105, 240–252]. The underlying field work surveyed plots of full adopters (only \{ZT\} plots), partial adopters (ZT and conventional tillage [CT] plots on same farm) and non-adopters (only \{CT\} plots). The companion paper assumes that the comparison between the \{ZT\} plots of full plus partial adopters and \{CT\} plots of partial adopters is the least-biased assessment of ZT's on-farm impact. Here we revisit this underlying assumption and draw on complementary farm survey findings to illustrate the extent of specification effects in the assessment of on-farm impacts of \{ZT\} wheat in the same study areas. The study thereby distinguishes between three contrasts between \{ZT\} and \{CT\} within the same dataset: (1) plain contrast (all plots of adopters and non-adopters); (2) adopter-only contrast (full and partial adopters only, as used in Erenstein et al. [Erenstein, O., Farooq, U., Malik, R.K., Sharif, M., 2008. On-farm impacts of zero tillage wheat in South Asia's rice–wheat systems. Field Crop Res. 105, 240–252]); (3) pair-wise contrast (partial adopters only). Proceeding from type 1 to type 3 comparisons the number of observations decrease but this is compensated by an increasing ability to control for variation. The ability of type 3 comparisons to pick up relatively small but significant differences is an important consideration in farm survey impact assessment. However, there is also an increase in partial adoption bias and further follow-up studies are needed to understand the implications of this. The comparisons show that the \{ZT\} effects on savings for diesel, tractor time and cost for wheat cultivation are particularly robust. In Haryana ZT's positive implications for yield and the other financial indicators were also statistically robust, but in Punjab these were sensitive to specification effects. Particularly sensitive to specification effects were the \{ZT\} effects on the productivity of applied water in both sites. "

The cultivars were adapted to zones characterized by different temperatures, and were grown in six environments whose mean temperature during the growing season ranged from 13°C to 28°C. Adaptation groups differed greatly in grain and total biomass production across environments, and large differences were observed in harvest index, supporting the hypothesis that temperature has important effects of dry matter partitioning to grain. All yield components were affected. The number of ears per plant, grains per ear and mass per kernel of highland-adapted cultivars declined dramatically when average site temperature exceeded about 17°C, while those of lowland-adapted cultivars were adversely affected by low temperatures. Carbon exchange rates differed among individual cultivars in all environments where that trait was measured, but significant differences were observed among adaptation groups only in the warmest environment, where rates for the highland cultivars were about 15% less than for the others. No consistent differences were observed among adaptation groups for variable chlorophyll fluorescence. Adaptation groups differed significantly in the proportion of incident radiation intercepted by the crop near flowering in three of four environments. This was due to both reduced leaf number and reduced area of individual leaves, but those differences were not proportional to the differences in grain yield among groups. Because indicators of potential assimilate flux to the ear near flowering used in this study (i.e. radiation interception and utilization) could not be consistently related to differences in harvest index among adaptation groups, direct effects of temperature on dry matter partitioning to the ear must be considered in future efforts to relate maize grain yield to temperature.

Grain yields, N uptake, and N partitioning patterns of 38 landrace accessions from CIMMYT's germplasm bank and 26 improved tropical cultivars were compared under adequate and limited levels of soil N in the winter season at Poza Rica, Mexico. The improved cultivars generally outyielded the landraces at both N levels by an average of 56%. Improved cultivars were not consistently superior, however, in total N recovery, in aboveground biomass or in the fraction of N partitioned to the grain under limited N. The landraces had greater grain N concentrations at both N levels. It is concluded that landraces can contribute useful traits for stable production in N-limited environments, but that selection on the basis of grain yield alone may be insufficient. As a part of routine screening activity, a further 171 accessions were evaluated at the same two N levels, 112 in the summer, and 59 in the winter season. A preliminary principal components analysis was used with landrace data from each season to identify key traits related to N uptake and allocation patterns. Based on these traits, cluster analysis identified six groups within each cropping season. Each cluster was divided into early and late-flowering groups, and principal components analysis was repeated within each subgroup on these variables. Some clusters performed well under adequate N but not under limited N, while others showed the opposite response. This indicated specific adaptation to N environments, in which total N accumulation, N partitioned to the grain, and grain N concentration varied independently. In some cases, the clusters revealed an association with geographical areas where accessions were collected, but no relationship was observed between precipitation at the collection sites for a cluster and crop performance. When breeding maize for large and stable grain yield under N-limited conditions a reasonable strategy would be to develop early and late-maturing source populations from landraces that exhibit large N uptake, partition a large proportion of dry matter and N to the grain, and maintain a large grain N concentration under limited N supply.

This study evaluated the effects of temperature on development and yield of maize cultivars differing in both adaptation and selection history. Experiments were sown in seven tropical environments where the mean temperature during the growing season varied from 13°C to 28°C. Cultivars adapted to tropical highland, tropical midaltitude, tropical lowland and temperate environments were included. Among these were comparisons of cycles 0 and 6 (C0, C6) of three populations, which had been improved through international progeny trials grown at several sites within specific adaptation zones. An additional cultivar, CIMMYT's Largo del Dia, was represented as 100 full-sib progenies, and grown in an adjacent trial in each environment. This cultivar was formed by selecting within a broadly-based composite for yield across adaptation zones, and for photoperiod insensitivity. Measures of development included rates of emergence and leaf appearance, and times to anthesis and silking. Final leaf number, grain yield, and yield components were also measured. In two of the three comparisons, \{C6\} selections significantly outyielded their \{C0\} equivalents across environments. No differences between \{C0\} and \{C6\} were observed in yield stability, as measured by standard deviation of yield across environments, or in developmental patterns. Principal components and cluster analyses revealed that Largo del Día differed from other cultivars in emergence rate, leaf appearance rate, and anthesis date. Across environments its mean grain yield was generally similar to that of the temperate cultivar, and had the smallest standard deviation. The range of grain yields among full-sib progenies of Largo del Día was similar to that observed among cultivars of different adaptation groups. Selection within a broad-based population for adaptation to diverse environments resulted in a cultivar with a unique response of development to temperature, more stable grain yield over a wide range of temperatures, but with less specific adaptation to any single environment. While the temperate maize cultivar also exhibited stable yields across environments, tropical cultivars were more specific in their adaptation. Results indicate that it may not be possible to select a cultivar with high and stable grain yield across temperatures ranging from 13°C to 28°C, because cool- and warm-temperature adaptation may be mutually exclusive traits. Broad adaptation is possible across a more moderate range of temperatures, however and can be improved by selection. "

(including both winter and spring habit wheat) is the number one crop in northern China, and currently almost all irrigated wheat is conventionally planted in narrow spaced rows on the flat and is irrigated by flood irrigation within bordered basins. Conventional flat planting for winter wheat has some disadvantages. The use of flood irrigation can result in a low potential irrigation water use efficiency and inefficient use of nitrogen. It can also cause crusting of the soil surface following irrigation and can contribute to the degradation of some soil properties. In addition, it can result in higher levels of crop lodging. A raised bed-planting system with a number of defined rows (usually two to four rows) planted on top of the bed with furrow irrigation was found to overcome these disadvantages. The benefits of the raised bed-planting system with furrow irrigation compared with conventional flat planting with flood irrigation were found as follows: first, there was a savings in some years of as much as 30% of applied irrigation water combined with enhanced water use efficiency by changing from flood to furrow irrigation; second, the crust problem on the soil surface was eliminated and soil physical status was greatly improved; third, nitrogen use efficiency could be improved by 10% or more because of improved nitrogen placement possibilities; fourth, the microclimate within the field was changed due to the orientation of the wheat plants in rows on the beds with the bed-planting system, which reduced crop lodging and decreased the incidence of some wheat diseases. These advantages, interacting together, were found to improve grain quality and increase grain yield by more than 10%. "

The paper illustrates the use of village surveys as a quasi-quantitative system analysis tool to derive implications for agricultural research and development. Drawing from village surveys in 170 communities, the paper assesses current crop residue management practices in Punjab and Haryana’s rice–wheat, basmati–wheat and non-rice–wheat cropping systems. The prevalence of wheat as the winter crop implies an intensive collection, trading and use of wheat straw as basal feed for dairy livestock; which contrasts with the diverse crop residue management of the monsoon crops. The increased use of combine harvesters has spurred the rapid advent of mechanical wheat straw reapers whereas the bulk of combine harvested rice straw is burned in situ. Present crop residue management practices are largely incompatible with year-round mulch retention despite significant biomass production. The research and development community faces the challenge of evening out straw use and management over seasons to ensure at least partial residue retention if its calls for conservation agriculture in this important sub-region are to succeed. The paper also reiterates the worrying decline of groundwater tables associated with the rice–wheat system. "

abstract = "Abstract Conservation agriculture (CA) is promoted worldwide to enhance soil quality, improve farmers’ incomes and increase the resilience of rainfed agro-ecosystems under climate change. A major constraint to the adoption of \{CA\} is crop residue management in mixed crop–livestock systems. Farmers have competing uses of crop residues – for soil cover, as fodder or as additional income source – which may explain low \{CA\} adoption rates in some countries. This paper describes the social and income trade-offs of different crop residue uses in Mexico at regional, community and household level associated with the introduction of CA. We first spatially analyze the importance of crop residues for fodder supply and identify municipalities with fodder surplus at national and regional level. Second, we assess the likely social trade-offs and implications for farming communities of changing a typical farm households’ residue allocation. Third, we identify the effects of crop residue uses on gross margins of maize and barley and assess the economic optimal crop residue allocation at the farm level with short planning horizons. The paper focuses on maize and barley producers in the central Mexican highlands and combines primary quantitative and qualitative data with secondary data. Analysis shows that at a national level, Mexico has a fodder surplus while the central highlands have a deficit. Crop residues are a major fodder source in Mexico, contributing up to 40% of fodder availability. Crop residues are also an important income source which implies costs for introducing \{CA\} in the central highlands. Our analysis indicates that retaining crop residues in-situ influences gross margins and that retention of roughly 45% of residues maximizes gross margins in situations where opportunity costs for the use of crop residues exist. Partial residue retention, sequential introduction and combination of technologies may facilitate \{CA\} uptake but \{CA\} remains a challenge for resource-poor farmers given their limited liquidity, risky production environment and difficulty to forego current income for future benefits. More interdisciplinary research is needed around economic optimal residue retention levels under different farming and production conditions, to identify the ecological needed minimum cover of crop residues for \{CA\} and to develop alternative low-cost sustainable technologies with short-term benefits.

Findings from farm surveys are used to examine water management and water productivity in the rice–wheat belt of India's Haryana State and Pakistan's Punjab province. Attributes of the irrigation sources help explain the widespread interest in groundwater use and the relative demise of canal water use. In each area groundwater now is the main irrigation source, used either solely or in conjunction with surface water. The ownership of tubewells is near universal among the surveyed farms, whereas conjunctive water use is more widespread during the monsoon season, among better endowed farmers and in the Pakistan Punjab. In Pakistan Punjab farmers primarily rely on diesel powered tubewells whereas Haryana farmers mainly use relatively cheaper electric power. Water productivity indicators for rice are markedly lower than those for wheat—largely reflecting significantly higher water inputs in paddy cultivation—but also vary between the study areas and by the prevailing water use, reflecting the limited incentives for farmers to use water wisely. A combination of technological, land use and market based approaches is likely to be most effective in achieving sustainable water management in these intensive cereal systems. "

The results revealed significant differences among the genotypes, as well as unique responses to the environmental stresses. Micronutrients concentration (iron and zinc), processing and pasta-making quality was favored by drought but not by heat stress. Overall, the durum wheat lines showed inferior values for bread volume compared to the bread-wheat checks. However, some durum genotypes in specific environment had almost the same performance. To develop durum wheat cultivars with similar bread-making quality to that of bread wheat, it is necessary to achieve a better balance of tenacity and extensibility.

Maize variety diversity, soil and water conservation and improved storage or combinations of these accounted for 98% of agricultural innovations followed by the farmers in the study area. Using data from 892 randomly sampled households obtained from six districts of Malawi, the research employed a maximum simulated likelihood estimation of a multinomial endogenous treatment effect model to account for unobservable heterogeneity that influences technology adoption decision and maize productivity. Results revealed considerable heterogeneity in the choice of agricultural innovations practiced by smallholder farmers ranging from none to all practices within their fields. For instance 24% adopted improved maize varieties and storage; 14% improved maize, soil and water conservation, 14% improved maize only and 36% practiced all the technologies while 12% practiced none. In addition, the results showed that spouse's education, marital status, religion and informal networks are important factors in shaping women's participation in agricultural technology choice decisions. Exposure to production shocks such as drought, access to input and output markets, land size and gender of the plot manager of the plots explained the variation in farmers' propensities to adopt agricultural innovations. Respondents from drought prone areas, with small land size had higher incentives to adopt all the agricultural technologies as risk minimizing strategies. Conversely, farmers from high potential regions with bigger land sizes and higher asset and crop diversity indexes were less likely to adopt these agricultural innovations. Overall, adoption of improved maize and storage technologies resulted in significant increase in maize output per unit area though it may be important for researchers and policy makers to understand the social and institutional settings in which the technology is targeted, to benefit both men and women farmers equally.

Agricultural productivity is known to be sensitive to climate change induced effects and it has impact on livelihood of families linked with farming. Thus it is important to understand what are the existing coping strategies that farmer deploy in case of climate shocks like flood and drought and who is involved in making decision relating to these coping strategies. This paper uses the household level data of 641 households from 12 randomly selected villages in Vaishali district of Bihar to understand the household coping mechanisms with emphasis on role of gender. This study has moved away from the conventional division of households by male and female-headed households and thus capturing the intra-household gender dynamics by understanding the role of men and women within the household as decision makers of the coping strategy to manage climate shock. The study uses a multivariate probit model and the results suggest that there is a higher probability that the male farmers will make the decision on choice of the coping strategy. The most prominent coping mechanism is to find alternative employment in urban locations; however, when consumption levels have to be reduced because of climate shock, all family members then contribute to the decision-making process collectively. The results show that exposure to agriculture extension and training programs have a positive influence on choosing appropriate coping mechanisms, but female farmers have poor access to these resources. These policies should look into providing outreach to both male and female farmers in any given locality. "

Manual systems of conservation agriculture (CA) based on seeding into planting basins or direct seeding techniques have received increased attention over the last decade. However, a critical review of the pros and cons of the different manual seeding systems under different agro-ecologies has been lacking. This paper aims at analysing different manual seeding systems in areas extending from central Mozambique to central Malawi. Results show that \{CA\} systems perform differently in contrasting agro-ecological environments. Direct seeded treatments had greater maize yields than conventional tillage practices by an average of 12–27% and outperformed the conventional practice in nine out of fourteen yield comparisons. Basin planted treatments performed well only in Sofala and Manica (15%) with yield penalties of −9% in Tete. The strongest factor influencing maize grain yields in the more variable areas of Manica and Sofala was the quality of season and the location, whereas tillage treatment and location were more important in the higher rainfall areas of Tete. Direct seeding systems out-yielded other treatments in areas of higher rainfall and responded better to a favourable environment than conventional tillage practices. \{CA\} systems, especially direct seeding in Malawi, Manica and Sofala, showed greater financial returns to investments and labour productivity due to reduced labour costs and higher yields. Labour savings of up to 43 labour days ha−1 could be achieved with direct seeded treatments in Malawi. The results of this research clearly highlight the need for site-specific recommendations and adaptation of \{CA\} systems to different agro-ecological environments. Blanket recommendations of one \{CA\} system across many agro-ecologies, as has often been done in the past, will only lead to underperformance of \{CA\} in some areas and rejection by smallholder farmers if yield benefits are not achieved.

The study also quantifies the potential effects of a similar weather extreme occurring in 2050 under climate change. The study results indicate that weather extremes that affect maize productivity in key grain baskets can negatively affect food security in vulnerable countries. The 2012 weather extreme which occurred in the \{USA\} reduced \{US\} and global maize production by 29% compared to trend; maize consumption in the country decreased by 5% only and this resulted in less surplus maize for exports from the largest maize exporter in the world. Global maize production decreased by 6% compared to trend. The decrease in global maize production coupled with a reduction in the volume of global maize exports worsened food insecurity in eastern Africa, the Caribbean and Central America and India. The effects of the weather extreme on global food security would be worse, if the latter were to occur under climate change in 2050, assuming no climate change adaptation worldwide over the years. In addition, the hardest-hit regions would remain the same, whether the weather extreme occurs in 2012 instead of 2050: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), South Asia and the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region. However, sustained growth in per capita income across world economies between 2000 and 2050 would allow few countries in \{SSA\} and the \{LAC\} region to virtually eliminate hunger within their borders. In these countries, per capita income would be high enough by 2050 to completely offset the negative effect of the weather extreme. The study results are also consistent with USDA׳s estimates on \{US\} and global maize production and consumption in 2012 after the weather extreme. Some discrepancy is found on the volume of global maize trade; this implies that the bio-economic model likely overestimates the effect of the weather extreme on food insecurity. However, the trends from the analysis are likely to be valid. Further research would involve using a \{CGE\} model that can capture the net effects of weather extremes. "

The particular challenge this places on agriculture is to identify practices which ensure stable and productive food supply that also have a low greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity. Maize is the principle staple crop in many parts of Africa with low and variable yields, averaging only 1.6 t/ha in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Food security and increasing crop yields are considered priorities in \{SSA\} over impacts of food production on \{GHG\} emissions. Here we describe an approach that can be used to inform a decision support tree for optimal interventions to obtain sufficient food production with low \{GHG\} intensity, and we demonstrate its applicability to SSA. We employed a derivative of the farm greenhouse gas calculator ‘Cool Farm Tool’ (CFT) on a large survey of Kenyan and Ethiopian smallholder maize-based systems in an assessment of \{GHG\} intensity. It was observed that \{GHG\} emissions are strongly correlated with nitrogen (N) input. Based on the relationship between yield and \{GHG\} emissions established in this study, a yield of 0.7 t/ha incurs the same emissions as those incurred for maize from newly exploited land for maize in the region. Thus, yields of at least 0.7 t/ha should be ensured to achieve \{GHG\} intensities lower than those for exploiting new land for production. Depending on family size, the maize yield required to support the average consumption of maize per household in these regions was determined to be between 0.3 and 2.0 t/ha, so that the desirable yield can be even higher from a food security perspective. Based on the response of the observed yield to increasing N application levels, average optimum N input levels were determined as 60 and 120 kg N/ha for Kenya and Ethiopia, respectively. Nitrogen balance calculations could be applied to other countries or scaled down to districts to quantify the trade-offs, and to optimise crop productivity and \{GHG\} emissions. "

A previous study found that increased grain yield under N stress was associated with higher post-anthesis N uptake, grain production per unit N accumulation and N harvest index. This study examines the underlying physiological mechanisms as well as root morphological differences as they affect N efficiency. Sixteen hybrids with contrasting N-efficiency were evaluated under a range of soil N fertility levels at Harare, Zimbabwe, in 2003 and 2004 and Kiboko, Kenya, in 2003 for grain yield, harvest index, ears per plant, kernel number per ear, kernel weight, kernels per row, kernel row number and grain carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio as well as anthesis-silking interval and indicators of photosynthetic efficiency during grain filling. Differences in root-system size (estimated by root electrical capacitance), root density and distribution (estimated by coring), and soil mineral N depletion were assessed between contrasting hybrids. There was considerable genetic variability in yield components and dry matter partitioning among the hybrids under all N conditions and a strong relationship between N efficiency and dry matter partitioning. Significant hybrid-by-environment interactions indicated that increasing harvest index under high-N conditions may not increase harvest index under low-N conditions. The N-efficient hybrids were characterized by a lower anthesis-silking interval, higher dry matter production during grain filling, higher kernel number and relatively higher grain C/N ratio under limited N supply compared with inefficient hybrids. These hybrids were also associated with stay-green characteristics in that they maintained more green leaves, and had lower leaf senescence and higher leaf chlorophyll content during and after flowering. This may imply a higher photoassimilate supply in the N-efficient hybrids during and after flowering under low-N conditions. Between two contrasting hybrids, an N-efficient hybrid had greater root-length density in, and depleted more mineral-N from the surface soil layer than an N-inefficient hybrid. Although there was significant variation between hybrids, total root-system size was not significantly related to N efficiency indicating that selection for improved performance under low-N did not increase total root-system size in tropical maize. Although this study found a relationship between root-length density, soil mineral N depletion and plant N efficiency, the effects were not sufficiently compelling to conclude that they are causative factors.

In this work the relationships between Δ, ma and yield were studied in 20 bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes under the arid conditions of North–West Mexico, using four different water treatments (full irrigation, postanthesis water stress, preanthesis water stress and residual soil moisture stress) in two seasons (2000–2001, 2001–2002). These treatments simulated four primary wheat growing mega-environments representing approximately 70% of the wheat producing area worldwide. Carbon isotope discrimination was analyzed on grain at maturity in both seasons and on leaves at booting stage and anthesis in Season 2 as was ash content of the flag leaf and grain at maturity. Grain Δ correlated positively with yield under postanthesis and residual moisture stress. Leaf Δ was positively related with yield only under postanthesis water stress. Significant correlation was found between leaf ma and grain yield under full irrigation and postanthesis water stress. Leaf ma was positively correlated with grain Δ under postanthesis water stress. Grain ma was not associated with yield. These results suggest that under postanthesis water stress, grain Δ and leaf ma may be used as indirect selection criteria for yield, and leaf ma could be useful for predicting yield under well-watered conditions.

Fifty-eight artisans trained in the construction of metal silos for hermetic grain storage were compared to a random sample of 123 untrained artisans. Results show that two-thirds of the trained artisans were making the silos, half of these in their own workshops and half as employees. The probability of using the skills learned declined with age but increased with previous experience in technical work. The training did not significantly increase the income of employed artisans, but increased the annual income of those who made the silos in their own workshops by KSh315,173 (about US$3,600). The overall impact could be improved by better targeting of trainees, by using apprenticeships as an alternative mode of training, and by encouraging entrepreneurship through business training and provision of credit.

The objective of this paper is to examine the pattern of household energy uses, and identify and analyze the factors influencing household choices of energy, sources of fuelwood collection, and family members involved in fuelwood collection. The paper uses primary data collected from three Asian countries: India, Bangladesh and Nepal. A multivariate model is employed to analyze the data. Age, gender and education levels of a household head influence a household's choice of energy sources. Wealthy households are found to use clean energy sources such as liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and electricity, whereas poorer households tend to use solid fuels such as fuelwood and dung cake. Sources of fuelwood collection are largely influenced by a family's labor supply, education, and household wealth status. Females and children are employed by households for fuelwood collection. Nepal and Bangladesh engage mostly female members for fuelwood collection. "

The permanent raised-bed/furrow system, a water-wise conservation agriculture-based practice, is gaining importance for row- and high value-crops in irrigated agriculture. However, because of additional surface exposure and elevation, raised beds may be more prone to salt accumulation especially under shallow water table conditions. A field study was carried out in 2008 and 2009 in the Khorezm region, Central Asia, to investigate the effect of three furrow irrigation methods on salt dynamics of the soil and the performance of the cotton crop on the raised bed-furrow system. The irrigation methods compared included (i) Conventional furrow irrigation wherein every furrow was irrigated (EFI) at each irrigation event; (ii) Alternate skip furrow irrigation (ASFI where one of two neighbouring furrows were alternately irrigated during consecutive irrigations events; and (iii) Permanent skip furrow irrigation (PSFI) during which irrigation was permanently skipped in one of the two neighbouring furrows during all irrigation events. For salinity management with \{PSFI\} a ‘managed salt accumulation and effective leaching’ approach was pursued. The \{EFI\} method increased salt accumulation on the top of the raised beds. In contrast, the \{PSFI\} method allowed an effective salt leaching from the top of the raised beds. After leaching, salinity on top of the beds under \{PSFI\} was reduced to &lt;3 dS m−1 compared to 5–6 dS m−1 under \{ASFI\} and \{EFI\} indicating an effective leaching with the \{PSFI\} method. Raw cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L., cv. Khorezm 127) yield was higher under the \{PSFI\} (2003 kg ha−1) method having yield increases of 984 kg ha−1 (96% higher) and 787 kg ha−1 (64% higher) than under \{EFI\} (1216 kg ha−1) and \{ASFI\} (1019 kg ha−1) methods, respectively. Better crop performance with \{PSFI\} was linked with the lesser salinization of the raised beds and a larger salt free root zone before the leaching events. In addition, the \{PSFI\} method reduced irrigation water demand contributed thus to minimizing secondary soil salinization. Thus, \{PSFI\} could be an effective method to manage the salt under raised beds in salt-affected irrigated arid regions. "

The evaluation was based on multiple measurements of biomass taken before and after the drought stress was applied using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), along with other selection criteria including anthesis-silking interval, leaf senescence, chlorophyll content, root capacitance, final grain yield, and grain yield components. Kernel weight was the most stable trait under drought stress. Correlations between the primary trait (grain yield) and the secondary traits, except the root capacitance and \{ASI\} under water-stressed condition, were all significant. Root capacitance had relatively low heritability and low genetic correlation with other drought resistance criteria, and is not recommended as a drought resistance criterion. Significant reduction of \{NDVI\} values measured in the afternoon when the leaves became rolling, compared to those measured in the morning when the leaves were open, provides a reliable index for leaf rolling, which however was not significantly correlated with grain yield. \{NDVIs\} measured across different developmental stages were highly correlated with each other and with most of the secondary traits as well as, grain yield, indicating that \{NDVI\} can be used as a secondary trait for large-scale drought resistance screening. Regression models built based on non-yield drought criteria and yield components explained about 40% and 95% of the variation for the grain yield, respectively. Some maize lines developed in China for temperate regions showed strong drought resistance comparable to tropical maize lines when tested under tropical condition, indicating that temperate lines with a wide adaptability can be used in drought resistance breeding for both temperate and tropical environments.

The lack of access to credit constitutes a significant barrier to entry. Until governments and development partners make credit available to seed entrepreneurs directly or through risk sharing arrangements with commercial banks, national seed companies will not grow leaving the seed sector monopolized by the regional and multinational seed companies. In addition, the transfer of genetic materials between public and private sectors should be improved to allow easy access by seed companies to suitable and adapted varieties. To allow for rapid regional spillovers of varieties released in one country to similar agro-ecologies in different countries, the implementation of the harmonized regional seed laws and regulations should be expedited.

Alternate wet and dry (AWD) water management combined with alternative establishment methods, e.g., zero tillage planting in bed and flat layouts, and residue retention, may substantially reduce rice irrigation water requirement. Field experiments were conducted in a rice–wheat cropping system to evaluate these technologies and to identify the underlying processes responsible for possible reductions in rice yield. Zero till dry seeded rice (DSR) on the flat (DSRF) and on raised beds (DSRB), combined with three levels of wheat and rice straw residue retention – none (R0), 50% (R50) and 100% (R100) were therefore evaluated during the 2008 and 2009 growing seasons, using \{AWD\} water management. These treatments were compared with water seeded rice (WSR) grown with conventional tillage (dry tillage) on the flat under continuous flood irrigation (WSRF-R0-FI) or alternate wet and dry irrigation (WSRF-R0-AWD). The use of \{AWD\} reduced irrigation amount to only 30% of the amount of water applied to continuously flooded rice. However, yield of residue removed \{AWD\} treatments was lower than yield of the continuously flooded treatment by 27% in 2008 and by 40% in 2009. The significant reduction in rice yield in all treatments with \{AWD\} was caused by reduced growth rate, resulting in lower biomass, leaf area, panicle density, number of florets panicle−1 and floret fertility, with significant differences in the second year. In 2008, this appeared to be due to water deficit stress in the \{AWD\} treatments. In 2009, the reduction in growth and yield with \{AWD\} was greater, and more so as the level of residue retention increased. Residue retention reduced rice yield by 59% in 2009 with \{R100\} compared to the R0. By far the biggest cause was a reduction in floret fertility. The reduction in fertility with \{AWD\} in 2009 appeared to be due to cold damage, whereas the continuously flooded rice appeared to have been protected from cold damage by the floodwater. The weather during the period from panicle initiation (PI) to flowering in 2009 was very cold, with 20 days with minimum temperature less than 15 °C. About 1 in 10 years experience such low temperatures in this region. Therefore, the development of varieties with greater cold and water deficit stress tolerance is needed if non-flooded rice culture and surface residue retention are to be adopted in this region. "

Elite lines from \{CIMMYT\} were evaluated in a multilocation trial in the eastern Gangetic plains (EGP) of India to determine genotype × environment (GE) interactions for agronomic and nutrient traits. Agronomic (yield and days to heading) data were available for 14 environments, while zinc and iron concentration of grains for 10 environments. Soil and meteorological data of each of the locations were also used. \{GE\} was significant for all the four traits. Locations showed contrasting response to grain iron and zinc. Compared to iron, zinc showed greater variation across locations. Maximum temperature was the major determinant for the four traits. Zinc content in 30–60 cm soil depth was also a significant determinant for grain zinc as well as iron concentration. The results suggest that the \{GE\} was substantial for grain iron and zinc and established varieties of eastern Gangetic plains India are not inferior to the \{CIMMYT\} germplasm tested. Hence, greater efforts taking care of \{GE\} interactions are needed to breed iron and zinc rich wheat lines. "

It is also claimed to mitigate climate change through soil carbon sequestration: we conducted a meta-analysis of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock changes under \{CA\} practices in two tropical regions, the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), to quantify this. In \{IGP\} annual increases in \{SOC\} stock compared to conventional practice were between 0.16 and 0.49 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. In \{SSA\} increases were between 0.28 and 0.96 Mg C ha−1 yr−1, but with much greater variation and a significant number of cases with no measurable increase. Most reported \{SOC\} stock increases under \{CA\} are overestimates because of errors introduced by inappropriate soil sampling methodology. \{SOC\} increases require careful interpretation to assess whether or not they represent genuine climate change mitigation as opposed to redistribution of organic C within the landscape or soil profile. In smallholder farming in tropical regions social and economic barriers can greatly limit adoption of CA, further decreasing realistic mitigation potential. Comparison with the decreases in greenhouse gas emissions possible through improved management of nitrogen (N) fertilizer in regions such as \{IGP\} where N use is already high, suggests that this is a more effective and sustainable means of mitigating climate change. However the mitigation potential, and other benefits, from crop diversification are frequently overlooked when considering \{CA\} and warrant greater attention. Increases in \{SOC\} concentration (as opposed to stock) in near-surface soil from \{CA\} cause improvements in soil physical conditions; these are expected to contribute to increased sustainability and climate change adaptation, though not necessarily leading to consistently increased crop yields. \{CA\} should be promoted on the basis of these factors and any climate change mitigation regarded as an additional benefit, not a major policy driver for its adoption.

Straw of both crops is usually burned to facilitate seedbed preparation for the succeeding crop. Soil physical and biological attributes were determined from 1996 to 2000 from a study initiated in 1992 at the \{CIANO\} (Centro de Investigaciones Agrı́colas del Noroeste) experiment station. The objective was to compare five treatments: (1) conventional tilled bed (CTB)-straw incorporated, and permanent bed (PB) with (2) straw removed, (3) straw partly removed, (4) straw retained, and (5) straw burned — on soil strength, soil structure, and soil microbial biomass carbon (SMB). Seven N treatments were applied to wheat, but for the purpose of this study we chose a subset of three N treatments (0, 150 and 300 kg N ha−1) for measurements. Maize received a uniform application of 150 kg N ha−1 each year. Soil strength decreased as the amount of crop residues applied for each tillage-straw treatment increased. Permanent beds-straw burned treatment had the highest soil strength and CTB-straw incorporated the lowest. The largest soil aggregate fractionation, evaluated with a fractal dimension parameter (D), corresponded to PB-straw burned treatment and the lowest to PB-straw retained treatment. \{SMB\} was greater at 0–7 cm than at 7–15 cm depth. As the amount of crop residues increased in each tillage PB-straw treatment, the \{SMB\} generally increased. The largest amount of \{SMB\} occurred most often on either CTB-straw incorporated or PB-straw retained and the lowest in PB-straw burned treatment. The practice of retaining crop residues as stubble should be adopted in the Yaqui valley since changes resulting from burning crop residues showed the tendency to decrease productivity and soil quality as shown by increased soil strength and soil fractionation, and reduced SMB.

Various bottlenecks still impede adoption in these countries.

The observational error, the difference between the area measured and the area estimated, was first studied at the plot level. Average observational error or bias was −11% of the average area measured, indicating an average underestimation of plots by 11%. This observational error is strongly related to plot size, with smaller plots being overestimated and larger plots underestimated, in an approximately negative linear relationship. The observational error is also smaller for cotton fields than for cereals. The analysis was repeated at the farm level, where the bias in estimating the total area per farm was −8%. At this level, total error or accuracy was calculated by the relative total error (RTE), the square root of the mean square error, divided by the mean. The farmers’ estimate was found to be less accurate (RTE = 9.4% of the mean) than physical measurement (RTE = 6.6%), but at a cost of only $370 as compared with $2328 (for a sample of 96 farms in 11 villages). The coefficient of variation (CV) of most surface variables was found to lie between 60% and 100%, and their relative bias (average observational error divided by the mean area) between 2% and 10%. For crop area per farm, the physical measurement of plots resulted in a gain of accuracy of 2–4%, as compared with the farmers’ estimate after visual inspection. A general model was developed in which these calculated parameters are used to predict the accuracy in future surveys and to compare the accuracy with the survey’s cost. It is shown how the survey design can be optimized based on acceptable error, sample size and cost for each measurement technique. Simulations demonstrate that the total error for biased estimators, even for variables with small CVs, hardly decreases above sample sizes of 100–150 farmers. "

The existence of a feed-back mechanism, the use of follow-up formal surveys with a narrow focus for extended diagnosis, and the use of \{RRA\} findings as proposals in a joint planning process help ensure that priorities for on-farm research and extension are set correctly. The use of an analytical framework as part of the \{RRA\} methodology (consisting of a formal method for ranking problems through the construction of problem-cause-effect diagrams based on elements of goal oriented project panning, GOPP) further enhances the effectiveness of RRAs.

A number of these technologies have been tried in recent years which include dead level contours with infiltration pits and deepened contours. Although in situ \{RWHTs\} are known to increase food security in drought prone areas, the role of socio-economic factors on their performance in terms of crop yield and scaling out is still not well understood. This study sought to investigate the socio-economic factors which influence the effectiveness of dead level contours for in situ rainwater harvesting and consequently on crop yield. The study involved 14 key informants interviews and questionnaire administration to a total of 55 respondent farmers practising in situ rainwater harvesting with dead level contours. A statistical package (Statistical Package for Social Scientists, SPSS) was used to analyse relationships between performance of \{RWHTs\} and attributes such as labour, resources, gender, experience and education. The results show a strong correlation between performance and resource status (p = 0.004). For example, within the wealthy category, 42.1% were successful, while 14.3% and 13.8% were average and poor performers respectively. Thus within the successful category, 42.1% were wealthy, while 42.1% and 15.8% were medium-rich and resource-constrained respectively. Performance rating was also significantly correlated (p = 0.007) to gender of household head e.g., within the most successful group 94.7% were men compared to 5.3% women. There was also a significant correlation between resource status and gender (p = 0.039) such that within the wealthy category, 69.2% of the respondents were men compared to 30.8% women. Labour was found to have no significance on performance (p &gt; 0.05) even though the majority of key informants (93%) alluded that the more labour resources at one’s disposal, the higher their chances of success. This is so because \{RWHTs\} are time-consuming and labour intensive. Education level and number of years using water harvesting technologies did not have a significant bearing on performance (p &gt; 0.05). The paper concludes that resource ownership could be a key factor in farmers’ ability to scale out \{RWHTs\} since performance was significantly linked to resource status. Women headed households were performing rather poorly in \{RWHTs\} suggesting the need for special attention to gender in the promotion of RWHTs. "

Many researchers have been concerned about the slow progress of technical change in marginal environments and the level of research resources allocated to these areas. This paper provides empirical evidence that there has been significant growth in wheat yield potential in marginal environments, especially during the post-Green Revolution. International yield trial data, covering all major wheat growing environments from 1964 to 1999, were used in estimating the growth in wheat yield potential and changes in yield variability. The global database on wheat varietal adoption and yield gains based on estimated wheat yield growth rates were used to determine production increases due to wheat breeding research. Results show greater progress in shifting the wheat yield frontier in marginal areas, particularly in drought and high temperature environments. Furthermore, yield variability in marginal environments has notably declined, while it has increased slightly in favourable environments. While initial gains came from crossover of varieties from favourable environments, targeted breeding efforts have contributed significantly to more recent productivity growth in marginal environments. Increased production from marginal environments accounted for around 25% of the total wheat production increase in 1997. These findings show greater progress in wheat research and the huge potential of improving wheat productivity in unfavourable environments. "

abstract = "Abstract Livestock provides numerous benefits to smallholders in sub-Saharan Africa, but also represents a potential agent of environmental degradation. Exclosures have been implemented in grazing areas for the past decades in Ethiopia and have been effective in regenerating natural vegetation, controlling soil erosion and increasing soil fertility. More recently, the principles of exclosure have been applied to farmland in pilot areas of Ethiopia. This paper analyzes the impact of eight years of farmland exclosure in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia. The performance of ‘exclosed farms’ (EF) – in which livestock was excluded from the farmland throughout the year – was compared to the performance of neighboring ‘open grazing farms’ (OF) – in which fields were open for aftermath grazing in winter. \{EF\} and \{OF\} had significantly different feed and fuel use strategies. Compared to OF, \{EF\} relied less on cereal residues, farmland grass, and livestock dung, and more on biomass produced in the communal grazing area (trees and grass) and tree biomass produced on-farm. Because of these different patterns of feed and fuel use, more biomass – in the form of crop residue, manure and compost – was available as soil amendment in EF. This translated into significantly more fertile soils and significantly higher tef yields in \{EF\} as compared to \{OF\} (1980 ± 644 kg ha−1 in \{EF\} vs. 1173 ± 434 kg ha−1 in OF). These results demonstrate that farmland exclosure is a practical pathway toward sustainable intensification. However, attention should be drawn to three points: (1) the approach impacted positively on crop productivity, but had a negligible impact on livestock productivity, (2) \{EF\} livestock still depended partially on grazing (outside of the exclosure) for their acquisition of feed, pointing at the fact that zero-grazing sensu stricto may not be realistic in semi-arid areas of Ethiopia, and (3) land rehabilitation through controlled grazing may only be feasible in particular geographic locations (e.g., physical barriers preventing outside livestock to access the area, and presence of alternative grazing areas in the vicinity).

Ownership of a tractor plays a lesser role in increasing cropping intensity, although official credit policy has emphasized tractorization over investments in tubewells. Analysis of season-specific cropping intensity also indicates that lack of appropriate varieties for double cropping also constrain cropping intensity. It is estimated that cropping intensity could be increased by at least 30% through policies directed at improving water supplies and by promoting research on earlier varieties of cotton, maize and oilseeds.

The uptake of applied \{ABA\} over 1 h was 8 times the level of the endogenous hormone in the 1-5 mm elongation zone of the root, and 4 times the endogenous level in the 5-12 mm differentiation zone. This difference in uptake between the zones may be attributable to various factors such as the presence of a carrier for \{ABA\} uptake in the apical part of the maize root.

As a result, smallholder farmers end up selling their grain soon after harvest, only to buy it back at an expensive price just a few months after harvest, falling in a poverty trap. The potential impact on poverty reduction and greater livelihood security will not be realized, however, if farmers are unable to store grains and sell surplus production at attractive prices. Apart from causing quantitative losses, pests in stored grain are also linked to aflatoxin contamination and poisoning. To address this problem, a metal silo was developed as a valid option and proven effective in protecting stored grains from attack by storage insect pests. A metal silo is a cylindrical structure, constructed from a galvanized iron sheet and hermetically sealed, killing any insect pests that may be present. The impact of metal silo technology in Africa, Asia and Latin America includes, improving food security, empowering smallholder farmers, enhancing income opportunities and job creation, and safeguarding the agro-ecosystems. The metal silo can be fabricated in different sizes, 100 kg–3000 kg holding capacity by trained local artisans, with the corresponding prices of $35 to $375. The use of metal silo, therefore, should be encouraged in order to prevent storage losses and enhance food security in developing countries. "

Investigated grain quality traits were protein (CP), fat, metabolizable energy (ME), lysine and tryptophan. Stovers were investigated for nitrogen (N), neutral (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF), acid detergent lignin (ADL), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) and ME. Quality traits were investigated using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) applied to whole and ground maize grain and to ground stover. Application of \{NIRS\} to whole maize grain was unsuccessful but CP, fat and \{ME\} contents in ground maize grain were well predicted with \{R2\} = 0.81, 0.83 and 0.94, respectively, and predictions of lysine and tryptophan were acceptable (R2 = 0.70). Maize stover quality traits were generally well predicted by \{NIRS\} (R2 = 0.81–0.96). Genotype and environment effect was significant on the quality traits of grain, whereas G × E effect was not significant. Trade-offs between grain and stover quality traits were generally absent or weak and inconsistent but several grain quality traits were incompatible. Thus grain \{CP\} was negatively correlated with grain yield. Lysine and tryptophan were consistently significantly negatively correlated with CP. Line and cultivars-dependent variation in grain and stover quality traits were high enough to be of nutritional significance to monogastrics and ruminants. "

Most stover fodder quality traits were highly significantly different among the lines except ADF. These differences were substantial among best and worst lines for the traits, with stover N varying threefold and NDF, \{ADF\} and \{IVOMD\} by more than 10 percentage units. Among the agronomic traits, significant positive associations were observed among grain and stover yield. Grain yield was significantly negatively associated with DtA50 and Anthesis to silking interval (AtS) and positively with PH. Stover yield was significantly negatively associated with DtA50 and positively with PH. Desirable stover quality traits N, \{IVOMD\} and \{ME\} were significantly negatively associated with grain yield (R2 = 0.25–0.28) while undesirable quality traits NDF, \{ADF\} and \{ADL\} were significantly positively associated with grain yield (R2 = 0.04–0.23). Stover yields were largely unrelated fodder quality traits except for a significant negative association with \{NDF\} and \{ADF\} (R2 = 0.04 to 0.08). \{GWAS\} analysis carried out using \{GBS\} (genotyping by sequencing) and a 55K \{SNPs\} genotypic dataset revealed several regions of significant association for N, \{ADF\} and IVOMD, each explaining from 3 to 9% of phenotypic variance for these fodder quality traits. \{SYN7725\} from the 55K chip on chromosome 4 explained the largest proportion of phenotypic variance (∼9%) for \{ADF\} and had a robust minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.35. A specific genomic region on chromosome 3 (132.7–149.2 Mb) was found to be significantly associated with all the three forage quality traits, with the largest effect on IVOMD. This region merits attention for further validation and marker-assisted introgressions. A cellulose-related candidate gene, Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (xth1, GRMZM2G119783) was also identified closer to the peak on chr.10 (∼76.9 Mb) for ADF, which has been previously demonstrated to have a significant role in fiber elongation in cotton.

The line evaluation trials were conducted using recommended agronomic practices during the off-season of 2009 at \{ICRISAT\} farm in Hyderabad, India. Data were recorded on various agronomic traits including yields. At harvest the stover was analyzed for a range of fodder quality traits. On the basis of high stover in vitro digestibility (IVOMD) (a trait chosen because it correlated well with pricing in fodder trading of another coarse stover, namely sorghum) and high grain yield, the top ranking 10 inbred lines were selected and crossed in all possible combinations (excluding reciprocals) using diallel mating design in the rainy season of 2010. A total of 26 crosses along with four commercial hybrid checks were selected and planted in two replicates for evaluation during the dry season of 2010. A wide range in performance was observed in grain and stover traits. Grain and stover yields ranged from 0.94 to 7.3 t/ha (P &lt; 0.0001) and from 2.0 to 8.5 t/ha (P &lt; 0.0001), respectively.

Vernalization treatments of 0 to 56 d were applied to plants at their first leaf stage. All plants headed irrespective of duration of vernalization treatment. Vernalization response was assessed through the change of final leaf number (FLN) on the main stem at heading. Five lines did not respond to vernalization. \{FLN\} for vernalization-sensitive lines generally decreased to a minimum as days of vernalization treatment increased. Plants at and after the stage where additional vernalization did not reduce \{FLN\} were vernalization insensitive. The quantitative features of this vernalization response, up to the point of insensitivity, were characterized with a linear regression: (Fi − 6) = α − βTv, where Fi is \{FLN\} observed for a particular vernalization treatment, Tv is the time in days of that vernalization treatment, and α and β are the Y-intercept and the slope of the regression, respectively. This model fitted the experimental results well. The parameters α and β varied among lines, and are useful for quantifying vernalization response in wheat. The implication of each parameter can be interpreted biologically: α is the “changeable number of leaves”, i.e., how many leaves can be potentially decreased by vernalization treatment, and β represents the “exchange rate” between leaf numbers and vernalization days, i.e., how many leaves can be reduced by one day of vernalization treatment.

The results provide strong evidence that the mixture behaved in a usefully predictable manner, at least as well as the means of the components, over a diverse range of environments in South Asia. The mixture was less variable over all environments compared with its components but was not necessarily more stable. The mixture restricted yellow and leaf rusts and foliar blight relative to the means of the components. No single method of stability analysis gave an unequivocal idea of stability. However, stochastic dominance analysis and the Westcott geometric method seemed most useful for indicating the genotypes that were least risky. Considering all environments, \{UP262\} was the least stable genotype. Ska was less variable but had a lower mean yield. The mixture was relatively high yielding with the least variability. \{NL459\} had the highest yield but was variable. Nevertheless, it emerged as stable in some analyses. From the point of view of safety over a large area of cultivation, the mixture would be preferable to NL459. "

To study interactions among cultivars, sowing dates and years and to estimate losses with delayed sowing for grains m−2 and grain yield, an orthogonal subset of four years, three cultivars (PBW 34, \{PBW\} 154 and \{PBW\} 226) and seven sowing dates was used. To study the relationship between temperature and radiation, and yield and yield components, the same three cultivars were used with all the available years and sowing dates for each. The optimum sowing dates for yield were 5 November for \{PBW\} 34 (long-season) and 15 November for cultivar \{PBW\} 154 (medium-season) and \{PBW\} 226 (short-season). The combined effect of pre-heading radiation and temperature, referred to as the photothermal quotient (PTQ), was a better predictor of grains m−2 than was either variable alone. The sole effect of post-heading temperature was the best preditor of individual kernel weight. Yield and grains m−2 were maximized for all cultivars when exposed to the highest \{PTQ\} between 20 days before to 10 days after heading. Hence, the optimum heading date was the same for all three cultivars and, for the years studied, was in mid-February. After the optimum sowing date, there was a 0.8, 0.7 and 0.7% day− yield reduction for \{PBW\} 34, \{PBW\} 154 and \{PBW\} 226, respectively. The optimum heading date is earlier than observed for several other important areas of irrigated spring wheat. This may be explained by the rapid increase in temperature from February onwards at Ludhiana. We discuss the use of \{PTQ\} and temperature to determine optimum heading dates and, therefore, sowing dates for different cultivars. "

Estimates of the minimum days of vernalization required to reach vernalization insensitivity decreased in a linear fashion as plant age at the onset of vernalization treatment increased. The number of leaves appearing after the onset of vernalization insensitivity averaged 6.3 ± 0.5. \{FLN\} minus six appears to be a valid estimate in our experimental conditions for the onset of vernalization insensitivity, at least for plants that had six or more leaves appearing after the end of vernalization treatment. Linear regressions of \{FLN\} minus six against days of vernalization were significant for both cultivars (for treatments with six or more leaves emerging after vernalization). The Y-intercepts of the fitted regressions were close to values obtained by subtracting six from \{FLN\} of unvernalized plants. Both intercept and slope were controlled genetically. Accumulated plant age, expressed as leaf stage, enables attainment of vernalization insensitivity, independent of, or in combination with vernalization treatment. "

abstract = "An important aspect of an intercropping system is the extent of competition between the crops. Where this is large, there is likely to be a significant genotype × cropping systems interaction. Even when the correlation between sole-crop and intercrop yields is positive, there may be significant departures from the trend which can be exploited by plant breeding. The traits required for intercropping are those which enhance the complementary effect between species. The setting of objectives must take into account not only the influence of a particular trait on the target crop's yield, but its potential effect on another crop. A useful strategy for areas with unreliable rainfall distribution is to intercrop a relatively short-duration crop with a long-season indeterminate crop, for which the periods of maximum demand on water resources are different. Photo-sensitivity provides a mechanism for timing precisely the flowering of particular cultivars. The plant types of the intercropped species should be selected to complement each other. Cultivars of species which are compatible in this way can be planted at higher density, and this is a major factor contributing to the ability of intercrops to yield more than sole crops. Plant breeding is costly. An intercropping system targeted for breeding must clearly be of major significance, cover a large area and be sufficiently unique to justify a separate programme. A cereal/ legume intercrop in excess of 0.5 million hectares is estimated to be sufficiently large to justify a full-scale crossing and selection programme. For adaptive variety trials, bivariate analysis is the preferred approach, in order to remove background correlated effects between the two crop yields in an intercrop. An alternative is to select on the basis of income. Farmers, however, may use a wider range of criteria to select cultivars. The best way of accounting for these is to involve farmers in the selection process. Early generation selection in a breeding programme should first focus on the highly heritable traits identified as contributing to intercrop efficiency. Early generation yield evaluation of genotypes of beans intercropped with maize was found to be feasible and effective. Selection under farmers' own management should be introduced at as early a stage as possible, once a set of promising lines has been identified. Breeding for intercropping will be most effectively carried out in the context of regional collaboration or international programmes, focusing on improving and extending the use of cropping systems which are already widely practiced.

The application of mesosulfuron-methyl at 11.25 g a.i. ha−1 plus a noninonic surfactant at 252 g a.i. ha−1 to three \{HWW\} and three \{SWW\} varieties in either autumn (Zadoks stage 14–15) or spring (Zadoks stage 24–25) resulted in visible injury, including chlorisis, stunting and leaf deformities. The greatest injury occurred at fourteen days after treatment (DAT) for all wheat varieties. All varieties showed the same initial sensitivity to herbicide treatment, but differed significantly in their recovery from plant damages. The \{HWW\} varieties recovered more successfully from spring-applied herbicide than the \{SWW\} varieties; conversely, the \{SWW\} varieties recovered more rapidly from damage caused by autumn-applied herbicide than the \{HWW\} varieties. Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) values were severely affected by autumn herbicide application for \{HWW\} varieties and spring application for \{SWW\} varieties. Autumn herbicide application for \{SWW\} varieties and spring herbicide application for \{HWW\} varieties produced higher grain yields.

These crops contribute more than 80% of the total cereal production and are critically important to employment and food security for hundreds of millions of rural families. The demand for these two cereals is expected to grow between 2% and 2.5% per annum until 2020, requiring continued efforts to increase productivity while ensuring sustainability. Starting from the 1960s, expansion of area and intensification of rice–wheat productions system based on the adoption of Green Revolution (GR) technologies, incorporating the use of high-yielding varieties, fertilizers and irrigation, led to increased production and productivity of both these crops. However, continued intensive use of \{GR\} technologies in recent years has resulted in lower marginal returns and, in some locations to salinization, overexploitation of groundwater, physical and chemical deterioration of the soil, and pest problems. This paper presents findings from recent research on resource conservation technologies involving tillage and crop establishment options that are enabling farmers to sustain productivity of intensive rice–wheat systems. Field results show that the resource conserving technologies, an exponent of conservation agriculture, improve yields, reduce water consumption, and reduce negative impacts on the environmental quality. The paper considers contributions of innovative inter-institutional collaboration in international agricultural research and socio-economic changes in the \{IGP\} countries that led to rapid development and adoption of these technologies by farmers.

Both the number of varietal releases per million hectares of maize and the adoption of improved maize varieties and hybrids are similar to the rates achieved in other regions. This has occurred despite fewer maize breeders per million tons of maize, greater reliance on the public sector, and somewhat more diverse production environments in sub-Saharan Africa. Nonetheless, adoption of improved maize materials has remained patchy, constrained in some cases by failure to incorporate smallholder preferences adequately, and in others by insufficient supporting infrastructure, particularly in development of seed systems. Furthermore, despite an apparently greater investment in crop management research in the region relative to other developing areas, appropriate technology for maintenance of soil fertility in the face of increasing population pressure requires much more attention. This technology will require a combination of both external and internal sources of nutrients. Crop management technology must also be evaluated in terms of effects on seasonal labor demand. Because of the relative diversity in African environments and infrastructural constraints, high-payoff maize technology in sub-Saharan Africa will require particularly careful attention to areas outside maize research itself—policy design, institution building, and human capital development.

This study examines the determinants of the speed of adoption of \{IMVs\} using a duration model and recently collected plot- and household-level data in rural Tanzania. The results highlight the importance of social capital and networks in speeding up the adoption of IMVs. Similarly, government extension workers as a main source of information have a positive effect on the speed of adoption. The regression results also suggest that rainfall and farmers' confidence in government support during crop failure speed up the adoption of IMVs. The findings imply that interventions that strengthen the role of extension services, rural institutions and networks can accelerate the adoption of \{IMVs\} by smallholder farmers in Tanzania. "

The C. mucunoides improved fallow proved superior to the two other cropping practices but the superiority diminished after 2 years of cultivation suggesting a 2-year cropping cycle in line with the existing system. An ex-ante assessment of the adoption of the improved fallow system by farmers identified crop residue incorporation and cost of inputs as major constraints.

This participatory initiative clearly demonstrated that incorporating farmers’ knowledge, ideas and preferences could improve the wheat production package. A traditional practice of Chefe Donsa farmers—applying ash from their homesteads to their fields to enable early-sown crops to withstand frost—led to the verification of the yield-enhancing effect of inorganic potassium fertilizer on wheat. Farmer adoption of a minimum tillage production system increased the gross margin of wheat production by US$ 132 per hectare—based on 1999 prices—relative to the traditional flat seedbed system. The minimum tillage system was characterized by a much lower level of soil manipulation relative to the traditional flat seedbed system, and, as a consequence, markedly reduced the total human labor and draft oxen requirements for wheat production. Thus, the minimum tillage system could be an effective intervention for soil conservation due to early-season vegetative cover of the soil surface. Also, the early crop harvest associated with the minimum tillage system was highly beneficial for small-holder farmers—since the early harvest coincided with the cyclical period of severe household food deficits and high grain prices in local markets.

Conservation agriculture (CA) has been proposed as a potential system for improving soil quality and providing stable yields through minimum soil disturbance, surface crop residue retention (mulching) and crop rotations or associations. However, concerns have been raised about the lack of evidence of the benefits of \{CA\} for small-scale farmers in southern Africa. This research was carried out in two communities and one on-station site in Zambia to provide more scientific evidence about the effects of \{CA\} on soil quality, infiltration, soil moisture and crop performance. Results from Kayowozi showed that maize yields in a direct seeded \{CA\} treatment, using cowpea seeded with a dibble stick in full rotation, increased by up to 78% after four cropping seasons in comparison to a conventional control using a ridge and furrow system. At Malende, maize yields for animal traction rip-line seeded and direct seeded plots were, on average, 75% and 91% higher than a conventionally tilled control plot after six cropping seasons. Detailed studies undertaken at the Monze Farmer Training Centre revealed that \{CA\} treatments, especially that using cotton in rotation, increased water infiltration and soil moisture. In some years, infiltration was five times higher on \{CA\} fields than on those using conventional tillage. Carbon increases were only found at the on-station long-term trial, where, over time, \{CA\} plots outperformed conventional practice leading to an overall increase of 12% carbon in the first 30 cm, compared with decreases of 15% in the conventional control. Comparative analyses between the on-farm and on-station trials point to a lack of adequate mulching, which might be the reason for lower carbon at the on-farm sites. We conclude that the effects of \{CA\} can build up on different soil types in most systems, but that scaling up and out requires the whole community to be targeted, rather than relying on individual farmers to overcome constraints related to the set-up in rural communities.

We attempted to identify the most susceptible/critical crop stage(s) of maize for excess moisture stress, and to develop a screening technique and selection strategies for identification of germplasm tolerant to excess moisture stress. Among the four crop stages, i.e. early seedling (V2), knee-high (V7), tasseling (VT) and milk stage (R1), \{V2\} was found to be highly susceptible, followed by the \{V7\} stage. A screening technique (cup method) was developed/standardized, and was found to be an efficient technique for large-scale screening of maize genotypes against excess soil moisture stress. Germplasm was screened using this technique followed by field evaluation at the \{V7\} growth stage (seventh leaf visible). Excess soil moisture stress severely affected various growth and biochemical parameters, impaired anthesis and silking, and eventually resulted in poor kernel development and yield. However, remarkable variability was found among the genotypes studied. Genotypes with good carbohydrate accumulation in stem tissues, moderate stomatal conductance, &lt;5 days ASI, high root porosity, and early brace root development ability have been found to have good tolerance against the hypoxia/anoxia caused by excess soil moisture conditions.

There was a four-fold variation in drag between varieties, and some varieties showed a two-fold variation in drag according to orientation. Wind-induced deformation reduced the drag coefficient by up to 50% as airspeed was increased to 10 m/s, and the lift/drag ratio sometimes changed sign over this range. These aeroelastic effects increased aerodynamic stability and streamlining, and substantially reduced the drag force.

Wide ranges in crop and environmental conditions were obtained by varying N application rates and timing and by different planting dates and locations. Crop development from emergence (DC10) to physiological maturity (DC90) was divided in three phases, with the intermediate phase \{II\} ranging approximately from early booting (DC40) to final anthesis (DC70).

Retaining crop residues in the field is not only a prerequisite for \{CA\} but may also be the most viable option for African farmers to retain their fields in a productive state. In this paper, (1) we explore the possibility of increasing the quantity of crop residue available by closing the maize yield, (2) we propose interventions that can reduce crop residue demand for livestock feed, and (3) we quantify the optimum amount of crop residues required as mulch, using empirical, secondary and modeling data from Western Kenya and the Ethiopian Rift Valley. Residue retention can also be increased by reducing livestock demand. Closing the maize yield gap–i.e. achieve 90% of the water-limited yield potential–and intensifying dairy production–which would promote the use of rations that are more energy-dense than cereal residue-based rations–would increase the estimated proportion of farmers retaining at least 1 t ha−1 of crop residues from the current 36% to 97% in Western Kenya. In the Ethiopian Rift Valley, closing the maize yield gap and substituting mechanization to animal draught power would increase the estimated proportion of farmers retaining at least 1 t ha−1 of crop residues from the current 3% to 83%. We conclude that the question is not ‘if’, but ‘how’ cereal residues can fulfill the demand of both the soil and the livestock. "

The continuing soil erosion and land degradation in these low-input staple crop production hillside farming systems lead many to be pessimistic about increasing the agricultural incomes of these farmers. However, this study shows that the appropriate combination of improved technologies and agricultural policy or alternative production diversification strategies can improve the incomes of small-scale hillside farmers in southern Honduras by over 50%. The technology components considered are stone walls and ditches combined with living tree barriers to prevent erosion of the hillsides, and a package of improved sorghum seed, seed treatment, and modest doses of nitrogenous fertilizer. A whole-farm mathematical programming framework is used to determine the potential farm-level income effects of the soil-conservation and seed-fertilizer technologies. The main conclusion is that erosion-control devices and yield-increasing crop varieties and fertilizer are an effective technology introduction strategy for the erosion-prone hillside landholdings found in many areas of Central America. If policy actions or diversification strategies for disposal of surplus grain are found which are effective in reducing the risk of low income from cereal price reductions in high-production years, adoption of the improved technologies is shown to be profitable for small-scale farmers. Another benefit not explicitly considered would be to slow the very rapid growth of urban poverty in these countries. Sensitivity analysis results indicated that neither risk aversion nor the increased availability of crop land or initial cash have any substantial effects on the predicted adoption level of the improved technologies, or on their income impacts for these farmers.

The experiment was conducted as split–split plot treatment arrangement with three replications for eight wheat cropping seasons in the state of Sonora, Mexico. Results indicated that both wheat grain yield and N use efficiency were higher with burning than incorporation of wheat straw and with fertilization with urea or urea plus chicken manure than chicken manure alone. As shown by the crop rotation-by-straw management interaction, planting sesbania following incorporation of the straw by tillage produced comparable grain yields to straw burning treatment. In contrast, wheat in annual rotation with maize produced the lowest wheat grain yield and N use efficiency irrespective of the wheat straw management and N source applied. "

Since the inheritance of field resistance to tan spot is poorly understood, this study was conducted to determine the genetic control of resistance in the field. Resistance was measured as disease severity caused by P. tritici-repentis race 1 in four crosses involving five wheat parents: parent 1 (P1) = catbird; parent 2 (P2) = Milan/Shanghai-7; parent 3 (P3) = Alondra/Coc//Ures; parent 4 (P4) = Bcb//Dundee/Gul/3/Gul); parent 5 (P5) = ND/VG9144//Kal/BB/3/Yaco/4/Chil. P1, \{P2\} and \{P3\} were resistant and \{P4\} was moderately resistant, whereas \{P5\} was susceptible to tan spot. The F2-derived \{F3\} families and the parents were field evaluated at El Batán, Mexico, in 1996. When all the plants within a \{F3\} family expressed low levels of disease severity similar to that of the resistant parent it was classified resistant (R), otherwise the progeny was classified as susceptible (S). The progeny of the three crosses of the susceptible parent with the resistant and moderately resistant parents P2, P3, and \{P4\} segregated as 3R:13S whereas the progeny in the cross with \{P1\} showed a segregation ratio of 1R:15S. This suggests that each resistant parent possessed two genes conditioning resistance to tan spot severity caused by P. tritici-repentis race 1. Information on the inheritance of resistance measured as disease severity on adult plants under field conditions is of practical importance for wheat breeding programs seeking improvement in tan spot resistance.

Lack of effective selection criteria is a major limitation hampering progress in breeding for drought tolerance. In an earlier report, we showed in two populations that one cycle of direct selection was effective in increasing grain yield under stress. In the present study, we retested the efficiency of direct selection for grain yield under drought stress in rice using four populations derived from crossing upland-adapted, drought-tolerant varieties (Apo, Vandana) to high-yielding, lowland-adapted, drought-susceptible varieties (IR64, IR72). Each population was subjected to two cycles of divergent selection either under drought stress in upland or under nonstress conditions in lowland conditions. Following selection, approximately 40 high-yielding lines selected under each protocol from each population, along with a set of unselected lines, were evaluated in a series of selection response trials over a range of moisture levels. Significant response to direct selection under stress was realized in 9 out of 15 combinations of populations and stress environments, and in 6 of the 7 severe stress trials. Averaging over all the populations and stress environments, the stress-selected lines had a yield advantage of 25 and 37% over nonstress-selected and random lines, respectively. In contrast to this, under nonstress, the nonstress-selected lines had an average yield advantage of only 7 and 13% over stress-selected and random lines, respectively. Direct selection in managed stress trials during dry seasons gave significant response (25% on average relative to indirect selection in nonstress conditions) under naturally occurring wet season stress. In addition, direct selection under stress in upland gave an average gain of 16 and 45% over nonstress-selected and random lines, respectively, under stress in lowland. The yield advantage of the stress-selected lines appears to result mainly from maintenance of higher harvest index. These results show that direct selection for grain yield under stress is effective and does not reduce yield potential. Overall, this is the first report in rice demonstrating that (a) selection under managed drought stress in the dry season can result in yield gains under natural stress in the wet season, and (b) that selection under upland drought stress can, at least under the conditions of the present study, result in gains under lowland drought conditions.

We performed detailed plant water status measurements on a subset of lines having similar crop growth duration but contrasting genotypes at qtl12.1 under field (24 genotypes) and greenhouse (14 genotypes) conditions. The Way Rarem-derived allele of qtl12.1 was confirmed to improve grain yield under drought mainly through a slight improvement (7%) in plant water uptake under water-limited conditions. Such an apparently small increase in water uptake associated with this allele could explain the large effect on yield observed under field conditions.

Both were tested with farmers on-farm co-ordinated farmers field trials (CFFTs) and had not been identified as this was more contractual type of participatory research. Individual traits were measured but overall farmers’ preferences were not elicited. In the more collaborative participation of the mother–baby trials the overall preference was determined and farmers traded-off the late maturity and dented grains of Manakamana-3 and ZM-621 against other favourable traits. Depending on location, these genotypes yielded 15–45% more grain than the local varieties in the mother–baby trials. These results led to the release of ZM-621 as Deuti in 2006. Farmers had adopted Manakamana-3 (released in 2002) and ZM-621 (Deuti) as a direct result of \{PVS\} trials and increased area under them year after year. Farmers awareness of the varieties has increased and seeds of these varieties are under community-based seed production (CBSP).

It was hypothesized that agricultural practices would also affect the bacteria involved in the degradation of crop residue. Soil was sampled from four different agricultural practices, i.e. conventional agriculture on the flat or on beds, or conservation agriculture on the flat or on beds. Cultivating crops on the flat is done traditionally, but cultivating crops on beds was introduced so as to avoid water logging during the rainy season and its potential negative effect on yields. Soil from these four treatments was amended in the laboratory with maize residue (Zea mays L.) or its neutral detergent fibre (NDF) fraction, mostly consisting of (hemi) cellulose, and incubated aerobically for 14 days. Maize residue was applied to soil as it is left in the field in conservation agriculture and \{NDF\} was added to study which bacteria were favoured by application of (hemi) cellulose. Soil was incubated aerobically while the carbon mineralization and the bacterial population were monitored. On the one hand, the relative abundance of phylotypes belonging to bacterial groups that preferred low nutrient environments was higher in soil with conservation agriculture (e.g. Acidobacteria 17.6%, Planctomycetes 1.7% and Verrucomicrobia 1.5%) compared to conventional practices (Acidobacteria 11.8%, Planctomycetes 0.9% and Verrucomicrobia 0.4%). On the other hand, the relative abundance of phylotypes belonging to bacterial groups that preferred nutrient rich environments, such as Actinobacteria, showed an opposite trend. It was 11.9% in conservation agriculture and 16.2% in conventional practices. The relative abundance of Arthrobacter (Actinobacteria) and Bacillales more than doubled when maize residue was applied to soil compared to the unamended soil and that of Actinomycetales when maize or \{NDF\} was applied. Application of organic material reduced the relative abundance of a wide range of bacterial groups, e.g. Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia. It was found that application of organic material favoured the same bacterial groups that were more abundant in the soil cultivated conventionally while it reduced those that were favoured in conservation agriculture.

The average premium for fortified maize was much less than the discount for yellow: 5.9% for those aware and 7.4% for those unaware. Consumer preferences were influenced by socioeconomic factors such as gender, education, income and ethnic background.

Based on interviews with growers, marketers, activists, and other stakeholders, as well as secondary sources, this paper describes this policy’s emergence and evolution using a global commodity chain approach. Several studies suggest that \{GE\} herbicide tolerant rice would yield profits for California growers struggling with rising weed control costs. Instead, \{GE\} rice was greeted with scrutiny by the California industry and legislators because Asian export markets had zero-tolerance for \{GE\} rice contamination. This paper examines how nature’s agency—the “unruly” qualities of agro-ecosystem functions, the movement of wildlife, seeds, and pollen across space—strengthened narratives about risk and industry consensus around zero-tolerance rules for \{GE\} rice. In addition to recounting the origins of zero-tolerance demands and containment regulations for California rice, this research explores how calls for food safety and zero-tolerance rules are mobilized as surrogate for wider political economic aims.

This study develops a multinomial endogenous switching regression model of farmers' choice of combination of \{SAPs\} and impacts on maize income and agrochemicals and family labor use in rural Ethiopia. Four primary results were found. First, adoption of \{SAPs\} increases maize income and the highest payoff is achieved when \{SAPs\} are adopted in combination rather than in isolation. Second, nitrogen fertilizer use is lower in the package that contains system diversification and conservation tillage. Third, conservation tillage increased pesticide application and labor demand, perhaps to compensate for reduced tillage. However, when it is used jointly with system diversification, it does not have a significant impact on pesticide and labor use. Fourth, in most cases adoption of a package of \{SAPs\} increases women workload, suggesting that agricultural intensification technology interventions may not be gender neutral. This implies that policy makers and other stakeholders promoting a combination of technologies can enhance household food security through increasing income and reducing production costs, but need to be aware of the potential gender related outcomes.

abstract = "Abstract In the rainfed mid-hill region of Nepal, most fields receive 2–3 t ha−1 of organic compost application every year. Despite efficient recovery and use of organics in the mixed crop-animal systems that predominant in the mid-hills, depleted soil fertility is widely understood to be a significant constraint to crop productivity, with most farmers achieving maize grain yields below 2 t ha−1. Increased use of fertilizer may arrest and even reverse long-term soil quality degradation, but few farmers in the mid-hills use them at present and existing recommendations are insufficiently responsive to site, varietal, and management factors that influence the productivity and profitability of increased fertilizer use. Moreover, policy makers and development practitioners often hold the perception that returns to fertilizer use in the mid-hills are too low to merit investment. In this study, on-farm experiments were conducted at 16 sites in the Palpa district, Nepal to assess the responsiveness of a maize hybrid (DKC 9081) and an ‘improved’ open-pollinated maize variety (‘OPV’, Manakamana-3) to four nitrogen (N) rates, i.e., 0, 60, 120 and 180 kg ha−1, with each N rate response evaluated at 30:30 and 60:60 kg ha−1 rates of phosphorus (P2O5) and potassium (K2O), respectively. With sound agronomy and high rates of fertilizer (180:60:60 kg N:P2O5:K2O ha−1), grain yields observed in the field experiments exceeded 8 t ha−1 with hybrids and 6 t ha−1 with OPV. Yield levels were lower for \{OPV\} than hybrid at every level of applied N, but both genotypes responded linearly to N with partial factor productivity for N (PFPN) ranging from 14 to 19 for \{OPV\} versus 26–30 for hybrid, with improved N efficiencies obtained when P and K rates were significantly higher. Averaged across phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) levels, a $ 1 incremental investment in fertilizer increased the gross margin (GM) by $ 1.70 ha−1 in \{OPV\} and by $ 1.83 ha−1 in the hybrid. For the full response of N, requires higher rate of P2O5:K2O and vice-versa and full response to P2O5:K2O does not occur if N is absent. These results suggest that, i) degraded soils in the mid-hills of Nepal respond favorably to macronutrient fertilizers – even at high rates, ii) balanced fertilization is necessary to optimize returns on investments in N but must be weighed against additional costs, iii) \{OPVs\} benefit from investments in fertilizer, albeit at a \{PFPN\} that is 36–47% lower than for hybrids, and, consequently iv) hybrids are an effective mechanism for achieving a higher return on fertilizer investments, even when modest rates are applied. To extend these findings across years and sites in the mid-hills, crop growth simulations using the CERES-maize model (DSSAT) were conducted for 11 districts with historical weather and representative soils data. Average simulated (hybrid) maize yields with high fertilizer rate (180:60:60 kg N:P2O5:K2O ha−1) ranged from 3.9 t ha−1 to 7.5 t ha−1 across districts, indicating a high disparity in attainable yield potential. By using these values to estimate district-specific attainable yield targets, recommended N fertilizer rates vary between 65 and 208 kg N ha−1, highlighting the importance of developing domain-specific recommendations. Simulations also suggest the potential utility of using weather forecasts in tandem with site and planting date information to adjust fertilizer recommendations on a seasonal basis. "

Using a multivariate probit model, we find gender differences in the adoption pattern for some SIPs. Compared to male plot mangers, female managers are less likely to adopt minimum tillage and animal manure in crop production, indicating the existence of certain socioeconomic inequalities and barriers for female farmers. However, we find no gender differences in the adoption of soil and water conservation measures, improved seed varieties, chemical fertilizers, maize-legume intercropping, and maize-legume rotations.

abstract = "Abstract The irrigated rice–wheat (RW) systems of north-west India are critical for food security. However, these systems are not sustainable due to over-exploitation of the groundwater resource on which they largely rely. Current farmer practice (FP) involves manual transplanting of rice into heavily tilled/puddled soil from 10 June to early July, prolonged periods of flooding, rice residue burning, and heavy tillage prior to sowing wheat. Inclusion of a short duration mungbean crop between wheat harvest and rice transplanting has also been promoted at times. Options for reducing irrigation input to the \{RW\} system include delaying transplanting until after the monsoon rains start (late June), switching to shorter duration rice varieties, and alternate wetting drying (AWD) water management for rice. However, the effect of such practices on groundwater depletion is not well-understood. Examining the effects of these options on cropping system yield and components of the water balance and water productivity is highly complex because of the need to consider the interactions between each crop in the system. Therefore, we used a cropping system model (APSIM) to compare the performance of \{RW\} systems with a range of rice transplanting dates (4 dates from 10 June to 10 August) and rice variety durations (long – 158 d, medium – 144 d, short – 125 d), with and without mungbean in the system. The results suggest that changing from long to short duration varieties would reduce \{ET\} by around 250 mm, more than enough to halt the groundwater decline, but with a reduction in rice-equivalent system yield of about 2.5 t ha−1 compared with current FP. On the other hand, inclusion of mungbean into the \{RW\} system results in much higher system yield than recommended farmer practice (by over 3 t ha−1), but the tradeoffs are much higher \{ET\} (by 250–300 mm) and irrigation requirement (by 300–450 mm). The results of this study suggest that more effort should be directed towards the development of higher-yielding, short duration rice varieties to reduce groundwater depletion of the \{RW\} system while maintaining yield, and that inclusion of short duration summer crops such as mungbean should not be recommended.

Labour and water scarcity are driving farmers to change from puddling and manual transplanting of rice to mechanised dry seeding. The introduction of dry seeding to the rice–wheat system brings with it the potential to adopt conservation agriculture (CA), with reduced or zero tillage for all crops, and surface residue retention. This would further reduce fuel and labour costs for crop establishment, and air pollution, and also bring benefits for soil structure and nutrient cycling. However, whether conversion to \{CA\} rice–wheat systems would help solve the problem of groundwater depletion is less well-understood. In this region, evapotranspiration (ET) must be reduced to reduce groundwater depletion. We used the \{APSIM\} cropping system model to examine whether conversion from recommended farmer practice (rFP, comprising puddled transplanted rice, alternate wetting and drying rice water management, rice straw removal, tillage for wheat) to a \{CA\} rice–wheat system would reduce \{ET\} in Punjab, north west India. We also used the model to identify the optimum system management taking into account effects on total cropping system rice equivalent yield (REY), components of the water balance and water productivity. Maximum \{REY\} (mean 14.6 t ha−1) occurred in systems with 5 June sowing of a popular long duration rice variety, with similar yield for rFP and CA. Irrigation input with \{CA\} was much lower (by 390 mm) than with rFP, resulting in slightly higher irrigation water productivity (increased from 11.3 to 11.7 kg ha−1 mm−1). However, changing to \{CA\} only reduced \{ET\} of the highest yielding system by 4% (55 mm), and of other current practices (late May and early June sowing of medium and long duration varieties) by less than this. The only way to achieve a substantial reduction in \{ET\} was by growing short duration rice varieties in both the rFP and \{CA\} systems. However, with current short duration varieties, this came at the cost of both rice and system yields (system yield reduced by an average of about 1.8 t ha−1). This could be overcome by intensification to 3 crops per year in a \{CA\} rice–wheat–mung system (with short duration rice varieties), while still providing a substantial but smaller decrease in ET. This system also had considerable flexibility in rice sowing date, with similar system yields for sowings from 5 June to 15 July. These findings suggest that greater effort to increase the yield potential of short duration rice varieties is warranted. Field experimentation is needed to test the improved systems as suggested by the model simulations, particularly in terms of cropping system yield and ET, and alternatives to rice and wheat should also be evaluated. At the same time, spatial hydrological studies are needed to determine the sustainable level of \{ET\} from cropping systems that will allow matching of groundwater depletion and recharge. "

In general, maize yields in the hills are judged to be intractably low and few efforts have systematically assessed either the water-limited productivity potential or identified sensible entry points toward sustainable intensification that can be selectively matched to the needs and constraints faced by different types of farmers. This study combines field surveys, on-farm field experiments, and simulation modeling (DSSAT) to explore opportunities for closing maize yield gaps in these ecologies. Among surveyed households, the mean grain yield of maize under current farmer practice was 2.0 t ha−1 whereas good agronomic practices increased maize yields up to 6.5 t ha−1 (i.e. exploitable yield gap of 4.5 t ha−1). Recognizing that farmers rarely adopt full technology packages, the value of single agronomic interventions was also explored with all other management factors maintained as per prevailing farmer practice. Averaged across sites and two seasons, non-limiting fertilizer rates (175:60:60 kg \{NPK\} ha−1) increased grain yields by 1.8 t ha−1 followed by the use of hybrids (1.4 t ha−1), higher plant population (0.9 t ha−1), and improved weed control (0.9 t ha−1). These results were also reflected in changes to the economic performance of the system with gross margins increasing from a ‘farmer practice’ base of $202 ha−1 (B:C = 1.86) to $339 ha−1 (B:C = 2.14) with hybrid adoption, $454 ha−1 (B:C = 2.88) with higher plant population, $646 ha−1 (B:C = 2.52) with non-limiting fertilizer, and $611 ha−1 (B:C = 3.37) with careful weed control. Further gains in profitability were achieved with layered agronomic interventions, which increased gross margins to $857 and $763 ha−1 (B:C = 2.95 in both) in conventional tillage (CT) and minimum (strip tillage; ST) systems, respectively. Divergence between grain yield gains and economic performance criteria highlights the importance of considering both perspectives. For resource-poor households, maintaining optimal plant population can increase B:C by more than 50% with small investments ($7 ha−1). Simulation results also suggest that additional potential productivity advantages are achievable with timely planting (e.g. 19% higher mean yield for short duration hybrid with less inter-annual variability). Cultivation of longer duration hybrids can also increase yield potential over their shorter duration alternatives, although trade-offs with yield potential of the second crop in the rotation must be considered. These results highlight several pathways toward intensification in the hills of Nepal that have varying investment requirements, inferred risks, and implications for the different dimensions of sustainability and food security.

Therefore, understanding the nature of all chemical constituents and paying attention to their effects in determining water absorption is crucial for reliable evaluation of the flour bread-making properties and its bread-making performance. In this study, a new standard water absorption criteria (UNIFABS) for Mixograph, Alveograph and bread-making was developed based on the solvent retention capacity of four different solvents: water, lactic acid, sodium carbonate and sucrose. The \{UNIFABS\} was developed in order to have a common water absorption criteria for the three methods that satisfies the water absorption capacity as influenced concomitantly by proteins and polysaccharides. The \{UNIFABS\} improves the assessment of dough mixing and viscoelastic parameters, and the value of both, Mixograph and Alveograph, in predicting and selecting for bread-making quality in breeding programs.

In this region, conservation agriculture (CA) has been promoted as useful set of principles that could improve farmers' resilience to climate variability and change. However, matching practices to agro-ecological and farmers' socio-economic conditions remain contentious. Here we combine empirical data and results from a cropping system model to quantify benefits and trade-offs, in terms of sowing opportunity, yield, and yield variability, from adopting \{CA\} practices. We hypothesized that \{CA\} practices would require less labour, allow farmers to plant earlier, at times closer to optimum planting times and consequently result in higher maize yields. We tested the hypothesis using available household labour and the outputs from a cropping systems model (DSSAT) run for six locations in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Thirty years of climate records and soil characterisations were available for each site. Modelled \{CA\} practices included, a basin planting system prepared early during winter (CA-Basins early); a basin planting system prepared late and at the onset of the rains (CA-basins late); an animal draught direct seeder e.g. using a Fitarelli animal traction planter (CA-Direct seed); an animal traction ripper (CA-Ripper); and a dibble stick manual planting system (CA-Dibble). Check conventional cropping systems included conventional mouldboard ploughing prepared early (CMP-early), and late (CMP-late), which mimicked farmers having early or late access to draft power, respectively. Simulated results showed that CA-Ripper, CA-Direct seeding and CA-Basins improved timeliness of operations and enabled earlier planting across all locations compared to conventional systems. Mechanized \{CA\} systems potentially offered farmers flexibility on when to plant. However, timely planting of \{CA\} systems did not translate into higher yields when carried out during periods of high rainfall variability. Yield benefits of early plantings in \{CA\} were only apparent in Zimbabwe. Rainfall patterns showed a shift of 0.28 and 0.39 days yr− 1 in planting dates at Chitala and Chitedze, over the simulated 30 years. However, this was not evident at the other four locations. Optimum planting dates established for the six locations were 5th to 27th December for Malawi; 26th December to 7th January for Mozambique; and 4th to 7th December for Zimbabwe. For each location, planting maize close to the optimum period resulted in higher yields, irrespective of cropping system. Significantly (P &lt; 0.05) lower yield variability values i.e. 25% compared to 32 and 36%, were observed for optimum date plantings. Model generated optimum planting dates could be used to provide farmers with site-specific planting date recommendations. "

However, although efforts have been made to promote mola culture, the factors affecting its production are poorly understood. Therefore, this study was undertaken to identify factors contributing to mola productivity in polyculture systems. A total 177 farms in three sub-districts of Barisal district, Bangladesh, were surveyed. Production of carp was higher (P &lt; 0.05) in demo farms (3.42 ± 1.64 t ha− 1) than non-demo farms (2.49 ± 1.46 t ha− 1) and also differed significantly (P &lt; 0.05) by sub-district. The productivity of mola ranged from 0.08 to 0.68 t ha− 1 (mean; 0.26 ± 0.10 t ha− 1). Mola yields differed significantly (P &lt; 0.05) by sub-district, but no significant difference in yields was observed between demo (0.28 ± 0.10 t ha− 1) and non-demo (0.25 ± 0.10 t ha− 1) farms. Annual costs, gross income and net income were significantly different (P &lt; 0.05) between demo and non-demo farms. A Cobb-Douglas production function model was used to identify which inputs affect fish yields. Stocking density, feed inputs, labor and pond depth were found to significantly affect total fish production, whereas mola production was significantly influenced by inputs of inorganic fertilizer, mustard oilcake, the number of months water was retained in the pond, labor and pond depth. A financial analysis showed the benefit-cost ratio of mola polyculture was higher than 1, indicating the investment efficiency of this technology for rural farmers. The study indicates that application of appropriate inputs could be considered to maximize production of mola in future projects attempting to promote its culture. Statement of relevance This paper assesses the productivity of vitamin A rich mola carplet, farmed in polyculture with carp in Bangladesh, and identifies factors contributing to mola carplet productivity to support the design of attempts to promote mola culture in future.

A multinomial logit selection model has been applied for this identification and analysis. The results show that a household's choice of cleaner fuels for lighting, cooking, and heating is driven by level of income, age, education and gender of the household head, access to electricity, and location. Households with a better-educated or female head, those with a higher level of income, and urban households, have a higher probability of switching to the use of clean energy, while poor households, rural households and those with a low level of education are constrained by these factors to continue using dirty energy. The study shows that female-headed households are more likely to choose cleaner fuels, and that above all the availability of a clean and cost-effective source of energy within the proximity is an important factor in the adoption of clean energy. We combined \{BLSS\} 2003 and 2007 and conducted similar analyses and confirmed the robustness of the result. "

The pattern of distribution of water sources and access to them across income groups shows that wealthier households in both rural and urban areas have access to safer water sources than their poorer counterparts. We find that education and household income are strong determinants of the choice of safe and secure access to water. Rural households tend to use more traditional water sources, such as springs, wells, rivers or ponds, compared to their urban counterparts. "

In rainfed conditions, conservation agriculture (CA) practices, i.e., reduced tillage, residue retention and crop rotation, have proven to have substantial scope for arresting or reversing soil degradation. Previous research findings suggest that \{CA\} can be beneficially applied to irrigated croplands as well, but influences on salinization processes are insufficiently documented. This study investigates the effect of \{CA\} practices on soil salinity dynamics in irrigated production systems in the Khorezm region, Uzbekistan, Central Asia. The study was conducted under a cotton-wheat-maize rotation system, typical for the region, from 2007 to 2009 with two tillage methods (‘CA’ – permanent raised beds (PB); conventional tillage (CT)) combined with two residue levels (residue harvested (RH); residue retained (RR)). Compared to pre-experiment levels, salinity in the top 30 cm soil increased significantly during cotton (May–October), while a negligible change occurred during wheat (October–June) and maize (July–September) season. In absence of crop residues, soil salinity on top of the beds increased compared to \{CT\} without crop residue retention. When retaining crop residues, the soil salinity under \{PB\} was reduced by 32% in the top 10 cm and by 22% over the top 90 cm soil profile compared to \{CT\} without crop residue retention. Thus, \{PB\} + \{RR\} seems a promising option to slow down on-going soil salinization in salt-affected agro-ecologies such as those in the irrigated arid lands of Central Asia. "

Their development involves, as in the case of maize, selection for high grain yield and improved secondary traits. With the objective of better understanding the role and regulation of the morphology of drought adaptation, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of tropical maize (Zea mays L.) was evaluated in six field experiments under intermediate (IS) and severe (SS) drought stress at flowering and under well-watered (WW) conditions in Mexico. The analyses per water regime revealed 32 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for the five measurements of relative content of leaf chlorophyll (CL), 25 for the five visual ratings of plant senescence (SEN), and 11 for the three measurements of electric root capacitance (RCT). Impressive clusters of \{QTLs\} were observed on chromosomes 2 (bins 2.03-05), 4 (bin 4.09), and 10 (bins 10.04-05), suggesting that a small number of genes control chlorophyll metabolism and plant senescence. The high \{CL\} and low \{SEN\} of the drought resistant parent are aspects of its high water productivity resulting from improved constitutive traits. Co-locations of \{QTLs\} for CL, \{SEN\} and \{RCT\} with \{QTLs\} for plant height (PHT), the anthesis-silking interval (ASI), and grain yield (GY) were observed in bins 1.06-07, 8.06, and 4.09 but not for the large \{QTL\} clusters on chromosomes 2 and 10, suggesting independent genetic control of reproductive traits. Still, the phenotypic data showed that high \{CL\} and low \{SEN\} were favorable for grain yield production under drought, while delayed \{SEN\} was associated with higher grain yield under \{WW\} conditions. \{CL\} and \{SEN\} are suitable to complement selection for drought tolerance in order to sustain future breeding progress.

Conservation agriculture (CA) practices combined with optimum nitrogen (N) management can counterbalance some of these adverse effects. Most work has been done in rainfed areas so there is less information available for irrigated production systems. This study compared the effects of tillage, crop residue management and N rates on yield and water productivity for irrigated cotton, winter wheat and maize grown in a two-year rotational sequence in Uzbekistan under \{CA\} practices vs. current conventional farmer practices. Permanently raised beds (PB) and conventional tillage (CT) were compared under two crop residue levels (retained residue – \{RR\} and removed residue – RH), and three N levels (zero, medium and high, with actual rates depending on the crops) on a sandy loam to loam soil. Raw cotton yield, yield components and water productivity were not affected by tillage methods. However, the following crops, wheat and maize, produced 12 and 42% higher grain yields, respectively, under \{PB\} than under CT. Under PB, water productivity increased in wheat by 27% and in maize by 84%, while 11% less water was applied during wheat and 23% during maize production, compared to CT. All three crops showed a considerable increment in yield and water productivity when N fertilizer levels were increased from zero to medium N application, and a relatively much lower increment when the N rate was doubled from medium to high N, for both tillage methods. In maize, the response to applied N was more pronounced with \{PB\} than with CT. Irrespective of tillage method, \{RR\} increased the grain yield of wheat by 5% compared to RH. In maize, \{RR\} in \{PB\} increased grain yields by 15% compared to RH. \{RR\} had no effect for CT. The positive effect of \{PB\} and \{RR\} on yield and water productivity of wheat and maize and the lack of negative effects on cotton yield reflect that \{PB\} with \{RR\} and proper N application may be viable alternatives to the present, unsustainable conventional agriculture practices in these irrigated arid lands, assuming the patterns are confirmed in the long-run.

We illustrate the approach by mapping and contrasting poverty and livelihood assets within the Indian Indo-Gangetic Plains drawing on district-level indicators and livelihood asset-based principal components. The relatively low poverty incidence in the north-western plains is associated with an overall favorable livelihood asset base, particularly pronounced for natural and financial capitals. There is a marked gradient with poverty increasing eastwards, reflecting a similarly marked decline in livelihood assets. The overall unfavorable livelihood asset base in the mid-Gangetic Plains of Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh provides a particularly challenging spatial poverty trap.

However, losses due to insects during storage remain high. Hermetic storage containers, such as metal silos (soldered airtight) and super grain bags (made from high-density polyethylene to reduce gas exchange), may enable farmers to reduce post-harvest losses. To test the different containers' effectiveness to control insect pests, on-station trials were conducted at three sites in Kenya under artificial infestation with maize weevils (Sitophilus zeamais) and larger grain borers (P. truncatus). The experiment consisted of six treatments, using three different types of containers and two different insecticides: i) polypropylene bags without insecticides; ii) polypropylene bags with Actellic Super; iii) super grain bags without insecticide; iv) metal silos without insecticide; v) metal silos with Actellic Super; and vi) metal silos with Phostoxin. Treatments were replicated three times per site. The results demonstrated that metal silos are very effective in controlling maize weevils and the larger grain borer. The use of both Actellic Super and Phostoxin in the metal silos did not lead to a significant increase in insect mortality or reduction in grain weight loss. Super grain bags controlled insect pests well, but insect mortality was not complete and all bags in the trial were perforated, almost certainly by P. truncatus. We conclude that it is technically feasible to control storage insects without insecticides in Africa by using hermetic storage, either metal silos or super bags. The super bags, however, might not be suitable in areas with a high incidence of P. truncatus. "

The use of leaf number and stage of development to indicate the optimum timing for applications of fertilizers and irrigation water, and uniform seeding at reduced seeding rates to control lodging contributed significantly to the substantial progress in wheat productivity.

A historical set of 47 varieties developed and grown in the region between 1900 and 2000 was evaluated at a trial in Siberian Research Institute of Agriculture (Omsk) in 2002–2008. The genetic gains for grain yield and associated changes in agronomic traits were analyzed for three maturity groups (early, medium and late) and four breeding periods (before 1930, 1950–1975, 1976–1985 and after 1985). The overall yield was 3.71 t/ha for modern varieties versus 2.18 t/ha for old varieties representing 0.7% increase per year in the course of 100 years. The genetic gains between the breeding periods indicated that the rate of progress for the early and medium maturity groups was more or less comparable from one breeding period to the other. For the late maturity group there was an obvious and sharp decline in genetic gain with time. Modern varieties were also characterized by average response to environmental mean and good grain yield stability evaluated according to Eberhart and Russell (1966). Thousand kernel weight and number of grains per unit area were linearly correlated with grain yield and genetic gain over time suggested their importance for breeding progress. Resistance to leaf rust in some modern varieties sustained and contributed to stability of genetic gains. The yield increase over time was not associated with plant height reduction and incorporation of Rht genes. The maturity range of the newer varieties is narrower compared to old germplasm as they tend to belong to medium maturity group. Translocation 1B.1R had limited contribution to Western Siberian germplasm being observed in only three varieties. The increase in adaptation, yield potential and its stability has been reached due to gradual accumulation of favorable genes through diverse crosses, robust selection and testing system. Resistance to leaf rust and other prevalent pathogens is of paramount importance for future progress. "

A key question in breeding for tolerance to excessive moisture is the extent to which the performance of maize hybrids can be predicted on the basis of per se performance of inbred lines under excessive moisture. We attempted to identify the relationship between morpho-physiological traits and grain yield measured on inbred parents and their single cross progenies under \{EM\} stress. Responses of various morpho-physiological traits, except days to 50% anthesis, differ significantly under normal versus \{EM\} stress. Superiority of hybrid progenies over parental inbred lines increased under \{EM\} stress, suggesting that hybrids were comparatively more tolerant to \{EM\} stress than inbred progenies. Across moisture regimes, all morpho-physiological traits of hybrids, except lodging and root porosity under normal moisture, were found to be positively and significantly correlated with mid-parent traits. Our data suggest that per se performance of lines was a relatively more important factor in determining hybrid performance under \{EM\} stress, while under optimum soil moisture conditions mid-parent heterosis was relatively more important than per se performance of mid-parent. Phenotypic correlation between hybrid and mid-parent yields showed a strong relationship under \{EM\} stress (r = 0.66**). The relationship was statistically significant under normal moisture as well, though it was comparatively weak (r = 0.41*). Our findings suggest that performance of hybrid progenies under excessive moisture can be predicted and improved to some extent on the basis of their inbred parents that have been systematically selected and improved for \{EM\} stress.

A new technology, consisting of coating seed of imidazolinone resistant (IR) maize varieties with the imidazolinone herbicide, imazapyr, has proven to be very effective in controlling Striga on farmer fields. To bring this technology to the farmer, a sustainable delivery system needs to be developed, preferably with substantial participation of the private sector. To help extension agents and seed companies to develop appropriate strategies, the potential for this technology was analyzed by combining different data sources into a Geographic Information System (GIS). Superimposing secondary data, field surveys, agricultural statistics and farmer surveys made it possible to clearly identify the Striga-prone areas in western Kenya. Results found that Striga affected a maize area of 246,000 ha annually, with a population of 6.4 million people and maize production of 580,000 tons, or 81 kg/person. Population density in this area is high at 359 people/km2. A survey of 123 farmers revealed that 70% of them have Striga in their fields. A contingent valuation (CV) survey indicated that farmers would, on average, be willing to buy 3.67 kg of the IR-maize seed each at current seed prices, sufficient to sow 44% of their maize area. By extrapolation over the maize area in the zone, total potential demand for IR-maize seed is estimated at 2000–2700 tons annually. Similar calculations, but based on much less precise data and expert opinion rather than farmer surveys or trials, gives an estimate of the potential demand for IR-maize seed in Africa of 153,000 tons.

The objective of this research is to guide crop improvement efforts by prioritizing areas of high poverty, the key problem of high drought risk and the crops grown and consumed in these areas. Global spatial data on crop production, climate and poverty (as proxied by child stunting) were used to identify geographic areas of high priority for crop improvement. The analysis employed spatial overlay, drought modelling and descriptive statistics to identify where best to target technology generation to achieve its intended human welfare goals. Analysis showed that drought coincides with high levels of poverty in 15 major farming systems, especially in South Asia, the Sahel and eastern and southern Africa, where high diversity in drought frequency characterizes the environments. Thirteen crops make up the bulk of food production in these areas. A database was developed for use in agricultural research and development targeting and priority setting to raise the productivity of crops on which the poor in marginal environments depend. "

However, due to multiple other uses, small landholders in these countries are faced with trade-offs in managing crop residues. This article reviews crop residue management practices, mainly surface retention, incorporation or removal, describing their advantages and limitations in cereal-based agroecosystems in developing countries. The benefits of residue retention are regionally variable and depend on both agroclimatic and socioeconomic factors. Most studies from developing countries in Asia, Latin America, and Africa show positive effects of retaining crop residues on soil quality, soil organic matter and carbon storage, soil moisture retention, enhanced nutrient cycling, and decreased soil loss, among other environmental and soil health benefits. Variation was observed in the effect of surface retention vs. incorporation on various soil properties indicating the importance of taking into account abiotic factors such as climate, soil texture, study duration, sampling methods, and agronomic practices when assessing the impact of these practices. Negative effects of residue retention on crop performance attributed to nitrogen immobilization, waterlogging and decreased soil temperature have also been reported in some environments. Residue trade-offs in mixed crop-livestock systems in developing countries can limit the amount of residue retained. However, interventions such as intensification, partial retention, improved return of nutrients from manures, and the provision of substitutes to the current functions of livestock (e.g. mechanization, insurance) could reduce these residue trade-offs in favour of promoting long-term soil health.

Owning animals allows some households to achieve food security and maintain soil fertility by capturing and mobilizing soil nutrients. Intensification will bring various benefits to livelihoods, but these will be unevenly distributed. The results of this paper should caution scientists and policy-makers against the often heard warning of inevitable losses in soil fertility in the Sahel associated with intensive technologies, and against extrapolating conclusions attained at specific locations or social groups. Endogenous coping strategies based on using local inputs can also be effective and should be explored in addition to a continued attention for the need for more targeted uses of external inputs. "

Development of enhanced drought tolerance in crops grown in climatic zones where drought is a very dominant stress factor therefore plays an essential role in plant breeding. Previous studies demonstrated that corn yield potential and enhanced stress tolerance are associated traits. In this study, we analyzed six different maize hybrids for their ability to deal with drought stress in a greenhouse experiment. We were able to combine data from morphophysiological parameters measured under well-watered conditions and under water restriction with metabolic data from different organs. These different organs possessed distinct metabolite compositions, with the leaf blade displaying the most considerable metabolome changes following water deficiency. Whilst we could show a general increase in metabolite levels under drought stress, including changes in amino acids, sugars, sugar alcohols, and intermediates of the \{TCA\} cycle, these changes were not differential between maize hybrids that had previously been designated based on field trial data as either drought-tolerant or susceptible. The fact that data described here resulted from a greenhouse experiment with rather different growth conditions compared to natural ones in the field may explain why tolerance groups could not be confirmed in this study. We were, however, able to highlight several metabolites that displayed conserved responses to drought as well as metabolites whose levels correlated well with certain physiological traits. "

We used the HybridMaize crop simulation model to estimate potential yield for maize grown in the winter season in northwestern Bangladesh. This is a high yielding environment, where farmers achieve yields as high as 12 Mg/ha. The model predicted a mean potential yield of 12.87 Mg/ha. We used a RapidEye satellite image acquired around tasseling to identify the maize fields, calculate ground cover and its regression to actual yield from farmers’ fields. Next, the regression was applied to all the maize pixels in the image to calculate actual yield. In the last step, we created a yield gap map based on the difference between potential and actual yield. Yield gap maps will enable agronomists to identify production constraints on farmers’ fields with large yield gaps. Alternatively, by learning from the farmers with the highest actual yields and analyzing their data, it will be possible to generate region or field specific, optimized crop management recommendations.

This study identifies ways to maximize green leaf area duration during grain filling and develops \{NDVI\} models to predict physiological maturity and different stay −green parameters to increase grain yield of rainfed winter wheat under terminal drought. Three wheat populations were evaluated: one containing 240 landraces from Afghanistan, the second with 250 modern lines and varieties, tested for two years under low rainfall conditions in Turkey, and the third with 291 landraces from Central and Western Asia (grown for one year in the same location). The onset of senescence, maximum “greenness”, rate of senescence and residual “greenness” at physiological maturity were estimated using sequential measurements of \{NDVI\} and have shown significant correlations with grain yield under low rainfall rainfed conditions. Trade-offs were identified among the different stay −green attributes, e.g. delayed onset of senescence and high maximum “greenness” resulted in accelerated rates of senescence and highest yields and were most evident in the landrace populations. It is concluded, that the use of rate of senescence to select for stay −green must be coupled with other stay −green components, e.g. onset of senescence or maximum “greenness” to avoid the effects of the trade-offs on final grain yield. The \{NDVI\} decay curves (using the last three \{NDVI\} measurements up to maturity) were used to estimate days to maturity using the \{NDVI\} decay during the senescence period and days to heading. A training and testing set (20 and 80% of each population, respectively) were used for calibrations allowing for correlations between predicted and observed maturity of up to r = +0.85 (P &lt; 0.0001).

These alterations may have impacts on crop yields. The crop growth model \{DSSAT\} (Decision Support Systems for Agrotechnology Transfer) has recently been modified and used to simulate these impacts on crop growth and yield. In this study, we applied \{DSSAT\} to a long-term experiment with maize (Zea mays L.) grown under contrasting tillage and residue management practices in Monze, Southern Province of Zambia. The aim was (1) to assess the capability of \{DSSAT\} in simulating crop responses to mulching and no-tillage, and (2) to understand the sensitivity of \{DSSAT\} model output to input parameters, with special attention to the determinants of the model response to the practice of CA. The model was first parameterized and calibrated for the tillage treatment (CP) of the experiment, and then run for the \{CA\} treatment by removing tillage and applying a mulch of crop residues in the model. In order to reproduce observed maize yields under the \{CP\} versus \{CA\} treatment, optimal root development in the model was restricted to the upper 22 cm soil layer in the \{CP\} treatment, while roots could optimally develop to 100 cm depth under CA. The normalized \{RMSE\} values between observed and simulated maize phenology and total above ground biomass and grain yield indicated that the \{CA\} treatment was equally well simulated as the \{CP\} treatment, for which the model was calibrated. A global sensitivity analysis using co-inertia analysis was performed to describe the \{DSSAT\} model response to 32 model input parameters and crop management factors. Phenological cultivar parameters were the most influential model parameters. This analysis also demonstrated that in \{DSSAT\} mulching primarily affects the surface soil organic carbon content and secondly the total soil moisture content, since it is negatively correlated with simulated soil water evaporation and run-off. The correlations between the input parameters or crop management factors and the output variables were stable over a wide range of seasonal rainfall conditions. A local sensitivity analysis of simulated maize yield to three key parameters for the simulation of the \{CA\} practice revealed that \{DSSAT\} responds to mulching particularly when rooting depth is restricted, i.e., when water is a critical limiting crop growth factor. The results of this study demonstrate that \{DSSAT\} can be used to simulate crop responses to CA, in particular through simulated mulching effects on the soil water balance, but other, often site-specific, factors that are not modeled by DSSAT, such as plough pan formation under \{CP\} or improved soil structure under CA, may need to be considered in the model parameterization to reproduce the observed crop yield effects of \{CA\} versus CP.

This paper attempts to examine the factors that influence farmers׳ choice of water pumps (e.g. electric, diesel, solar photovoltaic (PV) or biogas), and to assess the impact of these water pumps on crop productivity, household income, and poverty. The paper uses the multivariate probit model and propensity score matching approach in order to achieve these objectives. The empirical results indicate that educated, younger, and wealthier farmers are more likely to adopt alternate energy-based water pumps for irrigation. Access to credit facilities and frequent hours of load shedding are key factors influencing a farmer׳s decision to adopt alternative energy-based water pumps rather than relying on electricity. Alternative energy sources have positive and significant impacts on the productivity of wheat, rice and maize crops and on household income. The use of alternative energy sources for water pumping has resulted in the reduction of poverty in the range of 11–20%. The study has important policy implications. The current energy crisis in Pakistan has adversely affected farming operations and in turn crop yield, and the use of water pumps for irrigation based on alternative energy sources has increased crop productivity. Access to these renewable energy technologies for water pumping should be encouraged through subsidies and easy availability of credit facilities, as the majority of farmers in Pakistan are resource-poor with small landholdings.

This study was conducted to develop and evaluate a selection procedure to improve the drought resistance of maize populations grown under limited moisture supply, particularly around flowering. Eighty-five full-sib progenies of the tropical lowland population Tuxpeno were grown under three soil moisture-deficit treatments at a site in Mexico without rainfall during the season. The treatments were; mild (normal irrigation); medium (irrigation to field capacity soon after emergence and again 10 days after flowering); and severe (irrigation to field capacity soon after emergence only) soil moisture-deficits. Mean yields were 6120, 4330 and 1560 kg ha−1, respectively, under the three treatments. There was significant genotype (progeny) × soil moisture-deficit interaction for grain-yield. Yield under the severemoisture-deficit was significantly correlated with a measure of the rate of leaf and stem extension (r=-0.39∗∗). Tnterval between male and female flowering (r-−0.73∗∗) and rate of foliar senescence (r=−0.39∗∗). These indices were used along with grain-yield in a selection index. To test its usefulness, experimental varieties formed from progenies selected for yield per se unde the different soil moisture-deficit treatments and for a divergence (index-tolerant and index-susceptible) of performance using the selection index were grown under conditions similar to those of the initial progeny evaluation. The drought-tolerant variety (selected for yield and favourable adaptive traits) outyieldeall others by 500 kg ha−1 under the severe moisture-deficit but not at the expense of yield under the well-watered conditions. Recurrent selection for these traits under similar moisture-deficits was practised among 250 full-sib progeny in this population for three cycles. Canopy temperature, determined by infrared thermometry prior to flowering, was highly correlated (r=−0.73∗∗) with yield under severe moisture-deficits, and was included in the selection index after the second cycle. After three cycles of improvement with a 33% progeny-selection intensity, evaluation under the same soil moisture-deficits showed that grain-yield increased by 1.8, 7.8 and 21.6%, or 320, 420 and 410 kg ha−1 cycle−1 under the mild, medium and severe moisture-deficits, respectively.

abstract = "Abstract Global demand for agricultural products is expected to double in the next decades, putting tremendous pressure on agriculture to produce more. The bulk of this increase will come from developing countries, which host most biodiversity-rich areas of the planet. Whilst most biodiversity is found in production landscapes shared with people, where agriculture represents an increasing threat, international conservation organisations continue to focus on the maintenance and expansion of the network of protected areas. When conservation organisations partner with agricultural programmes, they promote low input, extensive agriculture. Combined with the focus on protected areas, this may exacerbate rather than mitigate conflicts between biodiversity conservation and agricultural production. Two models have been proposed to increase agricultural production whilst minimising the negative consequences for biodiversity: ‘land sparing’ and ‘land sharing’. Although often polarized in debates, both are realistic solutions, depending on the local circumstances. We propose a number of criteria that could guide the choice towards one or the other. We conclude that general principles to be considered in both land sparing and land sharing are: managing spillover effects, maintaining resilience and ecosystem services, accounting for landscape structure, reducing losses and wastes, improving access to agricultural products in developing countries and changing consumption patterns in developed countries, and developing supportive markets and policies.

An average 36% loss of provitamin A and an 8% increase in tryptophan were observed following nixtamalization and subsequent snack preparation by deep-frying. The correlations for physical properties of grain and maize flour with provitamin A were calculated to investigate whether secondary traits may be useful as indicators of provitamin A content.

Industrial relevance Yellow maize is used as food and feed. Possible methodologies for rapid carotenoid estimation for industrial purposes like corn flakes or for the poultry industry will be of importance.

The estimation of carotenoid losses during this process and the bioavailability studies are important to measure the impact of biofortified maize in the populations with provitamin A deficiencies.

The objective of this study, carried out in India on 20 durum wheat cultivars, under three water regimes (full irrigation, limited irrigation and residual soil moisture) and during two seasons, was to investigate the potential use of plant traits (particularly carbon isotope discrimination, Δ, and ash content, ma) to predict grain yield and \{WUE\} in wheat. \{WUE\} components were estimated using a soil water balance model (Budget) allowing comparison of environments in data scarce situations. A highly significant correlation was noted between grain yield and grain Δ across water regimes. However, the associations between grain yield, Δ and ma were found to depend highly on the water regime and environmental conditions. The association between grain yield and grain Δ was significant under full irrigation in season 1 and under residual soil moisture in season 2. Significant positive correlations were noted in both seasons between grain yield and leaf Δ under residual soil moisture and between grain yield and leaf ash content at anthesis under limited irrigation. A significant correlation was found across environments between grain and leaf Δ and T, the quantity of water transpired during the growth cycle, as estimated by the soil water balance model. T also significantly correlated to grain and leaf ma. Variation in \{WUE\} across environments was driven more by runoff, drainage and soil evaporation than by harvest index and transpiration. The associations between \{WUE\} and transpiration, runoff and Δ were negative but not significant. \{WUE\} was significantly correlated with leaf and grain ma at maturity. The study indicates that Δ and ma can be used as indirect selection criteria for grain yield and suggests that ma is a good predictor of transpiration, grain yield and \{WUE\} across environments. The use of mechanistic models that allows differentiating between cultivars should permit in a next future to analyze the relationships between WUE, Δ and ma across cultivars and evaluate the possibility to use these traits as predictors of \{WUE\} in wheat breeding programs.

Two of the trials were based on mechanized tillage using disc plow, while two trials were based on the traditional ox-plow of Ethiopia. The four long-term trials examined the effects of alternative practices for crop residue management, tillage and cropping sequence (CS) on wheat grain yield and the severity of infestation by the grass weed Bromus pectinatus. Among the crop residue management treatments, stubble burning tended to increase the grain yield of wheat and decrease the severity of Bromus infestation in contrast to partial removal and complete retention of stubble. Conventional tillage tended to increase wheat grain yield and decrease Bromus severity in contrast to minimum and zero tillage. Faba bean (Vicia faba) included in a faba bean–wheat–wheat \{CS\} markedly increased wheat yields and reduced Bromus severity, particularly in the first wheat crop following faba bean. Significant factor interactions indicated that the severity of B. pectinatus infestation in wheat crops produced under reduced tillage systems could be minimized by burning of crop stubble and by adopting crop rotation with faba bean.

However, farmers and policy makers are particularly interested in understanding whether the new rice production technology can be substituted for the traditional rice cropping systems within a whole-farm plan context and, if so, what are the likely resource allocation and financial implications to farmers. An optimal whole-farm plan that incorporates traditional (bush fallow) cropping of rice, jointly with livestock production was generated using a linear programming model, and then used to assess the economic implications of introducing the improved fallow (i.e., incorporating Callopogonium mucunoides) rice cropping system. The alternative combinations of enterprises investigated needed to be economically viable household farm units, as well as meet household food security requirements of such resource poor farmers. Introducing the new rice production technology into a base whole-farm model (i.e., under traditional rice cropping) increased rice area by 45%, and farm income above variable costs by 34%. In addition, the representative farm raises six beef cows and 72 poultry birds. In sensitivity analyses of alternative model scenarios, farm incomes were higher and more stable for farming systems using the new rice cropping technology than with the traditional whole-farm model. More widespread adoption of the new rice-based production technology will help transform existing traditional subsistence farming systems to more profitable commercial production systems. This transformation will have implications for farm structure (in terms of consolidation of highly fragmented holdings), agricultural resource management, and property rights (such as recognition of individualized rights to cropland, livestock grazing land and agricultural water resources).

In many agricultural regions, especially in developing countries, the density of meteorological stations is low, and reliable long-term continuous data are scarce. Researchers can use interpolated surfaces of weekly or monthly climate variables and generate daily weather from these. Various software tools, called ‘weather generators’, are available to automate this data generation process. The main objective of this study was to compare the performance of three weather generators, MARKSIM, \{SIMMETEO\} and WGEN, with observed daily weather data for one of the major maize growing regions in northwest Mexico. A second objective was to evaluate the impact of using different generators for creating daily weather data for the simulation of maize and bean growth at nine locations. No single generator was clearly superior. However, considering data requirements, the weather generator \{SIMMETEO\} is robust and can be recommended for (crop) modeling applications at single point locations as well as for applications that use interpolated summary weather data as input. The weather generator \{MARKSIM\} created a high inter-annual variability and long chains of wet days that are not found in observed data, but the generator has use for areas of poor distribution of weather stations or where monthly means are unavailable. The results from this study can be considered valid for the subtropical region from which the test locations were selected. For climates in different regions of the world, we suggest repeating the evaluation process following procedures similar to those used in this paper. "

The \{DSSAT\} crop simulation models can be a valuable tool in evaluating the effects of \{CA\} which are viable both economically and environmentally. Our objectives were: (1) to evaluate the ability of \{DSSAT\} to predict continuous maize (Zea mays L.) yield for conventional tillage (CT) and \{CA\} systems as well as maize yield for a \{CA\} maize–cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) rotation on an Oxic rhodustalf (2) to use \{DSSAT\} to project weather effect of climate change on yield, economic returns and risk in \{CT\} and \{CA\} systems. The \{DSSAT\} model was calibrated using data from 2007–2008 season and validated against independent data sets of yield of 2008–2009 to 2011–2012 seasons. Simulations of maize yields were conducted on projected future weather data from 2010 to 2030 that was generated by RegCM4 using the \{A1B\} scenario. The \{DSSAT\} model calibration and validation showed that it could be used for decision-making to choose specific \{CA\} practices especially for no-till and crop residue retention. Long term simulations showed that maize–cowpea rotation gave 451 kg ha−1 and 1.62 kg mm−1 rain more maize grain yield and rain water productivity, respectively compared with CT. On the other hand, \{CT\} (3131–5023 kg ha−1) showed larger variation in yield than both \{CA\} systems (3863 kg ha−1 and 4905 kg ha−1). \{CT\} and \{CA\} systems gave 50% and 10% cumulative probability of obtaining yield below the minimum acceptable limit of 4000 kg ha−1 respectively suggesting that \{CA\} has lower probability of low yield than CT, thus could be preferred by risk-averse farmers in uncertain climatic conditions. Using similar reasoning, Mean-Gini Dominance analysis showed the dominancy of maize–cowpea rotation and indicated it as the most efficient management system. This study therefore suggests that CA, especially when all three principles are practiced by smallholders in the medium altitude of Lilongwe and similar areas, has the potential to adapt the maize based systems to climate change. Use of \{DSSAT\} simulation of the effects of \{CA\} was successful for no-till and crop residue retention, but poor for crop rotation. Refinement of crop rotation algorithm in \{DSSAT\} is recommended. "

Two years of field experiments containing three irrigation treatments each were used to evaluate the CERES-wheat crop model, with good agreement between observed and modeled yields. The model was then used in a sensitivity analysis whereby seven irrigation strategies were applied across a range of possible soil and climatic conditions. Results indicated that yield losses from reduced irrigations depend greatly on year, corresponding to large variations in rainfall between growing seasons. Estimates of the best timing strategy for a given number of irrigations were more robust with respect to climate variability. Soils also exhibited a strong interaction with irrigation, with the difference between initial soil moisture and wilting point deemed particularly important in this system. The optimal economic strategy was determined for each hypothetical soil based on the observed historical distribution of growing season climatic conditions. The results of this study demonstrate the need to consider soil and climate variability when interpreting experimental results, and the ability of the \{CERES\} model to serve this need by quantifying the relative importance of different heterogeneous factors.

Although apomixis is a complex developmental process, genetic evidence suggests that it might be inherited as a simple mendelian trait – a paradox that could be explained by recent data derived from apomictic species and model sexual organisms. The data suggest that apomixis might rely more on a global deregulation of sexual reproductive development than on truly new functions, and molecular mechanisms for such a global deregulation can be proposed. This new understanding has direct consequences for the engineering of apomixis in sexual crop species, an application that could have an immense impact on agriculture. "

The paper argues that this is due to the neglect of market opportunity as a driving force for lowland use and the agro-ecological gradient as an important modifier. The gradient is linked to three modifiers of lowland use: the relative value of lowland cropping with respect to other livelihood strategies; the biophysical productivity of lowland cropping; and the access rights to lowlands. The paper applies a regression-based decomposition framework to analyze the factors affecting lowland use in West Africa. It uses community-level data from 1014 geo-referenced lowland units around four urban centers along an agro-ecological gradient in Côte d’Ivoire and Mali. Tobit models are used to explain the extent of lowland non-use in terms of seasonal fallow, its diversity in terms of rice and other crop cultivation and its land use intensity in terms of double cropping. A multinomial logit model is used to explain lowland cropping systems. Results highlight a positive link between closeness to urban markets and the extent, diversity and intensity of lowland use. The agro-ecological gradient in West Africa has a pronounced influence on agricultural lowland use, which tends to be more widespread, diverse and intensive proceeding towards the drier ecologies. Lowland development did increase the extent and intensity of lowland use, but by favoring the cultivation of rice, had a negative impact on the diversity of lowland use. Lowland use is also associated with migrants, particularly in the more humid ecologies. Research, policy and development implications are explored. An important lesson for scaling out is that it is not proximity to urban markets per se, but the associated market access which is the key driver for more significant lowland use. "

The rate constants for P movement between the pools follow first order kinetics. The P module was calibrated and tested using three data sets from Colombia, Syria, and Tanzania. The limited testing showed that the P module simulated accurately grain yield and P uptake by wheat grown under semi-arid conditions. The wheat crop responded little to fertilization although measured Olsen P was as low as 2.6 mg kg−1. The P module overestimated P uptake for both soybean and bean crops grown in acidic soils, but predicted with a good degree of accuracy labile P in the soil and P uptake for maize grown under the same acidic conditions.

In an attempt to minimize these problems, \{IBSNAT\} reduced its focus on a central database, but considerably enhanced its effort on the design and use of a set of simple, standard experiment documentation and results files that could be established and edited easily, transferred directly among workers, used as inputs to analytical software and crop models, and read by database and spreadsheet software. The standard files which were developed, and which were used in a software package termed \{DSSAT\} V3, have recently been upgraded by a consortium of experimenters and modellers (the International Consortium for Agricultural Systems Applications; ICASA). These new files are described briefly here. The \{ICASA\} files constitute an advance in the potential for good documentation and storage of agronomic data, but only partly solve the problem of overall data management and use. There is still need for central and local databases that facilitate both the searching of information from different experiments, and the examination of relationships that may be apparent in a large array of data. A number of such databases have been developed for specific applications, and a few of these are briefly touched upon. In particular, recent work with one large database currently being developed by a number of international Agricultural Research Centers, National Research Organizations, and Universities, (the International Crop Information System, ICIS), is briefly described.

Data from 360 randomly selected rural and urban households show that yellow maize is known to all but few are aware of its nutritional qualities or consume it. The main source of supply is imported food aid. Rich in oils, carotenoids and fructose, yellow maize easily undergoes chemical changes to produce unacceptable organoleptic properties (or bad taste) if poorly handled during importation. These two factors are responsible for it being perceived inferior to white maize by consumers. Quality assurance during importation can improve consumer confidence but a long-term strategy will be to vigorously promote domestic production of yellow maize varieties rich in high levels of β-carotene that meet the preferences of consumers. Drawing from a probit model regression analysis, nutritional education can potentially promote yellow maize consumption, especially if targeted at low income households. Domestic production and consumption of yellow maize will decrease vitamin A deficiency among vulnerable groups and improve food insecurity through reduced grain prices and increased incomes for farmers. These results draw attention to the need for policy makers in developing countries to review their agricultural policies to ensure that they do not undermine the local production and consumption of nutritionally valuable crops.

The results indicate that by 2016, adoption of \{DTM\} can generate between US$ 362 million and US$ 590 million in cumulative benefits to both producers and consumers. Yield variance reductions stand to generate considerable benefits, especially in high drought risk areas. These benefits translate into poverty reductions in the range of 0.01–4.29% by 2016. Significant benefits are also found among different types of households living in drought risk areas of Kenya, Ethiopia and Nigeria. "

Thermal images of the canopy of 92 different maize genotypes were acquired on two different days in the time interval between anthesis and blister stages (grain filling 1), whereby each picture contained five plots of different genotypes and canopy temperatures calculated for each plot. Significantly, lower canopy temperatures were found in well-watered genotypes compared with water-stressed genotypes. Furthermore significant differences (p &lt; 0.001) between genotypes under water stress were detected using thermal images. A close correlation (p &lt; 0.01–0.001) between canopy temperature or modified Crop water stress index with \{NDVI\} and \{SPAD\} values was obtained.

Partial least squares regression (PLSR) calibration models with cross-validation were developed for both relative (% dry matter) and absolute (mg kernel−1) constituent contents. Similarly, models using bagging \{PLSR\} were developed. The best model obtained was for relative crude protein content, with an \{R2p\} of 0.75 and a \{SEP\} of 0.47%. Kernel mass was also highly predictable (R2p=0.76, SEP=0.03 g). Tryptophan, lysine and oil were less predictable, but showed good potential for segregating individual seeds using NIR.

In \{C4\} crops, information concerning Δ variation in different organs of the plant and its possible association with biomass or grain yield is still scarce. In the present study, Δ was first analyzed at flowering, under drought and well-watered conditions, in different organs of maize (Zea mays L.) inbred lines differing for drought tolerance. Leaf Δ was higher than ear and silk Δ. Drought stress significantly increased Δ in all organs. Under drought, tolerant inbred lines showed significantly higher Δ than susceptible ones. There was a significant positive correlation between leaf, ear and silk Δ, and ear dry weight at flowering, a trait closely associated to grain yield. Carbon isotope discrimination was then analyzed at flowering in leaves of a set of drought tolerant maize hybrids and checks. Drought tolerant hybrids had significantly higher grain yield and Δ than the used checks. No correlation was found, however, between Δ and grain yield within tolerant hybrids. The use of Δ appears consequently accurate for a first screening of lines or hybrids highly contrasting for drought tolerance, but not for a more advanced selection among tolerant hybrids. More studies are needed in maize and other \{C4\} crops to establish the causes of Δ variation and precise which organ sampled and time of sampling may allow the better precision in the screening process.

We examine the hypothesis that creolization lessens these trade-offs and, hence, is a way of enhancing the benefits that farmers obtain from improved germplasm. Results show that creolized varieties occupy a niche that shifts according to the availability of improved germplasm and the orientation of farmers’ maize production. "

When weeds are controlled with herbicides or through rotations under conservation agriculture, shifts in weed spectra are expected, increasing the need to adapt to this new situation. Experiments were conducted at four experimental sites namely the University of Zimbabwe farm (UZ) (clay soil), Domboshava Training Centre (DTC) (sand soil) and two contrasting soil types at Henderson Research Station (HRS sand (s), \{HRS\} clay (c)) to investigate the responses of weed communities to crop rotations. The trial was carried out from the 2008–09 to the 2013–14 cropping season. Rotations consisted of maize (Zea mays L.) rotating with a range of green manures, and the control treatment was maize monocropping. Herbicides were only applied in the maize phase at seeding, supplemented by hand weeding whenever weeds were 10 cm tall or 10 cm in diameter for weeds with a stoloniferous growth habit. Weed count data was collected between 2011 and 2014. Weed density, the Shannon–Weiner index and its components were used to explain weed community responses to rotations. There was a decrease in weed densities over time at all sites with a percentage decrease as high as 92% (i.e. from 357 to 30 weeds m−2) observed in maize-velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC) rotation. At all sites, some maize–green manure rotations were associated with high weed densities and these included maize-black sunnhemp (Crotalaria juncea L.) and maize-cowpea (Vigna unguiculata Walp) rotations. The two weeds Galinsoga parviflora Cav. and Ricardia scabra L. remained abundant throughout the study at all sites with densities reaching above 1000 plants m−2 per season in some plots. Shannon's E′ index was highest at \{HRSs\} and \{HRSc\} sites in the maize-velvet bean rotation and maize-common rattle pod (Crotalaria grahamiana Wight &amp; Arn.) rotations respectively suggesting that in these treatments dominant weeds were reduced in numbers. This suggests that rotations with cover crops such as velvet bean may reduce weed numbers and dominance of problematic weeds over time. This can potentially lead to a less intense weeding schedule, which is more cost effective and affordable for smallholder farmers. "

Until now, the diffusion of hybrid maize in \{LAC\} has been quite variable. Using data from 18 countries, we investigate factors affecting the hybrid maize diffusion rate. Our findings validate conventional profitability-based explanations of producer adoption behavior, but they also confirm the importance of supply-side factors, thereby providing empirical support for the life cycle theory of seed industry development. We conclude that if policy makers in \{LAC\} are to accelerate the diffusion of hybrid maize, they will have to ensure an environment in which it is not only profitable for producers to adopt improved germplasm, but also profitable for the seed industry to produce and sell high-quality seed.

But just how reliable are the results of studies that estimate the benefits of plant breeding research? This article reviews methods used to estimate the benefits of plant breeding research and discusses theoretical and empirical issues that often receive inadequate attention in applied impact assessment work. Our objective is not to question the validity of the theoretical frameworks commonly used to estimate the benefits of plant breeding research, but rather to examine problems that can arise when the widely accepted theoretical frameworks are used for empirical analysis. Most of these problems can be grouped into three basic categories: (1) problems associated with measuring adoption and diffusion of MVs, (2) problems associated with estimating benefits attributable to adoption of MVs, and (3) problems associated with assigning credit among the various plant breeding programmes that participated in developing the MVs.

Maize farms are small, and population pressure necessitates the intensification of existing farming systems. Maize research directed at developing technologies for maize production began in Nepal in 1965. In 2000, a survey was carried out in two districts to determine the current level of adoption of improved maize production practices. In each of these districts, remote and accessible village development committees (VDCs) were surveyed. Questionnaires were administered to 54 randomly selected households in each VDC. A Tobit analysis was used to determine socio-economic, physical and technology factors that influence the use of improved varieties by farmers. All households use composted farmyard manure, and in the more accessible areas, urea as part of their soil fertility management strategy. Use of improved varieties was less than 60% for all \{VDCs\} and only 15% in the most remote VDC. In three of the four VDCs, adoption of improved varieties primarily occurred during the past 5 years. Based on a Tobit analysis, Khet land area, ethnic group, years of fertiliser use, off-farm income, and contact with extension significantly and positively affected adoption of improved varieties. Farmers in \{VDCs\} in central Nepal reported lack of seed to be the major constraint to the adoption of improved varieties, while lack of knowledge of new varieties was the major constraint for farmers in the western VDCs. The results from this survey suggest that the strategy for improving the adoption of new varieties will differ depending on infrastructure and the socio-economic conditions of the farmers in a given area.

Genetic resistance, rather than fungicide application, is the principal means of controlling leaf rust in developing countries. Whereas productivity enhancement is often estimated in terms of yield gains and increased supply, productivity maintenance is measured in terms of the yield losses avoided by the research investment. The internal rate of return on CIMMYT’s research investment was estimated at 41%. When discounted by 5%, the net present value was US$ 5.36 billion in 1990 dollars, and the benefit–cost ratio was 27:1.

The aim in this paper is to examine issues relating to the economic impact of a quality-reducing, seed-borne disease, and to highlight differences compared to non-seed-borne diseases affecting yield only. Economic evaluation of quality-reducing, seed-borne diseases needs to incorporate impacts of trading restrictions such as quarantines or embargoes imposed by purchasers. The costs of measures taken to control diseases also represent part of the economic impact of the disease. Full economic costs of a disease include the direct (yield and quality) costs and costs of the control measures. The costs of Karnal bunt of wheat in Mexico were found to include many control costs that have often been overlooked. The optimal amount of resources to invest in controlling a disease depends on the likely annual costs of the disease and of control measures. Before implementing disease control policies, both the costs and the benefits of the policies need to be considered, taking the risks of each option into account, to ensure that the policy itself does not impose greater costs than the uncontrolled disease.

Using taxonomic and phylogenetic information it was found that zero tillage most affected the bacterial communities. The relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Betapreoteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria was affected by tillage and correlated to the total organic carbon (TOC) and clay content in soil. Residue management had a significant effect on the bacterial community structure when phylogenetic membership and the total enumeration of bacteria were considered. Residue management affected the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, Betaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes. When no tillage was applied, crop residue management affected the microbial communities more than when conventional tillage was applied. Wheat–maize rotation or crop monoculture did not affect the bacterial community structure. No significant differences in richness, diversity and total abundance of bacteria was found between the treatments. This indicated that even though phylotypes changed, the number and diversity of the bacterial communities were similar. "

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of different weed control strategies on weed flora and composition under conservation agriculture (CA) systems in Zimbabwe. This study was conducted at three on-station trial sites namely Domboshawa Training Centre (DTC), University of Zimbabwe farm (UZ farm) and Henderson Research Station (HRS) in a maize–soybean rotation for four seasons from 2009–2010 to 2012–2013 seasons. Hand weeding was done whenever weeds were 10 cm tall or 10 cm in circumference for weeds with a stoloniferous growth habit. Weed identification was done up to the weed species level, and the Shannon–Weiner diversity and evenness index was used to determine the response of weed flora to herbicides. Results showed that there were more weeds in the early years which decreased gradually until the final season. Weed species diversity was not affected by herbicide application and the results indicated that weed species diversity was small in \{CA\} systems. Annual weed species constituted a greater proportion of species, and species richness decreased with the duration of the study. Richardia scabra L. and Galinsoga parviflora Cav. were the most common dominant weed species at all sites and in all seasons. Moreover, herbicide application had no effect on the evenness of weeds in the plots but site characteristics had a significant effect on the distribution of weed species (weed species evenness). The results presented in this study suggest that herbicide application facilitates a depletion of weed seed bank/number of weeds over time. Thus, herbicide application in \{CA\} has potential to reduce weed density, species richness and species diversity in the long term which may lead to more labour savings and larger yields. "

This work examined the effects of drought and heat stress conditions on grain yield and quality parameters of nine durum wheat varieties, grown during two years (2008–09 and 2009–10). Generally, G and E showed main effects on all the parameters whereas the effects of G × E were relatively small. More precipitation in Y09–10 may account for the large differences in parameters observed between crop cycles (Y08–09 and Y09–10). Combined results of the two crop cycles showed that flour protein content (FP) and \{SDS\} sedimentation volume (SDSS) increased under both stress conditions, but not significantly. In contrast the gluten strength-related parameters lactic acid retention capacity (LARC) and mixograph peak time (MPT) increased and decreased significantly under drought and heat stress, respectively. Drought and heat stress drastically reduced grain yield (Y) but significantly enhanced flour yellowness (FY). \{LARC\} and the swelling index of glutenin (SIG) could be alternative tests to screen for gluten strength. Genotypes and qualtiy parameters performed differently to drought and heat stress, which justifies screening durum wheat for both yield and quality traits under these two abiotic stress conditions.

Targeted breeding for these biofortified varieties was initiated by exploiting available genetic diversity for Zn and Fe from wild relatives of cultivated wheat and synthetic hexaploid progenitors. The proof-of-concept results from the performance of competitive biofortified wheat lines showed good adaptation in target environments without compromising essential core agronomic traits. Agronomic biofortification through fertilizer approaches could complement the existing breeding approach; for instance, foliar application of Zn fertilizer can increase grain Zn above the breeding target set by nutritionists. This review synthesizes the progress made in genetic and agronomic biofortification strategies for Zn and Fe enrichment of wheat. "

Wheat grain yield and yield components were measured in a long-term trial established in 1992 under irrigated, arid conditions in northwestern Mexico. Five tillage–straw management systems (conventionally tilled raised beds [CTB] with straw incorporated and permanent raised beds [PB] with straw burned, removed, partly retained or fully retained) were compared for a wheat–maize rotation. Daily climatic data were averaged over six periods corresponding approximately to advancing wheat growth stages. The PB-straw retained and PB-straw removed had the highest yields (average yield of 7.31 and 7.24 t ha−1, respectively) and grains per m2. The PB-straw burned had the lowest yield (average yield of 6.65 t ha−1) and grains per m2, but the highest thousand kernel weight. Maximum temperature was positively correlated to final grain yield during tillering and head differentiation, but was negatively correlated to thousand kernel weight during grain-filling. For the tillage–straw system year interaction, three groups of management systems were distinguished for yield and grains per m2: PB-straw burned, CTB-straw incorporated and \{PB\} where straw is not burned. The CTB-straw incorporated had a positive interaction with year in favorable years with high radiation and evapotranspiration. The PB-straw burned was relatively more affected by excess water conditions and showed positive interactions in years with high relative humidity. The PB-straw retained was the most stable in different climatic conditions, indicating that this management system could contribute to maintaining wheat yield in a changing climate scenario. "

Variability in the sterility mosaic pathogen revealed the occurrence of five different isolates in India. Among them, three distinct \{SMD\} isolates have been characterized, viz., Patancheru, Bangalore and Coimbatore. Molecular tools offer a viable option to tackle these biotic stresses via identification of the genomic regions associated with the trait such as \{SMD\} resistance.

After screening over 3000 \{SSR\} markers on parental genotypes of each mapping population, intra-specific genetic maps comprising of 11 linkage groups and 120 and 78 \{SSR\} loci were developed for \{ICP\} 8863 × \{ICPL\} 20097 and \{TTB\} 7 × \{ICP\} 7035 populations, respectively. Composite interval mapping (CIM) based \{QTL\} analysis by using genetic mapping and phenotyping data provided four \{QTLs\} for Patancheru \{SMD\} isolate and two \{QTLs\} for Bangalore \{SMD\} isolate. Identification of different \{QTLs\} for resistance to Patancheru and Bangalore \{SMD\} isolates is an indication of involvement of different genes conferring the resistance to these two \{SMD\} isolates. One \{QTL\} namely qSMD4 identified within an interval of 2.8 cM on \{LG\} 7 explaining 24.72% of phenotypic variance, once it is validated in other genetic background, seems to be a promising \{QTL\} for use in marker assisted selection.

The present study investigated the trend in variability and association between food and fodder traits in inbred parents and the hybrids derived from them and assessed the general combining ability (GCA) of inbred lines for both food and fodder traits. Sixteen inbred lines and sixty single cross hybrids generated by a 10 × 6 factorial mating design were evaluated for grain and stover yield and a range of laboratory stover fodder quality traits across three environments in Ethiopia. The hybrid and inbred line trials were planted in adjacent blocks in the same fields using an alpha lattice experimental design. Genotypes in both hybrids and inbred trials showed highly significant differences for all the traits studied. Generally, hybrids had higher grain and stover yields and lower stover fodder quality traits than the inbred lines. Both the magnitude and direction of relationship for almost all traits were similar among genotypes in the inbred and hybrid trials. General combining abilities of both lines and testers and specific combining ability (SCA) of line by tester interactions were significant for most traits studied. The highly significant \{GCA\} effects observed for most traits and the greater relative importance of \{GCA\} (lines and testers) as compared to \{SCA\} for grain yield and most stover fodder quality traits suggest the importance of additive gene effects in controlling grain and stover yield as well as stover fodder quality. Important stover fodder quality traits such as digestibility and metabolizable energy were highly heritable (h2 = 0.79–0.81) and the genotypic variations among hybrids in these traits will have implications for productivity of maize stover fed to livestock or for the income of farmers selling maize stover to fodder value chains. Significant positive relationships observed between inbred lines per se and hybrid performances for these fodder quality traits suggest the feasibility of predicting hybrid performance from the performance of the inbred lines.

abstract = "Conservation Agriculture (CA) is being advocated to enhance soil health and sustain long term crop productivity in the developing world. One of CA's key principles is the maintenance of soil cover often by retaining a proportion of crop residues on the field as mulch. Yet smallholder crop–livestock systems across Africa and Asia face trade-offs among various options for crop residue use. Knowledge of the potential trade-offs of leaving more residues as mulch is only partial and the objective of this research is to address some of these knowledge gaps by assessing the trade-offs in contrasting settings with mixed crop–livestock systems. The paper draws from village surveys in 12 sites in 9 different countries across Sub-Sahara Africa and South Asia. Sites were clustered into 3 groups along the combined population and livestock density gradients to assess current crop residue management practices and explore potential challenges to adopting mulching practices in different circumstances. Results show that although high-density sites face higher potential pressure on resources on an area basis, biomass production tends to be more substantial in these sites covering demands for livestock feed and allowing part of the residues to be used as mulch. In medium-density sites, although population and livestock densities are relatively lower, biomass is scarce and pressure on land and feed are high, increasing the pressure on crop residues and their opportunity cost as mulch. In low-density areas, population and livestock densities are relatively low and communal feed and fuel resources exist, resulting in lower potential pressure on residues on an area basis. Yet, biomass production is low and farmers largely rely on crop residues to feed livestock during the long dry season, implying substantial opportunity costs to their use as mulch. Despite its potential benefit for smallholder farmers across the density gradient, the introduction of CA-based mulching practices appears potentially easier in sites where biomass production is high enough to fulfil existing demands for feed and fuel. In sites with relatively high feed and fuel pressure, the eventual introduction of \{CA\} needs complementary research and development efforts to increase biomass production and/or develop alternative sources to alleviate the opportunity costs of leaving some crop residues as mulch.

This study aims at examining the effect of tillage–residue management systems on wheat yield and quality in two cropping cycles, 19 years after establishment of tillage–residue management systems in 1992. Wheat grain samples were collected in an experiment with a durum wheat-maize (Zea mays L.) rotation and furrow-irrigation, conducted in the arid Yaqui Valley of north-western Mexico. Main plots had five tillage–crop residue management treatments: conventionally tilled raised beds (CTB) with straw incorporated and permanent raised beds (PB) with straw burned, removed, partly retained or fully retained. Split plots had seven nitrogen (N) fertilizer treatments with different rate (0, 150 or 300 kg N ha−1) and timing of application (basal, 1st node and split between both). Highest yields were obtained with PB-straw partly retained and 300 kg N ha−1 split application in 2010/11 (7.48 t ha−1) and with PB-straw removed and 300 kg N ha−1 applied at 1st node in 2011/12 (8.26 t ha−1). Permanent beds with full residue retention had high yellow berry (YB, opaque and starchy endosperm) incidence, even with 300 kg N ha−1; 19.5% in 2010/11 and 9.4% in 2011/12 of the grain kernels were affected by YB. Four groups of tillage–straw systems with different characteristics in relation to the durum wheat quality and yield were distinguished with a principal component analysis: PB-partly retained with high yields and acceptable quality, PB-straw retained with low quality and acceptable yields, \{CTB\} with intermediate quality results and lower yields and PB-straw burned with high quality and low yields. Results indicate a significant effect of timing of N application on durum wheat grain quality in PB. For both cycles and both N rates, the application of mineral N resulted in higher grain quality when all N was applied near 1st node. Grain quality was highest in PB-straw burned, but this practice had the lowest yields. For PB-straw fully retained, 1st node application of N fertilizer is recommended to minimize N immobilization. To obtain stable yields and desirable quality, alternative tillage practices such as \{PB\} with full or partial residue retention require adjusted, site-specific N management. Further research is required to identify fertilization strategies in tillage systems with full or partial residue retention that include fertilizer applications after first node to improve grain quality.

abstract = "Abstract Cotton–wheat cropping system is the second most important wheat based system in the South Asia (4.5 M ha) and India (2.6 M ha) and contributes significantly to the food security in the region. However, with the conventional method of crop establishment and crop management, the productivity and profitability of the cotton–wheat system is low. Hence, despite non-suitability of growing situations, farmers are inclined towards cultivating the conventionally tilled rice–wheat rotation which has got severe consequences on the natural resources as well as the future food security. Therefore, an attempt was made to develop and evaluate the performances (in terms of system productivity, water productivity and profitability) of conservation agricultural technologies (like permanent narrow and broad-bed planting and residue management under zero tillage) under an irrigated cotton–wheat system in the region. Treatments included farmers’ practice (conventional tillage and flat-bed sowing without residue recycling; CT), and four combinations of raised-bed planting and residue management under zero tillage (viz., narrow-bed and broad-bed sowing with and without crop residue retention) in the first year. During the second year onwards two additional treatments were included: flat-bed sowing under zero tillage with and without residue retention. Results indicate that mean (of last two years) seed cotton yield in the plots under zero tilled permanent broad-bed sowing with residue retention (PBB + R) was about 24 and 51% higher compared with zero tilled narrow-bed sowing without residue retention (PNB; 2.91 Mg ha−1) and \{CT\} plots (2.59 Mg ha−1), respectively. Similarly, plots under \{PBB\} + R had significantly higher mean (of last two years) wheat grain yield than flat-bed zero tilled (ZT) and \{CT\} plots. Unlike seed cotton yield, wheat grain yield was not affected by the treatments in the first year. In the second year, plots under \{PBB\} + R had about 9 and 11% higher wheat grain yield than \{PNB\} (4.37 Mg ha−1) and \{CT\} (4.29 Mg ha−1) plots, respectively. Although the system productivity in terms of wheat equivalent yield (WEY) was similar in the plots under \{PBB\} + R and zero tilled-broad permanent bed sowing without residue retention (PBB) and zero tilled narrow-bed sowing with residue retention (PNB + R) in the first year, plots under \{PBB\} + R had about 15 and 13% higher \{WEY\} than \{PBB\} and \{PNB\} + R plots. Similarly, mean (of the last two years) water productivity of the system in the \{PBB\} + R treated plots (12.58 kg wheat grain ha−1 mm−1) was 48, 22, 12, 15, 13, 24% higher compared with CT, PNB, \{PNB\} + R, PBB, \{ZT\} + R and \{ZT\} plots, respectively. The above-said \{PBB\} + R plots also had the highest net returns (based on mean values of last two years) that was 36 and 13% higher compared with \{CT\} and \{PNB\} plots, but was similar to other treatments. Therefore, growing cotton–wheat system under permanent beds with residue retention is recommended under irrigated conditions in this region due to its potential of increased productivity, profitability and resource conservation.

Despite this, occasionally poor effectiveness of control had been documented in some sites that required explanation. Analysis of the data against rainfall patterns suggested that: 1. poor maize emergence occurred when there was limited rainfall at germination, possibly due to inhibition by a very high herbicide concentration too near the maize seed; 2. there was poor Striga control in seasons of very high rainfall, possibly due to herbicide washout away from the maize root zone where Striga germinates and attaches. These field assessments were matched by experiments suggesting that slow release formulations might alleviate the problems. A series of slow release formulations were synthesized based on binding imazapyr to high capacity anion exchangers and using them to coat maize seed. The best seems to be a polyethyleneimine gel. Epidemiological field data from a multitude of sites support the conclusion that the slow release formulations increased stand establishment across sites and seasons compared to the control where there was low rainfall.

Seedling heat tolerance is critical for adequate crop establishment. Because field screening for emerging seedling heat tolerance is tedious, inconsistent, and seasonally limited, it is essential for genetic improvement to have effective and validated techniques to identify sources of tolerance and for evaluating breeding material. The objective of this research was to define a simple laboratory procedure for evaluating sorghum seedlings for their capacity to survive a controlled heat shock and resume growth, and to determine if there were significant differences for heat tolerance among the cultivars tested. Seven genotypes were grown between vertical transparent plexiglass plates in a growth chamber at 30 °C, exposed to direct heat shock via a water bath at 50 °C for 0, 10, 20 and 30 min and then returned to the 30 °C growth chamber. Coleoptile growth was measured at 8, 20, 32, and 44 h after the heat treatment. Heat tolerance per se was expressed by a heat tolerance index (HTI) defined as a ratio of resumed coleoptile growth after the controlled heat shock, compared to normal growth. Ten minutes heat exposure-separated genotypes better across the time interval for coleoptile recovery compared to other exposures. Genotype × exposure interaction for \{HTI\} was significant at P &lt; 0.001 and &lt; 0.05 for 32 and 44 h intervals, respectively. The technique for heat screening at 50 °C, 10 min of exposure and measuring coleoptile length after 32 h of recovery was the best treatment combination. This method is relatively simple and inexpensive and can be used to screen a large number of genotypes. "

Most producers attributed the observed improvement of mango production to the success of biological control. Based on production estimates by producers, the negative impact of the pest on plant production and the positive impact of the introduced natural enemy were demonstrated. Interviewed mango producers gained on average US$ 328 per year by the biological control programme. Extrapolated to all producers of Benin, a yearly gain of US$ 50 million in mango production can be estimated. The present value of accrued benefits is estimated at US$ 531 million over a period of 20 years. The total cost of the biological control of mango mealybug is estimated at US$ 3.66 million, which includes initial costs in other African countries and the introduction of the natural enemy from India, resulting in a benefit–cost ratio of 145:1 for benefits in Benin alone.

It is also recognized that livestock are an essential asset of poor farmers in the mixed crop-livestock systems in this region. One of the major constraints to their productivity is, however, feed availability. A significant proportion of this feed is sourced from maize stover. We engaged in a multi-disciplinary research of dual-purpose maize cultivars with the purpose of contributing to smallholder food security. The specific objective of our endeavor is to better match new maize cultivars to farmers’ needs by including fodder traits in maize improvement programs in Ethiopia, Tanzania and Kenya. We explored a novel approach for targeting maize breeding research. Agricultural development strategies must recognize heterogeneity in bio-physical, economic, socio-cultural, institutional and environmental factors when devising interventions and investments. The research effort into maize as a food and feed resource was, therefore, carried out in a cross-section of bio-physically and socio-economically contrasting areas across the three study countries. To this effect the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre's traditional targeting framework, maize mega-environments (MMEs), was combined with recommendation domains for dual-purpose maize using a Geographical Information System (GIS). The GIS-based approach provided a spatial framework for the structured exploration of opportunities to transfer knowledge and technologies. Results show that maize is potentially an important feed resource in areas with high feed demand. Throughout the different MMEs, a range of different incentives for dual-purpose varieties can be found. The maps with recommendation domains for dual-purpose maize will facilitate better targeting of new maize cultivars. Cultivars with good quality stover can now be preferentially promoted in areas with high demand for stover as feed, while at the same time matched to the bio-physically most suitable mega-environment. This integrated approach is widely applicable and will help increase the impacts from agricultural research. "

As a further step towards finding maize genotypes with acceptable levels of resistance to the maize weevil, 53 experimental maize hybrids that were generated in a North Carolina design \{II\} mating scheme, were evaluated for grain weight loss due to maize weevil damage under ambient temperature and humidity (ATH) conditions, in the on-station stock room at Harare, Zimbabwe. The study indicated that genotypic variation for grain weevil resistance was large (19%–57%) after five months of infestation by the maize weevils. A few \{F2\} populations with potential for use as sources of breeding new varieties for maize weevil resistance were identified. They displayed consistency of high performance (better than the standard control varieties) and showed a lower rate of grain weight loss due to the maize weevils over the five months in the stock room. The male and female \{GCA\} and \{SCA\} effects were highly significant (P ≤ 0.01) for maize weevil resistance, especially at two months after infestation, indicating that resistance was controlled by genes with both additive and non-additive effects, respectively. Further, the distribution of grain weight loss data for the hybrids was continuous and almost normal at the four intervals of data collection, clearly supporting that resistance was partial and possibly conditioned by minor genes with cumulative effects. Therefore, resistance could probably be improved by selection among the promising \{F2\} populations identified in this study. Although resistance was partial, a plot of grain weight loss of hybrids from the different categories demonstrated the advantage to farmers for growing a resistant variety (low percentage loss over time) compared to the susceptible ones that incurred significant grain weight losses. However, grain weight loss data were not significantly correlated with yield (r = 0.14; P &gt; 0.05), suggesting that the traits are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, breeding for maize weevil resistance in these populations would not necessarily compromise grain yield. Our results demonstrate that there is potential in developing maize varieties with acceptable levels of maize weevil resistance through recurrent selection procedures which exploit both \{GCA\} and \{SCA\} effects with sustainable impact on food security and the environment.

Maize yield data was obtained from plots under no-tillage as well as from conventionally tilled plots. Crop residues were retained in no-till plots, whereas they were removed from conventional tillage plots in line with current farmer practices. Rotations or intercropping systems with grain legumes were introduced at all sites. Fertiliser treatments were uniform across tillage treatments at each trial location but varied across countries, based on local fertilizer recommendations. Focus group discussions were conducted with farmers in the study sites to understand the constraints related to the successful integration of \{CA\} into the farming systems and to document farmers’ perceptions about CA. In the majority of cases (80%), yield responses from a range of \{CA\} systems were greater than those of the conventional control plot at the respective site. In 20% of the cases there was a negative response to CA, due to lack of experience by farmers in the initial year, slow increase in soil fertility at the respective site and waterlogging in some years with too much rainfall. Yield advantages on two manual \{CA\} systems, planted with a dibble stick with sole maize and maize-legume intercropping in Malawi were 1152 kg ha−1 and 1172 kg ha−1, respectively. Animal traction \{CA\} systems had slightly smaller yield benefits (458 kg ha−1 on a ripline seeded system and 761 kg ha−1 on an animal traction direct seeding systems) as compared to a ploughed control treatment. Yield benefits increased with increasing years of practicing CA, highlighting the need to gain experience to master critical management steps such as timely planting, weeding, fertiliser application and crop harvest residue management. Yields from \{CA\} system responded better to increasing clay and silt content in the top soil and were more resilient to seasonal rainfall variability than conventional control treatments. Results suggest that the niche for \{CA\} in southern Africa is larger than expected although rainfalls regimes below 600 mm are challenging to sustain large maize biomass production to provide effective soil cover in \{CA\} systems. The success of \{CA\} implementation will largely depend on addressing critical challenges observed in the field, which will need adaptation of \{CA\} system to the site and farmer circumstances. "

Simulated yields were within one standard error of the observed in the majority of cases. A sensitivity analysis for key parameters in the velvet bean module highlighted, that those governing the N content of crop root and shoot residues had greatest impact on maize yield response. Parameters controlling production and partitioning of root or shoot biomass were less important. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a cropping systems simulation model being tested for its ability to simulate the production of a green manure legume followed by a cereal. "

A field study was conducted using three wheat varieties (Bhrikuti, BL1473, and Kanchan) during the 2002 and 2003 wheat seasons at Rampur, Nepal, where \{HLB\} is a serious problem every year. The objective was to determine the effect of different levels of potassium (K) on reducing \{HLB\} severity on wheat and the associated increases in grain yield and thousand-kernel weight (TKW). The experiment was conducted in a split–split-plot layout in a randomized block with three replicates. Main, sub-, and sub–sub-plots consisted of three levels of K (0, 30, and 60 kg ha−1 of K2O), fungicide spray (protected and non-protected), and three wheat varieties, respectively. Multiple \{HLB\} scores were recorded to calculate the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC). Application of 30 and 60 kg ha−1 of \{K2O\} reduced \{AUDPC\} by 43 and 51%, respectively. These reductions in \{AUDPC\} increased grain yield by 53 and 61% in 2002 and 78 and 125% in 2003. The corresponding gains in \{TKW\} were 46 and 42% in 2002 and 27 and 45% in 2003. Seed infection went from 38 to 21% in 2002 due to potash application; the reduction in 2003 was non-significant. All three wheat varieties showed reductions in disease severity due to K application in both years, which resulted in increased grain yield and TKW. Applying 30 kg ha−1 of \{K2O\} produced grain yields comparable to those in fungicide-protected plots without K. This underlines the importance of applying \{K2O\} to reduce grain yield losses due to \{HLB\} when fungicide is either unavailable or too costly, a situation frequently encountered by resource-poor farmers in the Eastern Gangetic Plains of South Asia. These findings may be useful in developing an integrated \{HLB\} management strategy in South Asia, and elsewhere, as part of a holistic crop management approach. "

For the conventional planting system, two additional treatments were implemented, one using support nets to eliminate lodging and the other by applying the growth regulator, ethephon, to control lodging. In both years, lodging occurred late (25–30 days after anthesis) but significant grain yield reductions for lodging susceptible genotypes were observed. The Indian cultivar, \{HD\} 2329, and the Mexican advanced line, Super Seri, recorded maximum grain yield loss (7.6–8.9%) due to lodging. Ethephon (480 g ha−1) application controlled lodging by reducing plant height but also decreased average grain yield by 8.3%, which was primarily associated with a significant reduction in number of kernels per spike. Interaction between management practices (with and without ethephon) and genotypes was significant for grain yield, HI, kernel weight and kernels per spike but non-significant for biomass and spikes per square meter. Super Seri produced the highest yield across all management practices. This genotype possesses the translocation carrying the Lr19 gene, which likely contributed to its higher grain yield (10–12%) when compared to the near isogenic cultivar, Seri 82, which is devoid of the Lr19 gene. Therefore, the incorporation of this gene into other high yielding semi-dwarf wheat genotypes may enhance wheat yield in addition to providing resistance to leaf rust. "

Agricultural sustainability problems resulting from soil erosion and fertility decline have arisen throughout this agro-ecological zone. This article considers practices that would sustain higher and stable yields for wheat and maize in such region. A long-term field experiment under rainfed conditions was started at El Batán, Mexico (2240 m a.s.l.; 19.31°N, 98.50°W; fine, mixed, thermic, Cumulic Haplustoll) in 1991. It included treatments varying in: (1) rotation (continuous maize (Zea mays) or wheat (Triticum aestivum) and the rotation of both); (2) tillage (conventional, zero and permanent beds); (3) crop residue management (full, partial or no retention). Small-scale maize and wheat farmers may expect yield improvements through zero tillage, appropriate rotations and retention of sufficient residues (average maize and wheat yield of 5285 and 5591 kg ha−1), compared to the common practices of heavy tillage before seeding, monocropping and crop residue removal (average maize and wheat yield of 3570 and 4414 kg ha−1). Leaving residue on the field is critical for zero tillage practices. However, it can take some time—roughly 5 years—before the benefits are evident. After that, zero tillage with residue retention resulted in higher and more stable yields than alternative management. Conventional tillage with or without residue incorporation resulted in intermediate yields. Zero tillage without residue drastically reduced yields, except in the case of continuous wheat which, although not high yielding, still performed better than the other treatments with zero tillage and residue removal. Zero tillage treatments with partial residue removal gave yields equivalent to treatments with full residue retention (average maize and wheat yield of 5868 and 5250 kg ha−1). There may be scope to remove part of the residues for fodder and still retain adequate amounts to provide the necessary ground cover. This could make the adoption of zero tillage more acceptable for the small-scale, subsistence farmer whose livelihood strategies include livestock as a key component. Raised-bed cultivation systems allow both dramatic reductions in tillage and opportunities to retain crop residues on the soil surface. Permanent bed treatments combined with rotation and residue retention yielded the same as the zero tillage treatments, with the advantage that more varied weeding and fertilizer application practices are possible. It is important small-scale farmers have access to, and are trained in the use of these technologies. "

This study was designed to assess grain yield performance, endosperm modification, and protein quality and quantity under two contrasting soil nitrogen environments. A 15-parent diallel cross was evaluated under one low nitrogen stress and one optimal nitrogen environment each at Harare (Zimbabwe) and Bako (Ethiopia). Most \{QPM\} hybrids showed higher protein quality levels than the best non-QPM check under both conditions. Protein concentration tended to vary across nitrogen levels, but not endosperm type. Significant differences were found for the test of main effect (nitrogen-level) for endosperm modification and tryptophan concentration. This indicated that \{QPM\} maintains quality even under low soil nitrogen, a widespread condition in Africa. General combining ability (GCA) mean squares were highly significant for most protein quality traits for each environment and across environments whereas specific combining ability (SCA) mean squares were not significant in most cases. This indicated that additive gene effects were primarily responsible for variation of most traits evaluated and hence progeny performance can adequately be predicted on the basis of parental performance. Inbred lines P2, \{P4\} and \{P12\} had desirable \{GCA\} effects for endosperm modification while \{P1\} and \{P3\} had the best \{GCA\} for tryptophan concentration in grain.

Over the last half a century there has only been negligible adoption of new maize varieties that have been centrally developed and then released for cultivation in this complex environment. Acquisition of local knowledge and participation of farmers in participatory varietal selection (PVS) and participatory plant breeding (PPB) enabled rapid identification and development of germplasm adapted to the farming system with significantly higher yield than extant varieties. Two unreleased open-pollinated varieties (Population-22 and BA-93-2126#2 and two released (Manakamana-1 and Arun-1), and four newly bred composite varieties by PPB, all with attributes conforming to farmers’ articulated requirements, were evaluated in on-station and on-farm participatory trials that used a Mother and Baby design. Population-22, not previously released because it was later maturing than local varieties, was preferred by farmers over both local and released varieties. It had higher grain yield (21–52% more than local varieties) and several other traits that were compatible with the agricultural system of the middle hills, revealing that farmers were prepared to trade-off later maturity against other traits. This led to the release of Population-22 as Manakamana-3 in 2002. \{PPB\} involved mass selection by farmers from crossing various combinations of local and new white- and yellow-grained varieties. The variety most preferred by farmers, PM-7, was developed from crossing a new yellow-grained variety with local and new white-grained varieties and extracting a white-grained population from the segregating progeny after two generations. Overall, it was demonstrated that local knowledge acquisition and \{PVS\} led to farmers selecting a variety that had previously escaped identification, while through \{PPB\} farmers participated in developing new varieties with specific adaptation to the target area. Involving the client farmers in the breeding and selection process broke an impasse in finding new varieties that combined higher yield in marginal hill environments with the required compatibility with the farming system.

We present a theoretical framework largely based on Bradshaw's principles of phenotypic plasticity (Adv. Gen. 13: 115) updated to account for recent developments in physiology and genetics. Against this framework we discuss associations between plasticity of yield and plasticity of phenological development. Plasticity was quantified using linear models of phenotype vs environment for 169 wheat lines grown in 6 environments in Mexico, 32 sunflower hybrids grown in at least 15 environments in Argentina and 7 grapevine varieties grown in at least 14 environments in Australia. In wheat, yield ranged from 0.6 to 7.8 t ha−1 and the range of plasticity was 0.74–1.27 for yield and 0.85–1.17 for time to anthesis. The duration of the post-anthesis period as a fraction of the season was the trait with the largest range of plasticity, i.e. 0.47–1.80. High yield plasticity was an undesirable trait as it was associated with low yield in low-yielding environments. Low yield plasticity and high yield in low-yielding environments were associated with three phenological traits: early anthesis, long duration and low plasticity of post-anthesis development. In sunflower, yield ranged from 0.5 to 4.9 t ha−1 and the range of plasticity was 0.72–1.29 for yield and 0.72–1.22 for time to anthesis. High yield plasticity was a desirable trait as it was primarily associated with high yield in high-yielding environments. High yield plasticity and high yield in high-yielding environments were associated with two phenological traits: late anthesis and high plasticity of time to anthesis. In grapevine, yield ranged from 1.2 to 18.7 t ha−1 and the range of plasticity was 0.79–1.29 for yield, 0.86–1.30 for time of budburst, 0.84–1.18 for flowering, and 0.78–1.16 for veraison. High plasticity of yield was a desirable trait as it was primarily associated with high yield in high-yielding environments. High yield plasticity was associated with two phenological traits: plasticity of budburst and plasticity of anthesis. We report for the first time positive associations between plasticities of yield and phenology in crop species. It is concluded that in addition to phenology per se (i.e. mean time to a phenostage), plasticity of phenological development merits consideration as a distinct trait influencing crop adaptation and yield.

Nutrient deficiency is known to aggravate Striga infestation and in a number of plant species it was recently shown that this may be due to increased secretion of Striga germination stimulants into the soil. The present study was designed to observe the connection between soil fertility, secretion of germination stimulants and Striga infection in maize under greenhouse and field conditions. The experiments were conducted during two successive cropping seasons (2008 and 2009). The greenhouse study showed that maize secretes a number of so far unidentified strigolactones that induce Striga seed germination and the amount of these strigolactones increases upon N and P deficiency. The increased secretion of germination stimulants under N and P deficiency resulted in increased Striga infection in pot experiments. The on-station and on-farm field trials in Western Kenya also showed reduction in Striga infestation with the application of mineral nutrients but the results were less consistent than in the greenhouse. Increasing levels of N showed a fair reduction of Striga in the field especially during the first year, whereas P application did not have much effect in contrast to the greenhouse study where both N and P clearly reduced Striga infection. The likely explanation for this discrepancy is that availability of mineral nutrients under field conditions is less predictable than under greenhouse conditions, due to a number of factors such as soil texture and structure, pH, salinity, drought, leaching and runoff. Hence, further studies are needed on the importance of these factors before a fertiliser application strategy can be formulated to improve control of Striga in maize in the field. "

Two conservation tillage methods (ripping and planting basins) combined factorially with seven mulch levels (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 10 t ha−1) were compared with conventional mouldboard ploughing. The experiment was run for four consecutive growing seasons allowing for a rotation of maize, cowpea, sorghum and maize in some fields used in the study. Crop yields were determined across all tillage and mulch combinations in each year. Tillage system had no significant effect on maize yield while maize grain yield increased with increase in mulch cover in seasons that had below average rainfall. Mulching at 2–4 t ha−1 gave optimum yields in seasons with below average rainfall. Tillage system and mulching had no significant effect on cowpea yield when soil moisture was not limiting. However, the ripper and basin systems had 142 and 102% more cowpea grain than the conventional system in 2006/2007 because of differences in planting dates used in three systems and poor rainfall distribution.

Field, greenhouse and growth chamber experiments were carried to study morphological, physiological and genetic factors determining the bases of genotypical differences in Zn efficiency among cereal species and within cultivars of wheat. Among the cereals, rye had particularly high Zn efficiency (high yield under Zn deficiency). There were large genotypical differences among wheat lines. High Zn efficiency was closely associated with enhanced capacity of some lines to take up Zn from soils, but not with increased Zn accumulation per unit dry weight of shoot or grain. Measurement of Zn-containing superoxide dismutase activity in leaves revealed that an efficient utilization of Zn at the tissue or cellular level is an additional major factor involved in Zn efficiency of cereals. Zinc present in grains from Anatolia seems to be not bioavailable.

Most of the data were obtained from five experiments at Balcarce, Argentina, with cv. \{PROINTA\} Oasis. Additional data were obtained from an experiment in Sonora, Mexico. A wide range of incident radiation during spike growth was achieved, both by natural variation among experiments and by applying shading nets. Spike growth period was defined as the interval during which spikes achieved from 5% to 100% of the dry weight they accumulated by day 7 after anthesis excluding grain weight. Radiation level during this period affected yield mainly through variation in number of grains m−2. Differences in grains m−2 were related to differences in dry weight of spikes m−2 measured 7 days after anthesis excluding grain weight. Above 106 g m−2 of spikes, the relationship between grains m−2 and dry weight of spikes m−2 was approximately linear with positive slope and intercept. The slope obtained at Balcarce (58 grains g−1 spike) was not different from those obtained in Sonora (58–62). For low weight of spikes (&lt; 106 g m−2), the slope increased and the intercept decreased. Thus, the relationship was not linear and the number of grains g−1 spike was not constant, reaching its maximum value at 106 g m−2 of spikes. The cause of the variation in number of grains g−1 spike due to radiation does not seem to operate through a change in spike rachis proportion. Nevertheless, variation in radiation level caused greater variation in dry weight of spikes m−2 than in number of grains g−1 spike. For Oasis at Balcarce, the duration of the spike growth period (27 days) was steady between shading levels and experiments. Thus, the smaller dry weight of spikes m−2 induced by low radiation was due mainly to the lower spike growth rate. Crop and spike growth rate were positively related although low radiation increased mean and maximum partition to spikes. Crop growth rates, during the spike growth period, was linearly related to intercepted \{PAR\} (photosynthetically active radiation), and radiation-use efficiency was little affected by radiation level. Shading increased green area ratio (i.e., the ratio of green area index to crop dry weight) but it slightly affected green area index and extinction coefficient. Therefore, the percentage of intercepted \{PAR\} was not affected by radiation level. Intercepted radiation was the main factor determining both crop and spikes growth during spike growth period, and grain number m−2 was linearly related to accumulated intercepted \{PAR\} during this period.

Environment significantly affected all agronomic and quality characteristics. Grain yield values ranged from 1.4 to 5.4 mg ha−1 among experiments, showing the wide productivity range represented by the testing locations. Besides thousand-grain weight, which was higher in the 1BL/1RS isogenic group than in the 1B isogenic one, no differences in any other agronomic trait were observed in association with the presence of the translocation. However, quality characteristics evaluated differed statistically between lines with and without 1BL/1RS translocation. The genotype×environment interaction associated with the presence of the translocation, was significant for grain yield, harvest index, and SDS-sedimentation. The 1BL/1RS isogenic group showed higher grain yield than the 1B one only in Jerez de la Frontera, where drought-stress was severe. The 1BL/1RS translocation was associated with higher grain protein and flour yellowness, and with lower SDS-sedimentation. Although the introduction of the 1BL/1RS translocation could improve the agronomic performance under drought-stress conditions, its negative effect on gluten strength could limit the commercial exploitation of translocated durum wheat genotypes.

Increased leaf longevity, increased water and nutrient uptake, greater assimilate supply during grain filling, and increased grain and ear set have been associated with constitutive stress tolerance mechanisms in maize (Zea mays L.). We examined tropical maize for adaptive changes associated with drought tolerance that are sustained under N stress and therefore may indicate constitutive stress tolerance mechanisms. Original and drought-tolerant selection cycles of four populations were evaluated in five experiments differing in N supply at Poza Rica, Mexico between 1992 and 1994. Selection for tolerance to mid-season drought stress consistently increased grain yield across N levels due to an increase in both the number of ears per plant and kernel weight. The number of ears per plant was associated with a shorter anthesis–silking interval (ASI) of drought-tolerant cycles. Reduction in \{ASI\} due to selection was greater under N stress as compared to well-fertilized conditions, however, it was not associated with either biomass or N accumulation of plants and ears around flowering. The N content of individual kernels did not change with selection and grain N concentration decreased. Greater kernel weights were likely the result of delayed leaf senescence and increased assimilate supply during grain filling. We conclude that decreased ear abortion and increased assimilate supply during grain filling of maize selected for tolerance to mid-season drought also provide tolerance to N stress and therefore may contribute to increased yield and yield stability.

The cultivars of rice and wheat responded to irrigation and to N, with greater response to irrigation in rice, but to N in wheat. Delayed wheat seeding reduced wheat yields in all years. Agronomic N-use efficiency (kg grain yield per kg N applied), physiological efficiency (kg grain yield per kg N absorbed), and fertilizer N-recovery efficiency (kg N absorbed per kg N applied, expressed as %) for rice across treatments ranged from 2.8 to 10.8, 5.2 to 27.5, and 33 to 61, respectively, and all were greater for N application at 90 compared with 135 kg N ha−1. For wheat, those values ranged from 15 to 27, 33 to 51, and 45 to 63, respectively, and were greater at 120 compared with 180 kg N ha−1, and under irrigation than rainfed. All those parameters had greater values under irrigation than rainfed. Total soil N increased slightly after 3 years of cropping, while organic carbon and pH decreased slightly in all treatments. There was a net increase of soil ammonium N (80 kg ha−1) and a zero balance of N after the first year of cropping under irrigation with high N (135 and 180 kg ha−1 for rice and wheat, respectively), but without N there was a decrease of soil mineral N (70 kg ha−1) with a balance of +16 kg ha−1. Biological N fixation accounted for N balance in N-omitted as well as N-applied treatments. The results emphasize the need for regular monitoring of weather, crop performance, irrigation water, and soil and plant mineral N for further understanding the growth, productivity, N-use efficiencies, and balance in rice–wheat systems.

Coleoptile length was measured at three different temperatures and plant height, kernel weight and grain yield determined in six different environments. Durum wheat, regardless of stature, produced longer coleoptiles than bread wheat at higher temperature. Within the non-Rht isolines, plant height and coleoptile length were independent characters. The tall durum wheats tended to be taller than their bread wheat counterparts, indicating an absence of minor genes for reduced height. However, a number of bread wheat cultivars showed relatively small height increases following removal of the Rht gene and substantially greater increases in coleoptile length. Coleoptile length was more highly correlated (r2=0.53, P&lt;0.01) with seed weight among the non-Rht isolines compared to cultivars containing either Rht1 or Rht2. Grain yield and plant height were positively correlated among the semi-dwarf Rht isolines in 5 of 6 environments. No equivalent relationship existed among the non-Rht materials. Grain yield (standard sowing depth 3 cm) and coleoptile length were generally not significantly correlated within each isogenic grouping. Plant breeders should be able to select short statured, non-Rht1 or non-Rht2 hexaploid bread wheat with better emergence characteristics. The non-Rht genotypes developed from the bread wheat cultivars Seri 82 and Culiacan 89 were identified as meeting these criteria.

In this study, we used Landsat data from the Yaqui Valley, a prominent spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growing region in Northwest Mexico, to investigate the effect of planting date and fallow period weeds on wheat yields. Three crops cycles were analyzed for the planting date study, while 2 years were investigated for the weed study. The satellite estimates of planting date agreed well with farmer reported dates in 100 fields (r2 = 0.85, rmse = 6.5 days), although they tended to underestimate dates for early plantings (5–20 November). Comparison of planting dates with remotely sensed yields indicated that yield reductions associated with planting outside the recommended planting date (RPD) were generally small, but can be significant in years when a large number of fields are planted outside the RPD. The weed assessment study showed that wheat yields decreased substantially (&gt;1 t ha−1) when there were weeds in fields during the summer prior to planting. The total regional production loss associated with weeds during the fallow period was estimated as 5%, which implies that substantial agronomic and economic gains can be attained by maintaining fields weed free during the summer. We conclude that remote sensing provides important information for agricultural research and should be considered a valuable tool to complement field-based approaches. "

Farmers grew in their fields large populations that were bulks derived from the \{F2\} generations of single crosses. They selected within them starting in a generation where selfing was sufficiently advanced for the between-plant heritability to be high. Poorer bulks were soon rejected by farmers. A high proportion selected within the bulks and a significant proportion did so over several generations. An increasing number of farmers grew the best of the selected bulks because they spread from farmer to farmer without the need of intervention from scientists. Varieties selected from these bulks were preferred by farmers in on-farm trials and had a superior combination of yield and maturity compared with the later breeders’ selection from the same bulk. Levels of participation were higher with the better performing bulks and even when training was not provided, provided the germplasm performed acceptably well sufficient farmers selected in the bulks to make collaborative breeding cost effective. Collaborative breeding can be successful but demands different types of resources than those for on-station breeding so its cost effectiveness will vary with circumstances. It can be used to increase the probability of selecting segregants that perform well across environments by using methods that pool bulks selected by different farmers and it is also extremely useful for decentralising breeding programmes.

The surface seeding of wheat, which is becoming popular as a resource conserving technology on resource-poor farms, might provide a more conducive environment for early foliar blight development. During 2002 and 2003 wheat growing seasons, replicated studies were conducted in farmers’ fields in Nepal to determine the effects of surface seeding in comparison with conventional seeding on foliar blight development and agronomic performance, using the wheat varieties Rohini, \{BL\} 1473, Bhrikuti, and a farmer variety. The experiment was conducted in a strip-plot layout with strips of wheat varieties and fungicide treatments (sprayed or unprotected) in a randomized block with three replicates. The area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was estimated using multiple foliar blight assessments on flag leaf (AUDPC-FL) and on whole plants (AUDPC-WP). Grain yield, thousand-kernel weight (TKW) and kernels per spike (KPS) were also evaluated. Conventional tillage and surface seeding differed significantly for AUDPC, grain yield, \{TKW\} and KPS. In the fungicide-unprotected plots, the AUDPC-FL and AUDPC-WP values were, respectively, 8 and 34% higher under surface seeding than conventional tillage. On average, surface seeding produced 25% higher grain yield, 1.3 g higher TKW, and 1.8 more \{KPS\} than conventional tillage. The four wheat varieties differed significantly for all traits under both conventional tillage and surface seeding. The average foliar blight induced reductions in grain yield, TKW, and \{KPS\} were 16, 12, and 15%, respectively, under conventional tillage. The corresponding reductions were 23, 13, and 19% under surface seeding. Rohini produced the highest grain yields under both conventional tillage (2.67 t ha−1) and surface seeding (3.58 t ha−1). Under both seeding systems, Rohini showed the highest and \{BL\} 1473 the lowest grain yield reductions due to disease. Despite a higher spot blotch severity, the higher grain yield under surface seeding is suggestive of its adoption on wetlands under rice–wheat cropping systems. The four varieties responded differently to the tillage methods’ effect on spot blotch severity and grain yield, suggesting the importance of tillage method in cultivar selection when considering the effect of microenvironment on susceptibility to foliar diseases. The findings have implications for foliar blight management using surface seeding as a resource conservation technology in the warm regions of South Asia. "

Tillers m−2 correlated (r=0.89, P&lt;0.01) significantly positively while stem diameter and wall thickness correlated significantly negatively with lodging score. Diameter of different internodes including the peduncle, weight per stem and spike also correlated significantly negatively with tillers m−2. Simple linear regression explained that 79% of the variation in lodging score could be due to tillers m−2 and 49–65% due to diameter of different internodes. The best sub-set of the regression showed that number of tillers m−2 and/or stem diameter of internodes were the key variables when deciding two or three important characters for selecting for varieties with lodging resistance. Three variables such as stem diameter of first, second internode and length of first internode or tillers m−2, height and length of stem or tillers m−2, stem diameter of first, second internode together explained about 89–91% of the variation in lodging score. Therefore, it was suggested that selection for lodging resistant cultivars should emphasize larger stem diameter and wall thickness of basal internodes and fewer tillers per unit area with heavy spikes.

Long-term effects on root rot and nematode populations – and their possible detrimental effects on yield – were monitored from 1998 to 2003 to evaluate the sustainability of the cropping system. In general, wheat showed less root rot incidence than maize. Crop residue retention reduced the numbers of the nematode Pratylenchus thornei in both crops, as did zero tillage compared with conventional tillage. Conventional tillage with continuous maize and residue removal, the common farmer practice in this region, reduced yield and dramatically increased P. thornei. Zero tillage with residue removal resulted in low values for yield, root rot, and nematode populations, especially under maize monoculture. Under zero tillage and residue retention, root rot incidence in maize was moderate, parasitic nematode numbers were low, and yield was highest compared to alternative practices. In wheat, the highest yields were observed under zero tillage and residue retention, with intermediate root rot incidence. Zero tillage with rotation and residue retention enhanced water availability, soil structure, and nutrient availability more than conventional tillage.

The aim was to identify practices that would promote high, sustainable maize and wheat yields in the target environment. A better understanding of soil ecology could lead to more precise management of soil organisms for beneficial purposes in agriculture. The effect of alternative agriculture technologies on total bacteria, fluorescent Pseudomonas, Actinomycetes, total fungi, and Fusarium spp. were investigated. Residue retention induced higher population counts of total bacteria, fluorescent Pseudomonas, and Actinomycetes compared to residue removal under zero tillage and conventional tillage. The principal component analysis clustered the wheat treatments into three groups. Zero and conventional tillage with residue retention showed increased populations of total bacteria, fluorescent Pseudomonas, and Actinomycetes. Zero tillage without residue retention resulted in very low populations of micro-flora, while conventional tillage with residue removal resulted in the predominance of total fungi. For maize, the \{PCA\} biplot featured the same three clusters of treatments as for wheat. However, in contrast to wheat, maize under conventional tillage with residue removal induced reduced populations. These results, combined with earlier findings on soil quality, root rot, nematode populations, and yield, indicate that zero tillage with residue removal is clearly an unsustainable practice; zero tillage should therefore be combined with an adequate level of residue retention. Zero tillage with residue retention is a viable sustainable practice for smallholder farmers in the volcanic highlands of Mexico and comparable regions of the world. "

Based on this soil quality evaluation, sustainable management practices could be selected for transferring technologies to farmers in the region. A long-term experiment was conducted with 16 different crop management practices varying in: (1) rotation (continuous maize or wheat and both phases of the rotation of maize and wheat), (2) tillage (conventional and zero) and (3) crop residue management (full retention or removal for fodder). Superior soil quality was considered to represent the maintenance of high productivity without significant soil or environmental degradation. The pertinent, minimum soil quality data set included the following physical indicators: time-to-pond, aggregate stability, permanent wilting point, and topsoil penetration resistance. Chemical indicators were: soil C, N, K and Zn concentrations, measured in the 0–5 cm topsoil and C, N concentration in 5–20 cm. Multivariate analysis grouped the treatments into clusters: (1) zero tillage with retention of residue, (2) zero tillage with residue removal and (3) conventional tillage. Zero tillage combined with crop residue retention improved chemical and physical conditions of the soil. In contrast, zero tillage with removal of residues, led to high accumulation of Mn in the topsoil, low aggregate stability, high penetration resistance, surface slaking resulting in low time-to-pond values and high runoff. Finally, soil quality under conventional tillage was intermediate (irrespective of residue management), especially reflected in the physical status of the soil. The results provide a strong justification to promote zero tillage technology combined with appropriate residue management to farmers in the volcanic highlands of Central Mexico and other similar regions. The minimum data set and associated tools for careful monitoring and observation, will be essential for evaluating soil quality in farmer's fields. "

Soil erosion in Nepal mid-hills is the most critical during pre-monsoon season. Many reviews argue that reduced tillage could be an option to tackle this problem. However, very few field experiments to evaluate reduced tillage systems have to date been conducted in this region. Thus, a field experiment was initiated in factorial randomized complete block design on acidic sandy loam soil (Lithic Dystochrept) during the summer season of 2001 at Kathmandu University (1500 masl) to assess the effects of tillage and cropping patterns on soil and nutrient losses, crop yield and soil fertility. Two main treatments viz. conventional and reduced till, and two sub-treatments viz. sole maize (Zea mays) and maize + soybean (Glycine max) were considered. Soil organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (N), plant available phosphorus (P) and exchangeable potassium (K) were determined for the original soil and eroded sediment using standard methods. Two years of data indicated annual soil and nutrient losses to be significantly lowered by reduced till as compared to conventional till. Total annual soil loss from conventional and reduced till was 16.6 and 11.1 Mg/ha, respectively. Similarly, annual nutrient losses associated with the eroded sediment were 188 kg OC/ha, 18.8 kg N/ha, &lt;1 kg P/ha and 3.8 kg K/ha for conventional till and 126 kg OC/ha, 11.8 kg N/ha, &lt;1 kg P/ha and 2.4 kg K/ha for reduced till. Soil \{OC\} and N losses were significantly higher in conventional till and this may be one of the major causes of fertility depletion in the Nepalese hills. Soil chemical properties did not differ due to tillage and cropping systems; however, over years pH, N and P were increased irrespective of treatments. Although treatments were at par for maize grain yield, conventional till + soybean produced highest grain yield (4.0 Mg/ha) followed by reduced till + soybean (3.9 Mg/ha) and conventional till sole maize (3.8 Mg/ha). Mixed cropping of legumes and maize do not help conserve soil and nutrient loss in hills of central Nepal. Thus, reduced till could be a viable option for minimizing soil and nutrient losses without sacrificing economic yields in central hills of Nepal. "

The model presented in the paper provides a framework for analysing various afforestation and technology policies to increase the sustainable use of forest tree resources. The optimal conditions for choosing the levels of land clearing for various uses of refugee population are derived. The model parameters are used to identify the optimal timing and rate of afforestation that will attain a dynamic equilibrium of forest tree resources. Several policy implications are derived from the model results for reducing the environmental degradation of forest resources due to the presence of refugees. It is argued that the general environmental regulation policies based on user-pay principles may not be appropriate under the refugee situation and that additional intervention is needed by the host government and international relief agencies for reversing the trends in deforestation.

Here, we use data from a unique panel survey of cotton farmers conducted in India between 2002 and 2008. Accounting for possible selection bias, we show that the Bt pesticide reducing effect has been sustainable. In spite of an increase in pesticide sprays against secondary pests, total pesticide use has decreased significantly over time. Bt has also reduced pesticide applications by non-Bt farmers. These results mitigate the concern that Bt technology would soon become obsolete in small farmer environments.

As a result of the increasing demand and low availability of alternative resources, \{CR\} became an essential resource for household activities, especially for livestock keeping; a major livelihood element of smallholder farmers in the developing world. Farmers’ decisions on \{CR\} use are determined by farmers’ preferences, total crop production, availability of alternative resources and demand for CR. Interaction of these determinants can result in pressures and trade-offs of \{CR\} use. Determinants, pressures and trade-offs are shaped by the specific socio-economic and agro-ecological context of these mixed farms. The objective of this paper is to provide a comparative analysis of the determinants of \{CR\} use and to examine some options to cope with pressures and trade-offs in 12 study sites across Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Drawing on socio-economic data at household and village level, we describe how cereal intensification and livestock feed demand influence use, pressures and trade-offs of \{CR\} use across study sites, specifically cereal residue. Our results show that in low cereal production and livestock feed demand sites, despite a low demand for \{CR\} and availability of alternative biomass, pressures and trade-offs of \{CR\} use are common particularly in the dry season. In sites with moderate cereal production, and low–moderate and moderate livestock feed demand, alternative biomass resources are scarce and most residues are fed to livestock or used to cover household needs. Subsequently, pressures and potential trade-offs are stronger. In sites with low cereal production and high livestock feed demand, pressures and trade-offs depend on the availability of better feed resources. Finally, sites with high cereal production and high livestock feed demand have been able to fulfil most of the demand for CR, limiting pressures and trade-offs. These patterns show that agricultural intensification, better management of communal resources and off-farm activities are plausible development pathways to overcome pressures and trade-offs of \{CR\} use. Although technologies can largely improve these trends, research and development should revisit past initiatives so as to develop innovative approaches to tackle the well-known problem of low agricultural production in many smallholder mixed systems, creating more sustainable futures.

We reflect on their main findings and methodological progress, and on the new and not-so-new implications of these findings for research and action in the development agenda. We propose stylised graphical models to portray tradeoffs and plausible trajectories towards synergies, in the hope that such generalisations would prevent further efforts to ‘reinvent the wheel’ in the realm of tradeoffs analysis.

Profit-oriented firms are unlikely to assume functions that cannot easily be exploited for commercial gain, so government agencies will continue to play an important role in supporting basic research, conducting applied research targeted at marginal environments, collecting and disseminating market information, and establishing and enforcing industry standards.

Often this results in acute shortages of fodder during the post-monsoon period that can perhaps be partly overcome if the limited saline ground-water resources are effectively utilized to supplement water supplies. Thus, a field experiment was conducted during 1993–1997 on a calcareous soil in a semi-arid part of north-west India (average rainfall 350 mm/annum) to evaluate the suitability of forage grasses to saline irrigation (ECiw 8.5–10.0 dS/m) and optimize its schedule. Grass species included in this experiment were Brachiaria mutica Stapf. Cenchrus setigerus Vahl. Chloris gayana Kunth, Cymbopogon flexuosus, Cynodon dactylon Pers. Echinochloa colonum Link. Panicum antidotale Retz., P. coloratum Linn., P. laevifolium Hack., P. maximum Jacq. (Local wild), P. maximum Jacq. (Cultivated) and P. virgatum. Species those were identified to be the most promising included Panicum laevifolium and P. maximum (both local wild and cultivated) with an annual forage production of 3.43–4.23 Mg/ha. The overall reduction in forage yield with saline irrigation equalled 29 per cent when compared with canal water (ECiw 0.4 dS/m). Scheduling saline irrigation based on climatological approach, i.e. when the ratio of depth of irrigation water (Diw) and cumulative open pan evaporation (CPE) equalled 0.4, was observed to be optimal whereas increased salt accumulation nullified the benefits of enhanced water supplies (Diw/CPE=0.8). Two of the definite advantages of irrigated forages were about three–four-fold increase in productivity as compared with natural/seeded pastures and extension of production period to those of conventional shortages, i.e. during summer months (April–June) when the most nomad populations are forced to migrate to traditionally irrigated areas. Thus, it was concluded that saline water use strategies for rehabilitating arid lands with above grass species would not only render these degraded lands be more productive but also ensure conservation and improvement for long-range ecological security of these lands.

These herbivore-induced \{VOCs\} are not only known to attract natural enemies of the herbivores, but they may also prime inducible defences in neighbouring plants, resulting in stronger and faster defence responses in these VOC-exposed plants. Among the compounds that cause this priming effect, green leaf volatiles (GLVs) have received particular attention, as they are ubiquitous and rapidly emitted upon damage. In this study, we investigated their effects under realistic conditions by applying specially devised dispensers to release four synthetic \{GLVs\} at physiologically relevant concentrations in a series of experiments in maize fields. We compared the \{VOC\} emission of GLV-exposed maize plants to non-exposed plants and monitored the attraction of herbivores and predators, as well as parasitism of the caterpillar Spodoptera frugiperda, the most common herbivore in the experimental maize fields. We found that maize plants that were exposed to \{GLVs\} emitted increased quantities of sesquiterpenes compared to non-exposed plants. In several replicates, herbivorous insects, such as adult Diabrotica beetles and S. frugiperda larvae, were observed more frequently in GLV-treated plots and caused more damage to GLV-exposed plants than to non-exposed plants. Parasitism of S. frugiperda was only weakly affected by \{GLVs\} and overall parasitism rates of S. frugiperda were similar in GLV-exposed and non-exposed plots. The effects on insect presence depended on the distance from the GLV-dispensers at which the plants were located. The results are discussed in the context of strategies to improve biological control by enhancing plant-mediated attraction of natural enemies. "

abstract = "Farmer organization and collective action are often seen as key factors in enhancing farmers’ access to markets. Often, too little attention is directed at (a) the most appropriate types of organization; (b) whether organization makes less or more sense in the case of producers of an undifferentiated commodity or a higher value product; (c) whether the public or private sector is best placed to support farmer organizations; and (d) the conditions necessary for ensuring their economic viability. Research in Mexico and Central America explored these issues for commodity maize and high value vegetables, respectively. The benefits of farmer organization are more evident in the vegetable sector, characterized by high transaction costs associated with market access. However, horticultural farmer organizations in Honduras and El Salvador include less than 5% of total horticultural producers. This is possibly due to farmer organizations’ limited business skills and non-replicable organizational models. There is less incentive for maize farmers to organize to access output markets as the transaction costs are relatively low. The benefits of maize farmer organization are clearer when it comes to accessing inputs such as credit, seed and fertilizer. Farmer organization is a critical factor in making markets work for the poor, but the role and timing of public and private investment in these organizations is poorly understood. "

The household’s ability to cope with such risks and hence benefit from input technological change is often positively related to its wealth or stock of productive assets. Empirical evidence, however, suggests a non-linear relationship between wealth and adoption of new agricultural technologies so that within a rural community, households on the lower wealth continuum behave differently from those on the higher level. Using farm level data collected from 300 randomly selected households in three districts of Zambia in 2004/2005 crop season, this paper first stratifies households into poorly- and well-endowed households based on their access to productive assets and estimates separate double-hurdle models for the adoption of improved, high yielding maize (IHYM) varieties for each group. The results show that factors influencing the adoption and use intensity of \{IHYM\} varieties differ between the two groups. This draws attention to the need for recommending wealth group-specific interventions to increase the adoption and use intensity of such varieties and their subsequent impacts on food security and general livelihoods of the households. The explicit testing for the possibility that differences in household wealth affect the way in which other variables influence adoption decisions is the paper’s unique contribution to the adoption literature.

Such compounds may also change the emission of herbivore-induced plant volatiles, which serve as important cues for parasitic wasps to locate their hosts. Therefore, the use of elicitors in the field may affect biological control of insect pests. To test this, we treated maize seedlings growing in a subtropical field in Mexico with methyl jasmonate (MeJA), an elicitor of defense responses against many insects, and benzo-(1,2,3)-thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH), an elicitor of resistance against certain pathogens. Volatile emission, herbivore infestation, pathogen infection, and plant performance (growth and grain yield) of treated and untreated maize plants were measured. Application of \{BTH\} slightly reduced volatile emission in maize, while MeJA increased the emission compared to control treatments. Despite the apparent changes in volatile emissions, the elicitor application did not consistently affect infestation by Spodoptera frugiperda larvae, the main insect pest found on the maize seedlings, and had only marginal effects on parasitism rates. Similarly, there were no treatment effects on infestation by other herbivores and pathogens. Results for the six replications that stretched over one summer and one winter season were highly variable, with parasitism rates and the species composition of the parasitoids differing significantly between seasons. This variability, as well as the severe biotic and abiotic stresses on young seedlings might explain why we measured only slight effects of elicitor application on pest incidence and biological control in this specific field study. Indeed, an additional field experiment under milder and more standardized conditions revealed that \{BTH\} induced significant resistance against Bipolaris maydis, a major pathogen in the experimental maize fields. Similar affects can be expected for herbivory and parasitism rates. "

The apparent Km (Michaelis constant) for oxidised glutathione (GSSG) was measured between 10 and 45°C at constant pH. The enzyme from highland cultivars adapted to cool environments had a slightly lower apparent Km for \{GSSG\} than that from lowland tropical cultivars at low assay temperatures. Similarly the enzyme from lowland tropical cultivars had a lower apparent Km for \{GSSG\} at high assay temperatures. However these effects were small and regression lines plotted through the data were not significantly different in slope or intercept. There was a strong correlation (r = 0·939) between apparent Km and Vmax (maximum initial velocity) as assay temperature was varied. The interpretation of apparent Km/temperature relationships is discussed with hypothetical examples of the effects of temperature on enzyme activity/substrate concentration plots. It is demonstrated that an increase in apparent Km at higher assay temperatures need not necessarily reflect any temperature-dependent impairment of enzyme function. The apparent Km for \{GSSG\} of glutathione reductase from maize increased over four-fold when the temperature was raised from 10 to 45°C, but it is concluded that in vivo rates of reaction are likely to be increased rather than decreased by this same change in temperature. Glutathione reductase would thus appear to be equally well adapted to function at all these temperatures. This suggests that the potential of enzyme thermal kinetics to predict thermotolerance may be limited. "

The objectives of this review are to summarize literature concerning \{CA\} principles and their interactive effects on weed life cycles and community composition, briefly review CA-appropriate cultural practices for additional weed control, and identify areas where further research is needed. No-till systems accumulate seeds near the soil surface where they are more likely to germinate but are also exposed to greater mortality risks through weather variability and predation. Assuming no seed input into the system, germinable seedbanks under no-till decrease more rapidly than under conventional tillage. Reducing tillage may shift weed communities from annual dicots to grassy annuals and perennials. Surface residues lower average soil temperatures and may delay emergence of both crops and weeds. Germination and growth of small-seeded annuals will suffer from restricted light availability, physical growth barriers and potential allelopathic effects from surface residue. Crop rotation affects weeds via allelopathy and altered timing of both crop management and resource demands. Rotations should incorporate crops sown in varied seasons (e.g., autumn and spring), annuals and perennials, different herbicides, and/or various crop families. Literature indicates implementing no-till without crop rotation can result in severe weed problems; greater rotational crop diversity results in easier weed management. Additional cultural practices for \{CA\} include: (i) selecting highly competitive varieties; (ii) altering planting dates; (iii) preventing weed seed recruitment; (iv) adjusting planting arrangement, densities, and fertilizer placement; and (v) microbial bio-controls. Further research is needed concerning: (i) the interactive effects of tillage and surface residue on weeds; (ii) the use of models and/or meta-analyses to predict weed responses, and to identify intervention points in CA; and (iii) the weed-suppressive potential of longer (4+ years) rotations.

More specifically, the study analyzes the weather extreme which affected maize production in the \{USA\} in 2012; it also estimates the effect of a similar weather extreme in 2050, using future climate scenarios. The secondary impact of the weather extreme on food security in the developing world is also assessed using trend analysis. Many studies have reported on the significant reduction in maize production in the \{USA\} due to the extreme weather event (combined heat wave and drought) that occurred in 2012. However, most of these studies focused on yield and did not assess the potential effect of weather extremes on food prices and security. The overall goal of this study was to use geo-spatial crop modeling and trend analysis to quantify the impact of weather extremes on both yield and, followed food security in the developing world. We used historical weather data for severe extreme events that have occurred in the USA. The data were obtained from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In addition we used five climate scenarios: the baseline climate which is typical of the late 20th century (2000s) and four future climate scenarios which involve a combination of two emission scenarios (A1B and B1) and two global circulation models (CSIRO-Mk3.0 and \{MIROC\} 3.2). \{DSSAT\} 4.5 was combined with \{GRASS\} \{GIS\} for geo-spatial crop modeling. Simulated maize grain yield across all affected regions in the \{USA\} indicates that average grain yield across the \{USA\} Corn Belt would decrease by 29% when the weather extremes occur using the baseline climate. If the weather extreme were to occur under the \{A1B\} emission scenario in the 2050s respectively, average grain yields would decrease by 38% and 57%, under the CSIRO-Mk3.0 and \{MIROC\} 3.2 global climate models, respectively. The weather extremes that occurred in the \{USA\} in 2012 resulted in a sharp increase in the world maize price. In addition, it likely played a role in the reduction in world maize consumption and trade in 2012/13, compared to 2011/12. The most vulnerable countries to the weather extremes are poor countries with high maize import dependency ratios including those countries in the Caribbean, northern Africa and western Asia. Other vulnerable countries include low-income countries with low import dependency ratios but which cannot afford highly-priced maize. The study also highlighted the pathways through which a weather extreme would affect food security, were it to occur in 2050 under climate change. Some of the policies which could help vulnerable countries counter the negative effects of weather extremes consist of social protection and safety net programs. Medium- to long-term adaptation strategies include increasing world food reserves to a level where they can be used to cover the production losses brought by weather extremes. "

Conservation agriculture is an alternative sustainable agriculture management system, which contributes to conserving soil, water and fertility, while changing vertical distribution of soil organic matter (SOM). No-tillage with straw cover (NTSC) and traditional tillage with straw removal (TTSR) in four regions of northern China (Tailai, Wuchuan, Nailin, Yaodu) were investigated to determine how tillage and soil type affected \{SOM\} stratification. \{SOM\} content, total N (TN), soil water content (SWC) and soil bulk density (ρd) in the 0–5, 5–15, 15–30 and 30–40 cm layers and the time since implementation of tillage treatments were evaluated. The top layer (0–5 cm) and total \{SOM\} content were markedly improved by NTSC. The influence dramatically decreased with depth in all sites. \{SOM\} content increased during the first 10 years following \{NTSC\} implementation, but the rate of increase was reduced in subsequent years. There was high positive correlation between \{SOM\} and SWC, high positive correlation between \{SOM\} and TN, and high negative correlation between \{SOM\} and bulk density. Effects of conservation measures on \{SOM\} content were expressed by a stratification ratio. The stratification ratio of SOM, in most sites, under long-term \{NTSC\} were &gt;2. These results from northern China, suggest that long-term no-tillage with straw cover significantly improved topsoil conditions and whole of soil profile \{SOM\} and this improvement was obvious in different layers.

Conservation agriculture (CA), defined as minimal soil disturbance, year-round ground cover, and crop rotations, is being promoted as a way to sustainably improve water-use efficiency, reduce soil erosion, and boost crop production. In this study, three cropping systems – continuous no-till maize, \{CA\} rotation, and conventional tillage rotation – were established on smallholder farms in the Nkhotakota and Dowa districts, two distinct agroecological zones in Malawi. Three-year crop rotations of cassava, cowpea, and maize and cassava, soybean, and maize were implemented in \{CA\} and conventional tillage, respectively, in Nkhotakota. In Dowa, a 3-year rotation of sweet potato, bean, and maize was implemented in both \{CA\} and conventional tillage. Cropping systems were analyzed for their impact on infiltration, soil moisture content, sediment runoff, earthworm and termite abundance, and crop production from 2011 to 2014. In Nkhotakota, which had high potential evapotranspiration and low soil water-holding capacity, residue retention was positively correlated with infiltration and no-till and \{CA\} increased soil water content (0–60 cm) compared to conventional tillage by an average of 20 mm. In Dowa, which had lower potential evapotranspiration, eliminating tillage and retaining residue did not improve infiltration or soil water content. In 2013/2014, no-till and \{CA\} reduced sediment runoff by 1537 kg ha−1 and 1309 kg ha−1 in Nkhotakota and 346 kg ha−1 and 209 kg ha−1 in Dowa, respectively, compared to conventional tillage. Tillage and residue management did not have a significant impact on sweet potato, cassava, bean, soybean, or cowpea production. Crop rotations had the greatest impact on maize yields in 2013/14, with \{CA\} and conventional tillage rotations increasing maize yields compared to no-till maize by 2525 kg ha−1 and 2145 kg ha−1 in Dowa and 1364 kg ha−1 and 469 kg ha−1 in Nkhotakota, respectively. However, cumulative protein production was greater in no-till than \{CA\} and conventional tillage rotations in Dowa and greater than conventional rotations in Nkhotakota. Rotation crop productivity needs to be improved with better yielding grain legumes and other higher protein crops before widespread adoption of diverse rotations can occur on smallholder farms in eastern and southern Africa.

The study showed that Zimbabwe has gone a long way towards developing a water management policy addressing both equity and access, through the Water and \{ZINWA1ZINWA\} stands for Zimbabwe National Water Authority. 1 of 1998. However, lack of incentives for improving efficient management and utilization of water resources once water has reached the farm gate was apparent, apart from punitive economic instruments levied on usage of increased volumes of water. For example, the new water reforms of 1998 penalized water savers through loss of any unused water in their permits to other users. In addition, the ability of smallholder farmers to access water for irrigation or other purposes was influenced by macro and micro-economic policies such as Economic Structural and Adjustment Programme (ESAP), Zimbabwe Programme for Economic and Social Transformation (ZIMPREST), prevailing monetary and fiscal policies, as well as the Land and Agrarian Reform policies. For instance, the implementation of \{ESAP\} from 1991 to 95 resulted in a decline in government support to management of communal irrigation schemes, and as a result only gravity-fed schemes survived. Also \{AWM\} projects/programmes that were in progress were prematurely terminated. While considerable emphasis was placed on rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure since the fast track land reform in 1998, the policies remained rather silent on strategies for water management in rainfed systems. The piecemeal nature and fragmentation of policies and institutional frameworks scattered across government ministries and sectors were complex and created difficulties for smallholder farmers to access water resources. Poor policy implementation strategies and lack of funding were some of the major weaknesses in Zimbabwe’s \{AWM\} policies. It was apparent that the prevailing institutional frameworks that underwent restructuring exercises since 2000, failed to effectively deliver services to smallholder farmers due to lack of human and financial capital. Nevertheless, the study showed that policies that can improve efficient utilization of agricultural water in rainfed systems need to target timely provision of the prime movers, i.e. credit, input markets and viable output markets, among other factors, so as to fully utilize good rainfall seasons. It was recommended that a forum led by \{ZINWA\} be set up to harmonize \{AWM\} issues across sectors and monitor their implementation. Such a forum would be mandated mainly to run periodic water management workshops in which relevant and interested stakeholders participate. "

This study investigated the effectiveness of tillage and mulch management in \{CA\} as well as termite control strategies including local natural indigenous techniques on termite activity, crop lodging and maize (Zea mays L.) yields. The study was carried out at a research site in Chimoio, Central Mozambique over two seasons, 2011/12 and 2012/13. The application of crop residues in \{CA\} significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) termite activity measured through surface area covered by termite galleries (termite activity) from 6.4 to 11.5% and termite numbers per litter bag from 78 to 138 in fields without and with residues, respectively. Residue application also reduced maize crop lodging due to termite attack as the termites preferentially fed on the maize residues. However, tillage effects alone on termite activity were not apparent. Maize yield increased significantly on switching from conventional tillage to minimum soil disturbance (no till) but not with residue application. With respect to the termite control methods tested, only the commercial insecticide fipronil (phenylpyrazole) proved to be effective in reducing termite consumption of residues and also significantly reduced lodging of maize plants at harvest. At least 1.5 t ha−1 of the residues remained in the system where fipronil was applied in comparison to 0.41–0.48 t ha−1 in the other treatments by November 2013. Maize grain yields were negatively correlated (p &lt; 0.05) to crop lodging due to termite damage while crop lodging in turn declined significantly with application of surface residues. Termite activity was however not significantly correlated to crop lodging, suggesting that termite activity could increase without necessarily increasing crop lodging. Thus in cases where termite damage increases to pest proportions, commercial control insecticides such as fipronil, offer a possible solution to control termites but its economic and long term environmental effects need to be evaluated.

Genetic variation was significant for all the lodging-related traits in the cross-year analysis, however, significant G × E interaction due to rank changes or changes in the absolute differences between cultivars were identified. The inconsistences on cultivar performances across seasons particularly reduced the heritability of key characters related to root lodging resistance (anchorage strength). Target characters related to stem lodging resistance (stem strength) showed good heritability values equal or above 0.70. Positive correlations between stem strength and stem diameter and between root plate spread and root strength were found. Selecting for greater stem diameter and wall width, greater root plate spread and shorter plant height could enable breeders to increase lodging resistance by increasing stem strength, root strength and decreasing plant leverage, respectively. Achieving a lodging-proof crop will depend on finding a wider root plate spread and implementing new management strategies. Genetic linkages between lodging traits will not constrain the combination of the key lodging-trait dimensions to achieve a lodging-proof ideotype. However, strong association between stem strength and stem wall width will increase the total biomass cost needed for lodging resistance. "

Significant effects of environment on protein content and grain micronutrients concentration were observed. The protein and Zn concentrations increased in the water and heat stressed environments, whereas Zn and Fe yield per unit area was higher in non-stress conditions. The results suggest that genetic gains in the yield potential of \{CIMMYT\} derived wheat varieties have tended to reduce grain Zn, in some instances; however, environmental variability might influence the extent to which this effect manifests itself.

In the present study, marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC) was successfully used to improve \{GPC\} in wheat cultivar HUW468. The genotype Glu269 was used as the donor parent for introgression of the gene Gpc-B1 that confers high GPC. In a segregating population, \{SSR\} marker Xucw108, with its locus linked to Gpc-B1 was used for foreground selection to select plants carrying Gpc-B1. Background selection, involving 86 polymorphic \{SSR\} markers dispersed throughout the genome, was exercised to recover the genome of HUW468. For eliminating linkage drag, markers spanning a 10 cM region around the gene Gpc-B1 were employed to select lines with a donor segment of the minimum size carrying the gene of interest. Improved lines had significantly higher \{GPC\} and displayed 88.4–92.3 per cent of the recurrent parent genome (RPG). For grain yield, selected lines were at par with the recurrent parent HUW468, suggesting that there was no yield penalty. The whole exercise of transfer of Gpc-B1 and reconstitution of the genome of \{HUW468\} was completed within a period of two and half years (five crop cycles) demonstrating practical utility of \{MABC\} for developing high \{GPC\} lines in the background of any elite and popular wheat cultivar with relatively higher speed and precision.

The experimental results demonstrated that such a visual test had an indicator range rather than a cut-off value. Thus, tests for \{DON\} determination with two different indicator ranges of 250–500 and 1000–2000 μg kg−1 were designed. The method allowed detection of \{DON\} at low and high concentration levels, which could be useful for research and practical purposes. The assay applied to spiked wheat and pig feed samples demonstrated accurate and reproducible results. The applicability of the developed lateral-flow test was also confirmed under real field conditions. The test strips prepared in Belgium were sent to Mexico, where they were used for the screening of \{DON\} contamination in different bread wheat entries from Fusarium Head Blight inoculated plots. The results were compared with those obtained by \{ELISA\} and LC–MS/MS. A poor correlation between \{ELISA\} and LC–MS/MS was observed. Visual results of the dipstick tests were in a good agreement with the results of the LC–MS/MS method. Coupled with a simple and fast sample preparation, this qualitative one-step test based on the visual evaluation of results did not require any equipment. Results could be obtained within 10 min. The described assay format can be used as a simple, rapid, cost-effective and robust on-site screening tool for mycotoxin contamination in different agricultural commodities. "

Wheat seed cv. \{RR\} 21 was treated with fungicides, carbendazim (Areestin), triadimenol (Baytan), tebuconazole (Raxil), and carboxin + thiram (Vitavax 200B). Single foliar application of propiconazole (Tilt) was sprayed at flowering stage. Controls were included for both factors and treatments were replicated four times. Triadimenol and carboxin + thiram increased seed germination in both years. Triadimenol, tebuconazole, and carboxin + thiram reduced the number of infected seedlings and seedling root rot severity in both years. Number of tillers was higher in carboxin + thiram treated plots compared to other seed treatments. Compared to the control, carboxin + thiram increased grain yield by 9% and 8% in 2004 and 2005, respectively, and triadimenol by 6% in both years. The foliar spray of propiconazole significantly reduced Helminthosporium leaf blight severity and increased thousand-kernel weights. Propiconazole spray increased grain yield by 15% and 14% in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Therefore, seed treatment either with triadimenol or carboxin + thiram in combination with single post-flowering foliar spray of fungicides should minimize grain yield loss due to wheat foliar blight in South Asia.

To determine the effect of \{CA\} on generalist arthropod predators and pests, we assessed the ground-dwelling arthropod assemblage prior to crop planting and shortly after crop emergence in a long-term \{CA\} trial at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in central Mexico. We used pitfall traps and in-field sentinel insect assay arenas to evaluate arthropod activity-density and predation, respectively, in a maize–wheat rotation, planted under \{CA\} (zero tillage, retention of residues) and conventional agriculture (tillage and no surface residue). In maize, activity-density of generalist predators (excluding ants) was higher in conventional agriculture treatments than in \{CA\} treatments prior to crop planting (P = 0.03), but no significant differences were apparent in arthropod activity-densities at the treatment level at any other time. In multivariate analyses, the arthropod community was affected by tillage in maize at both sampling dates (P ≤ 0.05), and by residue after crop emergence in wheat (P = 0.03). Spiders trended toward a greater association with no-till treatments in maize and treatments with residue retained in wheat. In wheat, predation (biological control potential) was significantly lower in conventional compared with \{CA\} treatments (P ≤ 0.05). According to multiple linear regressions, higher levels of soil cover significantly explained predation before and after planting in maize, and before planting in wheat (P ≤ 0.05). Our results indicate that the type and amount of residue that remains at the soil surface may influence arthropod community dynamics. This first report of the effects of \{CA\} on arthropods in this long-term trial indicates that \{CA\} in central Mexico may contribute to conservation of certain arthropod predators and biological control of insect pests.

Descriptive statistics and econometric techniques such as probit, tobit, and Heckman two-step selection models were used to analyze the data. The study finds that households derive a significant portion of their income from the collection of NTFPs; however, the extent and pattern of household dependence on \{NTFPs\} for income differ widely across different socioeconomic and demographic profiles. Level of education, age, landholding and household size, number of children, and gender influence the intensity of household collection of NTFPs. Households located inside the core zone of the reserve tend to depend more on \{NTFP\} collection compared to households residing in the buffer zone. Provision of non-farm employment and adequate farm land will go a long way in reducing household dependence on \{NTFPs\} and thereby improve forest conservation outcomes. "

The results showed that Jingdong 11 possessed a new Pinb allele not reported previously, and was designated as Pinb-D1q.

We found that land use/land cover changes are proceeding in all eco-environments and that transitions are from grasslands, and forest lands to bush/shrub lands and crop lands in the pastoral site (Liben), from bush/shrub lands and grasslands to crop lands in agro-pastoral site (Mieso) and from bush/shrub lands, forest lands and grasslands to crop lands in the mixed crop-livestock site (Tiyo). The changes significantly affected livestock feed resources and feed deficit management strategies available to households. Over the last 30–40 years, grazing resources available to livestock keepers have been declining with resultant increase in the contribution of crop residues and other feeds from crop lands (weeds and crop thinnings) as compared to feeds from grasslands. The feed deficit management strategies of households are also changing significantly from mobility to herd management and feed conservation in the pastoral areas; from mobility to feed conservation and purchasing of feed in the agro-pastoral areas and from transhumance to feed conservation and purchase of feed in the mixed crop-livestock areas. Hence feed resources and their availability vary with time and eco-environments indicating the need for the development of eco-environment/site specific feed management strategies in order to support productive stock in the study areas and similar eco-environments.

Grain yield of maize was highest (8.2–73.4%) under \{NTB\} followed by \{NTF\} and \{CTF\} across the years. Wheat yield was significantly higher under \{NTF\} during the 1st year while tillage practices had non-significant effect in the succeeding two years. On average, maize planted on \{NTB\} recorded about 11% lower water use and 16% higher water use efficiency compared to CT. The \{NTB\} and \{NTF\} required 24.7% and 10.8% less irrigation water than \{CTF\} system, respectively with 11.5% higher system productivity and demonstrated higher water productivity. The \{NTB\} and \{NTF\} systems provided similar net returns (averaged over 3 years) in maize–wheat system (MWS), which were US$ 281 ha−1 higher compared to \{CTF\} system. The \{CTF\} system had higher bulk density and penetration resistance in 10–15 and 15–20 cm soil layers due to compaction caused by the repeated tillage. The steady-state infiltration rate and soil aggregation (&gt;0.25 mm) were higher under \{NTB\} and \{NTF\} and lower in the \{CTF\} system. Similarly, mean weight diameter (MWD) of aggregates was higher under \{NTF\} and \{NTB\} compared to CTF. The study reveals that \{NTB\} and \{NTF\} systems could be more viable options for \{MWS\} in order to save input costs and enhance profitability; however, the long-term effects of these alternative technologies need to be studied under varying agro-ecologies.

Success with adopting \{CA\} on farms in Africa has been limited, despite more than two decades of research and development investments. Through analyzing past and on-going \{CA\} experiences in a set of case studies, this paper seeks to better understand the reasons for the limited adoption of \{CA\} and to assess where, when and for whom \{CA\} works best. \{CA\} is analyzed and understood within a framework that distinguishes the following scales of analysis: field, farm, village and region. \{CA\} has a potential to increase crop yields in the fields, especially under conditions of erratic rainfall and over the long-term as a result of a gradual increase of overall soil quality. The impact on farm income with the practice of \{CA\} on some fields of the farm is far less evident, and depends on the type of farm. The lack of an immediate increase in farm income with \{CA\} explains in many cases the non-adoption of CA. Smallholders have often short-term time horizons: future benefits do not adequately outweigh their immediate needs. Another key factor that explains the limited \{CA\} adoption in mixed crop-livestock farming systems is the fact that crop harvest residues are preferably used as fodder for livestock, preventing their use as soil cover. Finally, in most case studies good markets for purchase of inputs and sale of produce – a key prerequisite condition for adoption of new technologies – were lacking. The case studies show clear evidence for the need to target end users (not all farmers are potential end user of CA) and adapt \{CA\} systems to the local circumstances of the farmers, considering in particular the farmer's investment capacity in the practice of \{CA\} and the compatibility of \{CA\} with his/her production objectives and existing farming activities. The identification of situations where, when and for whom \{CA\} works will help future development agents to better target their investments with CA. "

Crop production intensification is required to produce more food per unit area of land, while rebuilding soil fertility. We explored the impact of reallocation of limited resources on crop productivity across farms of different resource endowment in central Mozambique. The results suggested that decreasing the cropped area and concentrating resources (fertiliser, manure and labour within the farmers’ means) to smaller fields can increase total farm maize production for poor as well as relatively richer farmers in central Mozambique, but that the fertility of the retained and abandoned land is important for the overall outcome. Concentrating resources to smaller areas would in most cases also lead to increased concentrations of soil organic carbon (SOC), indicating positive effects on soil fertility and crop productivity in the long term. However, this apparently does not apply when only fertiliser is used and if harvest residues and weeds are removed or burnt. Organic inputs are thus also required, such as retention of crop residues, and applications of manure if available can further increase SOC. The study has revealed that sustainable intensification or crop production requires that multiple constraints be addressed simultaneously. Success of crop intensification options will also depend on proper targeting to different farm types as well as variability in soil fertility. Differences in resource ownership and bio-physical circumstances lead to different opportunities for individual farmers even within the same area. While targeted interventions for individual farmers might not be feasible, targeting defined farmer/endowment groups may be a sustainable pathway to increase productivity. Although smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have limited assets, the study revealed opportunities to increase crop productivity without substantial capital inputs, but more efficient use and targeting.

Each year the trial comprised of 28 new entries, one \{CIMMYT\} check (Baj) and a local check variety. Locations were classified by mega environment (ME); \{ME1\} being the temperate irrigated locations with terminal high temperature stress, and \{ME5\} as hot, sub-tropical, irrigated locations. Grain yield (GY), days to heading (DTH) and plant height (PH) were recorded at each location. Effect of temperature on \{GY\} was observed in both \{ME1\} and ME5. Across years, mean minimum temperatures in \{ME1\} and mean maximum temperatures in \{ME5\} during grain filling had significant negative association with GY. The \{ME1\} locations were cooler that those in \{ME5\} in the 5 years of evaluations and had a 1–2 t/ha higher GY. A mean reduction of 20 days for \{DTH\} and 20 cm in \{PH\} was observed in ME5. Negative genetic correlations of −0.43 to −0.79 were observed between \{GY\} and \{DTH\} in South Asia during 2009–2014. Each year, we identified early-maturing germplasm with higher grain yield than the local checks. A positive trend was observed while estimating the breeding progress across five years for high-yielding early-maturing heat tolerant wheat compared to the local checks in South Asia.

The first set of advanced lines derived from crosses of high yielding wheats with genetic resources possessing high Zn and Fe such as Triticum spelta, landraces and synthetic wheat based on Triticum dicoccon were tested at nine locations in South Asia and Mexico for Zn and Fe concentration, grain yield and other traits. Analyses of variance across locations revealed significant genotypic, environmental and genotype × environment (G × E) effects for grain Zn and Fe concentrations and grain yield. Variances associated with environmental effects were larger than the genotypic and G × E effects for all three traits, suggesting that environmental effects have relatively greater influence. Although G × E interaction was significant, high heritabilities were observed for Zn and Fe concentrations at individual sites and across environments, reflecting non-crossover type of interaction. This trend was confirmed by the high genetic correlations between locations that showed similar ranking of entries across locations, indicating that it is possible to select the best adapted entries with high Zn and Fe concentration. Pooled data across locations showed increments of 28% and 25% over the checks for Zn and Fe. A considerable number of entries exceeded intermediate to full breeding target Zn concentrations, indicating that it is possible to develop Zn-biofortified varieties with competitive yields and other farmer preferred agronomic traits.

To address these challenges, a wheat phenotyping network was established in the region in 2009 to support national breeding programs by applying practical phenotyping techniques to increase selection success using a cooperative multi-location testing network. A number of trials have been grown to introduce new genetic diversity for stress adaptive traits, to establish their genetic bases, and to test a new generation of lines developed using physiological approaches. The 17th Semi-Arid Wheat Yield Trial (SAWYT), consisting of a group of 50 elite spring bread wheat advanced lines, bred in Mexico using both conventional (CON) and physiological trait (PT) approaches, was grown for two seasons 2009/10 and 2010/11. Data showed that \{PT\} lines gave superior yields overall, associated with higher grain weight, and with cooler vegetative and grain-filling canopy temperatures (CT); the \{CT\} trait is considered indicative of increased gas exchange, a likely consequence in these environments of superior vascular capacity including deeper rooting to access subsoil water. Local check genotypes, which were generally well adapted to the stressed environments tended to be 3–5 days earlier to heading than \{CIMMYT\} cultivars. Results demonstrate the potential to integrate physiological breeding approaches into genetic improvement for the region, particularly as future wheat production will take place under increasing water scarcity.

Climate change will reinforce the need to develop highly productive crops. For this purpose it is essential to identify target traits conditioning plant performance in changing environments. \{N2\} fixing plants represent the second major crop of agricultural importance worldwide. The current review provides a compilation of results from existing literature on the effects of several abiotic stress conditions on nodule performance and \{N2\} fixation. The environmental factors analysed include water stress, salinity, temperature, and elevated [CO2]. Despite the large number of studies analysing [CO2] effects in plants, frequently they have been conducted under optimal growth conditions that are difficult to find in natural conditions where different stresses often occur simultaneously. This is why we have also included a section describing the current state of knowledge of interacting environmental conditions in nodule functioning. Regardless of the environmental factor considered, it is evident that some general patterns of nodule response are observed. Nodule carbohydrate and N compound availability, together with the presence of oxygen reactive species (ROS) have proven to be the key factors modulating \{N2\} fixation at the physiological/biochemical levels. However, with the exception of water availability and [CO2], it should also be considered that nodule performance has not been characterised in detail under other limiting growth conditions. This highlights the necessity to conduct further studies considering these factors. Finally, we also observe that a better understanding of these metabolic effects of changing environment in nodule functioning would require an integrated and synergistic investigation based on widely used and novel protocols such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and stable isotopes.

The study of such practice is important especially under conditions of climate change, since EdGCM (Educational Global Climate Model) simulation predicts by 2040 an increase in precipitation by more than 100 mm yr−1 in the study area. Firstly, field-saturated infiltration rates, together with soil texture and soil organic carbon contents, were measured. The relation with local topography allows to generate a pedotransfer function for field-saturated infiltration rate, and spatial interpolation with Linear Regression Mapping was used to map field-saturated infiltration rates optimally within the catchment. Secondly, on several farmlands, \{CA\} was checked against plain tillage (PT) for values of field-saturated infiltration rates, soil organic carbon, runoff and soil loss. Results show no significant differences for infiltration rates but significant differences for runoff and soil loss (as measured in the period 2005–2011). Runoff coefficients were 30.4% for \{PT\} and 18.8% for CA; soil losses were 35.4 t ha−1 yr−1 for \{PT\} and 14.4 t ha−1 yr−1 for CA. Thirdly, all collected information was used to predict future catchment hydrological response for full-implementation of \{CA\} under the predicted wetter climate (simulation with EdGCM). Curve Numbers for farmlands with \{CA\} were calculated. An area-weighted Curve Number allows the simulation of the 2011 rainy season runoff, predicting a total runoff depth of 23.5 mm under \{CA\} and 27.9 mm under PT. Furthermore, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation management factor P was calibrated for CA. Results also show the important influence of increased surface roughness on water ponding, modeled with a hydrologic conservation balance. By coupling this model with the infiltration rate map, a ‘ponding map’ of the catchment was established. Finally, a sediment budget for a full future implementation scenario of \{CA\} has been estimated, predicting a large impact of \{CA\} on sheet and rill erosion rates, since total soil loss due to sheet and rill erosion in cropland would become 581 t yr−1 instead of 1109 t yr−1, if \{CA\} would be practiced in MZZ. Simulation of several policy scenarios shows that especially under a future wetter North-East-African climate, \{CA\} would be a beneficial alternative for the current plain tillage, as it will increase infiltration and keep runoff coefficients under control.

In this study, we modeled the response of herbaceous species of grasslands within the Arsi Mountains in Ethiopia under no-migration and with migration scenarios to the projected 4.2 °C increase of temperature by 2090 (under the \{A2\} emission scenario). For 67 species of grasses and legumes, we determined the current and predicted altitudinal limits and calculated current and projected area coverage using a Digital Elevation Model. The results indicated that the projected warming significantly reduced altitudinal ranges and habitat areas of all the species studied. All the studied species faced range contraction and habitat loss with range shift gaps among forty two species under the no-migration scenario. With the migration scenario, however, the forty two species with range shift gaps are predicted to benefit from at least some habitat area retention. Between growth forms, legumes are predicted to lose significantly more habitat area than grasses under the no-migration scenario while no significant difference in habitat area loss is predicted under the migration scenario. It can be concluded that management options are required to facilitate upslope species migration to survive under the warming climate. This could involve leaving suitable dispersal corridors and assisted colonization depending on species behavior and level of extinction risk predicted under the projected warming. "

The utilization of wild germplasm in breeding programs has been restricted by reproductive barriers between wild and cultivated species and technical difficulties in making large numbers of crosses. Efforts to overcome these hurdles have resulted in the development of synthetic amphidiploids, namely \{ISATGR\} 278-18 (Arachis duranesis × Arachis batizocoi) and \{ISATGR\} 5B (Arachis magna × A. batizocoi), which possess several desirable traits, including resistance to foliar diseases that generally cause huge yield losses annually in groundnut growing areas of Asia, America, and Africa. With an objective to improve foliar disease resistance, the primary gene pool was diversified by introgressing foliar disease resistance in five cultivated genotypes (ICGV 91114, \{ICGS\} 76, \{ICGV\} 91278, \{JL\} 24, and \{DH\} 86) from synthetic amphidiploids using a backcross breeding approach. Several introgression lines with resistance to two foliar diseases (rust and late leaf spot) were identified with levels of resistance equal to the donors. These backcross derived lines have shown a wide range of variation for several morphological and agronomic traits. These lines, after further evaluation and selection, can serve as donors in future breeding programs aimed at developing improved cultivars with desirable agronomic traits, high resilience to biotic/abiotic stresses and a broadened genetic base.

Ten-fold resequencing at the target region on 40 of the panel lines and 47 tropical lines was also undertaken. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) for cob glume color confirmed the \{P1\} locus, which is located on the short arm of chromosome 1, with a − log10 P value for surrounding \{SNPs\} higher than the Bonferroni threshold (α/n, α &lt; 0.001) when a mixed linear model (MLM) was implemented. A total of 26 markers were identified in a 0.78 Mb region surrounding the \{P1\} locus, including 0.73 Mb and 0.05 Mb upstream and downstream of the \{P1\} gene, respectively. A clear linkage disequilibrium (LD) block was found and \{LD\} decayed very rapidly with increasing physical distance surrounding the \{P1\} locus. The estimates of π and Tajima's D were significantly (P &lt; 0.001) lower at both ends compared to the locus. Upon comparison of temperate and tropical lines at much finer resolution by resequencing (180-fold finer than chip SNPs), a more structured \{LD\} block pattern was found among the 40 resequenced temperate lines. All evidence indicates that the \{P1\} locus in temperate maize has not undergone neutral evolution but has been subjected to artificial selection during post-domestication selection or improvement. The information and analytical results generated in this study provide insights as to how breeding efforts have affected genome evolution in crop plants. "

The difference between field scale and regional scale yield risk, which can be significant, also represents an important measure of the factors that cause the yield gap – the difference between average and maximum yields. While field scale yield risk is difficult to assess with traditional data sources, yield maps derived from remote sensing offer promise for obtaining the necessary data in any region. We analyzed remotely sensed yield datasets for two regions in Northwest Mexico, the Yaqui and San Luis Rio Colorado Valleys, in conjunction with time series of aggregated regional yields for 1976–2002. Regional scale yield risk was roughly 8% of average yields in both regions. Field scale yield risk was determined to be 58% higher than regional scale risk in both regions. The difference between field and regional scale risk accounted for 50% of the spatial variance in yields in the Yaqui Valley, and 70% in the San Luis Rio Colorado Valley, indicating that climatic uncertainty represents an important source of the spatial yield variability. This implies that accurate seasonal climate forecasts could substantially reduce yield losses in farmers’ fields. The results were shown to be fairly sensitive to assumptions about the magnitude and nature of errors in yield estimation, suggesting that improved understanding of estimation errors are needed to realize the full potential of remote sensing for yield risk analysis.

Three examples of rice–vegetable integration are then explored in the light of this framework. These examples illustrate varying degrees of spatial and management integration, but little temporal integration. Temporal integration is constrained in large part by the limited degree of water control found in most West African lowlands. Research, policy and development implications are then explored. A major conclusion is that in the short-term integrated rice–vegetable production is unlikely to be an important part of a pro-poor development agenda. "

The results showed that \{NTSC\} reduced soil bulk density in the 0–30 cm soil layer, but more importantly the treatment increased total porosity by 20.9%, water stable aggregates and pore size class distribution. The enhance soil structure and improved infiltration in \{NTSC\} treatments contributed to reducing soil salinity by 20.3%–73.4% when compared with CTSR. Soil organic matter was significantly greater to 30 cm in NTSC, while total soil nitrogen was lower than \{CTSR\} treatments; however, available P was significantly higher in the 0–5 cm soil surface. During the first 3 years, there was no difference in spring maize yield between \{NTSC\} and CTSR, but yield significantly increased in \{NTSC\} compared with \{CTSR\} during the remaining years due to reduced salinity stress and increased soil health. In conclusion, \{NTSC\} soil management practices appear to be a more sustainable approach to farming than conventional methods that utilize intensive tillage and crop residue removal. "

To gain an insight into the molecular basis of apomictic reproduction, gene expression in mature ovaries containing reduced and unreduced embryo sacs was compared in Brachiaria, an apomictic tropical forage grass. Experimental systems for the molecular study of apomixis and sexuality have limitations mainly resulting from numerous differences in the genetic make-up of the plant material. When unrelated to the reproductive behaviour, these may dramatically affect the results if a conventional differential display strategy is applied (comparison made on a one-to-one plant basis). To overcome these limitations, we examined mRNA populations extracted from ovaries collected from pooled samples of various apomictic and sexual plants using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) differential display and non radioactive cDNA detection procedures. Using this approach, two mRNAs whose expression appeared to be related to the late stages of apomictic reproduction were identified. These results indicate that gene expression in pooled mRNA analysis is a promising tool to elucidate the molecular basis of apomixis. "

This article reviews some of the approaches for addressing the expected effects that climate change may likely inflict on wheat in some of the most important wheat growing areas, namely germplasm adaptation, system management, and mitigation. Future climate scenarios suggest that global warming may be beneficial for the wheat crop in some regions, but could reduce productivity in zones where optimal temperatures already exist. For example, by 2050, as a result of possible climate shifts in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGPs) – currently part of the favorable, high potential, irrigated, low rainfall mega-environment, which accounts for 15% of global wheat production – as much as 51% of its area might be reclassified as a heat-stressed, irrigated, short-season production mega-environment. This shift would also represent a significant reduction in wheat yields, unless appropriate cultivars and crop management practices were offered to and adopted by South Asian farmers. Under the same climate scenarios, the area covered by the cool, temperate wheat mega-environment could expand as far as 65°N in both North America and Eurasia. To adapt and mitigate the climate change effects on wheat supplies for the poor, germplasm scientists and agronomists are developing heat-tolerant wheat germplasm, as well as cultivars better adapted to conservation agriculture. Encouraging results include identifying sources of alleles for heat tolerance and their introgression into breeding populations through conventional methods and biotechnology. Likewise, agronomists and extension agents are aiming to cut \{CO2\} emissions by reducing tillage and the burning of crop residues. Mitigation research promises to reduce emissions of nitrous oxide by using infrared sensors and the normalized differential vegetative index (NDVI) that determines the right times and correct amounts of fertilizer to apply. Wheat geneticists and physiologists are also assessing wild relatives of wheat as potential sources of genes with inhibitory effects on soil nitrification. Through the existing global and regional research-for-development networks featuring wheat, technology and knowledge can flow to allow farmers to face the risks associated with climate change. "

In this study, we performed a regional observational experiment using remote sensing to analyze sources of yield variability in an irrigated wheat system in Northwest Mexico. Four different soil types and 3 years with contrasting weather served as the two main experimental factors, while remotely sensed yields provided thousands of observations within each treatment. Analysis of variance revealed that 6.6 and 4.6% of the variability in yields could be explained by soil type and climate, respectively, with a negligible fraction explained by soil-type–climate interactions. The majority of the variability in yields (88.6%) was observed within treatments and was attributed mainly to variations in management. The impacts of management were observed to depend significantly on both soil type and climate, as revealed by distributions of yields within each treatment. The results indicate that changes in management will have the greatest impact on regional production, and will also play a large role in determining the impact of any changes in climate or soil. This work also demonstrates the use of consistent remote sensing estimates to perform regional studies unfeasible with field-based approaches. "

The causal impact of technology adoption is estimated by utilizing endogenous switching regression. This helps us estimate the true welfare effect of technology adoption by controlling for the role of selection problem on production and adoption decisions. Our analysis reveals that adoption of improved agricultural technologies has a significant positive impact consumption expenditure (in per adult equivalent terms) in rural Ethiopia and Tanzania. This confirms the potential role of technology adoption in improving rural household welfare as higher consumption expenditure from improved technologies translate into lower poverty, higher food security and greater ability to withstand risk.

Qpm.caas-2BS.1 and Qpm.caas-5BL.1 contributed by Strampelli and Qpm.caas-3BS by Huixianhong, seem to be new \{QTL\} for powdery mildew resistance. Qpm.caas-4BL, Qpm.caas-5BL.3, and Qpm.caas-7DS contributed by Strampelli appeared to be in the same genomic regions as those mapped previously for stripe rust resistance in the same population, indicating that these loci conferred resistance to both stripe rust and powdery mildew. Strampelli could be a valuable genetic resource for improving durable resistance to both powdery mildew and stripe rust in wheat. "

Dumpling quality is determined by the characteristics of both flour and filling, thus improvement of flour quality plays an important role in improving dumpling quality. Thirty-nine Shandong winter wheat cultivars and advanced lines sown in Jinan, Shandong Province, China, in the 2008–2009 cropping season were used to determine genetic variation in Chinese raw dumpling quality and its relationship with flour characteristics. Large variations were observed for protein quality parameters in comparison with starch properties. Variation in color of the raw dumpling sheet was broader than that of sensory evaluation parameters of boiled dumpling among tested wheat cultivars, indicating the large influence of filling on dumpling color. Two cultivars, Jimai 20 and Zimai 12, were identified as possessing very good quality of raw dumpling, and 21 cultivars and advanced lines showed good quality. Protein and total starch content influenced the L* value of raw dumpling sheets. L* value at 0 and 2 h after sheeting were significantly influenced by protein content (r=−0.46 and −0.52, P&lt;0.01) and total starch content (r=0.55 and 0.57, P&lt;0.01), respectively. Flour yellow pigment was significantly corrected with a* (r=−0.67 and −0.62, P&lt;0.01) and b* (r=0.87 and 0.84, P&lt;0.01) value of raw dumpling sheets at 0 and 2 h after sheeting, respectively. Gluten strength parameters such as farinograph mixing tolerance index (MTI, r=−0.55, P&lt;0.01) were positively associated with appearance. \{MTI\} and energy were also significantly and positively correlated with elasticity of raw dumpling, with r=−0.54 and 0.47 (P&lt;0.01). The positive relationships between peak viscosity (r=0.51, P&lt;0.01), breakdown (r=0.54, P&lt;0.01), and smoothness of raw dumpling were also observed. Therefore, it is suggested that breeding programs should give more attention to gluten strength and starch pasting parameters for raw dumpling quality improvement. "

Major gene loci of HMW-GS were associated with variation in mixograph characters, but accounted for no more than 25.3% of the phenotypic variations. Glu-D1, together with Glu-B3, played the most important role in determining the properties. Additive effects of HMW-GS and LMW-GS showed major contributions to most of the variation of mixograph parameters, and epistatic effects were also important and could be counter to additive effects of individual loci. The quantity of gluten protein fractions, especially the quantity of glutenin, LMW-GS, and Glu-B3, showed highly significant correlations with most of the quality parameters, but the correlation coefficients were influenced by grain hardness, protein content, or both.

Fundamental to the pursuit of effective investment strategies is an ability to quantify tradeoffs associated with potential policy and management changes. However, the data needed to predict regional yield responses to change, namely observations of yields and climatic, soil, and management conditions in farmers’ fields, are often difficult to obtain. In this paper, we investigate the value of data on the spatial distribution of yields for understanding causes of landscape yield variability. Stochastic simulation models, which employ the \{CERES\} model to simulate crop yields across a landscape, are used to translate assumed spatial patterns of soil and management conditions into spatial pattern of yields. Monte Carlo simulation is then used to repeat this process for many different realizations of conditions, resulting in a modeled relationship between yield patterns and the relative importance of soil and management yield constraints, both of which can be computed in the controlled simulation environment. The derived relationship then allows one to infer from observed yield patterns the true proportion of yield variability explained by soil and management. This procedure was tested for wheat in the Yaqui Valley, an intensive agricultural region in Sonora, Mexico, where yield patterns have been previously estimated with remote sensing. Comparison of simulated and observed yield patterns indicated that roughly 80% of spatial yield variance in 2001–2002 was attributable to management variations. The ability of simulation models to aid interpretation of landscape patterns is potentially invaluable for understanding yield constraints in many agricultural regions, where direct observations of soil and management variables are infeasible.

Conservation agriculture (CA) has been proposed as a viable alternative in the region, based on reduction in tillage, retention of adequate levels of crop residues and soil surface cover and use of crop rotation. This study began in 2009 when the highlands of Central Mexico suffered from a prolonged drought during vegetative maize growth in July–August, providing an opportunity for the on-farm comparison of \{CA\} with \{CP\} under severe drought conditions which 21 climate change models projected to become more frequent. Under dry conditions, \{CA\} resulted in higher yields and net returns per hectare as early as the first and second years after adoption by farmers. As an average of 27 plots under farmers’ management in 2009, the maize yields were 26% higher under \{CA\} (6.3 t ha−1) than under \{CP\} (5.0 t ha−1). 2010 was close to a normal year in terms of rainfall so yields were higher than in 2009 for both practices; in addition, the yield difference between the practices was reduced to 19% (6.8 t ha−1 for \{CA\} vs. 5.7 t ha−1 for CP). When all the 2009 and 2010 observations were analyzed in a modified stability analysis, \{CA\} had an overall positive effect of 3 838 Mexican Pesos ha−1 (320 $US ha−1) on net return and 1.3 t ha−1 on yield. After only one to two years of adoption by farmers on their fields, \{CA\} had higher yields and net returns under dry conditions that were even drier than those predicted by the analyzed 21 climate change models under a climate change scenario, emission scenario A2.

Soil bulk density decreased with time in all tillage systems irrespective of mulch quantity applied. Ripping loosened the soil much deeper than the other tillage methods. Total infiltration in all treatments was similar over the four seasons. Soil structural changes resulted in increased unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity of the clay loam soil. Maize yield increased with time in all treatments. Long term studies need to be conducted to substantiate the results on soil property and crop yield improvements observed in the reported study. "

However, scientific studies on crop yield benefits of infiltration pits have not been conclusive. Combining field-edge \{RWH\} methods such as contour ridges with infiltration pits with in-field practices may enhance crop yield benefits. Thus, the objective of the study was to assess soil moisture and maize yield improvement of combining infiltration and planting pits. Field experiments were conducted in Rushinga, Zimbabwe for three seasons at three sites using a split-plot design: main-plot factor, field-edge rainwater management method (RWMM); and split-plot factor, tillage method. Soil moisture content was measured weekly using gravimetric and Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) methods. A household and field survey to establish farmers’ perceptions, typology and availability of field-edge \{RWMM\} was conducted. In order to share experiences and enhance stakeholders’ learning, field days were held. Lateral movement of soil water was measured up to 2 m downslope from infiltration pits, hence infiltration pits did not improve maize yield and soil moisture content in the cropping area. Maize yield (kg ha−1) was 45% higher under conventional tillage (2697) than planting pits (1852) but the yield gap decreased from 90 to 30% in the first and third year respectively. The value of infiltration pits is in reducing soil erosion by water and growing high value horticultural crops inside and close to pits, a view shared by host farmers and other stakeholders. Planting pits are an option for farmers without access to draught power and a fall-back method. Research is required to determine soil moisture, maize yield benefits and waterlogging risk in fields with underlying impermeable layers that enhance lateral flow of water. "

This study was conducted at three on-station and three on-farm sites: CIMMYT-Harare, Domboshawa Training Centre and Henderson Research Station (on-station sites), Hereford farm, Madziva communal area and Shamva communal area (on-farm sites). The evaluation focused on the effect of initial herbicide application and succeeding manual weeding whenever weeds were 10 cm tall or 10 cm in length for grasses with stoloniferous–rhizomatous growth habit. Weeds counts, weeding time and grain yields were collected at all on-station sites. At the on-farm sites, weed counts were done before weeding and a number of farmers were timed during weeding. The results showed that herbicides use reduced the weed density and time taken on weeding at all sites. Combining herbicides e.g. atrazine, glyphosate and metalachlor had the lowest weed density and weeding time at all sites. However, the treatments had no effect on maize grain yields suggesting that appropriate and timely manual weeding reduced crop/weed competition. Herbicides treatments had higher input costs than manual weeding due to the additional cost of herbicide but the treatment with manual weeding only had more overall labour days compared to the mixture of three herbicides. In order to achieve economic benefits, smallholder farmers may use the time for value addition e.g. expand cropped land area, use time for value addition, or sell new products on the market. Herbicides use reduces the manual labour needed to control weeds and minimise total crop failure due to untimely weeding hence, herbicides are an important but not the only weed control option under \{CA\} systems in Zimbabwe.

The most effective and efficient way of managing losses due to \{DM\} is to develop durable host-plant resistance in Asian maize across different \{DM\} pathogens. We assessed resistance in released \{DM\} (P. zeae) resistant \{CIMMYT\} maize lines (CMLs) against Peronosclerospora sorghi and Perenosclerospora heteropogoni to develop \{DM\} resistant (DMR) maize germplasm with a broad-spectrum of resistance, and identify and further improve new sources of \{DMR\} maize germplasm for use in regional breeding programs targeting DM-prone environments. Data indicated that out of 19 \{DM\} resistant CMLs, four (CML-433, 465, 466 and 472) were resistant and 15 susceptible to P. sorghi. Screening of new inbred lines from CIMMYT-Asia (CA) resulted in identification of a set of yellow maize lines with good level of \{DM\} resistance (disease score – 0.0–25%). However, the high quality protein maize (QPM) lines derived from \{CIMMYT\} Population 61 and bi-parental pedigree crosses between elite \{QPM\} lines showed very poor resistance to DM. Progenies of the bi-parental population developed by crossing \{DMR\} (P. sorghi) \{CA\} lines showed further enhanced levels of resistance to both P. sorghi and P. heteropogoni. The study resulted in identification of 10 new inbred lines, in addition to the 4 released CMLs, offering consistent high resistance to both the \{DM\} pathogens. Promising bi-parental populations (13) with combined \{DM\} resistance and other desirable agronomic traits were identified for the extraction of a new generation of \{DMR\} lines with broad-spectrum \{DM\} resistance and other commercial traits. Comparison of genotypic response under different screening methods/DM species clearly indicated that the glasshouse-based sandwich method of screening against P. sorghi was the best method for identifying promising genotypes with a high level of \{DM\} resistance that were also resistant to \{DM\} under field conditions for both the species. However, the highly controlled conditions used for sandwich screening, which is most favourable for disease development, resulted in high disease pressure potentially masking the identification of genotypes with a moderate level of \{DM\} resistance.

This study was conducted, under controlled environmental conditions, to elucidate the genetics and map the resistance to \{SNB\} caused by spore inoculum and culture filtrate of P. nodorum isolate Sn2000. A hard red spring wheat population was developed from a cross between the susceptible cultivar Steele-ND and the resistant line \{ND\} 735 for this study. Two-leaf seedlings of the parents, \{F1\} and \{F2\} generations, and F2:6 recombinant-inbred lines (RILs) were inoculated with spore suspensions while independent two week old seedlings of segregating generations were infiltrated with culture filtrate. Disease reaction was assessed 8 days after inoculation based on a lesion-type scale while plants were evaluated for culture filtrate response four days after infiltration for the presence or absence of necrosis. Genetic analysis revealed that a single recessive gene, Tsn1, in \{ND\} 735 confers resistance to both spore suspension and culture filtrate of P. nodorum isolate Sn2000. Mapping analysis using Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers indicates the gene, Tsn1, is located on the long arm of chromosome 5B and is flanked by the \{DArt\} markers wPt-8285 and wPt-3049 at a distance of 7.0 cM and 2.9 cM, respectively. This gene also controls resistance to tan spot caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis race 2. Results of this study reveal that wheat-P. nodorum interaction follows the toxin model of gene-for-gene hypothesis. Additionally, the finding of single gene control in the line \{ND\} 735 for both tan spot and \{SNB\} enhances the utility of the line \{ND\} 735 in wheat breeding program as a source of multiple disease resistance.

It was concluded that amber grain and semolina colour and kernel vitreousness increased market prices whereas increasing yellow berry, starchy grain, sunn pest damaged kernel and other contaminants (barley grains and red kernels of bread wheat) affected it negatively. Some regression equations, obtained from this study might be used for price estimation in such commodity markets and as practical guidance for plant breeding programmes. "

We used multiple methods and data sources, principally a survey of 621 households spread across nine districts, and in-depth interviews with farmers in three villages located in three different districts. Our study revealed four main findings. Firstly, we found that although farmers were able to identify unhealthy \{SP\} plants, they were unable to tell the specific type of disease affecting the plants both from direct and photographic observations. Secondly, there exists considerable heterogeneity in the way farmers manage unhealthy plants in the field; some farmers were observed to follow management methods prescribed by plant pathologists, while others used traditional methods of managing a diseased plant. Thirdly, the following three factors were found to be the determinants of farmers' knowledge and management of \{SP\} diseases and plant root damage: (i) farmers' training in \{SP\} production and management; (ii) the number of plots which the woman of the household has control over; and (iii) household membership to a crop production association. Lastly, the location of farms is a strong determinant of farmers' satisfaction with \{SP\} vines; residing in areas in which sweet potato vines are widely available and in a village that is accessible by a primary road or tarmac road increases a farmer's satisfaction with sweet potato vines that are available in the farmers' farm during planting time.

Maize production and soybean imports are increasing significantly to meet the strong demand for feed by a rapidly growing livestock industry. Extension of the rice and maize growing seasons in northeastern China and improvement of the cropping system through delayed wheat planting have contributed to improving cereal productivity despite changing climatic conditions. Significant improvements in yield potential of rice, maize, and wheat have been achieved. Comparative genomics has been successfully used to develop and validate functional markers for processing quality traits in wheat, and also for developing new varieties. Although transgenic Bt rice and maize, and maize expressing phytase have been developed, their commercialization has not been officially permitted. International collaboration has contributed significantly to cereal production by providing germplasm and improved crop management practices. Full integration of applied molecular technologies into conventional breeding programs and promotion of lower-input technologies, will play a key role in increasing and sustaining future cereal production.

The microstructural, thermal and rheological properties of annealed starch granules determine most of the quality of pozole. Annealed starch in traditional nixtamalisation has an important role in increasing gelatinisation onset (To), peak (Tp) and final (Tf) temperatures; peak, setback and final viscosity as well as the stability of the starch granule, all of which significantly affect pozole quality. Annealed starch in Cacahuacintle nixtamal (pozole end-use) increased temperatures To, Tp and Tf by &gt;5.2, &gt;3.8 and &gt;4.1 °C respectively, and narrowed the range Tf − To from 13.78 to 12.62 °C. The enthalpy was reduced from 6.76 to 5.85 J/g, while the nixtamal starch in tortilla maize landraces presented fewer annealing effects. The annealing effect in nixtamal starch seems to stabilize the starch granules and avoid their collapse, compared to native starch, as shown by the X-ray diffraction peak intensity and pattern that is similar to unprocessed maize. Starch in nixtamal changes from Type A to Type V pattern in pozole. Kernel physical parameters, although important, affected the quality to a lesser extent, with the exception of the flotation index.

Only a small fraction (2–15%) of Fe from plant sources is typically bioavailable, that is, available for absorption and nutritionally useful for humans. This study evaluated Fe concentration and bioavailability for three diverse sets of 12, 14 and 16 maize hybrids grown in two- or three-location trials to assess the feasibility of selecting for Fe bioavailability in breeding programs. Bioavailability of Fe, assessed using the in vitro digestion/Caco-2 cell model, varied significantly among hybrids in two of the three trials. Location effects were larger than location by genotype interaction effects, additive but not non-additive gene action was significant, and heritability estimates were mostly between 0.55 and 0.65 for Fe bioavailability estimators. Bioavailability of Fe was not associated with Fe concentration in grain or with grain yield. Negative correlation of Fe bioavailability with zinc concentration in grain for one of the three hybrid trials, and positive correlation with provitamin A concentrations in one trial were indicative of inhibitor and enhancer effects on Fe bioavailability, respectively. Although use of the Caco-2 cell model is promising, particularly because it integrates the whole meal, or food matrix effect on Fe bioavailability, the complex nature of the assay and moderate heritability of bioavailability estimators make it most suitable as an intermediate selection tool, following high throughput selection for molecular markers of Fe bioavailability, currently in development by other researchers, and preceding validation and efficacy trials with animal and human models.

During the last 50 years, resource conserving technologies were introduced in large parts of the rainfed areas while the irrigated areas were expanded largely without considering resource conservation. In more recent years, the use of conservation agriculture (CA) practices has been reported for the different agricultural production (AP) zones in CAC, albeit centering on a single \{AP\} zone or on single factors such as crop yield, implements or selected soil properties. Moreover, conflicting information exists regarding whether the current practices that are referred to as ‘CA’ can indeed be defined as such. Overall information on an application of CA-based crop management in Central Asia is incomplete. This discussion paper evaluates experimental evidence on the performance of \{CA\} and other resource conserving technologies in the three main \{AP\} zones of CAC, provides an overview of farmer adoption of production practices related to CA, and outlines technical and non-technical challenges and opportunities for the future dissemination of \{CA\} practices in each zone. Agronomic (e.g. implements, crop yields, duration, and crop residues), institutional (e.g. land tenure) and economic (e.g. short vs. long-term profitability) perspectives are considered. At present, adoption of CA-based agronomic practices in the rainfed production zone is limited to partial crop residue retention on the soil surface or sporadically zero tillage for one crop out of the rotation, and hence the use of single \{CA\} components but not the full set of \{CA\} practices. In the irrigated \{AP\} zones, \{CA\} is not commonly practiced and many of the pre-conditions that typically encourage the rapid spread of \{CA\} practices appear to be absent or limiting. Further, our analysis suggests that given the diversity of institutional, socio-economic and agro-ecological contexts, a geographically differentiated approach to \{CA\} dissemination is required in the CAC. Immediate priorities should include a shift in research paradigms (e.g. towards more participatory approaches with farmers), development of commercially available reduced and no-till seeders suitable for smaller-scale farm enterprises, and advocacy so that decision makers understand how different policies may encourage or discourage innovations that lead towards more sustainable agricultural intensification in the CAC.

In this study we combined field experimentation and long-term rainfall analyses in Makoni and Hwedza districts in eastern Zimbabwe to evaluate cropping adaptation options to climate variability. Analyses of long-term rainfall data closely supports farmers’ perceptions that the mean annual total rainfall has not changed, but the pattern of rainfall within-season has changed: the number of rainfall days has decreased, and the frequency of dry spells has increased at the critical flowering stage of maize. On-farm experiments were conducted over two cropping seasons, 2009/10 and 2010/11 to assess the effects of planting date, fertilization and cultivar on maize production. Three maize cultivars were sown in each of the early, normal and late planting windows defined by farmers. Each of the nine cultivar-planting date combinations received N, P, K and manure combinations at either zero, low or high fertilization rates. Overall, there were no significant differences in maize development or grain yield among cultivars. Maize grain yield was increased by increasing the amount of nutrients applied. Average yield was 2.5 t ha−1 for the low rate and 5.0 t ha−1 for the high rate on early planted cultivars on relatively fertile soils in Makoni in 2009/10 season. Yields on poorer soils in Hwedza were small, averaging 1.5 t ha−1 for the low rate and 2.5 t ha−1 for the high rate. Maize grain yields for the early and normal planted cultivars were similar for each fertilization rate, suggesting there is a wide planting window for successful establishment of crops in response to increased rainfall variability. Yield reduction of &gt;50% was observed when planting was delayed by 4 weeks (late planting) regardless of the amount of fertilizer applied. Soil nutrient management had an overriding effect on crop production, suggesting that although the quality of within-season rainfall is decreasing, nutrient management is the priority option for adaptation in rain-fed smallholder cropping systems.

We quantified genotypic variation among elite genotypes of the \{CIMCOG\} panel assembled by \{CIMMYT\} for its usefulness for wheat breeding. Ten genotypes, representing the range of variation for yield and its components of the whole panel, were grown under high-yielding conditions in \{NW\} Mexico for two growing seasons. The stage of development of floret primordia was determined 2–3 times weekly during stem elongation for apical, central and basal spikelets within the spike. The dynamics of floret initiation/death, and the resulting number of fertile florets, were determined for each spikelet position. We found that the variation in number of fertile florets within this elite germplasm was much more related to the survival of floret primordia than to the maximum number of florets initiated. As the two floret primordia most proximal to the rachis were almost always fertile and most distal florets (florets 6–8) were never fertile, the differences in number of fertile florets were clearly attributed to the differential developmental patterns of intermediate florets (floret primordia 3, 4 and 5, counted from the rachis, depending on the spikelet position). We found significant differences among elite germplasm in dynamics of floret development. Differences in floret survival seemed positively related to those in the length of the period of floret development: the longer the duration of floret development the higher the likelihood of that floret becoming fertile. It is proposed that this type of study may be instrumental for identifying prospective parents for further raising yield potential wheat breeding programmes. "

abstract = "Abstract This paper explores the potential and challenges of increasing production of food and feed on existing maize fields in mixed crop-livestock systems in the semi-arid areas of southern Africa. It integrates results from different sources of data and analysis: 1. Spatial stratification using secondary data for \{GIS\} layers: Maize mega-environments combined with recommendation domains for dual-purpose maize were constructed for Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, stratifying the countries by demand factors (livestock densities and human population densities) and feed availability. Relative biomass contributions to feed resources from rangelands were compared to those from croplands to explore the usefulness of global datasets for feed supply estimations. 2. Verification through farming systems analysis: the potential demand for maize residues as feed (maize cropping patterns, maize yields and uses, feed deficits) was compared at contrasting sites, based on household survey data collected on 480 households in 2010. 3. Maize cultivar analysis: Genotypic variability of maize cultivars was compared to evaluate the potential contribution (stover quantity and quality) of dual-purpose maize to reduce feed deficits. The study results illustrate high spatial variability in the demand for and supply of maize residues. Northern Malawi is characterized by high livestock density, high human population density and high feed availability. Farmers achieve maize yields of more than 2 t/ha resulting in surplus of residues. Although livestock is important, southwest Zimbabwe has low livestock densities, low human populations and low feed availability; farming systems are more integrated and farmers make greater use of maize residues to address feed shortages. Central Mozambique also has low cattle densities, low human populations and low feed availability. More rangelands are available but maize yields are very low and livestock face severe feed shortages. The investigation of 14 advanced \{CIMMYT\} maize landraces cultivars and 15 advanced hybrids revealed significant variations in grain and stover yield and fodder quality traits. Where livestock densities are high and alternative feed resources are insufficient, maize cultivars with superior residue yield and fodder quality can have substantial impact on livestock productivity. Cultivars at the higher end of the quality range can provide sufficient energy for providing livestock maintenance requirements and support about 200 g of live weight gain daily. Maize cultivars can be targeted according to primary constraints of demand domains for either stover quantity or stover fodder quality and the paper proposes an approach for this based on voluntary feed intake estimates for maize stover.

Dual-purpose maize, i.e. varieties with increased grain and stover yields, are therefore being developed. These varieties show high potential, but it is not clear if they respond to a demand by targeted farmers. Therefore the farmers’ perspective on such varieties was studied in selected districts in Ethiopia (three districts) and Tanzania (two districts), using both informal methods (participatory rural appraisals) and formal methods (farmer evaluation of varieties and household surveys), the latter involving 360 households in Ethiopia and 150 households in Tanzania. Results show that maize stover is an important element of livestock feed in the study areas. Farmers mention a wide variety of criteria they use to evaluate maize varieties. These include field characteristics such as yield and pest resistance, consumer characteristics such as cooking and taste qualities, and feed characteristics including stover quality and quantity. Analysis of adoption patterns shows that varieties that score well on feed characteristics have a higher probability of being adopted. We conclude that there is a demand for varieties with increased stover quantity and quality, as long as they do not compromise field characteristics, in particular yield, and consumer qualities. Such varieties would have the potential to increase the productivity of maize-livestock systems and the income of these farmers, while reducing the pressure on the environment. "

Identification of molecular markers for quality traits will have a great impact in molecular breeding. An attempt was made to identify microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers for important nutritional traits (protein content, oil content and oil quality in terms of oleic acid, linoleic acid and oleic/linoleic acid ratio) in a mapping population consisting of 146 recombinant inbreed lines (RILs) of a cross \{TG26\} × GPBD4. Phenotyping data analysis for quality traits showed significant variation in the population and environment, genotype × environment interaction and high heritability was observed for all the traits. Negative correlation between protein content and oil content, oleic acid and linoleic acid indicated their antagonistic nature. After screening &gt;1000 \{SSR\} markers, a partial genetic linkage map comprising of 45 \{SSR\} loci on 8 linkage groups with an average inter-marker distance of 14.62 cM was developed. \{QTL\} analysis based on single marker analysis (SMA) and composite interval mapping identified some candidate \{SSR\} markers associated with major \{QTLs\} as well as several minor \{QTLs\} for the nutritional traits. Validation of these major \{QTLs\} using a wider genetic background may provide the markers for molecular breeding for improving groundnut for nutritional traits. "

As a result, soil degradation has been aggravated by the loss of valuable top soil caused by rainwater runoff due to the absence of effective conservation practices. To combat this trend, Conservation Agriculture (CA) systems were introduced using a pointed stick or hand hoe to plant directly into untilled soil with crop residues as surface mulch. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of different cropping systems (CA and conventional) on soil physical and chemical parameters and long-term maize productivity in target communities of the southern and central regions of Malawi. This study analysed the effects of \{CA\} on soil parameters and maize yield over eight cropping seasons. The biophysical variability of the communities was explored through principal component analysis. Results showed that maize yields in \{CA\} systems were strongly affected by rainfall infiltration, which was 24–40% greater compared with the conventional ridge and furrow system. In some cases, maize yields in \{CA\} plots were double that of conventional tillage plots. The larger water infiltration observed in \{CA\} plots relative to conventional tillage indicated that \{CA\} systems may increase access to soil water by the crop and offset the negative effects of seasonal dry spells. Yield benefits of \{CA\} over conventional tillage systems were greater especially from the 5th season although, in some instances, greater yields on \{CA\} were recorded almost immediately. \{CA\} can be practiced in diverse environments from sandy to clay soils, nutrient rich to infertile soils and from low to high rainfall areas as long as adequate inputs (fertilizer, herbicides and labour) are available with good extension support to farmers, especially in the initial years.

abstract = "Previous yield gains in wheat have been achieved through increased expression of grain number per unit area, while fruiting efficiency has also been shown to explain improved grain number. However, combining a high grain number and weight in the same genotype is a difficult task in practical breeding. This study evaluated the progeny of a cross between two elite parents that contrast in grain number and grain weight, as a way to better understand how the two desired traits might be combined to achieve a significant boost in yield. The two parents are both high biomass elite spring wheat lines that achieve high yield through contrasting strategies: Bacanora achieves high grain number with a high density of relatively small spikes. Weebil has a lower density of larger spikes in which larger grain size is expressed. The specific objectives of this research were: (i) to evaluate grain yield performance of \{DH\} lines and parents over two seasons, (ii) to identify promising physiological traits explaining high yield performance and (iii) to determine whether these traits are also expressed at the low plant densities. Two experiments were carried out under field conditions in southern Chile where the highest yield potential of wheat has ever been recorded. In Exp. 1 the performance of the 105 spring wheat \{DH\} lines, their parents and a Chilean spring cultivar (Pandora-INIA) with similar phenology were assessed together. Results showed that it is possible to increase yield potential by combining high grain number and grain weight, thereby reducing the trade-off between both components. 42 and 50% of the \{DH\} lines showed transgressive segregation in \{S1\} and S2, respectively. 3 and 4% of the \{DH\} lines yielded between 15,000 and 16,000 kg ha−1. Grain yield was highly correlated with above-ground biomass (R2 = 0.78, p &lt; 0.0001 in \{S1\} and \{R2\} = 0.77, p &lt; 0.0001 in S2) and grain number (R2 = 0.69, p &lt; 0.0001 in \{S1\} and \{R2\} = 0.71, p &lt; 0.0001 in S2), whereas no correlation was found with either harvest index or grain weight. In Exp. 2, the high-yielding \{DH\} lines selected from Exp. 1 showed on average 45% higher grain yield (p &lt; 0.01) than the Chilean checks. Differences in yield between the \{DH\} lines and the checks were explained by grain number m−2, which was closely related to grain number spike−1 and fruiting efficiency. The latter trait was in line with faster post-anthesis spike dry matter accumulation, explaining in turn the higher radiation use efficiency of the selected \{DH\} lines recorded during this period. When comparing yield and its components at different plant densities, grain yield and both main yield components showed strong correlations between environments as a result of increased expression of grains spike−1 (p &lt; 0.001) under low plant density that was able to offset the reduction in spike number m−2 (p &lt; 0.001).

abstract = "Small holder farmers in rainfed agriculture believe that soil tillage is needed to maximize crop yields. However, as cropping intensity, and hence tillage intensity, increases there may be a decline in particular physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil which limit crop yield. This is primarily caused by declining soil organic matter, its oxidation being accelerated by tillage, particularly in warmer climates, and exacerbated by the limited return of above-ground biomass to the soil due to its competing use for other purposes. In large-scale commercial agriculture declining soil quality has been effectively addressed by conservation agriculture—cropping systems based on minimum tillage, crop residue retention and appropriate crop rotations and associations, preferably including legumes. This has required development of minimum tillage planting equipment along with herbicide technology to achieve weed control that is traditionally achieved through tillage. However, a shortage of mechanized options suitable for small holder farmers is creating an impediment to the adoption of conservation agriculture practices that would arrest the decline in soil quality in their fields. In South Asia, two-wheel tractors are replacing animal-drawn ploughing in small holder plots. This speeds the tillage operation and hence the turnaround time between crops, which may increase opportunities for crop intensification, but the problems associated with full tillage remain. Over the previous decade planter attachments to two-wheel tractors have been developed which permit seed and fertilizer placement with minimum to zero tillage in a single-pass. Recent tests have demonstrated that use of these implements can produce crop yields equal to or better than conventional tillage involving hand broadcasting of seed and fertilizer. Further, fuel and labour costs, seed and fertilizer inputs and turnaround time between crops can be reduced. In Africa, the introduction of animal-drawn rippers and direct seeders, originally developed for small-scale farmers in Brazil, is considered as a major breakthrough to small-scale farmer mechanization. It significantly reduces labour required for planting and benefits may be even greater if herbicides can be effectively used for weed control. Nevertheless, movement towards minimum tillage with two-wheel tractor mounted planters and animal-drawn direct seeding equipment is constrained by weed management issues. There are problems of availability and of safe and effective use of herbicides by resource-poor farmers and there is a need to develop more integrated weed management strategies that can be combined with small-scale planters. There is also a need to optimize the performance of small-scale planters to suit farmers’ needs in different agro-ecological environments. Tools and concepts are now available to implement conservation agriculture for small holders and thereby increase profitability of their cropping practices and at the same time improve soil quality and sustainability of their livelihoods. However, much more adaptive research and on-farm evaluation is needed across a diverse range of soils, cropping systems and agro-ecological regions to bring conservation agriculture to more small holders.

The \{DH\} lines were grouped into four categories based on the \{HSI\} and around 5–10% lines were categorized as heat tolerant. A few lines yielded significantly more than the better parent and possessed good expression of other traits.

A large area of land in the Middle and Lower Gangetic Plains of South Asia remains either uncultivated or underused following the rice harvest in the kharif (wet) season. The area includes “rice-fallow,” estimated at 6.7 million ha, flood-prone riversides (“diara lands,” 2.4 million ha), waterlogged areas (4.9 million ha), and salt-affected soils (2.3 million ha). Bringing these lands under production could substantially improve the food supply and enhance livelihoods in the region. This paper describes a methodological case study that targeted resource-conserving technologies in underused lands of the Ballia District of eastern Uttar Pradesh (India) using multispectral remote-sensing images. Classification of temporal satellite data IRS-P6 in combination with Spot \{VGT\} 2 permitted the identification of all major categories of underused land during the post-rainy rabi/winter season, with an average accuracy of 89%. Based on three-year averages of field demonstrations, farmers gained an additional income of $63 ha−1 by introducing raised beds in salt-affected soils; $140 and $800 ha−1 by introducing deepwater rice varieties (monsoon) and boro rice (winter) in waterlogged areas; and $581 ha−1 by introducing zero-till lentil (winter) in rain-fed fallow lowland. Timely wheat planting through zero-tillage implies an additional income of $147 ha−1 and could increase wheat production by 35,000–65,000 tons in the district. The methodologies and technologies suggested in the study are applicable to more than 15 million ha of underutilized lands of the Indo-Gangetic Plains of South Asia. If the technologies are precisely applied, they can result in more than 3000 million \{US\} $ of additional income every year to these poverty prone areas. "

Three major factors influencing mass spectra—the ratio of components of the solvent, the resolving time, and the sample volume—were optimized using HMW-GS mixtures extracted from Chinese cultivar Jing 411. The results showed that the optimized method for sample preparation was to resolve HMW-GS from 20 mg in an hour with 50 μl solvent of 0.4% TFA, 30.0% \{ACN\} and 69.6% H2O. The stable mass spectra and accurate molecular weights of 16 major \{HMW\} glutenin subunits from common wheat and related species were obtained using the optimized MALDI-TOF-MS method. Seven subunits, where each was from 2–5 cultivars, showed very similar molecular weights. The determined molecular weights of 11 subunits were close to those calculated from their coding sequences. In addition, no positive reaction between HMW-GS and GelCode® Glycoprotein Staining Reagent was observed. These results suggested that HMW-GS lack extensive post-translational modifications (PTMs), but low levels of glycosylation or phosphorylation present in some subunits cannot be ruled out. Because of its ability to obtain a rapid, complete and precise profile of \{HMW\} glutenin subunits without purifying procedures, MALDI-TOF-MS is expected to be a powerful technique for structural and functional studies of \{HMW\} glutenin subunits as well as other cereal proteins.

The process can, however, alter the sensory characteristics of the crop, and consumer acceptance is essential for their adoption. The oldest biofortified crop is quality protein maize (QPM), biofortified with essential amino acids, a trait now incorporated in many recently-released varieties in East Africa. To estimate rural consumers’ acceptance and willingness to pay (WTP) for \{QPM\} in the dispersed population of Northern Tanzania, a novel method, combining a modified home-use test with a Becker–DeGroot–Marschak experiment, was developed. The results showed that rural consumers in Tanzania could distinguish stiff porridge made from \{QPM\} and from conventional maize (CM). They generally preferred the former, as expressed by higher scores during affective tests for texture, taste, and overall qualities. Further, rural consumers who were not provided with information about the nutritional benefits of \{QPM\} were willing to pay a premium of 16% over CM, and those who were given information, 39%. The scores on the affective test and the information on QPM’s nutritional benefits were the main factors determining \{WTP\} in the experiment, while no personal characteristics of the participants were found to be significant. We conclude that \{QPM\} is, at least, as well accepted as conventional maize, and preferred for its sensory characteristics. Information on nutritional benefits increases rural consumers’ willingness to pay for it, so information campaigns may be effective in increasing demand for \{QPM\} varieties. However, these varieties need to be competitive for other characteristics that rural households value, in particular, field and storage qualities. "

It was present in cultivars with good pan bread-making quality, whereas most cultivars with poor bread-making quality lacked this protein peak. Quality testing and statistical analysis showed that this ω-gliadin peak was significantly related to dough strength, loaf volume and loaf score. It was separated into two apparent protein components by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). According to their relative mobilities on the gels, the proteins were designated ω-15 and ω-16, and their accurate molecular masses (42590.5 Da for ω-15 and 41684.1 Da for ω-16) were determined by MALDI-TOF-MS. The ω-15 and ω-16 gliadins possessed the N-terminal amino acid sequences of \{ARELNPSNKELQQQQ\} and KELQSPQQQF, and therefore they belonged to 1D-encoded ω-2 type and ω-1 type gliadins, respectively. Both gliadin subunits were always present together among the 86 cultivars analyzed, suggesting that they were encoded by two closely linked genes at Gli-D1 locus.

This allowed the development of a set of PCR-based markers for specific \{HMW\} glutenin genes encoding By-subunits for which no markers were previously available. Markers were validated using test cultivars containing specific Glu-B1 alleles confirmed by SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC analysis. Among the specific markers developed, primer pair ZSBy8F5/R5 was specific for the By8 gene, which exists in Glu-B1b (Bx7+By8) and Glu-B1u (Bx7*+By8) alleles. This marker allows discrimination of alleles containing By8 and By8* that are usually difficult to distinguish using SDS-PAGE. Since the over-expressed Glu-B1 allele (Glu-Bl al.) contains the By8* subunit, it is possible to use this marker in breeding programs for selecting for the over-expression of subunit Bx7 in crosses that segregate between normal Bx7 and over-expressed Bx7 subunits. This marker also represents an alternative for distinguishing two common Glu-B1 alleles: Glu-B1i (Bx17+By18) and Glu-B1b (Bx7+By8). Two primer pairs ZSBy9aF1/R3 and ZSBy9F7/R6 both gave characteristic banding patterns for Glu-B1c (Bx7+By9) and can therefore be used to discriminate By9 - containing alleles from non - By9 alleles.

However, the specific effect of individual Glu-3 alleles is not well understood due to their complex protein banding patterns in SDS-PAGE and tight linkage with gliadins at the Gli-1 locus. Using \{DNA\} markers and a backcross program, we developed a set of nine near isogenic lines (NILs) including different Glu-A3/Gli-A1 or Glu-B3/Gli-B1 alleles in the genetic background of the Argentine variety ProINTA Imperial. The nine \{NILs\} and the control were evaluated in three different field trials in Argentina. Significant genotype-by-environment interactions were detected for most quality parameters indicating that the effects of the Glu-3/Gli-1 alleles are modulated by environmental differences. None of the \{NILs\} showed differences in total flour protein content, but relative changes in the abundance of particular classes of proteins cannot be ruled out. On average, the Glu-A3f, Glu-B3b, Glu-B3g and Glu-B3iMan alleles were associated with the highest values in gluten strength-related parameters, while Glu-A3e, Glu-B3a and Glu-B3iChu were consistently associated with weak gluten and low quality values. The value of different Glu-3/Gli-1 allele combinations to improve breadmaking quality is discussed. "

The ratio between the two polymers (usually 22–35% amylose, 68–75% amylopectin) affects the starch properties, thereby determining different aspects of wheat quality. Waxy protein, which is the sole enzyme responsible for amylose synthesis, showed polymorphism in a collection of one hundred and three Mexican landraces, including null alleles at Wx-A1 and Wx-B1 loci, respectively. Molecular characterization of these alleles showed that the null Wx-A1 allele presented in only one accession was novel (Wx-A1o) and involved a deletion spanning the three and a half last exons of the gene. Some of the accessions lacking the Wx-B1 protein contained the common allele Wx-B1b (12.6%) (deletion of approximately 67 kb), while four others (3.8%) possessed the novel Wx-B1l, characterized by the deletion of one cytosine in the second exon of the gene and leading to a change in the ORF. This novel allele is particularly interesting because the absence of the Wx-B1 protein in this case was not associated with the lack of the other genes included in the approximately 67 kb region lost with the common null allele Wx-B1b.

Under no stress conditions, rapid small-scale parameters [protein (GP; FP) content, \{SDS\} sedimentation (SDSS), mixograph peak time (MPT), swelling index of glutenin (SIG), and lactic acid retention capacity (LARC)] showed significant relationship with gluten strength (alveograph energy, W) and bread loaf volume (LV). \{SIG\} and \{LARC\} were better than \{SDSS\} and \{MPT\} for predicting W, while \{SDSS\} was better than W and \{SIG\} for predicting bread LV. Most quality traits were primarily controlled by genotype (G), although environment (E) and G × E also had significant effects. Heat and drought stress showed contrasting effects on LARC, MPT, alveograph parameters [tenacity (P), extensibility (L), P/L ratio, W] and LV. Increase in P and decrease in L resulted in higher tenacity (larger P/L), which may explain the smaller loaf volume under drought stress. In contrast, decrease in P and increase in L, may explain the improved bread volume observed under heat stress. It is advisable to select for wheat quality under both favorable and abiotic stress conditions to identify genotypes with quality stability across environments. "

Considerable variation was observed in free and bound phenolic acids, and their components in flours with different extraction rates. Most phenolic acids, including the component ferulic, were present in the bound form (94.0%). Ferulic (51.0%) was the predominant phenolic acid in wheat grain, and caffeic (22.8%) and p-coumaric (17.6%) acids were abundant. The phenolic acids and their components were all significantly influenced by effects of cultivar, milling, location, and cultivar × milling interaction, with milling effect being the predominant. The proportions of phenolic compounds varied considerably among milling extractions and cultivars, and their levels depended on both initial grain concentrations and on selection of milling extraction that was incorporated into the final product. The grain phenolic acid concentrations determined ranged from 54 μg g−1 in flour produced at 60% extraction rate to 695 μg g−1 in flour produced at 100% extraction rate, indicating their higher concentrations in bran associated with cell wall materials.

Allelic variations of puroindolines and glutenins were determined in all the genotypes evaluated. Both puroindoline and gluten protein alleles corresponded to genotypes possessing medium to very good bread making quality. Large variability for most quality attributes evaluated was observed, with wider ranges in quality parameters across environments than among genotypes; even for parameters known to be largely determined by genotype. The importance of growing environment on grain quality was proved, suggesting that breeders’ quality objectives should be adapted to the targeted environments. "

Factors studied included relay or simultaneous planting of maize or intercrops, ridge and flat planting systems and in-row or between-row planting of intercrops. Mode of planting maize and intercrops (ridge/flat or in/between row planting) did not affect maize grain yield. However, ridge planting improved intercrop yields and reduced Striga densities. Peanut, bean, yellow gram, bambara nut and soybean intercrops produced considerable yields and increased the overall productivity of the cropping systems. The increase in output of farm produce ranged between 40% and 120% depending on the local agro-ecological conditions. Of the most productive intercrops, yellow gram provided the most stable Striga control over years and locations comparable only to cowpea. Peanut, bambara nut, bean and soybean were more variable in terms of Striga suppression in maize depending on the specific agro-ecological conditions. Shading, higher humidity and lower temperatures under the intercrop canopies were most likely the mechanisms which caused the decline of Striga numbers in intercropping systems. Intercropping can be an effective component of an integrated Striga control program compatible with the limited resources of small-scale subsistence farmers. In the long term, however, Striga populations can only diminish if intercropping is combined with handweeding of mature Striga plants to avoid the replenishment of the Striga seed bank in the soil.

One field study and two laboratory/incubation studies were performed in a natural herbaceous savanna and a Brachiaria decumbens and Pueraria phaseoloides pasture. In the laboratory, experiment pots were prepared containing soil collected from the respective field paddock's topsoil. Total P content was higher in earthworm casts than in the surrounding soil in field samples, 50% in native savanna soil and more than 100% in pasture soil. In casts produced under laboratory conditions this increase was relatively low (10–20%). Under field conditions, almost without exception, all P fractions were increased in casts relative to the original soil (corresponding to the increase in total P content), being relatively greater in the labile inorganic P fractions. In addition, samples from the natural savanna showed that pH of casts was higher (5.2) than that of soil (4.6) in both field and laboratory samples. Except in the native savanna under field conditions, the phosphatase activity was reduced in casts by 16.7 to 44%.

Little, however, is known how heavy metals might affect the biological functioning of a soil. Soil was sampled from eight locations along a gradient of heavy-metal contamination with distance from a mine in San Luis Potosí (Mexico) active since about 1800 AD. Microbial biomass was determined with the original chloroform fumigation incubation (CFI) as well as extraction (CFE) techniques and the substrate induced respiration (SIR) technique while C and N mineralization were measured.

Breeding for P uptake and P utilization efficiency may reduce this problem. This study was conducted to determine the contribution of P uptake and utilization efficiency to grain yield of selected spring wheat genotypes in different environments. Thirty-eight semidwarf spring bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) genotypes were grown in two experiments in Mexico, each on an acid Andisol under rainfed conditions and on a calcareous Aridisol with irrigation, without (−P) and with 35 kg P per ha fertilized (+P). Without P fertilization, grain yield ranged from 0.8 to 4.6 t ha−1 in the acid soil and from 2.4 to 5.2 t ha−1 in the calcareous soil. With P fertilization, this range was even larger. Under conditions of P deficiency, i.e. in the acid soil at −P and +P (high P adsorption) and calcareous soil at −P (P-depleted soil), P uptake explained 71–100% of the variation in grain yield, and was highly correlated with grain yield (r=0.79–0.95). In contrast, at +P in the calcareous soil, P utilization efficiency explained 60–63% of the variation in grain yield. Here, low grain P concentration was related to high grain yield (r=−0.40 to −0.59). In the calcareous soil, the harvest index was correlated with grain yield, irrespective of the P level. In the acid soil, post-anthesis P accumulation was important. It was positively correlated with grain yield, whereas in the calcareous soil, no post-anthesis-P accumulation occurred. Here, grain P accumulation at maturity was completely determined by translocation of pre-anthesis shoot P. We conclude that the combination of improved P uptake and P utilization efficiency in the same genotypes requires selection under both high and low-P conditions. "

Remote sensing offers great potential for monitoring regional production, yet the uncertainties associated with large-scale yield estimates are rarely addressed. In this study, we estimated crop area, yield, and planting dates for 2 years of Landsat imagery in an intensive agricultural region in northwest Mexico. Knowledge of crop phenology was combined with multi-temporal imagery to estimate crop rotations throughout the region. Remotely sensed estimates of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) were then incorporated into a simple model based on crop light-use efficiency to predict yield and planting dates for wheat. Uncertainty analysis revealed that regional yield predictions varied up to 20% with the method used to determine fAPAR from satellite, but were relatively insensitive to modeled variability in crop phenology, light-use efficiency, and harvest index (the ratio of grain mass to aboveground biomass). Comparisons of satellite-based and field-based estimates indicated errors in regional wheat yields of less than 4% for both years of data. In contrast, planting date calculations exhibited uncertainties of up to 50% using a sparse, three-date sampling from satellite-based sensors. A simplified model was also developed to explore yield predictions using only one date of imagery, demonstrating high accuracies depending on the date of image acquisition. The spatial and temporal distributions of crop production derived here offer valuable information for agricultural management and biogeochemical modeling efforts, provided that their uncertainties are well understood.

The model is then used to quantify the potential value of these forecasts with respect to wheat yields, farmer profits, and excess N application. Under the current scenario (i.e. no diagnostics), uncertainty in soil and climate conditions is shown to account for an average over-application of N by roughly 35%. Both soil diagnostics and climate forecasts are shown to increase profits significantly and decrease over-application of N, with minimal changes in yield. Soil variability is roughly three times as important as climate variations in terms of potential impact on profits in this region. The model was also used to simulate the effect of increases in fertilizer price, which have similar positive effects on excess N application but negative impacts on profits. Finally, the role of forecast uncertainty was evaluated, indicating that even limited information on soil or climate can be a useful input to management decisions. Future work is needed to improve operational diagnostics of soil N and growing season climate, whose cost can then be compared to benefits calculated in this study to determine their net value to N management decisions.

The objective of this study was to assess the Al resistance of open pollinated tropical maize cultivars, from widely differing origin, and their diallel crosses based on callose formation as a physiological marker, and study the inheritance and combining ability for Al resistance. Fifteen maize cultivars from 4 maize breeding programmes and their 105 crosses were grown under controlled environmental conditions in a growth chamber and treated without or with 25 μM Al at pH 4.3. After 12 h of Al treatment, callose contents of 1 cm root apices were determined. There was a significant genotypic variation in callose formation under Al stress. Furthermore, diallel analysis indicated a significant general combining ability (GCA) but not specific combining ability (SCA), indicating that Al resistance is mainly controlled by additive genes. In general, Al-resistant cultivars showed favourable \{GCA\} effects while the sensitive cultivars had unfavourable \{GCA\} effects clearly indicating the dominant role of Al-resistant cultivars in the development or improvement of Al-resistant maize varieties. Moreover, a relatively high heritability (h2 = 0.7) was obtained for Al resistance in nutrient solution. Aluminium resistance as revealed by callose content in Al-treated root apices was positively correlated to the relative grain yield of the same crosses evaluated across five tropical environments. In addition, strong genetic correlation was observed as \{GCA\} of callose formation in nutrient solution closely correlated with \{GCA\} of yield on acid soils. These findings suggest that Al-induced callose formation is a powerful tool to enhance the breeding of maize cultivars with superior adaptation to acid and Al-toxic soils. "

Screening was conducted under controlled conditions in greenhouse and field conditions, and indicators of early vigour, including shoot length, shoot biomass, leaf area, number of roots, root biomass, partitioning coefficients, and growth rates, were measured. Phenotypic correlations suggested that traits that were related and combined could be used to define early vigour. Broad-sense heritability ranged from moderate to high. Many regions were identified containing more than one QTL, suggesting that these traits were controlled by pleiotropic and/or closely linked QTLs. Many \{QTLs\} were specific to one environment but G × E interaction analysis showed that the main effects of the environment were large. Differences in temperature between experiments resulted in large differences in seedling age when expressed in thermal time. Different genes (QTLs) may be expected to control growth at different time intervals and thus may partly explain the limited agreement between experiments. However, several regions showed co-location of \{QTLs\} from more than one experiment. Comparisons with published studies revealed that these regions were previously identified in different genetic backgrounds and could potentially be used as introgression targets in a marker-assisted breeding program to improve germplasm for direct-seeded environments.

End-of-season yield results do not permit the evaluation of within-season management interactions with the production environment and do not allow for full understanding of the management practice applied. Crop growth and development were measured during the 2004, 2006 and 2008 crop cycles with an optical handheld \{NDVI\} sensor for all plots of the different management treatments of a long-term (since 1991) sustainability trial in the highlands of Mexico. Cropping systems varying in (1) tillage (conventional vs. zero tillage); (2) residue management (retention vs. removal); (3) rotation (monocropping vs. a maize [Zea mays L.]/wheat [Triticum aestivum L.] rotation) were compared. The NDVI-handheld sensor was evaluated as a tool to monitor crop growth and development and was found to be an excellent tool for this purpose. There was a strong relation between \{NDVI\} and biomass accumulation of maize and wheat. The measurement with the handheld sensor was non-destructive and fast so that a representative plot area could be measured easily and time-efficiently. Zero tillage induced different crop growth dynamics over time compared to conventional tillage. Zero tillage with residue retention is characterized by a slower initial crop growth, compensated for by an increased growth in the later stages, positively influencing final grain yield. Also crop rotation influenced early crop growth, with lower \{NDVI\} values for crops sown after wheat than crops after maize. Zero tillage with residue removal had low \{NDVI\} values throughout the growing season. Zero tillage with retention of crop residues results in time efficient use of resources, as opposed to conventional tillage, regardless of residue management, and zero tillage with residue removal. The results indicated that different tillage, rotation and residue management practices influence crop growth and development. It is important to monitor and understand crop growth under different management systems to select the right varieties and adjust timing and practice of input supply (fertilizer, irrigation etc.) in a holistic way in each cropping system.

In Northwest India, the stagnation of wheat yields over the past decade presents a distressing contrast to the tremendous yield gains achieved during the Green Revolution. One commonly proposed way to raise yields is to reduce the often considerable gap between yield potential and average yields realized in farmers’ fields, yet the likely effectiveness of different strategies to close this gap has been poorly known. Here we use a unique, decade long satellite-based dataset on wheat yields to examine various options for closing the yield gap in the south of Punjab. Persistent spatial differences in sowing dates and distance from canal are found to be significant sources of yield variation, with the latter factor suggesting the importance of reliable access to irrigation water for yield improvement in this region. However, the total yield gains achievable by addressing persistent factors are only a small fraction of yield losses in farmers’ fields. The majority of the yield gap is found to arise from factors unrelated to field location, such as interactions between management and weather. Technologies that improve farmers’ ability to anticipate or adjust to weather variations, or that improve stability of genotype performance across different weather conditions, therefore appear crucial if average crop yields are to approach their genetic potential.

A study was conducted over three seasons to evaluate different species of indigenous legumes for their biomass productivity, N2-fixation and residual effects on subsequent maize crops on nutrient-depleted fields belonging to smallholder farmers under contrasting rainfall zones in Zimbabwe. Under high rainfall (&gt;800 mm yr−1), 1-year indigenous legume fallows (indifallows), comprising mostly species of the genera Crotalaria, Indigofera and Tephrosia, yielded 8.6 t ha−1 of biomass within 6 months, out-performing sunnhemp (Crotalaria juncea L.) green manure and grass (natural) fallows by 41% and 74%, respectively. A similar trend was observed under medium (650–750 mm yr−1) rainfall in Chinyika, where the indifallow attained a biomass yield of 6.6 t ha−1 compared with 2.2 t ha−1 for natural fallows. Cumulatively, over two growing seasons, the indifallow treatment under high rainfall at Domboshawa produced biomass as high as 28 t ha−1 compared with ∼7 t ha−1 under natural fallow. The mean total \{N2\} fixed under indifallows ranged from 125 kg ha−1 under soils exhibiting severe nutrient depletion in Chikwaka, to 205 kg ha−1 at Domboshawa. Indifallow biomass accumulated up to 210 kg N ha−1, eleven-fold higher than the N contained in corresponding natural fallow biomass at time of incorporation. Application of P to indifallows significantly increased both biomass productivity and N2-fixation, translating into positive yield responses by subsequent maize. Differences in maize biomass productivity between indifallow and natural fallow treatments were already apparent at 2 weeks after maize emergence, with the former yielding significantly (P &lt; 0.05) more maize biomass than the latter. The first maize crop following termination of 1-year indifallows yielded grain averaging 2.3 t ha−1, significantly out-yielding 1-year natural fallows by &gt;1 t ha−1. In the second season, maize yields were consistently better under indifallows compared with natural fallows in terms of both grain and total biomass. The first maize crop following 2-year indifallows yielded ∼3 t ha−1 of grain, significantly higher than the second maize crop after 1-year indifallows and natural fallows. The study demonstrated that indigenous legumes can generate N-rich biomass in sufficient quantities to make a significant influence on maize productivity for more than a single season. Maize yield gains under indifallow systems on low fertility sandy soils exceeded the yields attained with either mineral fertilizer alone or traditional green manure crop of sunnhemp. "

Although remarkable success has been achieved to date in developing widely adapted wheat cultivars, many resource poor farmers in marginal areas in developing world have not benefited. Participatory research could greatly enhance identifying cultivars according to the choice of the poor farmers. This study was conducted to examine how farmers’ selection criteria could assist breeders in identifying superior wheat cultivars, and determine if a new statistical analysis tool, \{GGE\} biplot, could be effectively used in selection of improved cultivar based on quantitative (grain yield) and qualitative data (farmers’ preference score). The field experiments were conducted in 3 years (2003–2005) in three mid-hill districts in the central Nepal involving resource poor wheat farmers. Sixteen wheat genotypes, including a long-term and a current commercial cultivar, were used in the study. Data were collected on agronomic traits considered important by the participating farmers. These included days to heading and maturity, plant height, effective tiller number, spike length, kernel per spike, 1000-kernel weight and grain yield. Farmers also qualitatively scored each genotype for multiple traits based on their preference. In general, the farmers used the same traits in selecting a superior cultivar that are used by breeders. However, relative importance of different traits differed, not necessarily following in line with the breeder preference. The cultivar superiority based on quantitative agronomic data (breeders’ criteria) and qualitative preference scores (farmers’ criteria) often showed synergies, however, there were differences as well. This indicates farmers’ ability to choose superior cultivars based on qualitative observation compared to tedious quantitative data recording in the on-station testing. In the first year, a greater number of farmers selected improved check as a better choice than recent advanced breeding lines. In the 2nd and 3rd years, the farmers preferred genotypes other than the checks. This underlines the importance of testing of advanced materials in farmers’ fields in multiple years. Principal component analysis using GGE-biplot was useful in identifying superior genotypes based on both quantitative and qualitative data recorded across environments. This approach could be useful in analyzing data from participatory agricultural research conducted under highly diverse farmers’ field conditions where it is easier to record observations on qualitative than quantitative scale. This technique can also be extended to on-farm participatory testing of other technologies. The findings bear implications for a broad range of participatory research and technology evaluation and verification. "

Findings from farm surveys are used to evaluate the on-farm impacts of zero tillage (ZT) wheat in the rice–wheat systems of India's Haryana state and Pakistan's Punjab province. ZT-induced effects primarily apply to the establishment and production costs of the wheat crop. Both study sites confirmed significant ZT-induced resource-saving effects in farmers’ fields in terms of diesel, tractor time and cost savings for wheat cultivation. Water savings are, however, less pronounced than expected from on-farm trial data. It was only in Haryana, India that there were significant ZT-induced water savings in addition to significant yield enhancement. The higher yield and water savings in Haryana, India result in significantly higher water productivity indicators for \{ZT\} wheat. In both sites, there are limited implications for the overall wheat crop management, the subsequent rice crop and the rice–wheat system as a whole. The combination of a significant “yield effect” and “cost-saving effect” makes adoption worthwhile and provide a much needed boost to the returns to wheat cultivation in Haryana, India. In Punjab, Pakistan, \{ZT\} is primarily a cost-saving technology for wheat cultivation. The prime driver for \{ZT\} adoption is not water savings or natural resource conservation but monetary gain in both sites. Water savings are only a potential added benefit. "

The testing of \{BG\} 1442 commenced 11 years after it was first introduced into Nepal in 1987 by the national rice research programme (NRRP). Following its initial acceptance by farmers, it was widely disseminated from 1998 by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the low altitude region of Nepal called the terai in projects funded by the Department for International Development (DFID), UK. This dissemination was done using a method termed informal research and development (IRD) where many small packets of seed were distributed without fertiliser or pesticides, the only additional input being a description of varietal characteristics on an enclosed leaflet. From 2001 to 2008, various assessments were made of its extent of adoption and its impact on livelihoods. In a randomised survey of households in 10 districts, \{BG\} 1442 increased from not being used at all in 1997 to being grown by about 20% of the surveyed rice farmers by 2008. It was grown both in the Chaite and the main season and was well adapted to the rainfed-upland and medium-land rice ecosystems. The variety was grown from the far west to the far east of low-altitude Nepal by resource-poor farmers. \{IRD\} was important in accelerating adoption and improving food security as it was by far the most important external source of seed for farmers. Prior to the adoption of \{BG\} 1442, farmers who did not harvest sufficient rice to last their households for 12 months increased rice self sufficiency by over 2 months (25% more). Those households that sold surplus grain and who grew \{BG\} 1442 increased grain sales by 600 kg (25% more) in the Chaite season and by 370 kg (24% more) from main season cultivation. Compared with the conventional on-station variety testing and release, \{PVS\} can significantly reduce the time needed for testing and increase the benefits from plant breeding. However, the greatest impact of using more client-oriented approaches was not from \{PVS\} but from the subsequent \{IRD\} given that it was the major source of seed resulting in its wide use by 2008. This popularity certainly influenced the decision by the national programme to eventually release the variety. This demonstrated how the extent of adoption could be a useful criterion for release, particularly when experimental data has previously failed to establish the superiority of a variety. The benefits from using \{PVS\} and, particularly, \{IRD\} were very large as they reduced the time needed for variety testing and popularization and hence reduced the time needed to improve food security. However, \{NGOs\} cannot sustainably finance the use of \{IRD\} and if it is to become a routine part of the national research and extension system then government needs to change policies to routinely use \{PVS\} and IRD. The regulatory framework needs to pay more attention to farmers’ preferences and make the process of official release or registration simpler and faster. The diversion to \{NGOs\} of some of the resources currently allocated solely to governmental organisations would allow \{NGOs\} to participate sustainably in varietal testing and dissemination. "

In this study, grain yield of 300 maize testcrosses grown under different water and temperature regimes in the dry season 2010 was predicted using spectral reflectance (495–1853 nm) of both leaves and canopy measured between tassel emergence until milk-grain stage. Partial least square regression (PLSR) was used for data analysis. Coefficients of determination (R2) between predicted and actual grain yield were highest for measurements conducted at anthesis and milk-grain stage, explaining at maximum 23% and 40% of the genotypic variation in grain yield after validation, respectively. \{PLSR\} models explained a higher proportion of the genetic variation in grain yield under drought stress compared to well-watered conditions. The association between predicted and actual grain yield was stronger in spectral reflectance measurements taken at the leaf level compared to canopy level. By combining the most predictive \{PLSR\} models across trials, at maximum of 40% of the variation in grain yield could be explained in each trial with a relative efficiency of selection of 0.88 and 0.68 using leaf and canopy reflectance, respectively. The most relevant wavelengths for predicting grain yield were associated with photosynthetic capacity (495–680 nm), red inflection point (680–780 nm) and plant water status (900, 970, and 1450 nm, 1150–1260 nm, and 1520–1540 nm). Additional wavelengths based on leaf (800, 1000, and 1260–1830 nm) and canopy (988–999 nm and 1430–1640 nm) reflectance of unknown physiological relevance were also identified for prediction of grain yield. Caution must be exercised before integrating our spectral reflectance approach into a breeding program because this is a pilot study based on a single location and season. "

Governments in the Sahel are responding by promoting double-cropping of irrigated rice in the region's river basins, although rising fertilizer and water costs cast doubt on the future profitability of such systems. Despite controversy, the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is widely promoted as a potential solution to this dilemma. \{SRI\} includes transplanting young, single seedlings at wide spacing, compost application, mechanical weed control, and alternate wetting and drying irrigation. However, independent evaluation of the system in comparison to an appropriate control is lacking in SSA, and the Sahel in particular. Responding to this need, we compared \{SRI\} to flooded rice production following regionally Recommended Management Practices (RMP), in a five-season experiment in the Senegal River Valley. Our objectives were to evaluate yield, water productivity, fertilizer nitrogen recovery efficiency, partial macronutrient balances and soil quality under both management systems. But because compost production in the Sahel is constrained by low labor and biomass availability, we replaced these materials with waste rice straw, and compared the impact of sole mineral fertilizer application to rice straw residue incorporation with fertilizer addition, under both \{SRI\} and RMP. In seasons 1–3, fertilizer alone significantly increased yield, with no differences found between management systems. In season 4, beneficial effects of straw incorporation and fertilizer addition were observed, as significant additive increases in yield, straw and fertilizer nitrogen recovery were found for each management system. In season 5, additive benefits were found only for SRI, although \{SRI\} yields never exceeded any fertility management treatment under RMP. Across seasons, water savings from 16% to 48% were obtained with SRI, resulting in significant (11%–45%) increases in water productivity. Combined straw incorporation and fertilizer application helped stabilize partial nitrogen and potassium balances across management systems. Compared to controls, straw incorporation also increased total soil nitrogen and carbon. In contrast to the literature on \{SRI\} in the Sahel, our findings indicate that when nutrient additions are held constant, significant yield increases should not be expected over conventionally recommended rice crop management systems. However, should farmers choose to experiment with \{SRI\} to reduce water use, they would be most likely to benefit from combining rice straw incorporation with mineral fertilizer, although several seasons may be required for additive yield effects to occur.

Such \{CA\} practices aim at maximizing profits while making a better use of soil and water resources lowering labor demands, farm power and production costs. The \{CA\} experiments with rice–wheat systems combined two establishment methods (beds and flats) with three residue levels (all zero tillage) and with alternate wet and dry (AWD) irrigation followed by surface seeded wheat (SSW); and conventional tillage (dry tillage) and continuously flooded rice (water seeded rice, WSR) followed by SSW. These were evaluated for 2 years (2008–2010) by using several financial indicators such as gross margins (GMs) estimates and benefit/cost ratio (BCR) while accounting for the soil water balance and soil salinity dynamics. The \{GM\} and \{BCR\} were higher under WSR–SSW than under treatments of dry seeded rice (DSR)–SSW. Both were higher under residue removal compared to residue retainments in DSR-SSW. Surface seeded wheat, which involved minor production costs, yielded &gt;6 t ha−1 in both years in all treatments. Furthermore, &gt;80% of the total irrigation water was applied to rice. Yet, &gt;90% from WSR–SSW and ∼67% from DSR–SSW were lost through seepage and percolation. Dry seeded rice in bed (DSRB)–SSW saved 15% more irrigation water compared to dry seeded rice in flat (DSRF)–SSW and 67% compared to WSR–SSW. Soil salinity decreased with rice cultivation. After 2 years, WSR–SSW had the lowest while residue-removed DSRB–SSW had the highest salinity level at all soil depths. Groundwater salinity under deep groundwater tables was higher under treatments of DSR–SSW than under WSR–SSW. However, under shallow groundwater tables, groundwater salinity was higher under WSR–SSW than under DSR–SSW. Under the conditions that irrigation water is subsidized or even free of charge, conventional WSR–SSW into the standing rice field (20 days before rice harvest) is the most profitable option. However, under water scarce conditions, the \{CA\} based rice–wheat system could be a suitable alternative to cope with water scarcity and secondary soil salinization. Before this crop production system can be advocated and promoted, it needs to be flanked by adequate water pricing policies. "

Given the increasing availability of geographic information systems (GISs) and spatial data, one might anticipate widespread use of maps, reference to geographic variation, and analyses that capitalize on the power of GIS. Such use would be reflected in improved selection of research sites or treatments, better understanding of the influence of climatic or edaphic factors on crop responses, and more easily interpretable, quantitative results presented through maps. With the notable exception of research on individual fields or local landscapes, however, published research indicated insufficient use of spatial information and analyses or even explicit consideration of the geographical context of research. To assess use of geographic information in agronomic research, we examined papers in five prominent agricultural journals for evidence of analyses at a spatial scale smaller than field plots or local landscapes but larger than national or continental levels, which we term “mesoscale”. Use of simulation models was also examined since models can quantify response to environmental factors and thus, their use might provide instructive comparisons with use of spatial analyses. Of 250 papers considered, less than half (119 papers) described the geographic context of the research, and only 90 gave geographic coordinates with sufficient precision to locate sites within a 10 km radius. Only six papers included maps of the study area. Over 150 papers used single locations, and just 26 papers, more than four sites. In experiments creating variation in soil conditions, such as through irrigation, tillage, or nutrient treatments, the limited number of treatment combinations appeared to constrain quantitative interpretation of results. Most papers involving simulation models focused on model development or validation; models were seldom used to analyze effects of climatic or edaphic conditions as a complement to other lines of research. We conclude that there is need to increase the geographic relevance of agronomic research. Suggested steps include selecting sites using an explicit sampling strategy, using larger numbers of sites, and analyzing and presenting results using tools such as \{GIS\} and crop or ecosystem simulation models.

A different set of lines was evaluated each season, as new materials became available from the \{CIMMYT\} crop enhancement program. These consisted of approximately 100 advanced lines (F7) per year. \{SBWs\} had been top and backcrossed to \{CIMMYT\} cultivars in the first two shipments and to Australian wheat cultivars in the third one. At CIANO, the \{SBWs\} were trialled under receding soil moisture conditions. We evaluated both the performance of each line across all environments and the genotype-by-environment interaction using an analysis that fits a multiplicative mixed model, adjusted for spatial field trends. Data were organised in three groups of multienvironment trials (MET) containing germplasm from shipment 1 (METShip1), 2 (METShip2), and 3 (METShip3), respectively. Large components of variance for the genotype × environment interaction were found for each \{MET\} analysis, due to the diversity of environments included and the limited replication over years (only in METShip2, lines were tested over 2 years). The average percentage of genetic variance explained by the factor analytic models with two factors was 50.3% for METShip1, 46.7% for METShip2, and 48.7% for METShip3. Yield comparison focused only on lines that were present in all locations within a METShip, or “core” SBWs. A number of core SBWs, crossed to both Australian and \{CIMMYT\} backgrounds, outperformed the local benchmark checks at sites from the northern end of the Australian wheat belt, with reduced success at more southern locations. In general, lines that succeeded in the north were different from those in the south. The moderate positive genetic correlation between \{CIANO\} and locations in the northern wheat growing region likely reflects similarities in average temperature during flowering, high evaporative demand, and a short flowering interval. We are currently studying attributes of this germplasm that may contribute to adaptation, with the aim of improving the selection process in both Mexico and Australia. "

The term highly client-oriented breeding (COB) explains the purpose of farmer involvement – the deliberate achievement of a high degree of client orientation – rather than simply explaining the process of farmers participating in plant breeding (participatory plant breeding). Client-oriented breeding is sometimes based on the preferences of relatively few farmers in a small area, so a possible drawback is that it will produce varieties that are too locally adapted. We describe the testing of varieties in the High Barind Tract (HBT) of Bangladesh from a \{COB\} programme carried out in Chitwan district, Nepal. The two best lines, Judi 582 and Judi 567, yielded 19–50% more during the T. Aman season and 106% more during the Aus season than check varieties in the HBT. Research to determine farmers’ preferences and adoption consistently showed these varieties were preferred over all available alternatives. The new varieties were broadly adapted as they were superior in all the three rice-growing seasons over varying levels of inputs. This broad adaptation could be explained by the breeding method: the generations were advanced in two contrasting seasons and each generation was grown on a different farmer's field under different management and planting dates. Because the segregating generations were grown under moderate and fluctuating levels of nitrogen, it is to be expected that genotypes with good nitrogen use efficiency will be selected that can also respond to added nitrogen. Overall, the cost-effectiveness of \{COB\} was high as it produced widely adapted genotypes from a small breeding programme, and knowledge of farmers’ preferences increased the efficiency of targeting new germplasm.

Permanent beds as a form of conservation tillage is an alternative planting system for grain production in this area. The planting system on permanent beds reduces the operational costs up to 40% and enhances physical and biological soil quality parameters. Research plots were established in the 1992 crop season to study the effect of conventional tilled-bed (CTB) with all plant residues incorporated versus permanent beds (PB) with four plant residue alternatives (all burned, removed, as stubble, and partially removed, maize stover removed and wheat straw retained). The objective of this work was to compare, after 10 and 12 years of plot establishment, the effect of \{CTB\} with \{PB\} management on biological and physical soil attributes during the wheat phase of the rotation. Results indicate that degree of soil aggregation, estimated by means of fractal dimension (D) from dry sieving, was comparable for CTB-all residues incorporated and PB-all residues retained as stubble. But the soil dispersion index, as shown by the numerical difference of D from wet and dry sieving (ΔD), was less for PB-all residues retained as stubble, indicating that soil aggregates are greater in size and more stable for this treatment. By contrast, soil aggregates from dry and wet sieving for PB-all residues burned were highly fractionated. The largest degree of dispersion between the wet and dry aggregate size distribution in all \{PB\} treatments was for the 1–2 mm soil fraction, while for the CTB-all residues incorporated, a constant and high degree of dispersion occurred to each of the soil fractions from 0.053 to 8 mm. The amount of C and N from microbial biomass for \{PB\} treatments was bigger, as the amount of crop residues left on the soil surface increased. Kernel weight from \{PB\} treatments was negatively related to the N mineralized from microbial biomass (r = −0.57 in 2002 and r = −0.39 in 2004). "

The highest distance was found between the cluster of Reid Yellow Dent related lines and the cluster of Lancaster Sure Crop related lines, and this pattern has produced some of the highest yielding hybrids in Iran. Other heterotic patterns based on the \{SSR\} markers are suggested, but must be field tested to confirm what appears to be promising alternative heterotic patterns. "

With increasing trend towards the development of hybrids in the tropics there is a need to understand the genetics of these traits in inbred–hybrid breeding systems. The objectives of this study were to estimate the general combining abilities for secondary traits and their relationship with \{GY\} in a group of tropical white inbred lines and their hybrids under stress and non-stress environments. Traits were measured in inbred lines and their hybrid combinations across stress and non-stress subtropical and tropical environments in México. Hybrids showed earlier flowering, taller plants, more ears per plant (EPP), higher shelling percentage, slower leaf senescence, and higher leaf chlorophyll content than inbreds under all environments. La Posta Sequı́a (LP)-derived inbreds in general had desirable \{GCA\} for traits such as anthesis–silking interval (ASI), EPP, and leaf senescence but were more susceptible to foliar diseases. Conventionally bred maize lines had better standability, stay green, and resistance to diseases. Higher \{GY\} in lines and hybrids was associated with shorter ASI, earlier flowering, increased plant and ear height, increased EPP, increased shelling percentage, delayed senescence, and greater leaf chlorophyll concentrations. Under stress vs. non-stress conditions, we observed a higher variability for \{ASI\} and EPP, a higher inbred–hybrid correlation, and significant correlations between these traits and GY. Inbreds from \{LP\} appear to have high frequency of favorable dominant alleles for \{ASI\} and EPP. "

Over the period 1991–1995 an experiment to test improved agronomy was carried out in the central highlands of Mexico, at El Batan (latitude 19°N, longitude 99°W, altitude 2250 m). Under rainfed conditions (mean annual rainfall 603 mm, one crop per year), binary rotations (with phased entry) of wheat–maize, wheat–vetch and wheat–medic pasture were compared with continuous wheat and maize; most rotations were tested under the four combinations of tillage (cultivated versus zero) and crop residue (retained versus harvested). All plots were split for nitrogen fertiliser, and appropriate herbicides were used for weed control. Wheat grain yields are reported here for the first two complete cycles of the binary rotations (1992–1995), which comprised two dry years and two wet ones. Continuous wheat yielded slightly better than wheat after maize (3679 kg/ha versus 3441 kg/ha at 10% moisture), while wheat after vetch fluctuated, being superior in the wetter years and inferior in drier ones, the latter effect associated with lower soil water and greater plant water stress. Wheat after medic was only tested under zero tillage, and was superior most years (4123 kg/ha), compared to vetch–wheat (3925 kg/ha), wheat–wheat (3658 kg/ha) and maize–wheat (3356 kg/ha). Part of the yield benefit of wheat after legumes could be attributed to a lower responsiveness of yield to nitrogen fertiliser. Overall yield was unaffected by tillage, although zero tillage was significantly higher in the drier 2 years. Besides, for wheat after vetch, zero tillage was consistently superior, especially in the drier years. Overall yield was unaffected by straw residue retention, but there was a significant increase in the driest year. Yield components, disease levels and weed counts are reported. Of significance was the greater level of tan spot in zero till residue-retained wheat after wheat and after maize, the greater number of weeds in zero till wheat after legume, and the suppressive effect of cereal residue on grass weeds. Maize yields and overall economic performance of the different systems are presented in a subsequent paper (Fischer et al., 2002). "

Over the period 1991–1995 an experiment was carried out in the central highlands of Mexico, at El Batan (latitude 19°31′N, longitude 98°50′W, altitude 2250 m) to test the effect of improved agronomy.

All plots were split for nitrogen fertilizer, and appropriate herbicides were used for weed control. Maize after wheat outyielded continuous maize under all conditions of tillage, residue and nitrogen fertilization. Within the maize–wheat rotation, zero tillage with residue retention was clearly superior (average yield across N levels of 5025 kg/ha at 10% moisture) to the other tillage-residue combinations (average 4249 kg/ha), and during dry periods, showed less wilting. With continuous maize, yield was especially poor with zero tillage regardless of residue (average 3113 kg/ha), and this was associated with poor early growth and variable stunting even under wet conditions and for which there is no clear explanation. Maize after vetch yielded well with zero tillage (4372 kg/ha), but poorly with cultivation (3128 kg/ha), possibly due to less soil water at sowing in the latter. The main treatment yield variation was associated with either wilting score or radiation interception or both, all measured before tasseling. Observations of ponding and runoff during rain events indicated that runoff was negligible where crop residue was retained on the surface with zero tillage, but significant in all the other tillage-residue combinations. Without nitrogen, maize after vetch outyielded the other rotations, but these latter yielded more with N, having a much greater response to fertilizer nitrogen (18.4 kg/kg versus 4.5 kg/kg). The average net economic benefit, calculated for each cropping system by partial budgeting, was best for farmer practice with fertilizer, although vetch–maize with zero tillage and residue removal, and wheat–maize with cultivation and residue removal, both with nitrogen fertilizer, were close behind this treatment. Residue retention was disadvantaged by the high value of residues as fodder, and wheat rotations by the lower yield relative to maize, for no grain price advantage in the Mexican market. "

Process-based simulation models offer the potential for facilitating an assessment of management strategies for different environments, soils and production systems. The objective of this study was to review the physiology of velvet bean and using the generic legume model CROPGRO, to provide a structured and quantitative framework for describing crop response to management and environment. Model coefficients used to describe growth and development of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) served as initial reference values. Information on velvet bean from published sources was then used to revise the functions and parameters of the model. Phenology, canopy development, growth and partitioning were calibrated for two velvet bean varieties using experimental data from three sites in Mexico. Compared to soybean, velvet bean has a much longer growth cycle, allowing a very large numbers of nodes to form. Velvet bean has larger, thinner leaves than soybean, resulting in more rapid leaf area development, and larger seeds, which affects germination, early season growth and pod development. A modification to \{CROPGRO\} to track senesced tissues was incorporated. Overall, the physiological processes underlying growth and development of velvet bean appear to be similar to other tropically adapted legumes. The new model, incorporated as part of the DSSAT, version 3.5 suite of crop simulation models, has potential for evaluating management strategies in specific environments and to identify potential regions for introduction of velvet bean as a green manure cover crop.

Agricultural sustainability problems resulting from soil erosion and fertility decline have arisen throughout this agro-ecological zone. We assessed practices that would sustain higher and stable yields for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) in this region. A long-term experiment (randomized complete block) was started in 1991 under rainfed conditions in the volcanic highlands of central Mexico (2240 m a.s.l.;19.31°N, 98.50°W; Phaeozem). Our objective was to determine infiltration, soil moisture content, root diseases and nematode populations at the end of 12 years of 16 management treatments from a factorial arrangement of: (1) four rotations (monocropping and rotation of maize and wheat), (2) two tillage (conventional tillage [CT] and zero tillage [ZT]) and (3) two crop residue management practices (residue retention and removal). Water infiltration and soil moisture levels were greater under \{ZT\} when residue was left in the field then when residue was removed. Higher infiltration rates and favourable moisture dynamics supported up to 30% yield increase. A significantly higher incidence of root rot was found in monoculture of maize under \{ZT\} than CT. Residue retention significantly increased maize root rot incidence compared to residue removal. Rotation of maize and wheat decreased the incidence of maize root rot up to 30%. In general, the incidence of root disease was lower in wheat (up to 3 on a scale of 7) than in maize (up to 3.93 on a scale of 4) for all treatment. In maize, both non-parasitic and parasitic nematodes increased under ZT; however, in wheat no effect of tillage was seen. Incidence of root rot and parasitic nematode populations were not correlated with yield. Although root diseases may have affected crop performance, they affected yield less than other critical plant growth factors such as infiltration and water availability. Both environmental conditions and microflora played a key role in the biology and expression of soil pathogens. In the semi-arid and rainfed subtropical highlands of central Mexico, positive effects were observed with zero tillage, crop rotations and crop residue retention, compared with common farming practices.

Recent technologies, such as adoption of no-till practices or earlier maturing cotton and rice varieties, have enabled some farmers to sow wheat earlier, but repeatable and publicly available measurements of sow date trends are lacking. Here we utilize satellite measurements since 2000 to estimate sow dates over a decade throughout wheat growing areas in India. Comparisons with ground-based sow dates in Punjab confirmed the reliability of satellite estimates, and data from two independent satellite sensors were used as a robustness check. We find statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) shifts toward earlier sowing of wheat throughout much of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, with insignificant changes in Punjab. A production-weighted average of the entire region indicates that, on average, wheat was sown 1 week earlier by 2010 than it was at the beginning of the decade. Using previously published experimental estimates of yield gains from earlier sowing, we estimate that an overall yield gain of at least 5% averaged across India can be explained by the sow date trend. Given that national yield changes since 2000 have been less than 5%, our results indicate that the sow date shift has been a major factor in yield changes over the past decade, and that the net yield effect of all factors other than sow date has been close to zero, perhaps even negative. The results also indicate that sow dates in much of Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh are nearing or already at the optimum window for yields, so that yield benefits from sow date shifts will likely diminish in the next decade.

Agricultural sustainability problems resulting from soil erosion and fertility decline have arisen all over this agro-ecological zone. Based on selected soil quality indicators, i.e. time-to-pond, aggregate distribution and stability (expressed as the mean weight diameter (MWD) for dry and wet sieving, respectively) and soil moisture, from a representative long-term sustainability trial initiated in 1991 in Central Mexico (2240 masl; 19.31°N, 98.50°W; Cumulic Phaeozem), some insights into the feasibility of conservation agriculture (CA) as part of a sustainable production system in the tropical highlands are given. Zero tillage plots with crop residue removal showed low aggregate distribution (average \{MWD\} = 1.34 mm) and stability (average \{MWD\} = 0.99 mm) resulting in top layer slaking, increased erosion and low time-to-pond values. Retaining the residue in the field with zero tillage avoided the above-mentioned negative evolution for both aggregate distribution as stability (average \{MWD\} = 2.77 and 1.51 mm, respectively) and even improved the physical conditions of the soil as compared to conventional practice. Throughout the growing season the lowest soil moisture content was found in zero tillage without residue (average over the entire growing season = 20.5% volumetric moisture content), the highest in zero tillage with residue retention (average = 29.7%) while conventional tillage had intermediate soil moisture values (average = 27.4%). Zero tillage without residue retention had most days of soil moisture values under permanent wilting point, while zero tillage with residue retention had the least. Taking into account these results, zero tillage with residue retention can clearly be a part of an integrated watershed management scheme towards sustainable agriculture in the tropical highlands. It is clear that to develop new management practices to improve water use, reduce erosion and enhance human labor/animal power focus must be on the use of conservation agriculture both for rainfed as well as irrigated production systems and be fine tuned for each system.

To alleviate the above paradox, the government has mobilized communities and resources for the construction of physical soil and water conservation structures (stone bunds, terraces) in almost all land uses. However, yield improvement was mainly concentrated within the vicinity of the structures and runoff continued to overtop the structures, as no measures for in situ soil conservation were taken. The terwah system, consisting of traditional ploughing followed by making every 1.5–2 m contour furrows, and permanent raised beds with contour furrows at 60–70 cm interval treatments, were considered and evaluated as practices that could increase the efficiency of in situ water utilization and soil conservation. An experiment was started in Gum Selasa, which is one of the drought prone areas in Tigray, whereby runoff volume and sediment load were measured after every rain event. Permanent raised beds with contour furrows at 60–70 cm interval significantly (P &lt; 0.05) reduced runoff volume, runoff coefficient and soil loss as compared to traditional ploughing: 255, 381 and 653 m3 ha−1 runoff was recorded from permanent bed, terwah and traditional ploughing, respectively during the whole cropping season. The above runoff induced 4.7 t ha−1 soil loss from permanent bed, 7.6 t ha−1 from terwah and 19.5 t ha−1 from traditional ploughing. Overall, contour furrows and permanent raised beds can be part of the ongoing intensification process which includes physical soil and water conservation, slope reforestation, irrigation development and agro forestry in crop lands. Moreover, the use of permanent raised beds if combined with crop mulching and crop diversification is an important component for the development of sustainable conservation agriculture practices in the region.

The goal of this paper was to determine the effects of \{CA\} vs. conventional tillage systems on soil quality, with a special focus on the role of earthworms in affecting the soil structure morphology, and on crop yield. For the conventional tillage system, the effect of crop residue retention (CONV + RES) was also compared to the conventional farmers’ practice (residues removed; CONV). \{CA\} resulted in four times higher earthworm abundance when compared to CONV. Residue retention per se (CONV + RES) did not favor earthworm abundance. In all cases the earthworm community was dominated by exotic species. \{CA\} increased total N and soil organic C concentrations relative to CONV, but only at 0–5 cm soil depth. Nevertheless, the more pronounced vertical stratification of soil organic carbon content under \{CA\} favored soil surface aggregation and aggregate stability as expressed by the aggregate mean weight diameter after dry sieving (MWDds = 2.6 mm for \{CA\} and 1.6 mm for CONV) and wet sieving (MWDws = 0.9 mm and 0.6 mm, respectively). Also, \{CA\} improved topsoil water stable macroaggregation (WSA = 415 mg g−1) when compared to \{CONV\} (251 mg g−1). Residue retention within conventional tillage (CONV + RES) led to small increases in topsoil aggregate stability (i.e. \{MWDds\} and WSA). Soil structural improvements were accompanied by a higher direct surface water infiltration. Micromorphological analysis of thin sections indicated a loose and highly biogenic soil microstructure in CA, whereas \{CONV\} was characterized by a physicogenic microstructure, despite similar soil bulk densities (SBD). \{SBD\} is thus a poor indicator of soil physical quality when comparing different tillage systems. Redundancy analysis illustrated that \{CA\} resulted in improvement in most parameters related to soil quality, especially at the soil surface, but significant yield increases were recorded only in 2004. \{CONV\} + \{RES\} lead to marginal improvements in soil quality with no yield increases.

In the present paper, research advances on the utilization of synthetic hexaploid wheat for wheat genetic improvement in China are reviewed. Over 200 synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) accessions from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT) were introduced into China since 1995. Four cultivars derived from these, Chuanmai 38, Chuanmai 42, Chuanmai 43 and Chuanmai 47, have been released in China. Of these, Chuanmai 42, with large kernels and resistance to stripe rust, had the highest average yield (&gt; 6 t/ha) among all cultivars over two years in Sichuan provincial yield trials, outyielding the commercial check cultivar Chuanmai 107 by 22.7%. Meanwhile, by either artificial chromosome doubling via colchicine treatment or spontaneous chromosome doubling via a union of unreduced gametes (2n) from T. turgidum-Ae. tauschii hybrids, new \{SHW\} lines were produced in China. Mitotic-like meiosis might be the cytological mechanism of spontaneous chromosome doubling. \{SHW\} lines with genes for spontaneous chromosome doubling may be useful for producing new SHW-alien amphidiploids and double haploid in wheat genetic improvement.

Along with the fast development in molecular biology and biotechnology, a large amount of biological data is available for genetic studies of important breeding traits in plants, which in turn allows the conduction of genotypic selection in the breeding process. However, gene information has not been effectively used in crop improvement because of the lack of appropriate tools. The simulation approach can utilize the vast and diverse genetic information, predict the cross performance, and compare different selection methods. Thus, the best performing crosses and effective breeding strategies can be identified. QuLine is a computer tool capable of defining a range, from simple to complex genetic models, and simulating breeding processes for developing final advanced lines. On the basis of the results from simulation experiments, breeders can optimize their breeding methodology and greatly improve the breeding efficiency. In this article, the underlying principles of simulation modeling in crop enhancement is initially introduced, following which several applications of QuLine are summarized, by comparing the different selection strategies, the precision parental selection, using known gene information, and the design approach in breeding. Breeding simulation allows the definition of complicated genetic models consisting of multiple alleles, pleiotropy, epistasis, and genes, by environment interaction, and provides a useful tool for breeders, to efficiently use the wide spectrum of genetic data and information available.

Water saving irrigation and conservation agriculture (CA) practices (e.g., dry seeded rice, zero tillage wheat, residue retention) are potential alternative, resource-saving establishment methods. The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) Cropping System Model (CSM) can both be a valuable ex-ante and ex-post tool to evaluate the effects of water saving irrigation and resource saving CA-practices. The CSM-CERES-Rice and CSM-CERES-Wheat models of \{DSSAT\} were evaluated using experimental data from the 2008 to 2010 rice and wheat seasons as monitored in Urgench, the Khorezm region of Uzbekistan for growth, development of these crops, as well as soil mineral nitrogen (N) and volumetric soil moisture content in these cropping systems. Thereafter, the models were used to explore the long-term impact of water saving irrigation and CA-practices on grain yield, soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics, N dynamics, and water balance in a rice–wheat rotation for 39 years starting from 1971. The simulation results showed that the simulated yield of water-seeded rice without residue retention and flood irrigation (WSRF-R0-FI) is likely to remain the highest and constant over 39 years. The simulated yield of dry seeded rice (DSR) with alternate wet and dry (AWD) irrigation and varying levels of residue retention was penalized for the initial years. However, the simulated rice yield increased after 13 years of CA-practices and continued to increase for the remaining years. Wheat did not experience a yield penalty for any of the treatments and simulated yield increased over time across all CA-practices based treatments. In the long-term, the effect of tillage methods and different residue levels for both rice and wheat were apparent in terms of grain yield and \{SOC\} build up. The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that \{WSR\} using \{AWD\} irrigation with puddling (WSRF-R0-AWD-Puddled) could give equivalent yield with that of WSRF-R0-FI and that irrigation water for rice could be reduced from 5435 mm to 2161 mm (or by 60%). Deep placement of urea in \{DSR\} (CT-DSR-AWD-DPUS) has the potential to increase yields of \{DSR\} by about 0.5 t ha−1. Despite the huge water saving potential through the adoption of water saving \{AWD\} irrigation in DSR, a major challenge will be to prevent N losses. Substantial amounts of N losses through leaching, immobilization by residue mulch, combined with gaseous losses through volatilization and denitrification are the major causes for the lower simulated yield of rice for the \{AWD\} treatments. During the rice season, the implementation of water saving irrigation can improve water use efficiency by reducing percolation and seepage losses, which is an option in particular for WSRF-R0-FI. For both crops, the water use efficiency can be improved by lowering evaporation losses e.g. through residue retention on the soil surface. The creation of a sub-surface hard pan (puddling) and deep placement of urea super granules/pellet (DPUS) fertilizer could be the key for water saving and better yields of rice. Because CA-practices require almost three times less irrigation water than conventional method, and provide a long-term positive impact on grain yields of both crops, the CA-practices should be considered for double, no-till, rice–wheat cropping systems in the irrigated semi-arid drylands of Central Asia.

The yield gains were accompanied by improved stripe rust and leaf rust resistances primarily based on adult plant resistance genes. The grain quality of the new varieties did not deteriorate over time although most of them were inferior to the bread-making quality check Bezostaya-1, a feature that may require attention in future breeding.

Our method is based on household survey data collected from 500 farmers in Anantapur and Kurnool Districts, in Andhra Pradesh State of India, in 2013. We carried out principal component analysis (PCA) with subsequent hierarchical clustering methods to build farm typologies. To evaluate sustainability across these farm typologies, we adopted a framework consisting of economic, social and environmental sustainability pillars and associated indicators. We normalized values of target indicators and employed normative approach to assign different weights to these indicators. Composite sustainability indices (CSI) were then estimated by means of weighted sum of indicators, aggregated and integrated into farm typologies. The results suggested that there were five distinct farm typologies representing farming systems in the study area. The majority of farms (&gt;70%) in the study area are small and extensive (typology 1); marginal and off farm based (typology 2). About 20% of the farms are irrigation based and intensive (typology 3); small and medium and off farm based (typology 4) and irrigation based semi-intensive (typology 5). There was apparent variability among farm typologies in terms of farm structure and functions and composite sustainability indices. Farm typologies 3 and 5 showed significantly higher performances for the social and economic indices, while typologies 2 and 4 had relatively stronger values for environment. These discrepancies support the relevance of integrated farm typology- and \{CSI\} approaches in assessing system sustainability and targeting technologies. Universally, for all farm typologies, composite sustainability indices for economic pillar was significantly lower than the social and environment pillars. More than 90% of farmers were in economically less-sustainable class. The correlations between sustainability indices for economic and environment were typology specific. It was strong and positive when aggregated for the whole study systems [all samples (r = 0.183; P &lt; 0.001)] and for agriculture dependent farm typologies (e.g. typologies 1 and 3). This suggests the need to elevate farms economic performance and capacitate them to invest in the environment. These results provide information for policy makers to plan farm typology–context technological interventions and also create baseline information to evaluate sustainability performance in terms of progress made over time.

Optimum nitrogen (N) management for zero till (ZT) wheat sown into rice residues may to differ from that of conventional practice (in-situ burning of residues followed by intensive tillage prior to sowing). Therefore, we conducted several on-farm and on-station field experiments in 2007–2008 to 2012–2013 to evaluate N management practices for \{ZT\} wheat sown into rice residues using the Happy Seeder. The optimum N rate for wheat planted into rice residues in fields with no or only a short history of rice residue retention was 120 kg N ha−1, the current recommendation for conventional practice. Short-term (up to 20 d) soil N mineralization was lower in undisturbed soil than disturbed soil, while the total amount of N mineralization was similar after 40 d, suggesting that over the crop season, total soil N mineralization may be similar in tilled and non-tilled soil. Ammonia volatilization loss from urea broadcast over the residue covered surface, followed by irrigation, was low (&lt;2 kg ha−1) regardless of time of urea application. Band placement of 20% of the fertilizer N as diammonium phosphate at seeding, and topdressing of the remaining 80% as urea in two equal doses before first and second irrigations produced higher grain yield and N use efficiency than other treatments. However, surface residue retention reduces the rate of soil drying and in some situations this delays the time of the second irrigation and thus N fertilizer application beyond the optimum time. Therefore, the effect of banding various proportions of the urea N between the rows at sowing was investigated. The results showed that, on a loam soil, up to 75% of the recommended N fertilizer can be applied at sowing, 24 kg N ha−1 as \{DAP\} with the seed and 66 kg N ha−1 as urea drilled between every second wheat row, without loss of yield. In conclusion, a better applied N management strategy for \{ZT\} wheat than currently practiced is drilling of 24 kg N ha−1 as diammonimum phosphate into the soil at seeding followed by two top-dressings of 48 kg N ha−1 each just prior to first and second irrigations.

The objective of this study was to assess differences in resource endowment, crop productivity and crop residue management in selected sites in southern Africa. Three sites were selected along a gradient of intensification of crop production; Murehwa, Zimbabwe and Ruaca and Gorongosa, central Mozambique. Murehwa and Ruaca have mixed crop-livestock systems with more intensive crop production in Murehwa. Gorongosa is predominantly crop based with small livestock that do not impact on crop production. A combination of land size and cattle ownership was the major attribute that defined wealth status among farmers in mixed crop-livestock systems whereas land size and labor availability were important under crop-based extensification systems. Farm systems were more diverse where livestock was more important. The wealthiest farmers (resource group—RG1) in Murehwa produced an average of 2.2 t ha−1 maize crop residues, and productivity decreased with decrease in resource ownership with the poorest (RG4) achieving only 0.8 t ha−1. In Ruaca 1.3 and 0.5 t ha−1 was produced by \{RG1\} and \{RG4\} respectively, whereas in Gorongosa 0.4 and 0.2 t ha−1 was produced by \{RG1\} and RG4. These crop residues are insufficient to achieve the minimum threshold of soil cover (30%) required for the practice of conservation agriculture. However, they can provide sufficient feed to sustain livestock of \{RG1\} farmers in Murehwa for 63 days and 54 days for \{RG2\} farmers. In Ruaca, they can feed cattle for 37 days for \{RG1\} and 17 days for \{RG2\} farmers. The product of livestock × population density determined the extent and manner in which crop residues are used. The population density limited the extent of the grazing area, increased grazing frequency and reduced the grazing quality leading to the need to supplement animal feed with crop residues. Farmers preferentially allocate crop residues to livestock where labor is available. The crop residues fed to animals allow farmers to increase manure quantity and quality which explains the major differences in crop productivity between the different resource groups. In the absence of cattle, crop residues are burned before the cropping season to facilitate land clearance. In conclusion, land size, cattle ownership and labor availability largely define the intensity of crop production and the fate of crop residues on smallholder farms in southern Africa. "

abstract = "Abstract Rice-maize system (RMS) is emerging as dominant option for diversification of existing rice-wheat systems in Asia due to better suitability and higher yields of maize compared to wheat after long duration rice cultivars, and increasing demand of maize from poultry and fish industries. The conventional practice of cultivation of \{RMS\} is input intensive, deteriorates soil health and is less profitable. Conservation agriculture (CA) based management practices such as dry direct-seeded rice (DSR), zero tillage (ZT) and residue retention may hold potential to increase yields, reduce costs and increase farmers' profits in RMS. Therefore, replicated 5-year field study was conducted to evaluate the effects of six combinations of three tillage and crop establishment (TCE) techniques and two residue management options on soil physical properties, system productivity and economics of an irrigated \{RMS\} in north-west India. The \{TCE\} techniques consisted of transplanted puddled rice (TPR) followed by conventionally tilled maize (CTM); \{CTDSR\} followed by CTM; and \{ZTDSR\} followed by \{ZTM\} in main plots and two residue management options; removal of residues of both the crops (−R) and partial residue (5 t ha−1) either retained at soil surface on \{ZT\} plots or incorporated into the soil in \{CT\} plots (+R) for both rice and maize in sub-plots. Compared with TPR/CTM-R, soil physical parameters such as water-stable aggregates &gt;0.2 mm were 89% higher, and bulk density, penetrometer resistance and infiltration rate showed significant (P &lt; 0.05) improvement in ZTDSR/ZTM (+R) treatment. Similarly, root mass density was 6 to 49% greater in rice and 21 to 53% in maize under ZTDSR/ZTM (+R) plots compared to conventional \{RMS\} in different soil layers to 60 cm depth. The total amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) in 0–30 cm layer increased by 2.86 Mg ha−1 in ZTDSR/ZTM (+R) over conventional practice. Grain yield of \{TPR\} was 5 –7% higher compared to \{CTDSR\} and ZTDSR, which was attributed to increased number of grains panicle−1 and grain weight. Maize yield under ZTDSR/ZTM was significantly higher by 4.0% and 14.2% compared to CTDSR/CTM and TPR/CTM, respectively, due to increase in number of cobs plant−1 and grain number cob−1. Gradual improvement in soil physical health in ZTDSR/ZTM +R system resulted in higher and stable crop productivity (17.4–17.6 kg m−3) with higher profitability in different years over conventional system. Our study demonstrates that \{CA\} based management practices can be adopted for \{RMS\} on sandy loam or similar soils for sustaining soil and crop productivity in South Asia. "

Conservation agriculture is an approach to managing agro-ecosystems for improved and sustained productivity, by way of minimal soil disturbance, permanent soil cover with organic matter or cover crops and crop rotation. Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were measured using static chambers. Experiments involved four cropping system scenarios with different \{CA\} components, and different N rates. In addition, emissions of \{CH4\} and \{N2O\} fluxes were measured in farmers’ fields to establish baselines. The dynamics of \{CH4\} emissions were controlled by floodwater levels, and fertilizer N had no effect. On the other hand, N application rates and timing in relation to soil water status determined the \{N2O\} emissions in rice fields. Nitrous oxide fluxes could be avoided by applying N fertilizer to wet soil or by irrigating the field not later than 1 day after N application. Applying crop residues on soil surface had no significant effect on the seasonal \{CH4\} and \{N2O\} emissions. It was estimated that switching rice crop establishment method from conventional to CA-based practices in Haryana could reduce \{GWP\} for rice by 23% or by 1.26 Tg \{CO2\} eq yr−1. An intensive CA-based rice–wheat and maize–wheat system reduced \{GWP\} by 16–26% or by 1.3–2.0 Tg \{CO2\} eq yr−1 compared with the conventional rice–wheat system. However, this reduction in \{GWP\} would be from a decrease in diesel and electricity consumption and not from direct emissions of \{CH4\} and N2O, which were higher in the maize–wheat system than in the rice–wheat system.

The objective of this study was, therefore, to investigate how crop residue management, tillage and fertilizer application affected the bacterial community and those groups involved in the degradation of applied plant residues, and increase the knowledge to predict the sustainability of a soil under a specific agronomic practice. Samples from an arable soil from the state of Sonora (México), i.e. Hyposodic Vertisol (Calcaric, Chromic) (IUSS Working Group, 2007), cultivated with wheat (Triticum spp.) and maize (Zea mays L.) in succession on conventionally tilled beds (CTB) with crop residue incorporated, permanent beds (PB) with residue burned or retained, left unfertilized or fertilized (300 kg N ha−1 for wheat and 103 kg N ha−1 for maize) was improved with dried young wheat plants to stimulate microbial growth, while the bacterial community structure and C and N mineralization were monitored in an aerobic incubation of 56 days. The soil organic C was significantly higher in the PB-residue retained treatments (average 13.1 g kg−1 dry soil) compared with PB-residue burned (average 9.9 g kg−1 dry soil) or CTB-residue incorporated (average 10.5 g kg−1 dry soil), while pH and \{EC\} were significantly higher in the PB-residue burned (averages 8.85 and 1.06 dS m−1) compared with the fertilized or unfertilized soil in PB-residue retained (averages 8.65 and 0.78 dS m−1) or CTB-residue incorporated (averages 8.75 and 0.95 dS m−1). In the unimproved soil, we found a significant effect of soil organic C, application of N fertilizer (highly significant on Nitrosovibrio) and tillage-residue management (principally in fertilized soil) on the bacterial community structure, but not in the improved soil. Treatment had no significant effect on the decomposition of the applied organic material, and on average 48% and 9.4% of the applied C and N, respectively, were mineralized in 56 days. Improvement of soil with wheat plant material increased mainly the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes and decreased a wide range of bacterial groups. On the bacterial level of genus, tillage-residue management was the most important defining factor of the bacterial community inducing differences in the genera involved in the degradation of applied plant material, i.e. Promicromonospora, Bacillus, Agromyces, Streptomyces, Sinorhizobium and Lysobacter, in different treatments. It was found that nitrogen fertilization and tillage-crop residue management defined the soil bacterial community structure in the unimproved soil, but were less determinant in improved soil, and these results supported the hypothesis tested. It was concluded that all the factors tested, i.e. tillage, crop-residue management and fertilizer application, affect the soil bacterial community structure, while the mineralization potential of the soil was preserved. This study contributes to our understanding of how soil use and management practices define the soil bacterial community structure. "

We also assess the potential decline in human development potential among smallholder dryland farmers in these sub-Saharan African countries. In contrast to previous efforts, the current study directly integrates the uncertainties in estimations of income changes and secondary consequences through a weighting scheme. The results reveal moderate to high levels of secondary impacts which could lead to increased vulnerability to diseases, susceptibility to nutritional disorders, deprivation of educational opportunities, and ultimately to a reduction in human and societal development potential among the considered nations. The article concludes by proposing a portfolio of policy options for ameliorating the secondary impacts of climate change in these sub-Saharan African countries. "

It has been proposed that the length of the stem elongation phase may, to an extent, affect grain number; thus it would be beneficial to identify genetic variation for the duration of this phase in elite germplasm. Variation in these developmental patterns was studied using 27 elite wheat lines in four experiments across three growing seasons. The results showed that the length of the stem elongation phase was (i) only slightly related to the period from seedling emergence to terminal spikelet, and (ii) more relevant than it for determining time to anthesis. Thus, phenological phases were largely independent and any particular time to anthesis may be reached with different combinations of component phases. Yield components were largely explained by fruiting efficiency of the elite lines used: the relationships were strongly positive and strongly negative with grain number and with grain weight, respectively. Although fruiting efficiency showed a positive trend with the duration of stem elongation that was not significant, a boundary function (which was highly significant) suggests that the length of this phase may impose an upper threshold for fruiting efficiency and grain number, and that maximum values of fruiting efficiency may require a relatively long stem elongation phase.

The lodging model was used to estimate the lodging-associated traits required to enable spring wheat grown in \{NWM\} with a typical yield of 6 t ha−1 and plant height of 0.7 m to achieve a lodging return period of 25 years. Target traits included a root plate spread of 51 mm and stem strength of the bottom internode of 268 N mm. These target traits increased to 54.5 mm and 325 N mm, respectively, for a crop yielding 10 t ha−1. Analysis of multiple genotypes across three growing seasons enabled relationships between both stem strength and root plate spread with structural dry matter to be quantified. A \{NWM\} lodging resistant ideotype yielding 6 t ha−1 would require 3.93 t ha−1 of structural stem biomass and 1.10 t ha−1 of root biomass in the top 10 cm of soil, which would result in a harvest index (HI) of 0.46 after accounting for chaff and leaf biomass. A crop yielding 10 t ha−1 would achieve a \{HI\} of 0.54 for 0.7 m tall plants or 0.41 for more typical 1.0 m tall plants. This study indicates that for plant breeders to achieve both high yields and lodging-proofness they must either breed for greater total biomass or develop high yielding germplasm from shorter crops.

abstract = "Abstract Depletion and/or degradation of natural resources, increasing farm labour scarcity, and high production cost are major threats to the rice-wheat cropping system of north-west India. Conservation agriculture (CA) is a potential solution which can be achieved by switching from puddling then transplanting of rice to dry seeding (DSR), together with changing from conventional tillage (CT) to zero tillage (ZT) for wheat with surface retention of rice residues. Whether the use of \{ZT\} for both crops confers additional benefits to either crop is not known. The effects of surface retention of rice residues in wheat on the subsequent \{DSR\} crop are also unknown, nor how this is affected by tillage for DSR. Therefore, a field study was conducted during 2012-14 to investigate the interactions between tillage for rice and wheat (CT, ZT), and rice residue management (removed, retained on the soil surface), on the performance of a dry seeded rice-wheat system. There were no significant interaction or main treatment effects on wheat grain yield in the first two years, but in the third year, yield of \{ZT\} wheat (5.5 t ha−1) was significantly lower than yield of \{CT\} wheat (6.0 t ha−1). Yield of wheat decreased significantly over the three years, for example from 7.7 to 6.3 to 5.8 t ha−1 in the control system (CT for both crops, no rice straw mulch). Weather data analysis and simulation modelling suggested that this was entirely due to differences in seasonal weather conditions. Growth of non-mulched \{ZT\} wheat was inferior to that of mulched \{ZT\} wheat, and that of \{CT\} wheat with and without mulch, regardless of tillage for rice, although this was not reflected in wheat grain yield. Mulch delayed wheat crop development and the time of irrigation to varying degrees depending on seasonal conditions, and reduced irrigation amount by 50–100 mm in two of the three years. Tillage and rice residue management treatments did not affect the yield of \{DSR\} in the first year (mean yield 6.0 t ha−1). However, in the second year, growth and grain yield of \{ZTDSR\} (3.2 t ha−1) were inferior to that of \{CTDSR\} (3.8 t ha−1), regardless of tillage treatment for wheat. There was a consistent trend for poorer growth of \{DSR\} following wheat mulched with rice straw (significant in the first year), suggesting the need to examine the possibility of allelopathic effects of surface rice straw retention in dry seeded rice-wheat systems. There was a decline in rice growth and grain yield over the two years in all treatments. For example, yield of rice in the control declined from 5.9 t ha−1 in 2012 to 4.3 t ha−1 in 2013. Seasonal conditions and simulated growth and yield were similar each year; the poorer observed rice growth and yield in 2013 were due to disease during grain filling, greater weed infestation during the early vegetative stage, and unexplained factors during the middle of the season. Total system rice equivalent yield (REY) was not affected by tillage or mulch treatments nor their interactions in 2012 (mean \{REY\} 13.3 t ha−1), but was significantly lower in systems with \{ZTDSR\} (9.4 t ha−1) than \{CTDSR\} (10.0 t ha−1) in 2013. Treatment effects on irrigation input to rice and the total system were small. The net result was no treatment effects on total cropping system irrigation water productivity (WPi) in 2012 (mean 0.83 kg m−3), and significantly higher system \{WPi\} in 2013 in systems with \{CTDSR\} (0.69 kg m−3) than \{ZTDSR\} (0.63 kg m−3). The results suggest that in a dry seeded rice-wheat cropping system, surface retention of rice residues can improve the growth of \{ZT\} wheat right from the first crop, although this did not affect yield in the first three years. However, whether there is an adverse carry over effect of the rice residues on \{DSR\} requires further investigation. "

Renewed policy and donor emphasis on bridging gender gaps in development also emphasizes the potential social safety net benefits that weather-index insurance could bring to women farmers who are disproportionately vulnerable to climate change risk and have low adaptive capacity. To date, no quantitative studies have experimentally explored weather-index insurance preferences through a gender lens, and little information exists regarding gender-specific preferences for (and constraints to) smallholder investment in agricultural weather-index insurance. This study responds to this gap, and advances the understanding of preference heterogeneity for weather-index insurance by analysing data collected from 433 male and female farmers living on a climate change vulnerable coastal island in Bangladesh, where an increasing number of farmers are adopting maize as a potentially remunerative, but high-risk cash crop. We implemented a choice experiment designed to investigate farmers’ valuations for, and trade-offs among, the key attributes of a hypothetical maize crop weather-index insurance program that offered different options for bundling insurance with financial saving mechanisms. Our results reveal significant insurance aversion among female farmers, irrespective of the attributes of the insurance scheme. Heterogeneity in insurance choices could however not be explained by differences in men’s and women’s risk and time preferences, or agency in making agriculturally related decisions. Rather, gendered differences in farmers’ level of trust in insurance institutions and financial literacy were the key factors driving the heterogeneous preferences observed between men and women. Efforts to fulfill gender equity mandates in climate-smart agricultural development programs that rely on weather-index insurance as a risk-abatement tool are therefore likely to require a strengthening of institutional credibility, while coupling such interventions with financial literacy programs for female farmers.

abstract = "Abstract Machinery for sowing wheat directly into rice residues has become more common in the rice-wheat systems of the north-west Indo-Gangetic Plains of South Asia, with increasing numbers of farmers now potentially able to access the benefits of residue retention. However, surface residue retention affects soil water and temperature dynamics, thus the optimum sowing date and irrigation management for a mulched crop may vary from those of a traditional non-mulched crop. Furthermore, the effects of sowing date and irrigation management are likely to vary with soil type and seasonal conditions. Therefore, a simulation study was conducted using the \{APSIM\} model and 40 years of weather data to evaluate the effects of mulch, sowing date and irrigation management and their interactions on wheat grain yield, irrigation requirement (I) and water productivity with respect to irrigation (WPI) and evapotranspiration (WPET). The results suggest that the optimum wheat sowing date in central Punjab depends on both soil type and the presence or absence of mulch. On the sandy loam, with irrigation scheduled at 50% soil water deficit (SWD), the optimum sowing date was late October to early November for maximising yield, \{WPI\} and WPET. On the clay loam, the optimum date was about one week later. The effect of mulch on yield varied with seasonal conditions and sowing date. With irrigation at 50% SWD, mulching of wheat sown at the optimum time increased average yield by up to 0.5 t ha−1. The beneficial effect of mulch on yield increased to averages of 1.2–1.3 t ha−1 as sowing was advanced to 15 October. With irrigation at 50% \{SWD\} and 7 November sowing, mulch reduced the number of irrigations by one in almost 50% of years, a reduction of about 50 mm on the sandy loam and 60 mm on the clay loam. The reduction in irrigation amount was mainly due to reduced soil evaporation. Mulch reduced irrigation requirement by more as sowing was delayed, more so on the sandy loam than the clay loam soil. There was little effect of mulch on irrigation requirement for late October sowings. There were large trade-offs between irrigation input, yield, \{WPET\} and \{WPI\} on the sandy loam with regard to the optimum irrigation schedule. Maximum yield occurred with very frequent irrigation (10–20% SWD) which also had the greatest irrigation input, while \{WPI\} was highest with least frequent irrigation (70% SWD), and \{WPET\} was highest with irrigation at 40–50% SWD. This was the case with and without mulch. On the clay loam, the trade-offs were not so pronounced, as maximum yield was reached with irrigation at 50% SWD, with and without mulch. However, both \{WPET\} and \{WPI\} were maximum and irrigation input least at the lowest irrigation frequency (70% SWD). On both soils, maximum yield, \{WPET\} and \{WPI\} were higher with mulch, while irrigation input was slightly lower, but mulch had very little effect on the irrigation thresholds at which each parameter was maximised.

abstract = "Abstract Maize-based crop rotations are advocated as alternate to rice-based systems in South Asia due to better suitability for diverse ecologies, higher yields with less water use and more palatable maize fodder compared to rice, and increased demand of maize from piggery and poultry industries. Alternate tillage and crop establishment practices are important management strategies for tackling the issues of soil health deterioration and over exploitation of underground water resources, particularly in rice based intensive crop rotations. The conservation agriculture (CA) based tillage and crop establishment practices such as zero tillage (ZT) and permanent raised beds (PB) hold potential to enhance soil organic carbon (SOC), physical and biological properties for sustainability of soil health. Therefore, a long term study was conducted to evaluate the twelve combinations of tillage practices (03) and irrigated intensive maize based crop rotations (04) on organic carbon, physical properties and microbial biomass and enzymatic activities of a sandy loam (Typic Haplustept) soil in north-western India. The tillage practices consisted of ZT, \{PB\} and conventional tillage (CT) in main plots and four diversified intensive maize based crop rotations (MWMb: Maize-Wheat-Mungbean, MCS: Maize-Chickpea-Sesbaina, MMuMb: Maize-Mustard-Mungbean, MMS: Maize-Maize-Sesbania) in sub plots. In this study we analysed the SOC, physical and biological properties of soil at various depths after 7 years of continuous ZT, \{PB\} and \{CT\} in diversified maize rotations. Compared to \{CT\} plots, the soil physical properties like water stable aggregates (WSA) &gt; 250 μm were 16.1-32.5% higher, and bulk density (BD) and penetration resistance (PR) showed significant (P &lt; 0.05) decline (11.0–14.3 and 11.2–12.0%) in \{ZT\} and \{PB\} plots at 0–15 and 15–30 cm soil layers. The soil organic carbon (SOC) increased by 34.6-35.3% at 0–15 cm, and 23.6-26.5% at 15–30 cm soil depths with conservation agriculture (ZT and PB) based crop establishment techniques over CT. Similarly, the soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) under \{CA\} based systems increased by 45–48.9% in 0–30 cm profile depth of a sandy loam (Typic Haplustept) soil. Significant (P &lt; 0.05) improvement in soil enzymatic activities i.e., Fluorescein diacetate, dehydrogenase, β Glucosidase and Alkaline phosphatase was also recorded in the \{CA\} based treatments. Significant (P &lt; 0.05) synergistic effects of summer legumes (mungbean and Sesbania) with winter legume/cereal in crop rotations were observed on SOC,WSA, BD, \{PR\} and Ksat at 0–15 and 15–30 cm depths. Interaction between tillage and crop rotations were significant (P &lt; 0.05) for soil organic carbon, physical properties and enzymatic activities. Thus our long-term study suggests that \{CA\} based crop management with selected diversified maize based rotations (MCS and MWMb) can be advocated as sustainable intensification strategy in light textured soils of north-western India and other similar agro-ecologies of South Asia.

Conservation agriculture (CA) based best-bet crop management practices may increase crop and water productivity, while conserving and sustaining natural resources. In a 6-year study of conservation agriculture experiment established in 2008, we have evaluated the performance of CA-based management practices [permanent bed (PB) and zero tillage (ZT)] and conventional till (CT) for four intensified irrigated maize systems [maize-wheat-mungbean (MWMb), maize-chickpea-Sesbania green manure (MCS), maize-mustard-mungbean (MMuMb) and maize-maize-Sesbania (MMS)]. Significant (P &lt; 0.05) tillage and cropping system interactions were observed for system productivity. Agronomic performance (yield attributes) of all the crops (except wheat) grown in sequence with maize was maximum with ZT, however wheat outperformed on \{PB\} over \{ZT\} and CT. In the initial two years, higher system productivity (maize equivalent yield) was recorded in \{PB\} (8.2–8.5 Mg ha−1), while from third year onwards \{ZT\} registered maximum productivity (11.3–12.9 Mg ha−1).The system glucose equivalent yield increased by 0.6 Mg ha−1 under \{ZT\} and \{PB\} compared to CT. Economic profits from maize-based rotations were invariably higher either in \{MMuMb\} or \{MWMb\} systems, while in terms of glucose equivalent yield, \{MMS\} and \{MWMb\} rotation were highest. Synergistic effects of summer legumes (mungbean and Sesbania) after winter legume/oilseed/cereal were observed on yield of individual crop vis-a-vis system productivity and irrigation water use. \{ZT\} and \{PB\} practices reduced the irrigation water requirement by 40–65 ha-mm and 60–98 ha-mm, respectively compared to \{CT\} system, resulted enhanced system water productivity by 19.4% equally under both \{ZT\} and PB. Net profit from the maize-based systems under \{ZT\} was up to 31% higher with 72$ ha−1 lower production cost compared to CT.

While in-field retention of crop residues can play an important role in replenishing soil quality and reducing environmental pollution from stubble burning, until recently, there has been no suitable technology for seeding wheat in rice residues. To address this need, a series of machines (‘Happy Seeders’) was developed over the past 10 years, culminating in the development of version 2 of the 9-row Turbo Happy Seeder (v.2). The 9-row Turbo Happy Seeder(v.2) has a weight of 506 kg and can be operated by a 33.6 kW tractor at a work rate of 0.3 ha h−1. Numerous on-farm trials show that yield of wheat sown into rice residues with the 9-row Turbo Happy Seeder is similar to or higher than yield with straw burning and conventional tillage prior to sowing, while providing many benefits to the farmer. These include greatly reduced fuel consumption and cost of crop establishment, and the ability to sow as soon as desired after harvest, ensuring the possibility of sowing at the optimum time and reducing the need for irrigation. However, adoption has been low to date, despite a 50% price subsidy. Constraints to adoption include the low window of operation of the machine (25 days per year), the low machine capacity compared with conventional seed drills, the inability to operate in wet straw, and the lack of straw spreaders on combine harvesters. Removal of subsidies for diesel and electricity (for pumping groundwater) and implementation of the policy banning in-field straw burning would help to accelerate adoption of technology for direct drilling wheat into rice residues.

Climate change is also expected to affect agricultural production in most European regions, and in Southern Europe this effect is expected to negatively impact yields. In this study, we present the application of an innovative participatory approach to assess the potential of innovative agricultural systems to reconcile environmental sustainability with economic viability while contributing to local and global food security. Our approach consisted of combining (1) the participation of local stakeholders in the design of narrative scenarios, and (2) an integrated assessment of scenarios through the calculation of indicators at different scale with a bio-economic model. We tested our approach with a case study situated in the Camargue region of Southern France. Rice is currently the main crop in this region, but farmers there face adverse economic conditions linked to the recent reform of European Common Agriculture Policy. After identifying the main drivers of change, local stakeholders developed narrative scenarios and described how farmers would adapt within the context of those changes. These elements were then translated into model inputs. At the regional level, the four scenarios led to variations in farmland acreage (28,000–33,000 ha), as well as the proportion of rice crops (19–75%) and areas cultivated under organic farming standards (8–43%). The four scenarios also led to different values for indicators of agricultural economic welfare, food production, and environmental impacts. Trade-offs between these indicators and the associated objectives assigned to agriculture were identified and discussed with the stakeholders. We end with a discussion of the limitations and advantages of our approach to the participatory development and assessment of locally developed narrative scenarios. "

This trait is controlled by the puroindolines genes (Pin-D1) located on the 5DS chromosome. Forty-five landraces from Andalusia (Southern Spain) were analyzed for grain hardness by \{NIR\} (predicted particle size index or PSI) and Pin-D1 genes. Thirty-one accessions showed semi-hard texture (predicted \{PSI\} between 45 and 55%), while the rest was distributed in 13 hard accessions (predicted PSI &lt; 45%) and one soft-textured (predicted PSI &gt; 55%) accession. The wild alleles (Pina-D1a and Pinb-D1a) were found in all the soft and semi-hard texture accessions. However, only seven of the thirteen hard accessions could be explained by mutations in either Pina-D1 or Pinb-D1. Two of them contain the null Pina-D1b allele. For Pinb-D1, three different alleles were detected, including Pinb-D1b and Pinb-D1d. The third allele, tentatively named Pinb-D1ad, was characterized by a C/T transition that led to the appearance of a premature stop codon, which is extremely rare. These results confirm the importance of these landraces, infrequently utilized in breeding programs, as potential sources of the genetic variability of Pin loci for developing wheat cultivars with different grain textures.

A wide variation in volume percentages of A- and B-type starch granules among genotypes was observed. Volume percentages of A- and B-type granules had ranges of 68.4–88.9% and 9.7–27.9% in the first cropping seasons, 74.1–90.1% and 7.2–25.3% in the second. Wheat cultivars with higher volume percentages of A- and B-type granules could serve as parents in breeding program for selecting high and low amylose wheat cultivars, respectively. In comparison with the B-type starch granules, the A-type granules starch showed difference in three aspects: (1) higher amount of ordered short-range structure and a lower relative crystallinity, (2) higher gelatinization onset (To) temperatures and enthalpies (ΔH), and lower gelatinization conclusion temperatures (Tc), (3) greater peak, though, and final viscosity, and lower breakdown viscosity and pasting temperature. It provides important information for breeders to develop potentially useful cultivars with particular functional properties of their starches suited to specific applications. "

Each location was classified by mega environment (ME); \{ME1\} being the temperate irrigated locations with terminal high temperature stress, and \{ME5\} as warm, tropical, irrigated locations. Grain yield (GY), thousand kernel weight (TKW), days to heading (DH) and plant height (PH) were recorded at each location. Canopy temperature (CT) was also measured at some locations. Significant differences were observed between \{ME\} for DH, PH, GY, and TKW. The cooler \{ME1\} locations had a mean \{DH\} of 83 days, compared to 68 days mean \{DH\} in ME5. The \{ME1\} locations had higher mean \{GY\} of 5.26 t/ha and \{TKW\} of 41.8 g compared to 3.63 t/ha and 37.4 g, respectively, for ME5. Early heading entries (&lt;79 days, mean DH) performed better across all locations, with \{GY\} of 2–11% above the local checks and 40–44 g TKW. Across all locations the top five highest yielding entries had 5–11% higher \{GY\} than the local checks. The early maturing \{CIMMYT\} check ‘Baj’ also performed well across all locations. In the Mexico location, \{CT\} was associated with GY, thereby suggesting that cooler canopies may contribute to higher \{GY\} under normal as well as high temperature stress conditions.

However, the performance of \{CA\} under different environments and its ability to improve ecosystem services is still unclear. The effects of the \{CA\} options; direct seeding, rip-line seeding, and seeding into planting basins on maize grain yield, soil health and profitability across agro-ecological regions in Zimbabwe were evaluated through a review of literature in combination with meta-analysis. Overall, \{CA\} improved maize yield over conventional agriculture. Compared to conventional agriculture, direct seeding, rip-line seeding, and seeding into planting basins increased yield by 445, 258 and 241 kg ha−1, respectively. However, there was an initial yield decline in the first two years. \{CA\} practices reduced soil erosion and bulk density, and increased soil water content in most studies. Under high levels of residue retention (6 Mg ha−1), \{CA\} systems exhibited greater macro fauna abundance and diversity than conventional agriculture, particularly termites. Weed pressure tended to increase labour requirement for hand-hoe weeding under \{CA\} compared to conventional agriculture. However, the use of herbicides reduced weeding labour demand during the early season. The benefits of \{CA\} are tied to the farmers’ management intensity including: time of planting, weeding, fertiliser and herbicide application, and adequate training on equipment use. Economic analysis results showed that on average, a farmer incurs losses for switching from conventional agriculture to \{CA\} in the main maize growing regions of Zimbabwe. Based on the six seasons’ data, the losses were least with the ripper in drier areas and worst with the direct seeder in wetter areas. Incorporation of chemical herbicides worsens the economic returns of \{CA\} tillage options in all the agro-ecological zones. Overall, the study showed that the rip-line seeding is more attractive in the drier areas than direct seeding. Although not costed in this study, critical is the cumulative reversal of soil degradation associated with consistent \{CA\} practice which can sustain agriculture. Results from this review suggest that the benefits of \{CA\} depend largely on the type and context of \{CA\} being practised. It is thus imperative to profile the technology, the farmer socio-economic circumstances and the bio-physical environment in which the farmer operates for proper geographical and beneficiary targeting to achieve greater impact. More longer-term studies are required to fully elucidate the benefits and context of \{CA\} options and practice. "

Four yield potential trials with totally 59 leading cultivars from Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, and Xinjiang, China were conducted using a randomized complete block design with 3 replications under controlled environments in 2 successive cropping seasons from 2007 to 2009. The experimental sites were located in Chengdu in Sichuan, Lijiang in Yunnan, Wuwei in Gansu, and Changji in Xinjiang. Molecular markers were used to detect the presence of dwarfing genes and 1B/1R translocation. The results indicated that the annual genetic gains in yield were 0.73% in Sichuan, 0.34% in Yunnan, 0.58% in Gansu, and 1.43% in Xinjiang. There was no obvious trend of yield component improvement for yield increase in Sichuan; while reduced spikes per square meter and increased kernels per spike were the main factor for yield increase in Yunnan; increased kernels per spike were the main factor for yield increase in Gansu; and increased kernel weight of main spike and harvest index were the main factor for yield increase in Xinjiang, together with the contribution from reduced plant height and earlier maturity. It also indicated that the dwarfing genes Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b were all from International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) lines, and the significant progresses of genetic gain in yield in the 4 provinces were mainly due to the direct and indirect use of \{CIMMYT\} germplasm. Stripe rust resistance was the main contribution of \{CIMMYT\} germplasm in Sichuan and Yunnan; while \{CIMMYT\} germplasm contributed to high yield potential with high kernel number per spike, short plant height, and wide adaptability in Xinjiang and Gansu.

Nevertheless, the challenge of increasing food production in the \{IGP\} in line with demand grows ever greater; any perturbation in agriculture will considerably affect the food systems of the region and increase the vulnerability of the resource-poor population. Increasing regional production is already complicated by increasing competition for land resources by non-agricultural sectors and by the deterioration of agri-environments and water resources. Global environmental change (GEC), especially changes in climate mean values and variability, will further complicate the agricultural situation and will therefore, have serious implications for food systems of the region. Strategies to reduce the vulnerability of the region's food systems to \{GEC\} need to be based on a combination of technical and policy options, and developed in recognition of the concurrent changes in socioeconomic stresses. Adaptation options need to be assessed with regard to their socioeconomic and environmental efficacy, but a greater understanding of the interactions of food systems with \{GEC\} is needed to be able to do this with confidence. This paper discusses information needs relating to resource management and policy support to guide the development of research planning for increasing the robustness of \{IGP\} food systems to GEC. Further information is needed to develop a range of adaptation strategies including augmenting production and its sustainability, increasing income from agricultural enterprises, diversification from rice–wheat systems, improving land use and natural resource management, and instigating more flexible policies and institutions.

The largest survey to date of Se status of Australians found a mean plasma Se concentration of 103 μg/l in 288 Adelaide residents, just above the nutritional adequacy level. In the total sample analysed (six surveys from 1977 to 2002; n=834), plasma Se was higher in males and increased with age. This study showed that many South Australians consume inadequate Se to maximise selenoenzyme expression and cancer protection, and indicated that levels had declined around 20% from the 1970s. No significant genotypic variability for grain Se concentration was observed in modern wheat cultivars, but the diploid wheat Aegilops tauschii L. and rye (Secale cereale L.) were higher. Grain Se concentrations ranged 5–720 μg/kg and it was apparent that this variation was determined mostly by available soil Se level. Field trials, along with glasshouse and growth chamber studies, were used to investigate agronomic biofortification of wheat. Se applied as sodium selenate at rates of 4–120 g Se/ha increased grain Se concentration progressively up to 133-fold when sprayed on soil at seeding and up to 20-fold when applied as a foliar spray after flowering. A threshold of toxicity of around 325 mg Se/kg in leaves of young wheat plants was observed, a level that would not normally be reached with Se fertilisation. On the other hand sulphur (S) applied at the low rate of 30 kg/ha at seeding reduced grain Se concentration by 16%. Agronomic biofortification could be used by food companies as a cost-effective method to produce high-Se wheat products that contain most Se in the desirable selenomethionine form. Further studies are needed to assess the functionality of high-Se wheat, for example short-term clinical trials that measure changes in genome stability, lipid peroxidation and immunocompetence. Increasing the Se content of wheat is a food systems strategy that could increase the Se intake of whole populations. "

The seasonal estimates of gs showed an apparent decline under high evaporative demand in all moisture regimes.

The paper mainly aims at identifying the main drivers of household behavior regarding collection of main forest products in the context of dry forest environment. A multivariate probit analysis was used to explain variation in household participation in collection of different forest products. The results show that households' participation in collection of different forest products is significantly determined by a combination of household demographic characteristics, ownership of oxen and of cows, proximity to forest, access to health and school infrastructure, resettlement history and self-reported change in standard of living. The estimation results also suggest households most likely to engage in collection of forest honey, gum, and wood for fuel and other purposes are those located farther from the forest.

abstract = "Abstract Wheat seed storage proteins, especially glutenins and gliadins, have unique functional properties giving rise to a wide array of food products for human consumption. The wheat seed storage proteins, however, are also the most common cause of food-related allergies and intolerances, and it has become crucially important to understand their composition, variation and functional properties and interface this knowledge with the grain handling industry as well as the breeders. This review focuses on advances in understanding the genetics and function of storage proteins and their application in wheat breeding programs. These include: (1) The development and validation of high-throughput molecular marker systems for defining the composition and variation of low molecular weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) genes and a summary of the more than 30 gene-specific markers for rapid screening in wheat breeding programs; (2) The identification of more than 100 alleles of storage proteins in wild species provide candidate genes for future quality improvement; (3) The documentation of quality effects of individual LMW-GS and HMW-GS for improving end-use quality; and (4) The analysis of α-gliadin genes on chromosomes 6A and 6D with non-toxic epitopes as potential targets to develop less toxic cultivars for people with celiac disease. Genomic and proteomic technologies that will continue to provide new tools for understanding variation and function of seed storage proteins in wheat are discussed. "

The objectives of this study were to identify agronomic and photosynthetic traits associated with genetic gains in grain yield of facultative wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) between 1981 and 2008 in Henan Province, the most important wheat producing area in China. During the 2006–2007 and 2007–2008 crop seasons, a yield potential trial comprising 18 leading and new cultivars released between 1981 and 2008 was conducted at two locations, using a completely randomised block design of three replicates. Results showed that average annual genetic gain in grain yield was 0.60% or 51.30 kg ha−1 yr−1, and the significant genetic improvement in grain yield was directly attributed to increased thousand grain weight which also contributed to the significant increase in harvest index. The genetic gains in rates of net photosynthesis at 10, 20 and 30 days after anthesis were 1.10% (R2 = 0.46, P &lt; 0.01), 0.68% (R2 = 0.31, P &lt; 0.05) and 6.77% (R2 = 0.34, P &lt; 0.05), respectively. The rates of net photosynthesis at 10 (r = 0.58, P &lt; 0.05), 20 (r = 0.59, P &lt; 0.05) and 30 (r = 0.65, P &lt; 0.01) days after anthesis were closely and positively correlated with grain yield. A slight decrease in leaf temperature and an increase in stomatal conductance after anthesis were also observed. Grain yield was closely and positively associated with stomatal conductance (r = 0.69, P &lt; 0.01) and transpiration rate (r = 0.63, P &lt; 0.01) at 30 days after anthesis. Therefore, improvement of those traits was the likely basis of increasing grain yield in Henan Province between 1981 and 2008. The genetic improvement in yield was primarily attributed to the utilization of two elite parents Yumai 2 and Zhou 8425B. The future challenge of wheat breeding in this region is to maintain the genetic gain in grain yield and to improve grain quality, without increasing inputs for the wheat–maize double cropping system.

Conservation Agriculture (CA) has been promoted to achieve this goal, based on three principles: minimum tillage, soil surface cover, and diversified crop rotations. \{CA\} originated in regions where fertilizer is commonly used and crop productivity is high, ensuring an abundance of crop residues. By contrast, crop yields are generally low in \{SSA\} and organic residues in short supply and farmers face competing demands for their use. Since minimal tillage without mulch commonly results in depressed yields, the use of fertilizer to enhance crop productivity and organic residue availability is essential for smallholder farmers to engage in CA. This is especially true since alternative ways to increase organic matter availability have largely failed. A case study from Kenya clearly demonstrates how fertilizer increases maize stover productivity above thresholds for minimal initial soil cover required for initiating \{CA\} (about 3 tonne ha−1). We conclude that strategies for using \{CA\} in \{SSA\} must integrate a fourth principle – the appropriate use of fertilizer – to increase the likelihood of benefits for smallholder farmers. "

However, when using datasets that are unbalanced over time and space, there is increasing exposure to different genotype – environment combinations and interactions that may make predictions less accurate. Global cross-validated genomic prediction accuracies may be high when using large historic datasets but accuracies for individual years using a forward-prediction approach, or accuracies for individual locations, are often much lower. The objective of this study was to evaluate the overall accuracy of genomic predictions for untested genotypes using an unbalanced dataset to train a genomic selection model, and to explore ways of combining genomic selection and genotype-by-environment (G×E) interaction models to better target untested lines to different locations. Using the International Center for Maize and Wheat Improvement's (CIMMYT) Semi-Arid Wheat Yield Trials (SAWYT) we assessed the accuracy of genomic predictions and the potential to subset these nurseries using the concept of mega-environments (ME) adapted to a genomic selection context. We found that there was no difference in accuracy between models accounting for G×E interactions and global models. Data-driven methods of clustering locations based on similarities in genomic predictions also failed to improve accuracies within clusters. Using a simulation based on the empirical \{SAWYT\} data, we found that if there were different true genotypic values between clusters, there was an advantage to modeling G×E in prediction models. In the \{SAWYT\} dataset it appears that there is not a consistent pattern of genotype-by-environment interaction among the ME, and this dataset is not balanced enough to partition into new clusters that have predictive power.

These interactions shape the soil as a habitat for the soil food web and the vegetation and, thereby, regulate the two main life-supporting processes on Planet Earth: production and decomposition. Changes in decomposition and production processes are governed by (human-induced) changes in vegetation composition/cover, the amounts and quality of organic residues and (in)organic fertilizers entering the soil. Such modifications alter the physical environment and the soil biota. Hence, decomposition and production processes cannot be understood and/or manipulated without explicitly addressing the composition and activity of the soil food web. Using a conceptual model, we argue that quantitative understanding of biophysical interactions, in particular those between soil fauna and soil structure, are paramount to understanding biological and biochemical processes in soil and the availability of water and nutrients to plants. The need to increase the efficiency of crop production worldwide, to reverse soil degradation and to increase soil resilience will set the agenda for soil ecologists in the near future. "

The natural abundance of \{C13\} is quantified by near infrared spectra (NIRS) with a remote reflectance fibre optic probe, applying the probe directly to the soil samples. Discriminate partial least squares analysis of the near infrared spectra allowed to classify soils with and without residues, regardless of the type of tillage or rotation systems used with a prediction rate of 90% in the internal validation and 94% in the external validation. The \{NIRS\} calibration model using a modified partial least squares regression allowed to determine the δ13C in soils with or without residues, with multiple correlation coefficients 0.81 and standard error prediction 0.5‰ in soils with residues and 0.92 and 0.2‰ in soils without residues. The ratio performance deviation for the quantification of δ13C in soil was 2.5 in soil with residues and 3.8 without residues. This indicated that the model was adequate to determine the δ13C of unknown soils in the −16.2‰ to −20.4‰ range. The development of the \{NIR\} calibration permits analytic determinations of the values of δ13C in unknown agricultural soils in less time, employing a non-destructive method, by the application of the fibre optic probe of remote reflectance to the soil sample.

A field study was undertaken on permanently kept rainfed experimental plots established in 2005 on a vertisol in order to evaluate two resource saving cropping systems based on conservation agriculture (CA) that integrate in situ soil and water conservation tillage practices (derdero+ and terwah+) as compared to a conventional system in terms of soil moisture, runoff, water loss (drainage and evapotranspiration together), water productivity and crop yield. The experimental layout was a randomized complete block design with three replications and a plot size of 5 m × 19 m. The farming systems differed in tillage practice, but all had wheat, teff, barley and grass pea crops grown in rotation. The tillage treatments were (i) derdero+ (DER+) with a furrow and permanent raised bed planting system, plowed only by refreshing the furrow once at planting with no tillage on top of the permanently kept raised beds, 30% standing crop straw retention, and with ∼20% of the crop residue being covered with soil during refreshing the furrow at planting, (ii) terwah+ (TER+) with furrows made at 1.5 m intervals, plowed once at planting, 30% standing crop straw retention and fresh broad beds, and crop residue being partly covered with soil during tillage at planting, and (iii) conventional tillage (CT) with a minimum of three plain tillage operations and complete removal of crop straw. All plowing as well as the maintenance of the furrows of the permanent raised beds was done using a local ard plow called mahresha. Glyphosate was sprayed at 2 l ha−1 to control weeds before crop emergence, starting from 2007 with DER+ and TER+. Runoff was collected at the lower end of each plot in calibrated runoff collectors after each runoff event. Soil–water content was measured using the gravimetric method at 5–6 day intervals. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was measured in the field at several phenological stages, using a handheld GreenSeeker™ Optical Sensor Unit. Soil–water storage (0–80 cm soil depth) during the growing season was always highest with DER+ followed by TER+ and CT, whereas the opposite trend was observed for runoff. On the other hand, deep drainage and evapotranspiration was always highest in the DER+ compared to CT. \{NDVI\} records throughout the growing season were significantly highest with DER+ for wheat and grass pea, while the highest values were observed with TER+ when under teff. These values were directly proportional to the above ground crop biomass and yield. The grain and straw yield of wheat in 2009 was increased from 1.6 and 3.7 t ha−1 with \{CT\} to 2.6 and 5.2 t ha−1 with DER+, respectively. Our study demonstrates that field water conservation tillage practices that incorporate \{CA\} principles are effectively increasing green water in the root zone available for crops and thus, improve crop productivity and yields substantially on vertisols in drylands without other inputs.

Conventional (CT) and zero tillage (ZT) are two common soil management systems. Comparative field studies under controlled conditions are required to determine the impact of these systems on soil quality and yields. The research presented studied plant and soil physical and chemical characteristics as affected by different agricultural management practices, i.e. \{ZT\} and CT, cropped with continuous wheat or maize in monoculture (M) or in a yearly rotation (R) of these two crops, either with residue retention (+r) or without residues retention (−r), in an experimental field in the Transvolcanic Belt of Mexico after 14 years. The dominant factors defining soil quality were organic C, total N, moisture, aggregate stability, mechanical resistance, pH and EC. The principal component combining the variables organic C, total N, aggregate stability and moisture content showed the highest correlations with final yield (R = 0.85 for wheat and 0.87 for maize). After 14 years of continuous practice, \{ZTM\} + r and \{ZTR\} + r had the best soil quality and produced the highest wheat and maize yields of average 2001–2004 (6683 and 7672 kg ha−1 and 5085 and 5667 kg ha−1, respectively). Removing the residues, i.e. treatments \{ZTM\} − r with maize (average 2001–2004: 1388 kg ha−1) and \{ZTR\} − r and \{CTR\} − r with wheat (average 2001–2004: 3949 and 5121 kg ha−1), gave the lowest yields and less favourable soil physical and chemical characteristics compared to the other practices. It was found that zero tillage with residue retention is a feasible management technology for farmers producing maize and wheat in the agro-ecological zone studied, resulting in a better soil quality and higher yields than with the conventional farmer practice (maize monoculture, conventional tillage and residue removal).

Increasing average temperatures by 1.7 °C observed over several seasons at Obregon, Mexico reduced the time to flowering by 11 days and resulted in a decline of total biomass and grain yield. These effects were reproduced by the model, except when the observed total biomass inexplicably rose again in the fourth and fifth year, despite higher temperature and a much shorter growing time. In a water stress experiment, the effects of different timing and duration of water deficit on crop growth and yield were reproduced with the model for a rain-shelter experiment at Lincoln, New Zealand where observed grain yields were reduced from 10 to 4 t ha−1 due to increased water deficit. In experiments from Western Australia, reduced growth and yields due to extreme terminal water deficit were also reproduced with the model where measured yields fall below 0.5 t ha−1. In the Maricopa Free Air Carbon-Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) experiment in Arizona, USA, the largest yield increase occurred with elevated \{CO2\} in the dry and high N treatments, whereas little or no response was observed in the wet and low N supply treatments, as simulated with the model. Combining elevated \{CO2\} with increased temperature in a sensitivity analysis, two levels of water supply and a range of N applications indicated a positive effect of elevated \{CO2\} on yield as long as N was not limiting growth. Increased temperature and reduced water supply reduced yields and the yield response to N supply under ambient and elevated CO2. Grain protein concentrations were reduced under elevated CO2, but the difference was minor with ample N fertiliser. Evapotranspiration was reduced under elevated CO2. Higher temperatures increased evapotranspiration with low N input, but reduced it with ample N fertiliser, resulting in a reduction and an increase, respectively, in drainage below the root zone. In the Mediterranean environment of Western Australia the impact of elevated \{CO2\} and increased temperature on grain yield was in average positive, but varied with seasonal rainfall distribution. Based on the range of model testing experiments and the sensitivity analysis, APSIM-Nwheat was found suitable for studies on directional impacts of future climate change on wheat production. Due to some large discrepancies between simulated and observed data, field experiments representing only a limited range of possible climate change scenarios and the large possible range of factorial interactions not tested, simulated quantitative effects with the model should be interpreted cautiously.

To address these constraints, promising integrated crop management technologies were evaluated, using a multi-locational design in four sub-locations in Siaya and Vihiga district (western Kenya) for six cropping seasons. Technologies evaluated consisted of the traditional maize (Zea mays L.) – bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) intercrop, maize – Desmodium (Desmodium uncinatum (Jacq.) DC.) push–pull intercrop, Crotalaria (Crotalaria ochroleuca G. Don) – maize rotation, and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) – maize rotation. Within each of these systems, imazapyr-coated herbicide-resistant maize (IR-maize) and fertilizer were super-imposed as sub-plot factors. The push–pull system was observed to significantly reduce Striga emergence and stemborer damage from the second season onwards. IR-maize reduced and delayed Striga emergence from the first cropping season. Differences in Striga emergence and stemborer damage between the other systems were not significantly different. After five cropping seasons, the Striga seedbank was significantly higher in the maize-bean intercrop system than in the push–pull system under both maize varieties while the rotational systems had intermediate values not different from the day zero values. Under IR-maize, the Striga seedbank was significantly lower than under local maize for all cropping systems. Maize yields varied between seasons, districts, and cropping systems. Yields in the push–pull system were higher than in the maize-bean intercrop after two seasons and in the absence of mid-season drought stress. Both maize and soybean responded significantly to fertilizer application for both districts and for most seasons. The various interventions did not substantially affect various soil fertility-related parameters after five seasons. In the short term, IR-maize integrated in a push–pull system is the most promising option to reduce Striga while the rotational systems may need a longer timeframe to reduce the Striga seedbank. Finally, farmer-led evaluation of the various technologies will determine which of those is really most acceptable under the prevailing farming conditions. "

In 1991, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) initiated a long-term field experiment at its semi-arid highland experiment station in Mexico (2240 masl; 19.31°N, 98.50°W; Cumulic Phaeozem) to investigate the long-term effects of tillage/seeding practices, crop rotations, and crop residue management on maize and wheat grown under rainfed conditions. Soil ecology status contributes to agricultural system sustainability, and evaluations were made to determine the effect of different management practices on soil microbial biomass (SMB) (substrate-induced respiration (SIR) and chloroform fumigation incubation (CFI)) and micro-flora physiological and catabolic diversity (BIOLOG™ ecoplate well system). SMB-C (CFI, SIR) was significantly and respectively 1.2 and 1.3 times higher for residue retention (average 387 mg C kg−1dry soil and 515 mg C kg−1dry soil, respectively) compared to residue removal. SMB-C (CFI) was significantly higher for wheat (369 mg C kg−1dry soil) compared to maize (319 mg C kg−1dry soil). SMB-N (CFI) was significantly 1.3 times higher for residue retention (average 28 mg N kg−1dry soil) compared to residue removal. The average well color development (AWCD) obtained by the BIOLOG™ ecoplate essay indicated there were large differences in the catabolic capability of soil microbial communities after 15 years of contrasting management practices. While maize and wheat rotation under conventional tillage with residue retention showed a significantly higher overall \{AWCD\} value compared to the other treatments, \{AWCD\} of maize with zero tillage and residue removal was significantly lower than in the other treatments. \{AWCD\} was significantly higher for residue retention compared to residue removal and for wheat as compared to maize. For maize, the management practices were divided into two groups; zero tillage with residue removal was separate from all other treatments. For wheat, conventional tillage was separate from all zero tillage treatments. This study suggests that in the target area, a cropping system that includes zero tillage, crop rotation, and crop residue retention can increase overall biomass and micro-flora activity and diversity compared with common farming practices. In the long term, zero tillage combined with residue retention creates conditions favourable for the development of antagonists and predators, and fosters a new ecological stability. Zero tillage without residue retention is an unsustainable practice that leads to poor soil health in the long run. "

Innovative integrated technologies have been developed: the ‘push–pull’ system (intercropping with Desmodium and surrounded by Napier grass), soybean and Crotalaria rotations, and imidazolinone-resistant (IR) maize seed. In 12 demonstration trials in four villages in Siaya and Vihiga districts (Kenya) and two villages in Busia (Uganda) in 2003 and 2004, 504 farmers evaluated all cropping systems and a mono-cropped continuous maize, each cropped with \{IR\} or local maize, and supplemented or not with fertilizer, totaling 16 treatments. Farmers evaluated all treatments for yield, resistance to Striga and stem borer, improvement of soil fertility, and provided an overall evaluation score, using an ordered scale of 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). Data were analyzed using ordinal regression, estimating log odds ratios. The results show significant preferences for all treatments over the control. Push–pull with \{IR\} and fertilizer had the highest log odds ratio (2.93), so the odds of farmers preferring this treatment are 18.7 times the odds that farmers prefer the control. The odds ratios for the other push–pull combinations were generally highest (9–15), followed by the rotation systems with Crotalaria (3.5–7.0), and soybeans, especially with \{IR\} maize and fertilizer (odds ratio of 5.7). In mono-cropping systems, \{IR\} maize was only appreciated in combination with fertilizer, and then only in 2004. Push–pull and Crotalaria were more appreciated in 2004 than in 2003. Farmers in Vihiga had a stronger preference for push–pull, and those in Busia for soybean rotations. Significant differences among farmers were observed, but the effects were small. Women appreciated push–pull more than men, while other technologies were gender-neutral. Older farmers were more likely to prefer push–pull and Crotalaria with fertilizer. Livestock ownership was not found to have an effect on technology preferences. Measured yield, stem borer and Striga infestation all had significant but small effects, although their inclusion did not eliminate the treatment effects, indicating that other factors are still important. \{OLS\} of the scores for different criteria on the overall score shows yield to be the most important criterion (coefficient of 0.40), followed by soil fertility enhancement (0.25) and Striga resistance (0.13). Labor saving (0.09) and stem borer resistance (0.03) are relatively minor criteria. This research shows that scoring and analysis with ordinal regression is a convenient way to solicit and analyze farmers’ preferences for new technologies, with wide applicability in farming systems and participatory research. Its application here shows that farmers like the new technologies, especially push–pull, but that there are substantial differences between years, sites and farmers. The use of this method can be very helpful to define and focus further research and formulate specific and targeted recommendations for agricultural extension. "

The capacity of local farming communities and their institutions to respond to the new and emerging impacts of climate change is often constrained by lack of access to information and improved technologies, as well as poor support mechanisms to promote assimilation of new knowledge. This threatens to heighten vulnerability of the majority of SSA's rural communities who are already facing severe problems of food insecurity and a declining soil resource base. In this paper we use two case studies from Wenchi district in Ghana and Makoni in Zimbabwe to communicate how participatory action research (PAR) methodology, characterised by iterative planning–action–reflection cycles, was coupled with a new concept of field-based farmer learning centres to build adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers to climate change. The study was part of a University of Zimbabwe—led project supported under the Climate Change Adaptation in Africa (CCAA) programme to explore the state of resilience in African smallholder farming. The \{PAR\} and learning centre processes enabled communities, local leaders, and extension agents and researchers to establish the, hither to, imperceptible link between poor soil fertility and rising institutional challenges within communities. Institutional conflicts related to land tenure and sharecropping arrangements between migrant farmers and native landowners were addressed in Ghana, while local institutions supporting traditional social safety net mechanisms were revitalized in Zimbabwe. In both cases, it was apparent that farmers faced multiple stresses, at the core of which were poor and declining soil fertility and weakening local institutions. The worsening rainfall distribution and increasing cases of drought are broadening the scope for vulnerability, often driving competing claims and conflicts. \{PAR\} was successfully used as an entry point, empowering communities to self-mobilize and self-organize to co-learn and experiment with integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) technologies and other improved farming practices. They realised opportunities for achieving high crop yields and generate surpluses in good years. Strengthening local institutional capacity to revitalise community safety nets proved an essential ingredient for enhancing adaptive capacity of smallholders to climatic shocks. The \{PAR\} process was a major driver of effective partnerships among community members, extension, policy makers and researchers, but ensuing success generated a new set of social challenges that could not be addressed within the short timescale of the project. We conclude that \{PAR\} was a suitable mechanism for supporting self-organization and co-learning processes among smallholder farmers and their service providers, enabling them to use \{ISFM\} technologies and strengthen their local institutions around natural resource management. This revealed the scope for building adaptive capacity of these communities against climate change and variability. "

Conservation agriculture (CA)-based resource-conserving technologies (RCTs) vis-à-vis zero-till (ZT), raised-bed planting and direct-seeded rice (DSR) have shown promise as alternatives to conventional production technologies to overcome these problems. The integration of CA-based \{RCTs\} with precision agriculture (PA)-based technologies in a systems perspective could provide a better option for sustainable \{RW\} production systems. In this study we attempted to evaluate conservation and precision agriculture (CPA)-based \{RCTs\} as a double-ZT system integrated with laser-assisted precision land leveling (PLL) in the \{RW\} system. A field experiment was conducted in the western \{IGP\} for 2 years to evaluate various tillage and crop establishment methods under \{PLL\} and traditional land leveling (TLL) practices to improve water productivity, economic profitability and soil physical quality. Irrespective of tillage and crop establishment methods (TCE), \{PLL\} improved \{RW\} system productivity by 7.4% in year 2 as compared to traditional land leveling. Total irrigation water savings under \{PLL\} versus \{TLL\} were 12–14% in rice and 10–13% in wheat. \{PLL\} improved \{RW\} system profitability by US$113 ha−1 (year 1) to $175 ha−1 (year 2). Yields were higher in conventionally transplanted rice followed by direct-drill-seeded rice after ZT. In wheat, yields were higher in \{ZT\} when followed by \{DSR\} than in the conventional-till (CT) system. \{RW\} system productivity under double \{ZT\} was equivalent to that of the conventional method. Among different TCE, conventional puddled-transplanted rice-CT wheat required 12–33% more water than other \{TCE\} techniques. Compared with \{CT\} systems, double \{ZT\} consumed 12–20% less water with almost equal system productivity and demonstrated higher water productivity. The \{CT\} system had higher bulk density and penetration resistance in 10–15 and 15–20 cm soil layers due to compaction caused by the repeated wet tillage in rice. The steady-state infiltration rate and soil aggregation (&gt;0.25 mm) were higher under permanent beds and double \{ZT\} and lower in the \{CT\} system. Under CT, soil aggregation was static across seasons, whereas it improved under double no-till and permanent beds. Similarly, mean weight diameter of aggregates was higher under double \{ZT\} and permanent beds and increased over time. The study reveals that to sustain the \{RW\} system, CPA-based \{RCTs\} could be more viable options: however, the long-term effects of these alternative technologies need to be studied under varying agro-ecologies.

This paper focuses on farming systems in the semi-arid areas of Zimbabwe, where biomass production is limited and farmers integrate crop and livestock activities. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is promoted to intensify crop production, emphasizing the retention of surface mulch with crop residues (CR). This paper quantifies the associated potential economic trade-offs and profitability of using residues for soil amendment or as livestock feed, and explores alternative biomass production options. We draw on household surveys, stakeholder feedback, crop, livestock and economic modeling tools. We use the Trade-Off Analysis Model for Multi Dimensional Impact Assessment (TOA-MD) to compare different \{CR\} use scenarios at community level and for different farm types: particularly the current base system (cattle grazing of maize residues) and sustainable intensification alternatives based on a \{CA\} option (mulching using maize residues ± inorganic fertilizer) and a maize–mucuna (Mucuna pruriens) rotation. Our results indicate that a maize–mucuna rotation can reduce trade-offs between \{CR\} uses for feed and mulch, providing locally available organic soil enhancement, supplementary feed and a potential source of income. Conservation Agriculture without fertilizer application and at non-subsidized fertilizer prices is not financially viable; whereas with subsidized fertilizer it can benefit half the farm population. The poverty effects of all considered alternative biomass options are however limited; they do not raise income sufficiently to lift farmers out of poverty. Further research is needed to establish the competitiveness of alternative biomass enhancing technologies and the socio-economic processes that can facilitate sustainable intensification of mixed crop-livestock systems, particularly in semi-arid environments.

By using in silico mapping of BAC-end-derived \{SSR\} loci of pigeonpea on the soybean genome as a reference, putative mapping positions at the chromosome level were predicted for 6284 \{ISR\} markers, covering all 11 pigeonpea chromosomes.

Trade-offs among soil C, crop and animal and crop productivity were analysed using the NUANCES-FARMSIM (FArm-scale Resource Management SIMulator) dynamic model. Retention on the soil surface of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% of the maize stover yield produced per farm, and the use of the remainder as animal feed was quantified over a 12 year period for four farm types in Murehwa, Zimbabwe. Retaining 100% maize residues in the field led to an annual loss of on average 68 and 93 kg body weight per animal for cattle on farms of the relatively wealthiest farmers (Resource Group, RG1) who had most land and cattle and \{RG2\} respectively), and is therefore unsustainable for livestock production. There was an increase in grain yield of 1.6 t farm−1 and 0.7 t farm−1 for \{RG1\} and \{RG2\} respectively. Farmers without cattle (RG3 and RG4) may have a greater incentive for retaining their crop residues but they have to invest labour to keep the residues during the dry season. However, improved crop productivity for these farmers is limited by lack of access to fertiliser. The current practice of allocating all crop residues to animals results in average gross margin of US$7429 and US$4037 for \{RG1\} and \{RG2\} farmers respectively. Our results showed that from an economic perspective, it is logical that farmers prioritise the sustenance of cattle with crop residues over soil fertility management. We conclude that at current productivity levels, farmers who own cattle have limited scope to allocate crop residues for soil cover as it leads to significant loss in animal production and economic value.

Recent research shows the potential of \{GS\} to reshape wheat breeding. Many authors have concluded that the estimated genetic gain per year applying \{GS\} is several times that of conventional breeding. \{GS\} is, however, a new technology for wheat breeding and many programs worldwide are still struggling to identify the best strategy for its implementation. This article provides practical guidelines on the key considerations when implementing GS. A review of the existing \{GS\} literature for a range of species is provided and used to prime breeder-oriented considerations on the practical applications of GS. Furthermore, this article discusses potential breeding schemes for GS, genotyping considerations, and methods for effective training population design. The components of selection intensity, progress toward inbreeding in half- or full-sibs recurrent schemes, and the generation of selection are also presented. "

These validation trials are paired plot comparisons of conventional agricultural practice and conservation agriculture that had been established between 2004 and 2009. Traditional cropping systems vary across the study area although they all are tillage based and maize is the main crop grown. The treatments proposed on the validations trials reflect this variability in conventional practice and propose an adapted conservation agriculture option. The sites are thus grouped into four specific treatment comparisons. Bulk density and soil C concentrations were measured from samples collected at four depth layers (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm and 30–60 cm), thereafter C stocks were calculated. On the basis of the stover biomass harvest C inputs were assessed. No consistent differences in bulk density and soil C concentrations were found. Carbon stocks were found to be positively influenced by conservation agriculture only when a mouldboard ploughed maize-legume rotation was compared to a direct seeded maize legume rotation (with residue retention). Even when increases were significantly greater under conservation agriculture the order of magnitude was small (∼2 Mg ha−1). Limited C inputs, ranging between 0.1 and 1 g C kg−1 soil yr−1, are likely to be the major bottleneck for C increase. These results, based on on-farm validation trials indicate that there is a limited potential for conservation agriculture to significantly increase soil C stocks after up to 7 years of conservation agriculture practices, in the studied systems.

However, the benefits of \{CA\} likely depend on the biophysical and socioeconomic context in which \{CA\} technologies are implemented and whether or not all components of \{CA\} are in place. To better understand the effect of key \{CA\} components on soil quality and nutrient use efficiency, an on-farm field trial was conducted during the second year of an irrigated field experiment in Chiapas, Mexico. The experiment included two levels each of tillage and residue management in a full factorial design (three replicates each) with the following treatments: 1) conventional tillage with crop residue; 2) conventional tillage without crop residue; 3) zero tillage with crop residue; and 4) zero tillage without crop residue. In each replicate plot (8 × 20 m) a 15N labeled microplot (0.95 × 0.93 m) was established and fertilized according to standard rates. Mid-season soil samples were analyzed for total and available (Bray) P, as well as microbial community composition using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Crop yield, nutrient uptake, and aggregate-associated soil organic matter were evaluated at harvest. Crop residue retention led to small increases in aggregate stability and greater fungal PLFA. The retention of crop residues also resulted in a 110% increase in the recovery of fertilizer-derived N in vegetative biomass, leading to a marginally significant increase of 41% for total recovery of fertilizer N in the soil-crop system. Effects of tillage were less prominent, but conventional tillage was found to improve mid-season available P by roughly 60%. These results indicate that \{CA\} technologies, residue retention in particular, offer a promising set of options for farmers to improve soil functioning and reduce fertilizer-N losses, particularly for sandy soils within sub-humid tropical regions.

Since its detection in Spain in 2006, the pest is continuing to expand its geographical range, including the recent detection in several Sub-Saharan African countries. The present study proposed a model based on cellular automata to predict year-to-year the risk of the invasion and spread of T. absoluta across Africa. Using, land vegetation cover, temperature, relative humidity and yield of tomato production as key driving factors, we were able to mimic the spreading behavior of the pest, and to understand the role that each of these factors play in the process of propagation of invasion. Simulations by inferring the pest’s natural ability to fly long distance revealed that T. absoluta could reach South of Africa ten years after being detected in Spain (Europe). Findings also reveal that relative humidity and the presence of T. absoluta host plants are important factors for improving the accuracy of the prediction. The study aims to inform stakeholders in plant health, plant quarantine, and pest management on the risks that T. absoluta may cause at local, regional and event global scales. It is suggested that adequate measures should be put in place to stop, control and contain the process used by this pest to expand its range. "

With expansion of arable land and resultant decline in grazing resources, crop residues are becoming an increasingly important component of livestock feeds. This demand for livestock feeds has implications for the long-term sustainability of such systems since failure to return biomass to soils has implications for soil quality and the capacity of soils to support long-term productivity. Biomass allocation patterns are likely to vary with overall level of productivity and hence availability. In this study we used a household survey to quantify crop residue allocation patterns across a gradient of productivity in Eastern Africa focusing on two sites in Ethiopia and one in Kenya. We assessed the underlying determinants of crop residue allocation patterns with a view to understanding how productivity increases through intensification will influence biomass allocation in Eastern Africa and how livelihood and natural resource management objectives could be optimized. Results showed that farmers strongly favour allocation of residues to livestock feeding but that allocation to soil increases along the productivity gradient. This reduced feeding to livestock and increased allocation to soil fertility is associated with smaller farm sizes leading to reduced animal traction needs for tillage, increased overall livestock productivity, increased use of inputs and a reduced reliance on farm-based activities in overall livelihood strategies. The implications of these trends are that productivity increases in smallholder systems are likely to reduce pressure on biomass in the long term and that measures that enhance the prospects for farmers to intensify their production systems are likely to increase soil health and sustainability objectives in general. A key conclusion of the work is that intensification of livestock production could reduce crop residue allocation to soils with long term implications for soil productivity. "

The study comprised 14 non-commercialized hybrids (seven pairs of near-isogenic Bt and non-Bt hybrids) and four non-Bt commercial hybrids. Each plant was artificially infested twice with 10 first instar larvae. In CFT, plants were infested with C. partellus 14 and 24 days after planting; in BGH, plants were infested with B. fusca 21 and 31 days after planting. In CFT, the seven Bt hybrids significantly differed from their non-Bt counterparts for leaf damage, number of exit holes, percent tunnel length, and grain yield. When averaged over three seasons, Bt-hybrids gave the highest grain yield (9.7 t ha−1), followed by non-Bt hybrids (6.9 t ha−1) and commercial checks (6 t ha−1). Bt-hybrids had the least number of exit holes and percent tunnel length in all the seasons as compared to the non-Bt hybrids and commercial checks. In \{BGH\} trials, Bt-hybrids consistently suffered less leaf damage than their non-Bt near isolines. The study demonstrated that \{MON810\} was effective in controlling B. fusca and C. partellus. Bt-maize, therefore, has great potential to reduce the risk of maize grain losses in Africa due to stem borers, and will enable the smallholder farmers to produce high-quality grain with increased yield, reduced insecticide inputs, and improved food security.

The improvement of guayule for commercial-scale production could be accelerated through genomics-assisted breeding, but such a strategy is severely limited by the paucity of available genomic tools and well-characterized genetic resources. To that end, we used genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to simultaneously identify and genotype tens of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers across 62 plant samples from seven wild and cultivated guayule, three Parthenium interspecific hybrid, four mariola (Parthenium incanum Kunth), and one wild quinine (Parthenium integrifolium L.) accession(s) that have been characterized for ploidy level and nuclear genome size in this and a prior study. Phylogenetic analysis using the \{SNP\} data identified at least two distinct sources of guayule breeding material in the cultivated accessions, previously unknown multi-species hybrids within two Parthenium hybrid cultivars, and guayule/mariola hybrids within one guayule and one mariola wild collected accession. Similar to previously reported results for guayule and mariola, we observed aneuploidy and multiple ploidy levels among individual plants (mixed ploidy) within three Parthenium interspecific hybrid accessions newly characterized in this study. Nuclear genome size characterization of wild quinine, a first for this species, found an estimated haploid nuclear genome size (5757 Mb) for the tetraploid (2n = 4x = 72) accession that was more than 1.5-fold larger than that of tetraploid (2n = 4x = 72) guayule or mariola. Together, these results further underscore the need for a comprehensive characterization of available guayule germplasm and sister taxa with both \{SNP\} markers and flow cytometry, illustrate the novel utility of \{GBS\} for the genus Parthenium, and lay the foundation for genomics-assisted breeding in guayule.

Such data are generally difficult to obtain from the literature, field surveys and focused group discussions, or from biophysical experiments. This article describes a spreadsheet-based methodology that generates this information based on a region specific production function and ‘target yield’ approach in current and future climate scenarios. Target yields are identified for homogeneous agroecological spatial units using published crop yield datasets, crop models, expert judgement, biophysical land characterisations, assessment of yield gaps and future development strategies. Validated production/transfer functions are used to establish relationships between inputs (water, seed, fertilizer, machinery, energy, labour, costs) and outputs (crop yields, residues, water and fertiliser use efficiencies, greenhouse gas emissions, financial returns). The process is repeated for all spatial units of the region, identified through detailed mapping of critical biophysical factors, and for all suitable current and potential agronomic production technologies and practices. The application of this approach is illustrated for prioritizing agronomic interventions that can enhance productivity and incomes, help farmers adapt to current risk, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions in current and future climates for the flood- and drought-prone state of Bihar in north-eastern India. In general, climate smartness increases with advanced technologies. Yield is the least limiting while emission is the most limiting factor across the entire crop-technology portfolio for climate smartness. Finally, we present a robust climate smart land use plan at district level in Bihar under current and future climate scenarios. "

The genotypes were divided into two groups of 10 and 23 entries with and without the 1B/1R translocation, respectively. 1B/1R translocation lines had significantly high amounts of ω-gliadins, and low levels of glutenin and low molecular weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS), but no significant difference in dough properties and \{CSB\} quality from non-translocation lines.

Various stakeholders from national agricultural research services (NARS), networks, non-governmental organizations (NGO’s) and research institutes seek to develop and target productivity enhancing resource conserving management practices such as crop residue retention systems. To support this process, a methodology with explicit spatial and temporal dimensions using the \{DSSAT\} crop simulation models was developed and applied to the case study of residue retention in maize production systems of Jalisco, Mexico. Systems where crop residues were partially or totally retained were compared with systems with no residue retention. Variables considered included crop production, soil surface runoff water, soil organic carbon and soil organic nitrogen content. Gridded climate surfaces and a range of soil profile scenarios formed the basis of the regional input. Three levels of nitrogen application (0, 150 and 235 kg ha−1) were selected to represent current agronomic practices. Simulation models for maize and fallow were run in sequence for 12 consecutive years. Results demonstrated that soil water holding capacity and topography affected benefits of residue retention much more than nitrogen management. Benefits to maize production from residue retention were found mainly in areas in the northeast of Jalisco and surrounding regions, where low precipitation limits maize production. Reductions in soil surface runoff due to residue retention were most evident in high rainfall areas in the central-east of Jalisco and surrounding regions. Although the effect of soil loss is not accounted for in DSSAT, areas of pronounced soil surface runoff reduction are hypothesized to be areas of productivity gain in the longer term. The assessment provided insight in the regional potential for and the soil and climate conditions under which successful introduction of residue retention in maize cropping systems in Jalisco may be achieved. In combination with socio-economic assessment studies and experimental work, the approach and its results contribute to targeted introduction of new production technologies. "

The allelic diversity at Glu-B1 locus include subunits 6+8b∗, 7, 7+8, 7+8a∗, 7b∗+8, 7OE, 7OE+8, 7OE+8a∗, 7OE+8b∗, 7+9, 13+16, 14+15, 17+18 and 20. The rapid identification of HMW-GS capability of MALDI-TOF-MS is discussed in relation to its value for screening lines in wheat breeding programs, especially in discriminating subunits 7OE, 8a∗ and 8b∗ associated with superior quality. A new glutenin subunit 7b∗+8 was found in Japanese germplasm Eshimashinriki. "

The objectives of this study were to develop gene specific primers for the allele Pina-D1b, evaluate the method for the identification of Pinb-D1p with restriction enzyme PflMI and characterize allelic variations at Pina and Pinb loci in Shandong wheat germplasm. Based on the nucleotide sequences of Ha locus reported previously (CR626934 and CR626926), 121 primer sets were developed to test the Pina-D1b allele. Sequence alignment showed that the promoter region of Pina-D1b allele was highly conserved in the region from −1134 to −23 bp relative to the transcription start codon ATG. Pinb-D1p was first reported in Chinese wheat landraces, with a base A deletion at position 213 in the coding region. Restriction analysis of Pinb-D1p indicated that the base A deletion resulted in the missing of the cleavage site with enzyme PflMI and the digestion with PflMI was validated as a reliable tool for the identification of Pinb-D1p allele. A total of 523 wheat accessions from Shandong province including 431 landraces, 63 historical and 29 current cultivars were chosen for the test of \{SKCS\} hardness and identification of puroindoline alleles using \{DNA\} markers developed in this study and those reported previously.

It can be grown as an additional crop after harvesting winter crops such as winter wheat, winter legumes and oilseeds and before planting main season rice from the low-altitude Terai through to the middle hills of Nepal. Replacing short fallows in the spring, it provides additional high quality food, enhances soil fertility and increases the yield of the following crop. In spite of continued varietal research by the National Grain Legume Research Programme, no mungbean varieties were released from 1975 to 2006. The old variety, Pusa Baishakhi, was released in 1975, but became susceptible to Mungbean Yellow Mosaic Virus (MYMV) and several other diseases so mungbean became limited to a rarely grown, green manure crop. In 2003, we introduced four mungbean varieties resistant to \{MYMV\} from the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Centre. These were evaluated in participatory varietal selection (PVS) mother and baby trials in low fertility and droughted conditions using farmers’ levels of inputs and management. Variety spread was promoted by distributing free small seed samples in a process known as Informal Research and Development (IRD); and community-based seed production and marketing. Of the four varieties, \{NM94\} and \{VC6372\} consistently produced higher grain yields than the local check varieties, were resistant to \{MYMV\} and hence were preferred by farmers. The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives endorsed a new variety release procedure in 2005 that permitted the use of data from \{PVS\} trials to support the release or registration of new crop varieties. In 2006, on the basis of data generated from \{PVS\} trials alone, the National Seed Board released \{NM94\} as ‘Kalyan’ while, on the basis of combined data from the \{PVS\} trials and from on-station trials, \{VC6372\} (45-8-1) was released as ‘Prateeksha’. The use of \{PVS\} contributed greatly to fast-tracking the release process and this resulted in farmers getting new MYMV-resistant mungbean varieties more quickly. Varieties spread rapidly through \{IRD\} and farmer-to-farmer seed networks and provided benefits to farming households. Regulatory reforms to speed up and simplify the process of varietal release are discussed. "

A medium-term tillage experiment was carried out (2005–2010) on a Vertisol to quantify changes in runoff, soil loss and crop yield due to Conservation agriculture (CA) in the sub-humid May Zegzeg catchment. A randomized complete block design with 3 replications on permanent plots of 5 m by 14 m was used for three tillage treatments, (i) derdero+ (DER+), permanent raised beds with 30% standing crop residue retention and no-tillage on the top of the bed, (ii) terwah+ (TER+), ploughed once at sowing with 30% standing crop residue retention and furrows made at 1.5 m interval, and (iii) conventional tillage (CT) with a minimum of three tillage operations and removal of crop residues. Tillage operations in the three treatments were done using the local ard plough mahresha. Local crop rotation practices followed during the six years sequentially from the first to the sixth year included wheat-grass pea-wheat-hanfets (wheat and barley sown together)-grass pea-wheat. Glyphosate was sprayed starting from the third year (2007) at 2 L/ha before planting to control pre-emergent weed in DER+ and TER+. Runoff and soil loss were measured in collector trenches at the lower end of each plot. Soil organic matter was determined at two depths (0–15 cm) and (15–30 cm). Local farmers evaluated crop stands. Significantly different (p &lt; 0.05) 4-yr mean soil losses of 14, 17 and 26 t/ha, 5-yr mean runoff depth of 76, 95 and 118 mm, and 5-yr runoff coefficient of 19, 24 and 30% were recorded for DER+, TER+ and CT, respectively. Soil organic matter was significantly higher in DER+ and TER+ compared to CT. The mean farmers’ evaluation of crop performance in the last three years (2008–2010) showed a significant higher score for DER+ (6/8) followed by TER+ (5.6) and least for \{CT\} (4.8/8), and improvements in crop yield were observed; however, a period of at least five years of cropping was required before the difference became significant. In addition to the positive effects on runoff, soil loss and crop yield, we argue that avoiding repeated tillage which is 10–11 oxen-span days per ha and the faster ploughing pace at sowing in DER+ will enable a reduction in oxen density with further natural resource benefits. \{DER\} + and TER+ are improvements to good local practices that qualify them as CA: we recommend large scale dissemination and implementation on Vertisols.

The phenotypic variability of these physiological traits responsible for variation in \{GN\} and the relationships among them was analyzed in an elite wheat doubled-haploid (DH) population grown in two different environments. Positive transgressive segregation (i.e. \{DH\} lines that exceed parental phenotypic values) was observed for all \{GN\} determining traits, suggesting that increases in \{GN\} could be achieved through their improvement. However, focusing on top \{DH\} lines, which represent a feasible genetic improvement, fruiting efficiency was the most relevant physiological trait for consistently improving GN, and thereby grain yield, in both environments.

This study reports the results of a methodology for identifying and prioritizing local, stakeholder-driven response options to climate change in agriculture. The approach is based on multi-criteria scoring methods previously applied to research planning and priority-setting in agricultural and natural resource management research, public health, and other areas. The methodology is a sequential approach built around needs assessments by local stakeholders; the incorporation of climate science results; the sharing of these results and climate adaption response options with stakeholders at a series of workshops; stakeholder priority-setting exercises using multi-criteria scoring; and validation with policymakers. The application is to three diverse agroecosystems in Mexico, Peru and Uruguay. Among the many findings is that, notwithstanding the wide diversity of agro-ecosystems, there are numerous similarities in the agricultural adaptation responses prioritized by local stakeholders. "

Harnessing the rich source of wild relatives has been negligible due to differences in ploidy level as well as genetic drag and undesirable alleles for low yield. Lack of appropriate genomic resources has severely hampered molecular breeding activities, and this crop remains among the less-studied crops. The last five years, however, have witnessed accelerated development of genomic resources such as development of molecular markers, genetic and physical maps, generation of expressed sequenced tags (ESTs), development of mutant resources, and functional genomics platforms that facilitate the identification of \{QTLs\} and discovery of genes associated with tolerance/resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses and agronomic traits.

The complex nature of drought tolerance, genotype × environment interaction, and the difficulty of effective drought tolerance screening complicate the development of drought tolerant varieties. This study reports on progress made by a collaborative network of Indian rice breeding programs, in partnership with International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), to develop lines combining high yield potential with drought tolerance by employing direct selection for grain yield under drought stress, and testing their performance in rainy season managed-drought screenings (RSMDS) of different stress severity levels at several locations during the main season in rainfed rice production areas in India. Advanced-generation breeding lines of less than 100 days, 100–120 days, and greater than 120 days duration generated at eight national institutes and \{IRRI\} using diverse drought tolerant donors were evaluated in 2005–2007 under RSMDS. Stress was imposed at the reproductive stage, either by draining paddies shortly after transplanting for lowland trials, or by stopping irrigation before flowering for upland trials. Yield reduction of 34–53% under moderate stress and 65–88% under severe stress was achieved in comparison to irrigated controls. Several varieties that have been widely grown in rainfed environments in India for many years, including \{IR\} 36, \{IR\} 64, Mahamaya, Sambha Mahsuri, and Swarna, were shown to be highly susceptible. Breeding lines were identified that perform consistently better than these and other widely grown rainfed varieties under both moderate and severe drought stress without any yield penalty under fully irrigated conditions. In the combined analysis over locations and years, these promising breeding lines outyielded the widely grown controls by about 0.5 t ha−1 under moderate stress and 0.7–1.0 t ha−1 under severe stress. \{IRRI\} breeding lines contributed to the network were developed using a selection protocol involving replicated dry season managed-drought screening (DSMDS) in dry season at Los Banos, Philippines. For a subset of lines extensively tested both at \{IRRI\} and in India, correlations between yield under \{DSMDS\} in the Philippine and yield in \{RSMDS\} in India were moderately high, indicating the efficacy of dry-season \{MS\} screening at \{IRRI\} in identifying tolerant lines for India. Drought tolerant lines developed by the network members have been released in several Indian states and in the Philippines. Overall, these results indicate that managed stress screening for drought tolerance, with a focus on selection for yield under stress, is effective in generating drought-tolerant cultivars. "

abstract = "In communal areas of \{NE\} Zimbabwe, feed resources are collectively managed, with herds grazing on grasslands during the rainy season and mainly on crop residues during the dry season, which creates interactions between farmers and competition for organic resources. Addition of crop residues or animal manure is needed to sustain agricultural production on inherently poor soils. Objectives of this study were to assess the effect of village-level interactions on carbon and nutrient flows, and to explore their impact on the long-term productivity of different farm types under climate variability. Crop and cattle management data collected in Murewa Communal area, \{NE\} Zimbabwe was used together with a dynamic farm-scale simulation model (NUANCES-FARMSIM) to simulate village-level interactions. Simulations showed that grasslands support most cattle feed intake (c. 75%), and that crop residues produced by non-cattle farmers sustain about 30% of the dry season feed intake. Removal of crop residues (0.3–0.4 t C ha−1 yr−1) from fields of non-cattle farmers resulted in a long-term decrease in crop yields. No-access to crop residues of non-cattle farmers increased soil C modestly and improved yields in the long-term, but not enough to meet household energy requirements. Harvest of grain and removal of most crop residues by grazing cattle caused a long-term decline in soil C stocks for all farm types. The smallest decrease (−0.5 t C ha−1) was observed for most fertile fields of cattle farmers, who manure their fields. Cattle farmers needed to access 4–10 ha of grassland to apply 3 t of manure ha−1 yr−1. Rainfall variability intensifies crop–livestock interactions increasing competition for biomass to feed livestock (short-term effect) or to rehabilitate soils (long-term effect). Prolonged dry seasons and low availability of crop residues may lead to cattle losses, with negative impact in turn on availability of draught power, affecting area under cultivation in consecutive seasons until farmers re-stock. Increasing mineral fertiliser use concurrently with keeping crop residues in fertile fields and allocating manure to poor fields appears to be a promising strategy to boost crop and cattle productivity at village level. The likelihood of this scenario being implemented depends on availability of fertilisers and decision of farmers to invest in rehabilitating soils to obtain benefits in the long-term. Adaptation options cannot be blind to what occurs beyond field and farm level, because otherwise recommendations from research and development do not fit the local conditions and farmers tend to ignore them.

A conservation agriculture (CA) experiment was conducted in 2006 at Gumselasa, Northern Ethiopia, on experimental plots established in 2005 on a farmer's field. The objectives of this experiment were to evaluate the short-term changes in soil quality of a Vertisol due to the implementation of conservation agriculture practices and to assess their effect on soil erosion, crop yield and yield components of tef (Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter). The treatments were permanent bed (PB), terwah (TERW) and conventional tillage (TRAD). Soil organic matter (SOM) was significantly higher in \{PB\} (2.49%) compared to \{TRAD\} (2.33%) and \{TERW\} (2.36%). Although aggregate stability of \{PB\} (0.94) was higher than \{TRAD\} (0.83), the difference was not significant. \{PB\} had larger macroporosity (0.07 m3 m−3) compared to the other treatments. \{PB\} reduced runoff volume by 50% and \{TERW\} by 16% compared to TRAD. \{PB\} also reduced soil loss by 86% and \{TERW\} by 53% in comparison to TRAD. Despite the above soil physical quality improvements and effectiveness in runoff and soil loss reduction, biomass and plant height of tef were significantly higher in \{TRAD\} than PB. The significantly high weed dry matter at first weeding, the types of weeds and their water uptake behavior might have caused the lower tef yield on the PB. We therefore recommend that appropriate rate of herbicides must be used while growing tef using \{CA\} practices. "

This process has a profound influence on what form of mineral-N is absorbed, used by plants, and retained in the soil, or lost to the environment, which in turn affects N-cycling, N-use efficiency (NUE) and ecosystem health and services. As reactive-N is often the most limiting in natural ecosystems, plants have acquired a range of mechanisms that suppress soil-nitrifier activity to limit N-losses via N-leaching and denitrification. Plants’ ability to produce and release nitrification inhibitors from roots and suppress soil-nitrifier activity is termed ‘biological nitrification inhibition’ (BNI). With recent developments in methodology for in-situ measurement of nitrification inhibition, it is now possible to characterize \{BNI\} function in plants. This review assesses the current status of our understanding of the production and release of biological nitrification inhibitors (BNIs) and their potential in improving \{NUE\} in agriculture. A suite of genetic, soil and environmental factors regulate \{BNI\} activity in plants. BNI-function can be genetically exploited to improve the BNI-capacity of major food- and feed-crops to develop next-generation production systems with reduced nitrification and \{N2O\} emission rates to benefit both agriculture and the environment. The feasibility of such an approach is discussed based on the progresses made. "

However, the adoption of \{OF\} by farmers is occurring more slowly than is advocated. A key factor limiting farmers is an inability to predict socio-economic consequences of converting to OF. To overcome this, we developed a novel method of integrated assessment of agricultural systems (IAAS) and applied it to scenarios of development of \{OF\} in the Camargue region, South of France. In collaboration with the local stakeholders, we characterized the agricultural systems at different spatial scales and defined scenario related to the future of agriculture and to OF. We then used agent-based modeling with farmers and bio-economic modeling with local stakeholders for scenario assessment. We examined the effects on the development of \{OF\} systems of key factors such as the ongoing reform in the European Common Agricultural Policy and the effects of regulations for decreased use of pesticides. The policy reform implied trends towards a diversification of crops and greater possibility for conversion to OF. Development of \{OF\} at the regional level led to improved environmental performance, but caused a decrease in profitability of the rice supply chains. In light of the observed trade-off between rice production and \{OF\} development, objectives and options towards more sustainable agricultural systems were discussed with farmers and local stakeholders. Stakeholders' assessment of the framework provided insights on the positive and specific aspects of the \{IAAS\} methodology requiring improvement. The complementarities of agent-based and bio-economic modeling provide stakeholders with a better-informed assessment of diverse scenarios, for the development of more sustainable agricultural systems.

A series of farm surveys was conducted in two distinct agro-ecological zones of eastern India to evaluate the importance of crop management and structural constraints for maize productivity in a range of socio-economic settings prevalent in smallholder farms. Surveys revealed yield gap and yield variations among farms across growing seasons. Lower yields of farmers were mainly associated with farmer's ethnic origin, availability of family labor, land ownership, legumes in cropping sequence, irrigation constraints, seed type, optimal plant population, labor and capital investment, and use of organic manure. These constraints varied strongly between sites as well as growing seasons. Stochastic Frontier Analysis suggested intensification of farm input use and removal of socio-economic and structural constraints for increasing efficiency in maize production. The use of multivariate classification and regression tree analysis revealed that maize yield was affected by multiple and interacting production constraints, differentiating the surveyed farms in six distinct resource groups. These farm types lend scope for introducing typology-specific crop management practices through appropriate participatory on-farm evaluation/trials. Summarily, this research indicated that interacting production constraints should be addressed simultaneously, considering the need of different farm types, if significant productivity improvements are to be achieved. This will be, however, more challenging for less endowed farms due to lack of social and financial capital to improve management intensity.A typology-specific farm support strategy may be formulated to offset this lack of entitlement among resource-poor farmers.

abstract = "Abstract Agroforestry has attracted considerable attention in recent years because of its potential to reduce poverty, improve food security, reduce land degradation and mitigate climate change. However, progress in promoting agroforestry is held back because decision-makers lack reliable tools to accurately predict yields from tree-crop mixtures. Amongst the key challenges faced in developing such tools are the complexity of agroforestry, including interactions between various system components, and the large spatial domains and timescales over which trees and crops interact. A model that is flexible enough to simulate any agroforestry system globally should be able to address competition and complementarity above and below ground between trees and crops for light, water and nutrients. Most agroforestry practices produce multiple products including food, fiber and fuel, as well as income, shade and other ecosystem services, all of which need to be simulated for a comprehensive understanding of the overall system to emerge. Several agroforestry models and model families have been developed, including SCUAF, HyPAR, Hi-SAFE/Yield-SAFE and WaNuLCAS, but as of 2015 their use has remained limited for reasons including insufficient flexibility, restricted ability to simulate interactions, extensive parameterization needs or lack of model maintenance. An efficient approach to improving the flexibility and durability of agroforestry models is to integrate them into a well-established modular crop modeling framework like APSIM. This framework currently focuses on field-scale crops and pastures, but has the capability to reuse or interoperate with existing models including tree, livestock and landscape models, it uses parameters that are intuitive and relatively easy to measure, and it allows scenario analysis that can include farm-scale economics. Various types of agroforestry systems are currently being promoted in many contexts, and the impacts of these innovations are often unclear. Rapid progress in reliable modeling of tree and crop performance for such systems is needed to ensure that agroforestry fulfills its potential to contribute to reducing poverty, improving food security and fostering sustainability.

Topsoil (0–5 cm) \{SOC\} concentrations were surveyed in a coffee agroforestry watershed (0.9 km2) on Andisols in Costa Rica with uniform farm management. We encountered high values and large spatial variations of SOC, from 48.1 to 172 g kg− 1 in the dry combustion set (SOCref; n = 72) used for calibrating the visible-near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIRS) samples (SOCVNIRS; 350–2500 nm; n = 520). \{VNIRS\} using partial least squares regression was effective in predicting \{SOC\} (R2 = 0.85; a root mean square error (RMSE) = 12.3 g kg− 1) and proved an effective proxy measurement. We assessed several topographic, vegetation and andic soil property variables, of which only the latter (metal–humus complexes and allophanes) displayed strong correlations with \{SOCref\} concentrations. We compared Random Forest and three geostatistical approaches for the interpolation of \{SOC\} in unsampled locations. Ordinary kriging with \{SOCref\} yielded an \{RMSE\} of 28.0 g kg− 1. Random Forest was successful in incorporating many weakly and non-linearly correlated covariates with \{SOC\} (RMSE = 14.7 g kg− 1), provided Alp (the sodium pyrophosphate extractable aluminum), the best predictor of \{SOC\} (r = 0.85) but also the most costly variable to acquire. Co-kriging with Alp also showed high reduction in \{RMSE\} (16.0 g kg− 1). Co-kriging with \{SOCVNIRS\} only showed marginal reduction in \{RMSE\} to 24.2 g kg− 1 due to the presence of a high nugget effect. Local variability of \{SOC\} in this volcanic agroforestry watershed was dominated by andic properties whereas topographic or vegetation variables had very little impact. Estimation of \{SOC\} variability is recommended using inexpensive proxy measurements like \{VNIRS\} (RMSE = 12.3 g kg− 1) rather than spatial interpolation techniques. "

Two of the natural enemies that were released got established and spread to many localities in the region. This study adopted the economic surplus model based on production, market and \{GIS\} data to evaluate the economic benefits and cost-effectiveness of the programme in three countries—Kenya, Mozambique and Zambia. Findings show that the biological control intervention has contributed to an aggregate monetary surplus of US$ 1.4 billion to the economies of the three countries with 84% from maize production and the remaining 16% from sorghum production. The net present value over the twenty years period was estimated at US$ 272 million for both crops and ranged from US$ 142 million for Kenya to US$ 39 million for Zambia. The attractive internal rate of return (IRR) of 67% compared to the considered discount rate of 10%, as well as the estimated benefit–cost ratio (BCR) of 33:1, illustrate the efficiency of investment in the \{BC\} research and intervention. The estimated number of people lifted out of poverty through the BC-programme was on average 57,400 persons (consumers and producers) per year in Kenya, 44,120 persons in Mozambique, and 36,170 persons in Zambia, representing an annual average reduction of poor populations, respectively of 0.35, 0.25 and 0.20% in each of the three countries.

We studied the impact of two \{RCA\} (derdero+ (DER+) and terwah+ (TER+) on long-term soil quality and crop productivity in permanently kept plots in northern Ethiopia 7 years after its inception. The two \{RCA\} practices: (i) DER+ is a bed and furrow planting system, where beds remain unploughed, furrows are tilled once at planting time and 30% of crop residue is retained. (ii) TER+ is ploughed once at planting, furrows are made at 1.5 m intervals, creating fresh broad beds, and 30% crop residue is retained. These \{RCA\} practices were compared against conventional tillage (CT) characterized by a minimum of three tillage operations and complete removal of crop residues. Among the several assessed soil properties, soil organic C (SOC), total soil N, available P, soil microbial biomass C (SMBC), time of ponding, aggregate stability index (SI), consistency index (CI), cone index, air capacity and macroporosity were shown to increase significantly in soils subjected to DER+ planting system compared to CT. On average, crop yields under DER+ and TER+ increased by 30 % and 16 %, respectively, as compared to CT. Thus, from an agro-ecological point of view, adopting improved local practices such as DER+ and TER+ planting systems that employ conservation agriculture principles proved to be sustainable, resource conserving alternatives and incentives should be provided to facilitate larger adoption by farmers in Ethiopia.

Highly significant genotype × environment interaction was observed in combined analyses across environments, leading to sub-grouping of sites into the high-yielding or favorable and low-yielding or unfavorable upland environment groups. A significant effect of management regime was observed. Averaged over 15 environments, the moderate-input treatment out-yielded the low-input treatment by nearly 65% or 0.8 t ha−1 under favorable environments and by nearly 48% (0.3 t ha−1) in unfavorable environments. A significant genotype effect and genotype × input management interaction for yield at favorable sites was observed. However, the same was not significant at unfavorable sites. Varietal differences were relatively small at unfavorable sites across input levels. The heritability estimates for grain yield were moderately high in both moderate- and low-input conditions in favorable environments. The genetic correlation between yields in moderate- and low-input conditions was high in both favorable and unfavorable environments. The study indicated that improved varieties performed well relative to landraces under low-input management. Improved varieties along with modestly intensified management offer an attractive option to increase the productivity of rainfed upland environments. For both favorable and unfavorable environments, indirect selection under moderate-input conditions was less efficient than direct selection for grain yield in low-input conditions, indicating upland breeding programs to adopt selection for grain yield under both moderate- and low-input conditions.

Chi-square analysis indicated that Pinb-2 variants 2 and 3 in all three \{F2\} populations segregated as a single bi-allelic locus, with segregation ratios fitting a 1:2:1 ratio. Using 448 of the 480 plants derived from these three \{F2\} populations, the average \{SKCS\} hardness index of plants homozygous for Pinb-2 variant 2 vs. those homozygous for variant 3 was not significantly different (67.5 vs. 67.9). Results indicated that plants with Pina-D1b/Pinb-D1a were on average 10.0 Single Kernel Characterization System (SKCS) hardness index units harder than those carrying the Pina-D1a/Pinb-D1b haplotype. In conclusion, Pinb-2 variants 2 and 3 are allelic and exert little effect on kernel texture in hard-kernel T. aestivum germplasm. Further, the designation of Pinb-2v2 and Pinb-2v3 should be changed to Pinb-B2a and Pinb-B2b, respectively. We propose that Pinb-2 variants 1 and 4 of Chinese Spring be designated Pinb-D2a and Pinb-A2a, respectively. "

Monitoring long-term changes in crop yields and identifying the factors associated with such changes are essential to maintain and/or improve crop productivity. Long-term experiments (LTE) provide these opportunities. We analyzed 33 rice–wheat \{LTE\} in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of South Asia, non-IGP in India, and China to investigate the extent of yield stagnation or decline and identify possible causes of yield decline. In treatments where recommended rates of N, P and K were applied, yields of rice and wheat stagnated in 72 and 85% of the LTE, respectively, while 22 and 6% of the \{LTE\} showed a significant (P&lt;0.05) declining trend for rice and wheat yields, respectively. In the rice–wheat system, particularly in the IGP, rice yields are declining more rapidly than wheat. The causes of yield decline are mostly location-specific but depletion of soil K seems to be a general cause. In over 90% of the LTE, the fertilizer K rates used were not sufficient to sustain a neutral K input–output balance. Depletion of soil C, N and Zn and reduced availability of P, delays in planting, decreases in solar radiation and increases in minimum temperatures are the other potential causes of yield decline. A more efficient, integrated strategy with detailed data collection is required to identify the specific causes of yield decline. Constant monitoring of \{LTEs\} and analysis of the data using improved statistical and simulation tools should be done to unravel the cause–effect relationships of productivity and sustainability of rice–wheat systems.

abstract = "Velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC. cv.-group utilis) is widely promoted in tropical and sub-tropical regions as a green manure cover crop that can reduce weed growth and soil erosion and enhance soil fertility. To provide these benefits, the crop must attain rapid ground cover and develop substantial aboveground biomass. To assist biophysical targeting of the crop to environments that can provide adequate growth conditions, the \{CROPGRO\} model was adapted to simulate velvet bean growth and development. This paper evaluates the performance of the model for phenology, growth, senescence and N accumulation for multiple locations that represent a range of environmental and agronomic management scenarios. Vegetative development, as described by main stem leaf appearance rate, varied linearly with thermal time. Time to flowering showed departures from the linear photoperiod response used in the model. Additional research is required to determine whether the crop is influenced by factors besides photoperiod and air temperature, especially water and nutrient deficits. The linear response to photoperiod did, however, provide reasonable values for partitioning to vegetative, reproductive and senesced materials. Simulation of nitrogen concentration for various plant components matched observed data. Sensitivity analyses evaluating the ability of the crop to provide ground cover, intercept light and develop adequate growth for soil protection and weed suppression indicated that a mean temperature of over 22 °C and a soil moisture holding capacity of at least 100 mm are required. The \{CROPGRO\} model proved to be a reliable decision support tool for guiding analyses of velvet bean response to crop management and environmental conditions. Further research, however, is warranted to improve its predictive capability, especially for phenology. "

We tested different crop management systems for irrigated rice in three seasons of adaptive research trials in three locations in the middle Senegal River Valley. Our objectives were to assess the agronomic and socio-economic viability of Recommended Management Practices (RMPs) compared to the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and Farmers’ Practices (FPs). During the 2008 dry season, \{RMP\} and \{SRI\} significantly increased yields over \{FP\} by 2.3 and 2.6 t ha−1 across sites. Farmers analyzed their experiences in post-experiment meetings. They appreciated SRI’s yield and water-saving potential, but found it labor demanding, especially for weed management requirements that coincided with horticultural activities. Conversely, farmers described RMP’s elevated herbicide rate as costly, and indicated that because of poorly functioning agro-chemical markets, herbicide volumes larger than typically used in \{FP\} might be difficult to reliably source. To modify management systems to fit farmers’ needs and assets, we collaboratively developed a fourth, ‘Farmer Adapted Practice’ (FAP) that blended \{RMP\} and SRI. \{FAP\} used intermittent irrigation during the late vegetative stage, recommended crop density, intermediate seedling age, and a single round of mechanical weeding followed by localized herbicide application. Farmers compared \{FAP\} against the initial management systems in the subsequent seasons. Though no yield differences were found between RMP, \{SRI\} and FAP, each yielded significantly more (+1.0, +1.1 and +1.5 t ha−1) than FP. \{FAP\} also reduced labor requirements without increasing weed biomass compared to \{RMP\} or SRI, and used 40% and 10% less herbicide than \{RMP\} and FP, respectively. Cumulative distribution functions showed that \{FAP\} increased net profit potential and decreased economic risk. Prior to the 2009 dry season trials, the Senegalese state eliminated herbicide subsidies, doubling their cost. RMP, \{SRI\} and \{FAP\} yielded 2.9, 3.0 and 3.1 t ha−1 more than FP. \{FAP\} again reduced weeding labor and herbicide requirements while lowering production risk across sites. This study demonstrates the value-added outcomes that result from research that facilitates farmer–researcher collaboration to learn from, innovate and tailor management systems to fit local circumstances.

Comprehensive transcriptome assemblies and genome sequences have either been developed or underway in these crops. Based on these resources, dense genetic maps, \{QTL\} maps as well as physical maps for these legume species have also been developed. As a result, these crops have graduated from ‘orphan’ or ‘less-studied’ crops to ‘genomic resources rich’ crops. This article summarizes the above-mentioned advances in genomics and genomics-assisted breeding applications in the form of marker-assisted selection (MAS) for hybrid purity assessment in pigeonpea; marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC) for introgressing \{QTL\} region for drought-tolerance related traits, Fusarium wilt (FW) resistance and Ascochyta blight (AB) resistance in chickpea; late leaf spot (LLS), leaf rust and nematode resistance in groundnut. We critically present the case of use of other modern breeding approaches like marker-assisted recurrent selection (MARS) and genomic selection (GS) to utilize the full potential of genomics-assisted breeding for developing superior cultivars with enhanced tolerance to various environmental stresses. In addition, this article recommends the use of advanced-backcross (AB-backcross) breeding and development of specialized populations such as multi-parents advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) for creating new variations that will help in developing superior lines with broadened genetic base. In summary, we propose the use of integrated genomics and breeding approach in these legume crops to enhance crop productivity in marginal environments ensuring food security in developing countries.

Principal component analysis was performed on model outputs at four sites. Results indicated that (i) differences in structure often resulted in similar predictions and (ii) similar structures can lead to large differences in model outputs. User subjectivity during calibration may have hidden expected relationships between model structure and behaviour. This explanation, if confirmed, highlights the need for shared protocols to reduce the degrees of freedom during calibration, and to limit, in turn, the risk that user subjectivity influences model performance.

Model improvements can improve the accuracy of simulations and reduce the uncertainty of climate change impact assessments. Furthermore, they can reduce the number of models needed in a MME. Herein, 15 wheat growth models of a larger \{MME\} were improved through re-parameterization and/or incorporating or modifying heat stress effects on phenology, leaf growth and senescence, biomass growth, and grain number and size using detailed field experimental data from the \{USDA\} Hot Serial Cereal experiment (calibration data set). Simulation results from before and after model improvement were then evaluated with independent field experiments from a \{CIMMYT\} world-wide field trial network (evaluation data set). Model improvements decreased the variation (10th to 90th model ensemble percentile range) of grain yields simulated by the \{MME\} on average by 39% in the calibration data set and by 26% in the independent evaluation data set for crops grown in mean seasonal temperatures &gt;24 °C. \{MME\} mean squared error in simulating grain yield decreased by 37%. A reduction in \{MME\} uncertainty range by 27% increased \{MME\} prediction skills by 47%. Results suggest that the mean level of variation observed in field experiments and used as a benchmark can be reached with half the number of models in the MME. Improving crop models is therefore important to increase the certainty of model-based impact assessments and allow more practical, i.e. smaller \{MMEs\} to be used effectively. "

Thus, it is essential to increase the efficiency in using water to ensure crop productivity. Quantifying crop water use (WU; i.e. actual evapotranspiration) is a critical step towards this goal. Here, sixteen wheat simulation models were used to quantify sources of model uncertainty and to estimate the relative changes and variability between models for simulated WU, water use efficiency (WUE, \{WU\} per unit of grain dry mass produced), transpiration efficiency (Teff, transpiration per kg of unit of grain yield dry mass produced), grain yield, crop transpiration and soil evaporation at increased temperatures and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations ([CO2]). The greatest uncertainty in simulating water use, potential evapotranspiration, crop transpiration and soil evaporation was due to differences in how crop transpiration was modelled and accounted for 50% of the total variability among models. The simulation results for the sensitivity to temperature indicated that crop \{WU\} will decline with increasing temperature due to reduced growing seasons. The uncertainties in simulated crop WU, and in particularly due to uncertainties in simulating crop transpiration, were greater under conditions of increased temperatures and with high temperatures in combination with elevated atmospheric [CO2] concentrations. Hence the simulation of crop WU, and in particularly crop transpiration under higher temperature, needs to be improved and evaluated with field measurements before models can be used to simulate climate change impacts on future crop water demand.

abstract = "Abstract Ensembles of process-based crop models are increasingly used to simulate crop growth for scenarios of temperature and/or precipitation changes corresponding to different projections of atmospheric \{CO2\} concentrations. This approach generates large datasets with thousands of simulated crop yield data. Such datasets potentially provide new information but it is difficult to summarize them in a useful way due to their structural complexities. An associated issue is that it is not straightforward to compare crops and to interpolate the results to alternative climate scenarios not initially included in the simulation protocols. Here we demonstrate that statistical models based on random-coefficient regressions are able to emulate ensembles of process-based crop models. An important advantage of the proposed statistical models is that they can interpolate between temperature levels and between \{CO2\} concentration levels, and can thus be used to calculate temperature and [CO2] thresholds leading to yield loss or yield gain, without re-running the original complex crop models. Our approach is illustrated with three yield datasets simulated by 19 maize models, 26 wheat models, and 13 rice models. Several statistical models are fitted to these datasets, and are then used to analyze the variability of the yield response to [CO2] and temperature. Based on our results, we show that, for wheat, a [CO2] increase is likely to outweigh the negative effect of a temperature increase of +2 °C in the considered sites. Compared to wheat, required levels of [CO2] increase are much higher for maize, and intermediate for rice. For all crops, uncertainties in simulating climate change impacts increase more with temperature than with elevated [CO2]. "
