abstract = "The very low level of success (about 15%) in patch budding of cacao, Theobroma cacao L. in the West African sub-region has been attributed to poor union success and deaths of new sprouts due to fungal infection. Trials at Cocoa Research Institute of Nigeria (CRIN) headquarters, Ibadan (Lat. 07°10′N Long. 03°52′E at alt. 122 m above mean sea level) showed that twig manipulation methods significantly affected bud-take (p&lt;0.0001). The ringing method applied to twigs 2 days before actual budding gave significantly (p&lt;0.05) more initial bud-take (70.0%) than the conventional method (54.0%). A dip treatment of budwood for 3 min in a solution of benomyl-active (Benlate®) fungicide at the rate of 5 g/4.5 1 of water, following an initial surface sterilization with 50% alcohol significantly reduced die back of nursery budding sprouts due to Botryodiplodia infection. A mean final bud-take of 62.0% on 3-month old budding sprouts was recorded for this treatment as compared with 28.0% in the conventional method. A procedural strategy is suggested to involve ringing twigs from which budwoods are to be collected 2 days before actual budding and cleaning the rootstocks and budwoods in benomyl solution (5 g/4.5 1 water) after an initial surface sterilization with 50% alcohol to improve brown budding efficiency.

abstract = "Phytophthora pod rot (Ppr) disease caused by Phytophthora megakarya is the major constraint to cocoa production in Cameroon. The development of resistant varieties requires the use of effective resistance testing methods. The repeatability and reliability of the leaf disc and detached pod tests, as applied in selection activities in Cameroon, were studied. Repeatability of the tests was estimated by calculating the correlation (r) between resistance scores of clones, progenies and individuals within progenies in different inoculations rounds of the leaf disc and detached pod tests. Such correlations were generally significant for both tests. For the leaf disc test, as expected, correlations were lower for individuals within seedling progenies than for the average of seedling progenies or of clones. This suggests that a higher number of replicate observations are required for correct evaluation of individual seedlings than for evaluation of the average level of resistance of progenies. Observations carried out 5 or 7 days after inoculation was highly correlated, suggesting that scoring in the leaf disc test may be done only once at 5, 6 or 7 days after inoculation. In one experiment the ranking of leaf disc and detached pod inoculation test results could be compared statistically, with data being significantly correlated (r 0.78). The reliability of the tests was evaluated by the correlations between results of the tests and the level of field infection. These were generally positive and significant, for the leaf disc and detached pod test. A variation between mean scores of 5 and 8 in the detached pod test appeared to be related to a 40% difference in field infection with P. megakarya in years with medium disease pressure. However, correlations with field resistance were not always significant, suggesting the influence of uncontrolled environmental factors affecting field observations or the results in the screening tests. It is concluded that the leaf disc and detached pod tests, if applied under standardized conditions, can be of great value to speed up selection for Ppr resistance. "

abstract = "Resistance to Phytophthora pod rot (Ppr) is becoming an increasingly important criterion for selection of new cocoa cultivars in Côte d’Ivoire. The predominant species of the pathogen, Phytophthora palmivora, causes pod losses of 10–15% but the more aggressive Phytophthora megakarya present in the eastern part of the country causes losses of 40–60%. The latter species is expected to continue its spread to the main cocoa belt in Côte d’Ivoire over the next decade. Since 2000, the Centre National de Recherche Agronomique has been selecting new cocoa cultivars with direct involvement of farmers. More than 250 farmers were visited and their knowledge is being used to collect accessions with high yield potential, with low pest (mirids) infestation or with low Ppr incidence. Farmers were capable of identifying mother trees with low Ppr incidence only in regions with high disease pressure (Abengourou and Aboisso). Open-pollinated seedling progenies obtained from 226 promising trees in farmers’ fields were screened for resistance to Ppr by inoculating leaf discs from nursery plants with spores of a P. palmivora isolate. Three clones (SCA6, \{PA150\} and NA79) and three recommended hybrids were used as control cultivars. The results of the leaf disc test confirmed the known variation of resistance of the control cultivars. The relative level of resistance of the farm accessions varied mainly between moderately resistant and susceptible, but several accessions could be considered as resistant, in relation to the control cultivars. The major part of the 15% most resistant farm accessions came from the Abengourou and Aboisso regions in the eastern part of the country. Progenies from mother trees that farmers had selected as showing low Ppr incidence in their fields also appeared to be more resistant in the leaf disc test. This suggests that the resistance identified to P. palmivora in the leaf disc test may be efficient in the field in areas infected with P. megakarya. It is recommended that the genetic diversity identified through participatory selection of promising mother trees in farmers’ fields be further exploited in breeding to obtain new hybrid or clonal cocoa cultivars with low incidence of Ppr, good yield and low mirid damage.

abstract = "Sustainable production of banana, plantain and enset in Africa is crucial to secure food and provide income to millions of people. These crops, however, are severely threatened by diseases, pests and environmental constraints. Most bananas in Africa are produced by small-scale farmers who often do not have the financial resources for sustained production by means of the application of chemical fertilisers, fungicides and pesticides. Biotechnology can provide a means whereby plants can be improved for sustainable cultivation. Applications of biotechnology include tissue culture technology, development of molecular markers, and genetic transformation. Biotechnology, however, should not be used in isolation to solve the problems in banana and plantain production in Africa, but should be incorporated into integrated disease and pest management programmes. South Africa has the infrastructure and capacity to play an important role in the training of scientists, research on production constraints, and implementation of biotechnological advances for the rest of Africa.
