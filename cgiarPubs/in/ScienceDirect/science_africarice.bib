abstract = "Traditional tropical japonica (Oryza sativa) and Oryza glaberrima cultivars are typically grown in low-input, subsistence production systems in the uplands of West Africa by resource-poor farmers. In these systems, low soil fertility (LF), which is generally associated with lower organic carbon content, and N and P availability, is one of the major constraints to rice productivity. Thus, cultivars adapted to \{LF\} are needed for the food security of farmers, who would otherwise be solely reliant on nutrient inputs to increase productivity. This study evaluated the performance of six diverse cultivars grown in \{LF\} and high soil fertility (HF) conditions with supplemental irrigation over two seasons. Average grain yield across all cultivars in \{LF\} was 54% of that in \{HF\} (156 vs. 340 g m−2). Three improved indica rice cultivars and \{CG\} 14 (O. glaberrima) out-yielded Morobérékan (traditional tropical japonica) and WAB450-IBP-38-HB (progeny from interspecific hybridization of tropical japonica and O. glaberrima) in \{LF\} (181 vs. 105 g m−2 on average). The high grain yield in \{LF\} was the result of large spikelet number m−2 due to superior tillering ability and high harvest index rather than biomass production. The high-yielding cultivars in \{LF\} consistently had lower leaf chlorophyll content and higher specific leaf area during the period from the early vegetative stage through the reproductive stage. Among them, two indica cultivars (B6144F-MR-6-0-0 and \{IR\} 55423-01) were also high yielding in HF. The use of improved indica cultivars adapted to LF, but also with input-responsiveness, appears to offer an attractive and economical approach to improving upland rice productivity and widening genetic diversity in this region.

This plant parasite reduces crop yields of maize and sorghum, the major staple food source of the region. Presently, there are no Striga-resistant maize varieties commercially available in Western Kenya. Striga resistant or tolerant maize would form an important part of an integrated control approach. To determine the response of the maize varieties most widely grown by farmers around Lake Victoria to Striga, a field experiment was conducted at two locations and over two seasons. The results showed a high variability among commercial maize varieties with respect to the effects of Striga parasitism. Short-cycle varieties have the lowest Striga densities but produce acceptable yields only in low-stress environments. Long-cycle varieties are too susceptible to Striga and are not completely adapted to the agro-ecological conditions of the region. Some medium-cycle varieties show level of resistance and/or tolerance to Striga while others supported high numbers of Striga and had reduced yield. Nevertheless, sufficient genetic variability exists to recommend varieties suitable to enable farmers to obtain some yield advantage by selecting those with the most Striga tolerance for a range of farming situations found in Western Kenya.

In addition to the costs of weed control, weeds account for yield losses estimated to be at least 2.2 million tons per year in sub‐Saharan Africa, valued at $1.45 billion, and equating to approximately half the current total imports of rice to this region. Important weeds in upland rice include the perennial species Cyperus rotundus, Imperata cylindrica and Chromolaena odorata, the annual species Euphorbia heterophylla, Digitaria horizontalis, and the parasitic weeds Striga spp. In lowland rice the perennial weeds: Cyperus rotundus, C. esculentus and Oryza longistaminata and annual weeds Sphenoclea zeylanica, Echinochloa spp., Cyperus difformis, C. iria, Fimbristylis littoralis, Ischaemum rugosum, and O. barthii cause serious losses. Common weed management practices in rice‐based cropping systems include soil tillage, clearance by fire, hand‐ or hoe‐weeding, herbicides, flooding, fallow and crop rotations, and these are often used in combination. Labor shortages and lack of access to information, inputs, and credits are widespread constraints for African farmers. To optimize financial, social and environmental costs and benefits, integrated and ecological management approaches are advocated. Locally adapted and affordable combinations of preventive measures and interventions should be targeted. Future weed research should aim to deliver the information and tools for the implementation of these approaches. This requires the generation of knowledge on weed biology and ecology and on the consequences of changes in management and the environment on weed populations. To address the diversity of rice‐based cropping systems in Africa, priorities need to be set and products and information delivered that take full account of local conditions. This will require farmer participatory approaches that are inclusive with respect to resource‐poor farmers and gender. "

The present study analyzed two \{LTFEs\} for intensive rice-based irrigated systems in the Senegal River valley at Ndiaye and Fanaye (Sahel savanna). The trials were established in 1991, contain six different fertilizer treatments and rice is grown two times per year. Soil types are a typical Orthithionic Gleysol and an Eutric Vertisol at Ndiaye and Fanaye, respectively. The objectives of the presented study were to analyze the effect of intensive irrigated rice cropping on the soil resource base by studying the changes of soil characteristics over time and by comparing soil N, P and K pools in different fertilizer treatments. In the \{LTFE\} at Ndiaye, topsoil pH values increased significantly from 5.5 to about 6.5 and electrical conductivity was high but remained stable. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and total soil nitrogen (TSN) dropped slightly after 16 consecutive seasons but the difference was statistically not significant. At both sites, exchangeable N ranged between 1.6 and 2.8% of \{TSN\} and fixed N accounted for 5.5–8.2% of TSN, with slightly higher values in Fanaye. Treatment differences in N dose had no significant effect on these parameters. Results of δ13C analysis showed a decrease due to rice cropping at both sites, and the measurements indicate high turnover rates of soil organic matter. Soil analyses of total soil P and K and of different pools indicated only small changes when these elements were applied at medium quantities. In contrast, treatments with N application only showed considerable soil P and K depletion, and rice cultivation without P and/or K application cannot maintain soil fertility. The soil mining process is relatively quick for P due to the naturally low soil P status, whereas the high soil K reserves buffer even important negative K balances for decades. It is concluded that irrigated rice cultivation in the region can maintain soil fertility if at least medium P doses are applied together with nitrogen. "

The paper argues that this is due to the neglect of market opportunity as a driving force for lowland use and the agro-ecological gradient as an important modifier. The gradient is linked to three modifiers of lowland use: the relative value of lowland cropping with respect to other livelihood strategies; the biophysical productivity of lowland cropping; and the access rights to lowlands. The paper applies a regression-based decomposition framework to analyze the factors affecting lowland use in West Africa. It uses community-level data from 1014 geo-referenced lowland units around four urban centers along an agro-ecological gradient in Côte d’Ivoire and Mali. Tobit models are used to explain the extent of lowland non-use in terms of seasonal fallow, its diversity in terms of rice and other crop cultivation and its land use intensity in terms of double cropping. A multinomial logit model is used to explain lowland cropping systems. Results highlight a positive link between closeness to urban markets and the extent, diversity and intensity of lowland use. The agro-ecological gradient in West Africa has a pronounced influence on agricultural lowland use, which tends to be more widespread, diverse and intensive proceeding towards the drier ecologies. Lowland development did increase the extent and intensity of lowland use, but by favoring the cultivation of rice, had a negative impact on the diversity of lowland use. Lowland use is also associated with migrants, particularly in the more humid ecologies. Research, policy and development implications are explored. An important lesson for scaling out is that it is not proximity to urban markets per se, but the associated market access which is the key driver for more significant lowland use. "

Deep rooting cultivars are more resistant to drought than those with shallow root systems. The present study sought to quantify the effects of different levels of drought on dry matter partitioning and root development of three rice cultivars \{CG14\} (Oryza glaberrima), WAB56-104 (O. sativa tropical japonica, improved) and WAB450-24-3-2-P18-HB (CG14 × WAB56-104 hybrid). Two experiments on assimilate partitioning under different levels of drought stress were conducted under rain shelters at the West Africa Rice Development Association, Mbe, Ivory Coast. \{PVC\} tubes (diameter = 0.2 m, height 0.6 m) containing about 25 kg of sandy loam were used for the drought stress experiments. For rooting depth and root distribution studies, the tubes were subdivided into four compartments of 0.15 m each. In the first trial, tubes with WAB56-104 were gradually droughted to five levels of soil moisture content that were kept constant thereafter. In the second trial, plants of all cultivars were subjected to three drought treatments: (1) constant soil moisture content at field capacity (about 22% moisture content), (2) constant soil moisture content of 14% (about −0.5 \{MPa\} soil matrix potential) and (3) constant soil moisture content of 9% (about −1 \{MPa\} soil matrix potential). Rice reacted to drought stress with reductions in height, leaf area and biomass production, tiller abortion, changes in root dry matter and rooting depth and a delay in reproductive development. Assimilate partitioning between root and shoot, determined from changes in dry matter, was not affected by drought when the plants were gradually stressed. In no case, additional biomass was partitioned to the roots; on the contrary, dry matter partitioning to the root completely ceased under severe stress. Due to the irrigation technique used, vertical soil moisture distribution varied little, but roots grew deeper under drought stress. This was particularly the case for the upland adapted WAB56-104. Implication for modeling of drought responses in upland rice systems is discussed. "

The present study proposes \{CRM\} as the most adequate term for the technology in view of the substantial controversy and confusion surrounding existing terms, particularly conservation tillage. \{CRM\} is a dual-purpose technology that combines conservation and productivity effects. Its conservation potential hinges on the presence of the crop residues as mulch. This mulch provides a protective layer to the soil surface that is extremely effective in halting soil erosion and also amends the soil ecology. Its productivity potential is twofold. First, the mulch tends to stabilise, and occasionally even enhance, crop yield. Second, it implies factor substitution and input use efficiency alterations. The paper presents the residue balance as an analytical tool to assess the current availability of residues—both in terms of current residue production and current residue destinations. Residue destinations typically include extraction, burning in situ, incorporation, weathering and retention as mulch. \{CRM\} has profound implications for crop management. First, \{CRM\} implies a set of necessary practices so as to ensure the retention of sufficient residues as mulch. Second, \{CRM\} may imply complementary adaptations in order to be able to grow a crop and/or maintain productivity levels. Therefore, \{CRM\} is not a simple add-on technology, but instead a complete package of cultural practices. The actual potential of the \{CRM\} technology depends on a comprehensive assessment of the socio-economic implications of the implied changes. This potential is site-specific and will diverge between the private and social viewpoint. \{CRM\} therefore is a promising dual-purpose technology—but no panacea for soil conservation in (semi-)tropical countries.

However, mulching is not a simple single component technology that can be easily transferred. It is a complex basket of interrelated practices—including (i) necessary practices so as to ensure the production and retention of sufficient mulch and (ii) complementary practices in order to be able to grow a crop and/or maintain yield levels. This typically implies several adaptations to the entire farm production system. Whether mulching actually is a viable component for smallholder conservation farming in developing countries depends on a number of factors, including bio-physical, technological, farm level and institutional factors. The combination of these factors determine the feasibility of and the economic returns to mulching practices—and thereby farmer acceptance. The development and dissemination of mulching for smallholders in (sub)tropical developing countries highlights a number of promising experiences—particularly in (sub)humid areas. Crop residue mulching can offer significant savings implied by reduced tillage and the potential to alleviate binding constraints for crop growth and/or farm productivity (e.g. water conservation; timeliness of land preparation and crop establishment). Its economic potential to a large extent depends on the opportunity costs of retaining the mulch and the opportunity cost of complementary changes (e.g. need for mulch adapted seeding equipment; alternative weed, pest and disease management practices). Cover crop mulching offers opportunities for smallholders by addressing soil fertility and weed management constraints. However, the potential of cover crop mulching seems to be restrained to the (sub)humid zones and instances where the opportunity cost of using land to grow cover crops is limited. Significant opportunities exist in agricultural systems with limited external input use and/or periodic fallowing. The pure investment nature of cover crop mulching remains problematic. Mulching only tends to be viable when property rights over residual crop biomass are observed and tenure is secure. It typically implies a transition phase before becoming fully socio-economically viable—in terms of farmer learning, investments, local adaptation and fine-tuning and institutional change. Further success in the development and dissemination of mulching for smallholders requires targeting areas with specific economic opportunities for mulching and an integrated approach with a practical orientation, farmer participation, community involvement, flexibility and a long-term perspective.

Widely used models such as \{ORYZA1\} give much consideration to environmental effects on growth (e.g. carbon assimilation) but assume that assimilate partitioning among organs is independent of the environment, thereby allowing for no or little phenotypic plasticity. The present study evaluated the effects of nitrogen (N) nutrition on dry matter and N partitioning, using data from previous studies in the Philippines on irrigated transplanted and direct-seeded \{IR64\} rice fertilized with six levels of N in one, and two levels in another study. Nitrogen application reduced dry matter partitioning to roots, particularly in direct-seeded rice. High N resources significantly increased dry matter partitioning to leaf blades at the expense of stems, but did not affect partitioning between panicles and the rest of the plant. Partitioning of dry matter to leaves decreased as the N concentration in the leaves (LNC) decreased, regardless of the cause of low LNC: low N rate, high population in direct-seeded rice, or phenological stage of the crop. Leaf partitioning of absorbed N, compared to dry matter, was high and varied little during early vegetative growth, but varied strongly from panicle initiation onwards, probably due to competition for N between leaves and the stem and the developing panicle. The possible structure of models that would simulate plasticity of assimilate and N partitioning is discussed on the basis of organ-specific phenological time axes and interacting supply and demand functions. The underlying assumption is that the observed effects of N nutrition on partitioning are mediated by the size of incremental assimilate pools. "

A large potential for expansion of irrigated areas exists particularly in the inland valleys of the humid forest zone. Current production is characterized by large variability in productivity, management practices and production constraints. Quantifying the variability in rice yield and identifying the determining factors are prerequisites to the development of site-specific recommendations and to improved targeting of technologies. Diagnostic on-farm trials were conducted on 64 irrigated lowland fields in the humid forest zone of southern Côte d'Ivoire, in 1995–1996. This was a part of the regional gradient study of irrigated systems from the desert margin to the humid forest zone. Cropping calendars, field operations and input use were monitored. Weed biomass, rice N uptake, and grain yield were determined in farmers' fields as well as in super-imposed, researcher-managed subplots (clean weeding, no N control, and mineral fertilizer N application). Rice yield potential was simulated by using the Oryza-S crop growth model. Yield losses were attributed to management factors based on performance of rice in researcher-managed subplots (management-related yield gap) and by multiple regression with management options. Grain yields varied between 0.2 and 7.3 Mg ha−1 with mean yields of 3.2 in partially and 4.2 Mg ha−1 in fully irrigated systems, 44% and 57% of the potential yield of 7.3 Mg ha−1, respectively. Age of seedlings at transplanting, timeliness of operations and application of P fertilizer were correlated to yield and explained 60% of the observed variability. Grain yield was correlated with N uptake (r2 = 0.93***) but not with N application rate. Split application of mineral fertilizer N was associated with a 0.48 Mg ha−1 yield increase (p = 0.002), regardless of the quantity applied. Additional weeding increased yield only in systems with imperfect irrigation. Weed biomass was reduced with improved water control and it increased with age of seedlings at transplanting, and was higher in direct-seeded than in transplanted rice. Echinochloa spp. were the most common weeds in fully irrigated systems and Panicum laxum was more common in the imperfectly irrigated fields. While improved water management was associated with substantial rice yield increases (1.16 Mg ha−1), the timeliness of transplanting, weeding and N fertilization appears to be the key to increased rice yields in the forest zone of West Africa.

Mathematical programming techniques are used to develop farm models in order to identify optimal farm plans, determine yield and profit effects, and identify key constraints to the use of RICM. Sensitivity analysis is used to assess the implications of the results for farmers in different resource endowment groups. Simulation results show significant increase in yield and farm income from improved crop and resource management for small-scale irrigated rice production. The optimal plan for farms in the high resource endowment group is to allocate all available land to the \{RICM\} technology basket. The resulting yield and net farm profits are 7400 kg ha−1 of paddy and 621 US$ ha−1, respectively, and these are significantly higher than yields and net profits from observed farmer practices. However, the optimal farm plan, output and net revenue are different for producers in the medium and low resource endowment groups. For these groups, the optimal plans are to adopt \{RICM\} components in combination with observed farmer practices. Yield and net farm revenue for the medium resource category are 6200 kg ha−1 and 507 US$ ha−1, respectively. For producers in the low resource group, the corresponding values are 5300 kg ha−1 and 383 US$ ha−1. The key constraints for farms in the high resource endowment category are land, credit and labor for harvest/post-harvest operations. The key constraints for producers in the medium resource endowment category are land and labor for harvest/post-harvest operations. For farmers in the low resource endowment category, labor for weeding and harvest/post-harvest operations are the main constraints. The importance of labor for weeding in this group is explained by the emphasis on manual weeding. We conclude that farms in all resource groups will realize yield and net revenue increases from the use of \{RICM\} technology options. However, the optimal farm plans, main constraints and associated increases in yield and net revenue are different for different resource levels. "

abstract = "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) faces multiple problems. The main one is improving the lives of the 30% of its population that suffers from extreme poverty and food insecurity. As more than 70% of the population lives off farming and related activities, agricultural development will have to play a major role in improving this situation. Fortunately, Africa has an abundant supply of natural resources that can support a huge expansion in food, specifically rice production. Because of strong demand, rice area expansion in \{SSA\} is larger than for any other crop. Total milled rice production increased from 2.2 million Mg in 1961 to 9.1 million Mg in 2004. Rice imports into \{SSA\} also increased from 0.5 million Mg of milled rice in 1961 to 6.0 million Mg in 2003 and \{SSA\} currently accounts for 25% of global rice imports, at a cost of more than US$1.5 billion per year. Therefore, many African governments accord high priority to developing their local rice sector as an important component of national food security, economic growth, and poverty alleviation. The abundant supply of agroclimatically suitable wetlands (~239 million ha) and water resources can support a large expansion in rice area and productivity. Currently, less than 5% of the potentially suitable wetlands are planted with rice because of various constraints. Expansion and intensification of rice cultivation in \{SSA\} will not compete with other crops in terms of land and water resources because, during the rainy season, only rice can be grown on low-lying wetlands, including inland valleys. In addition, the labor-intensive nature of rice cultivation will provide additional sources of work and income to the rural poor, especially women. Should labor shortages become acute, however, appropriate mechanization can be considered. Small farmers want to earn money from rice farming, but lack modern inputs and capital to fully exploit their rice lands as these items are limited or not available. This is where an innovative public–private partnership is desirable to support the intensification of rice farming. Rice is cultivated in four ecosystems of SSA: dryland (38% of the cultivated rice area), rainfed wetland (33%), deepwater and mangrove swamps (9%), and irrigated wetland (20%). Many abiotic stresses (drought, flood, and variable rainfall; extreme temperatures; salinity; acidity/alkalinity and poor soils, soil erosion, and high P fixation) and biotic constraints [weeds, blast, Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV), and African rice gall midge (AfRGM)] limit rice production on the continent. The changing climate is expected to further aggravate the abiotic constraints and reduce rice yields in all ecosystems. Rice production is also restricted by many technical, management, socioeconomic, health, and policy constraints. The constraints to irrigated wetland rice in the Sahel of \{SSA\} are similar to those faced by Asian farmers in the 1960s; therefore, well-tested irrigated rice technologies from Asia and elsewhere are being introduced and adapted to local conditions to obtain fast returns on investment. For rice in irrigated wetlands in the humid and moist savanna zones, rainfed wetlands, and drylands, locally developed \{NERICA\} (new rice for Africa) varieties and production technologies are being tested in target environments. The progenies of Oryza glaberrima and O. sativa subspecies indica are better adapted to rainfed and irrigated wetlands, while those of O. glaberrima and O. sativa subspecies japonica are more suited to rainfed drylands. In addition, research is ongoing to tackle SSA-specific problems such as \{RYMV\} and AfRGM and to develop efficient crop management technologies. Currently available best management practices (integrated crop management options) for different rice ecosystems are shown in Table XV. Additional support through the provision of technical advice through revamped national R&amp;D services; a supply of good-quality seed and other inputs, including farm credit; and enabling policy are needed for profitable and sustainable intensification of rice cultivation in SSA. It is also critical to organize preventive health measures for farmers against wetland-related diseases (malaria, bilharzia, and so on), protect certain natural wetlands (e.g., with bird sanctuaries), preserve mangrove forests in strategic coastal belts and rich peats in inlands, and use chemical inputs efficiently to minimize pollution and maintain environmental quality while intensifying rice production. Anticipatory research is needed to tackle the impacts of changing climate on rice farming and the environment. Modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) can be exploited to reach out to farmers in remote areas and to deploy technologies effectively. In addition, the development of innovative private–public partnerships and the organization of farmers into user-groups will enhance the training, farmer education, and technology adoption required for intensive commercial rice farming.

The hydrological conditions (duration and intensity of flooding) vary with the toposequence position between the fringe and the centre of the valley. Production methods tend to evolve from the currently predominant unbunded plots without external input use, to input-intensive production in bunded plots. Agronomic management interventions co-evolve and may include varietal choice, herbicide use, and mineral N fertilizer application. The response of rice and the associated weeds to such interventions is likely to vary with the prevailing hydrological regime. A 2-year field experiment was conducted in northern Ivory Coast to determine the impact of water regime (plot position in the valley, presence of bunds) and input use (mineral N fertilizer and herbicide) on the productivity (yield and N use efficiency) of traditional and modern rainfed lowland rice cultivars and the biomass and composition of the associated weeds. Installing field bunds reduced seasonal variations in ponded water depth and resulted in a mean increase in rice grain yield of 30–40% (p &lt; 0.005). This increase was associated with a 25% lower cumulative weed biomass and a several-fold increase in the agronomic use efficiency of applied mineral N in bunded than unbunded plots. Under low input management, traditional varieties tended to out-yield modern varieties in unbunded plots. Improved crop management such as herbicide and fertilizer application, and the construction of field bunds was more effective to increase the yield and N use efficiency in the flooded valley centre than in the drought-prone valley fringes. There is a need for site-specific targeting of modern cultivars, land development and improved production methods in the inland valleys of the West African savanna zone. "

Two such trials are presented, both located in the Sahel savanna vegetation zone in Senegal. The trials were established in 1991, contain six different fertilizer treatments and rice is grown two times per year. Soil type at Ndiaye is a typical Orthithionic Gleysol and an Eutric Vertisol at Fanaye. Average grain yields without fertilizer application were 3.4 Mg ha−1 per season in Ndiaye and 2.9 Mg ha−1 per season in Fanaye. In 20 consecutive seasons best treatments at both sites and in both seasons yielded on average between 6.7 and 7.6 Mg ha−1 per crop. Yield components were influenced by cultivar, site, season and fertilizer treatment. The mineral composition of grains was homogenous between cultivars and similar to results from Asia, Australia and the USA. Significant differences among cultivars were found for the mineral composition of straw, especially for Si, Fe, Zn and K. Nitrogen, P and K fertilizer treatments increased the mineral concentrations of N, P, Mg, Ca, Mn and Cu. Highest yields in the \{LTFE\} indicate a not significant yield decline of −27 kg per season in Ndiaye and a significant increase in Fanaye (+86 kg per season). The crop model \{ORYZAS\} simulated that potential yields declined by −50 kg per season in Ndiaye and increased by +16 kg per season in Fanaye (not significant). Simulated yield trends were not always mirrored by trends of average seasonal radiation, which is due to the influence of unfavorable temperature extremes on yield and yield simulations. It is concluded that observed yield trends can largely be explained by climatic influences. The agronomic analysis did not indicate a negative impact of intensive irrigated rice cropping on the soil resource base. "

Linear regression analysis showed that simulated grain yield, and days to silking and physiological maturity of the varieties (OBA \{SUPER2\} and TZUTSR-WC5) approximated observed measurements. Across various component technologies, \{OBA\} SUPER2, a longer duration maize variety, yielded more than TZUTSR-WC5 a medium duration variety. Farmer attitude to planting time was satisfactorily explained by simulation. Planting early (April–May) matches the production strategy of farmers with no fertilizer input. This strategy offers more possibility of obtaining higher yields than planting at the regular time (mid May–June). Appropriate crop residue management, and practices that ensure high soil organic carbon increase the productivity of no-fertilizer farmers. In systems where high levels of fertilizer N are used (120–150 kg/ha), obtainable yields are higher but responded less to alternate planting windows and soil fertility status. "

Photothermal effects on phenology have been studied to develop simulation tools for breeding and cropping systems research. Forty-nine genotypes were planted at monthly intervals in various rice-garden trials. Environment variability among seasons, sites and within the crop canopy was characterized to develop a field-based, photothermal model for flowering. Basic concepts were summation of heat units and a linear thermal response of development rate having upper (Topt) and lower (Tbase) response limits. Photoperiodism was modeled by a slope constant (CPP) and a basic vegetative phase (BVP). Photoperiodism and transplanting shock acted as modifiers of heat requirements (Tsum), thereby having greater effects on duration at low than at high temperatures. Tbase, Topt, Tsum, \{BVP\} and \{CPP\} were considered genotypic constants and calibrated by optimization. Daily input temperature for the model was the physiologically relevant temperature Tphys at the shoot apex. Tphys depended on apex submergence, water temperature and diurnal temperature patterns. Diurnal temperature segments exceeding the Tbase-Topt range were disregarded. Mean water temperature was below air temperature, particularly at high leaf area index and on dry days. Mean air temperature was closer to the minimum than to the maximum when amplitudes were high or days short. Minimum temperatures below 18°C at booting stage resulted in near total spikelet sterility and a specific delay in heading.

Recent liberalization and intensification of production require varieties that are better adapted to climatic constraints associated with evolving rice-rice and alternative rice-based cropping systems. Forty nine locally grown or introduced genotypes were characterized for their photothermal response in the field using a model described in a previous paper. Varietal constants Tbase, Topt, Tsum, \{BVP\} and \{CPP\} characterized thermal and photoperiodic effects on flowering and were validated using literature and field data from independent experiments. Photothermal constants were associated with seasonspecific, agronomic performance. Short-duration types with high plasticity of duration performed best in the dry season, and medium-duration types with high plasticity in the wet season. Short-duration types with low plasticity of duration performed well in both seasons. Locally grown varieties were mostly medium duration and comparatively thermo- and photoperiod-insensitive. Researchers' selections were markedly different from locally used materials. We conclude that photothermal response of phenology is an important character for breeding improved irrigated rice in arid environments. "

Variable crop duration and temperature stresses, however, limit yields and calendrial options. In an effort to characterize climatic constraints to rice double-cropping in the region, a field-based model simulating flowering was combined with models predicting maturity and chilling- and heat-induced spikelet sterility. Simulations were performed for key sowing dates, 38 sites and three genotypes based on 10–33 years of weather records. Sowing between mid-September and mid-November was associated with near-total spikelet sterility due to chilling in all Sahelian environments. Crop duration was longest in November, increasing by 5 days per degree latitude in the continental Sahel. Greatest annual variation in duration was observed in the coastal west and extreme north of the Sahel. Climatic gradients along the courses of the Senegal and Niger rivers were associated with different annual patterns of duration and sterility. Based on the genotypes available to farmers, local rice-rice cropping calendars left little room for alternative calendars. Achieving a greater flexibility for cropping calendars would require the introduction of alternative short-duration varieties. The model permits the zonation of the Sahel in terms of calendrial options and varietal requirements. For a greater spatial resolution of such studies in the future, however, the pooling and digitalization of more weather data is recommended. "

Two upland and two lowland experiments were conducted in southern Benin to examine genotypic variations in weed-suppressive ability and grain yield under weedy conditions, and to identify plant characteristics that could be used as selection criteria for improved weed competitiveness. A total of 19 genotypes, including Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima genotypes and interspecific hybrids developed from crossing O. sativa and O. glaberrima, were grown under weed-free and weedy conditions in an upland with supplemental irrigation and in a flooded lowland. In weedy plots, hand weeding was done once or not at all. Mean relative yield loss across all genotypes due to weed competition ranged from almost 0% to 61%. Large genotypic variations in weed biomass and grain yield under weedy conditions were found. Visual growth vigor at 42 and 63 days after sowing (DAS) under weed-free conditions significantly correlated with weed biomass at maturity in both upland and lowland experiments (R2 = 0.26–0.48). Where weed pressure was low to moderate, with mean relative yield loss less than 23%, the multiple regression models using grain yield and plant height at maturity or only grain yield measured under weed-free conditions as independent variables could explain 66–88% of the genotypic variation in grain yield under weedy conditions. At higher weed pressure (mean relative yield loss: 61%), as observed in one of the upland experiments, biomass accumulation of rice at 42 days after sowing was associated with higher grain yield under weedy conditions. Biomass accumulation also significantly correlated with visual growth vigor at the same sampling dates. Therefore, we conclude that grain yield, plant height at maturity and visual growth vigor at 42–63 \{DAS\} under weed-free conditions appear to be useful selection criteria for developing superior weed competitive rice genotypes.

Europe is currently struggling to implement coherent coexistence regulations in all \{EU\} Member States. Since the publication of the European Commission's guidelines in 2003, some Member States have developed, and others are still developing, a diversity of ex ante regulations and ex post liability rules on the coexistence of \{GM\} and non-GM crops. In this article, our attention is drawn to ex ante regulations. More specifically, we polarize two alternative ways of regulating spatial coexistence, i.e. rigid minimum distance rules, imposed on \{GM\} crop production, versus flexible segregation measures such as buffer zones, leaving more freedom of negotiation between neighboring farmers. We conduct simulations with the software ArcView® on a \{GIS\} dataset of a hypothetical case of \{GM\} herbicide tolerant oilseed rape cultivation in Central France. Our findings show that rigid coexistence rules, such as large distance requirements, may impose a severe burden on \{GM\} crop production in Europe. These rules are not proportional to the farmers' basic economic incentives for coexistence and hence not consistent with the objectives of the European Commission. More alarming, we show that in densely planted areas a domino-effect may occur, a theoretical possibility ignored in the literature. This effect raises coexistence costs and even adds to the non-proportionality of rigid coexistence regulations. Instead, we show that flexible measures would be preferable since they are proportional to the economic incentives for coexistence and, hence, less counterproductive for European agriculture. "

In order to evaluate the probability for this process to occur, we studied 3 different sites in West Africa where numerical simulation of the geochemical interactions between soil, irrigation water and groundwater were performed with PHREEQC. It was possible to simulate the evaporation of the ponding water, the mixing between groundwater and irrigation water, the lateral drainage (flushing) and the leaching, and finally the management of the crop residues. By performing prospective simulations over 60 cropping cycles it has been shown that soil alkalinization and sodication are not inevitable in these areas especially if the cropping is properly managed. Moreover, when straw is removed and the plot flushed before the new cropping season, alkaline soils can even be improved with rice cropping. "

These soils were silty or clayey, deriving from Cretaceous or Tertiary shale materials. The particle-size distribution and its computation on a clay-free basis revealed relatively remarkable lithologic breaks in a couple of pedons. The effect of lithologic discontinuities on soil mineralogical composition was not, however, conspicuous. Petrographic investigation revealed that quartz predominantly comprised the fine-sand fraction in the soils at both study sites. Nevertheless, the clay mineralogical composition of the soils was a mixture of kaolinite, irregularly interstratified smectite-illite intergrades (S/I), hydroxyl-Al interlayered 2:1 type clays (HICs), vermiculite, smectite, halloysite and illite along with fine-sized quartz in Abakaliki. The soils of Bende predominantly contained smectite, which was partially interlayered with hydroxyl-Al and kaolinite. It is suggested that seasonal floodwater has slowed the disintegration of weatherable clay minerals inherited from the shale, while quartz originating from the sandstone is predominant in the fine-sand fraction. Additionally, a possible soil-forming process observed at the both study sites was ferrolysis, which was indicated by a clear decreasing pattern of \{HICs\} downward in the soil profiles. The entry of S/I and vertical distribution patterns for a couple of clay minerals in the pedon suggested that the soils in Abakaliki have developed under the significant influence of aeolian dust delivered by the Harmattan. The findings might describe a site-specific deposition pattern of Harmattan dusts as well as hydromorphic soil-forming processes in the wetlands of the inland valleys. "

In this article, we propose a spatial framework based on an existing landscape and introduce the concept of shadow factor as a measure for the opportunity costs induced by SEACERs. Our empirical findings led us to advance the proposition that flexible \{SEACERs\} based on pollen barriers are more likely to respect the proportionality condition than rigid \{SEACERs\} based on isolation distances. Particularly in early adoption stages, imposing rigid \{SEACERs\} may substantially slow down \{GM\} crop adoption. Our findings argue for incorporating a certain degree of flexibility into \{SEACERs\} by advising pollen barrier agreements between farmers rather than imposing rigid isolation distances on \{GM\} farmers. The empirical questions of proportionality and flexibility have been largely ignored in the literature on coexistence and provide timely information for \{EU\} policy makers. "

abstract = "Abstract In West Africa, upland rice (Oryza spp.) is mainly grown in low-input systems by resource-poor farmers. Weeds are one of the major constraints to rice production. Ideal rice varieties are high-yielding with strong weed-suppressive ability (WSA). \{WSA\} is the ability to suppress weed growth and reduce weed seed production and is determined by assessing weed biomass under weedy conditions. Development of such varieties requires simple screening protocols based on highly heritable traits, which can be evaluated in small plots under weed-free conditions. Then, in later stages of the breeding program, selected breeding lines could be evaluated with substitute weeds instead of natural weeds, as natural weed growth is heterogeneous. To develop such a protocol, I evaluated agronomic traits of 10 diverse rice varieties grown in plots with different numbers of rows (unbordered 1-row and 2-row, and self-bordered 4-row, in which the middle 2-rows were sampled) without weed competition and evaluated weed biomass of these varieties under competition with rice and cowpea as substitute weeds. I then examined whether agronomic traits in unbordered plots can predict yield and weed biomass in self-bordered plots. Broad-sense heritabilities of agronomic traits measured in weed-free conditions and weed biomass under weedy conditions were estimated. Among agronomic traits in unbordered plots, yield was positively correlated with yield in self-bordered plots (r = 0.88 and 0.96 in 1-row and 2-row plots, respectively, P &lt; 0.01). Weed biomass estimated in competition with two rice varieties was more heritable than weed biomass in competition with cowpea. In 1-row plots, growth vigor at 63 days after sowing (DAS), total aboveground biomass at harvest, and yield were related to weed biomass in competition with cowpea and rice variety Aus 257. Growth vigor at 42 and 63 \{DAS\} was a reliable estimator for total aboveground biomass and number of panicles at harvest, as well as integrated information on height and number of stems (height multiplied by number of stems). I suggest that growth vigor at 42–63 \{DAS\} in unbordered, 1-row plots appears to be a useful selection criterion for developing high-yielding varieties with superior WSA, and \{WSA\} of selected varieties can be validated using rice varieties as substitute weeds. Future research is needed to validate this protocol with breeding populations, a wide range of genetic materials, and other important weed species in West Africa before it can be implemented in breeding programs.

However, natural weed growth in field conditions is heterogeneous, resulting in high experimental error in phenotyping studies. Using crops as substitute weeds is one approach for improving the accuracy of estimation of WSA. Four upland-rice experiments were conducted using 14 diverse varieties in Benin between 2009 and 2011 to examine if the use of substitute weeds can improve estimation of WSA, and help identify varieties with strong WSA. Two rice varieties (Aus 257, which was also included in 14 varieties tested, and \{IR\} 1552, a purple-leaved rice) and cowpea (cv. KVx396-18) were tested as substitute weeds, and compared with natural weed infestation. At 50–62 days after rice sowing, weed biomass (weeds, rice or cowpea) were measured as an indicator of WSA. While \{WSA\} was more heritable in plots with substitute weeds than with natural weed infestation, there was no large difference in heritability among substitute weeds. In only one of the four experiments was the effect of variety on \{WSA\} not consistent between substitute weeds and natural weeds. But in this experiment, Aus 257 consistently showed strong \{WSA\} in both plots with substitute weeds and plots with natural weed infestation. Superior \{WSA\} of Aus 257 was also observed in the other experiments, and associated with higher biomass accumulation. These results indicate that the use of substitute weeds can offer an efficient selection approach for improving weed-suppressive ability of upland rice. Aus 257 can be used as donor for developing varieties with strong weed-suppressive ability. "

This paper addresses the underlying causes of tradeoff between yield without weed competition and weed competitiveness. Rice yield or weed biomass under weedy conditions are used as indicators of weed competitiveness. For this analysis, a common database was compiled from the results of 45 concurrent field trials comparing the performance of four to 64 genotypes in weed-free and weedy conditions in Asia, West Africa, North America and Latin America. Cyperus spp., Echinochloa spp. and Eleusine indica were the most frequent dominant weed species, being found in 9, 20 and 7 trials, respectively. Mean relative yield reduction [(yield under weed-free conditions − yield under weedy conditions)/yield under weed-free conditions] across genotypes tested for each trial was defined as weed pressure level. Mean yield without weed competition across genotypes ranged from 1.8 to 11.6 t ha−1 with mean relative yield reduction from almost 0 to 91%. Correlations for rice yield between weed-free and weedy conditions were generally positive, and significant in 27 trials. The correlations were related to weed pressure level and dominant weed species, but not to ecosystem (upland or lowland) or yield level under weed-free conditions. Relative yield reduction had a more pronounced effect than dominant weed species. Correlation decreased as weed pressure level increased, and became negative when relative yield reduction exceeded 80%, suggesting that different morpho-physiological mechanisms are responsible for high yields under weed-free conditions or severe weed competition. Correlations between rice yield under weed-free conditions and weed biomass varied, giving 17 and 19 for positive and negative ones, respectively. These correlations were related neither to weed pressure level, ecosystem and yield level under weed-free conditions, nor to dominant weed species. These results indicate that correlations between rice yields under weed-free and weedy conditions can be strongly affected by weed pressure level, and, unless severe weed competition occurs, there appears to be no tradeoff between them. Association of morpho-physiological mechanisms with weed competitiveness under conditions differing in weed pressure levels and dominant weed species deserves further investigation. "

Integrated crop management (ICM), covering almost all the agricultural practices from land preparation to harvest, was introduced to farmers for boosting yields since the early 2000s. A repeated farm survey was conducted over the period 2002–2010 to monitor farmers’ agricultural practices during the wet season in the Delta and Middle Valley of the SRV. The objectives of this study were to: (i) assess spatial and temporal variation in on-farm yields, and (ii) determine factors affecting variation in the yields through Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis. The data set consists of 829 farmer-year observations. While mean yields across nine years were 5.0 and 5.6 t/ha in the Delta and Middle Valley, respectively, mean attainable yields (upper 10 percentile) were 7.2 and 8.6 t/ha, respectively. Yield gap between attainable yield and mean yield was 2.2–3 t/ha. There were no temporal trends in yield or yield gap in either zone. \{CART\} analysis identified six and eight yield determining factors. The primary factor was sowing time, and delayed sowing resulted in yield reduction by around 1 t/ha in both zones. The major reasons behind delayed sowing were related to availability of credit, machinery, and irrigation water. The two other commonly identified factors were fertilizer management and bird control. We conclude that creating enabling environment through institutional arrangements for improving access to resources and machineries is essential for enhancing the adoption of \{ICM\} and breaking the yield stagnation. Development of alternative agricultural practices such as no tillage system is also needed to help farmers practice timely sowing. "

Partly as a result of historical urban bias, African countries have become heavily dependent on food imports with concomitant risks for food security as witnessed during the 2008 food crisis. African governments now recognize that they should reverse urban bias by investing in agriculture in order to decrease food import dependency. However, they typically focus primarily on supply-shifting investments that may be insufficient to render domestically produced food competitive, particularly in import-biased food markets. We review the national rice development investment strategies of 19 African countries and argue that in order to reverse urban bias in African rice markets, more resources will need to be allocated to value-adding and demand-lifting investments.

We review the experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis. During 2008–2012, a research program of framed field experiments based on experimental auctions was implemented to study consumers’ revealed preferences for rice quality attributes in 11 African markets. The experimental results suggest that domestic rice can compete with imported rice in urban markets if its intrinsic and extrinsic quality attributes are better tailored to urban consumer preferences. This is important for policy makers who are currently implementing ambitious national rice development strategies throughout Africa. "

Currently, rice plays a pivotal role in improving household food security and national economies in SSA. However, current rice productivity of smallholder farms is low due to a myriad of production constraints and suboptimal production methods, while future productivity is threatened by climate change, water shortage and soil degradation. Improved rice cultivars and agronomic management techniques, to enhance nutrient and water availability and use efficiencies and to control weeds, have the potential to increase yields. The aim of this study was to assess the relative contribution of such technologies to enhanced rice productivity. Relative yield gains emanating from nutrient, water and weed management were surveyed and calculated from literature. Partial budgeting was used to evaluate viability of fertilizer technology under GAP. Substantial yield gains ranging from 0.5 t ha−1 to 2.9 t ha−1 are projected following the use of improved technologies. Relative yield gains decreased in the following order: weed management (91.6%) &gt; organic fertilizer application (90.4%) &gt; bunding (86.7%) &gt; mineral fertilizer application (51.9%) &gt; tied ridges (42.6%). Combining fertilizer with unimproved rice cultivars led to negative returns. The lack of integration of improved technologies, to increase synergies and alleviate socio-economic constraints, largely explained the existing yield gaps. The gains obtained through improved rice cultivars can be further enhanced through application of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), improving nutrient, water and weed management technologies, based on the local resource availabilities of small farms. We therefore propose adapting technologies to local conditions and developing and using rice production decision tools based on \{GAP\} to enable rice farmers in \{SSA\} to improve resource-use efficiencies and crop productivity at the farm level.

The standard P requirement (SPR) of soils, defined as the amount of P to be added to attain an equilibrium solution concentration of 0.2 mg P l−1, varied from 42 to 175 mg P kg−1. Out of the seven soils, four required low amounts and the other three needed relatively higher P applications. The extractability of the adsorbed P in different extractants was: 0.01 M \{KCl\} 32–78%, Olsen P 21–112%, and Bray 1 P 15–40%.

Such soils are being used for rice (Oryza sativa L.), using pump irrigation. Before the onset of the growing season, farmers dry till and flush their rice field with fresh irrigation water to wash out salts from the root zone. We tested the potential of plowing under water-saturated conditions (puddling) to increase the amount of salt washed out from the topsoil with surface drainage. In a 1995 field experiment, salt removal using conventional dry soil-tillage and five irrigation-drainage cycles was compared with wet tillage (1, 2 or 3 times puddling) using a hydro-tiller and five irrigation-drainage cycles. Repetitive puddling and surface water drainage was very effective in removing salt from the soil profile. Each puddling, followed by surface drainage removed ca. 4.3 t salt ha−1, as opposed to ≈1 t salt ha−1 per flushing in the dry tilled plots. However, depth of the puddled layer increased after each puddling, and new salt from the subsoil was, therefore, brought in solution. Puddling had a negative effect on rice seedling establishment, presumably because it induced a lower but homogeneous salt distribution in the puddled layer. We concluded that introduction of the hydro-tiller in the Senegal River Delta as a replacement for conventional dry tillage cannot be recommended. The hydro-tiller may be used to accelerate reclamation of highly saline areas for rice cropping if a constant tillage depth can be maintained, and if the soil is allowed to regain structure after puddling. Before a reclaimed field is direct-seeded, test sowing and monitoring of survival rate for at least a week is recommended. "

Physiological studies were initiated to develop a crop model that simulates the performance of plant-types combining the traits of the two species. The present study characterizes the control of stomatal conductance and leaf rolling under drought in one O. glaberrima cultivar (CG14), one O. sativa tropical-japonica cultivar (WAB56-104), one inter-specific descendant of the two cultivars, and the O. sativa indica semi-dwarf-type Bouaké 189. An upland field experiment (Exp. I) with two sowing dates was conducted during the 1997 wet season under naturally occurring drought at Mbé, Côte d'Ivoire. Patterns of growth and yield were observed, and five cycles of diurnal (0800–1600 h) measurements of leaf water potential (LWP), stomatal conductance (gs) and leaf rolling score (LRS) were conducted in drought situations. In a second experiment at the same site during the 1997 dry season, irrigation was suspended for 35 days, beginning 15 days after sowing. During and after the drought period, LWP, gs, \{LRS\} and soil water tension of the topsoil were observed. Soil-matric potential (SMP) was determined from soil water content using a pF curve. Values of gs had no stable relationship with \{LWP\} across different times of day but were roughly constant during the day and depended on the \{LWP\} observed at 0800 h. \{LWP\} measured in the morning was similar to \{SMP\} as determined from pF curves, but soil tensiometers gave lower absolute values. Leaf rolling was closely related to \{LWP\} regardless of the time of day. The cultivars did not differ in the gs versus soil water tension or gs versus \{LWPMorning\} relationship, but differed significantly in the \{LRS\} versus \{LWP\} relationship. It is concluded that gs was controlled by a soil-moisture-dependent root signal, whereas \{LRS\} was controlled directly by leaf water status. Simple models to simulate these relationships in drought-sensitive crop models are discussed. "

Data were collected from 231 rice plots located in 12 inland valleys infested by Rhamphicarpa in Benin. Data were analyzed using a double hurdle model, which analyses both the likelihood (of occurrence) and the severity of infestation. Results showed that 72% of the surveyed rice plots were infested by R. fistulosa and the average severity was 109 plants m−2. The likelihood of infestation was higher on poorly fertile soils and fields located in the inland-valley bottom, and it decreases through timely use of herbicides and ploughing. Severity of infestation was higher on rice plots cultivated by female-headed households farmers and reduced through management practices such as late sowing, timely application of post-emergence herbicide, three hoe or hand weeding operations, medium-rate fertilizer application and prolonged fallow. Likelihood and severity of infestation were found to be negatively correlated. These findings suggest that farmers can reduce the likelihood and the severity of infestation of their plot as long as they are aware of factors causing the problem given their access to and management capacity of production resources.

A total of 157 farmers (93 male, 64 female) in 14 villages tested the mechanical weeders, ranked them in order of preference, and compared them with their own weed management practices. The ring hoe had the highest rank, followed by the straight-spike weeder; 97% of the farmers preferred the ring hoe to their own weed management practices, by hand or using traditional hoe, because of its easy operation and high efficiency. The ring hoe tended to be preferred especially in the fields with non-ponded water and relatively higher weed pressure. The straight-spike weeder tended to be preferred to ring hoe in the fields where weed pressure is less, whereas in ponded conditions, farmers liked these two weeders in equal proportion. The preference of weeders was not related to gender, rice field size, or years of experience of rice cultivation. Among 23 farmers who used herbicides, 17 farmers preferred herbicides to the ring hoe and have rice field of &gt;0.5 ha. Mechanical weeders can offer an effective approach for weed management, especially for small-scale rice farmers, and different types of mechanical weeders should be introduced to farmers based on water regimes and weed pressure level.

Rice breeding programs must develop genotypes that are expected to perform well either across all hydrological environments or for a specific target population of environments. We evaluated 14 rice (Oryza spp.) genotypes in seven experiments during 2 years (2007 and 2008) in Benin to investigate genotype × environment (G × E) interaction for grain yield, and to identify high-yielding genotypes and plant characteristics associated with high yield. The genotypes consisted of O. sativa indica genotypes, including ‘aerobic rice genotypes’ and interspecific genotypes, developed from crossing O. sativa and O. glaberrima for upland (‘NERICA’ genotypes) and lowland conditions (‘NERICA-L’). The mean grain yield ranged from 231 to 588 g m−2 across experiments, with the higher grain yields from flooded lowland conditions. The G × E interaction accounted for 22% of the total sum of squares, with environment and genotype responsible for 71 and 8%, respectively. Three environment groups were identified from a pattern analysis on grain yield. Grouping was related to water availability, distinguishing (i) an aerobic environment, with rice grown under aerobic conditions with supplemental irrigation, (ii) a hydromorphic environment, with rice grown under rainfed conditions with drought spells at the vegetative stage, and (iii) a permanently flooded environment. An interspecific genotype WAB1159-4-10-15-1-3 produced high yields in both flooded and hydromorphic environments, while two interspecific genotypes, NERICA-L-6 and NERICA-L-54 performed well only in a flooded environment. An aerobic rice genotype B 6144F-MR-6-0-0 outyielded these three interspecific genotypes in the aerobic environment. High grain yields in the flooded and hydromorphic environments resulted from biomass accumulation rather than harvest index, whereas the higher yield in the aerobic environment was the result of harvest index rather than biomass accumulation. Genotypes with high growth vigor at 42 and 63 days after sowing tended to have higher yields in the flooded and aerobic environments. Grain yield in the hydromorphic environment was positively correlated with growth duration. We conclude that while interspecific breeding appears to offer an effective approach to improving lowland rice productivity, a systematic effort is needed to screen a wide range of O. sativa and interspecific genotypes across hydrology gradients in West Africa to identify genotypes that perform well across or within a specific target population of environments.

In this paper, it is argued that Africa can turn the rising trends in world markets to a historical opportunity to realize its large potential for rice production. After a review of the policy responses of African countries to the 2008 global rice crisis, the opportunities and challenges for enhancing domestic rice supply are discussed. The competitiveness of rice production in Africa is analyzed for selected countries and rice ecologies. The potential for increasing paddy production is illustrated using a spreadsheet simulation that considers alternative rice sector development scenarios.

Interspecific rice varieties named New Rice for Africa (NERICA) may have superior weed competitiveness and could as such play an important role in integrated weed management. The \{NERICA\} varieties were developed from the wide cross between high-yielding Oryza sativa (L.) and weed competitive and disease resilient Oryza glaberrima (Steud.). In this study weed competitiveness of all 60 lowland varieties of \{NERICA\} (NERICA-L) was compared with their most frequently used parents [IR64 (O. sativa) and \{TOG5681\} (O. glaberrima)], the weed competitive variety Jaya (O. sativa) and the O. glaberrima upland \{NERICA\} parent CG14. During the 2006 and 2007 rainy seasons these varieties were grown under weed-free and weedy conditions in a lowland farmers’ field with partially controlled irrigation in south-east Benin. Weedy plots included single hand weeding at 28 days after sowing, whereas weed-free plots were weekly weeded. Most important weed species encountered in this study were Basilicum polystachyon, Alternanthera sessilis, Echinochloa colona, Sorghum arundinaceum, Cyperus halpan and Cyperus rotundus. Average weed-inflicted yield loss across varieties was 39% in 2006 and 8% in 2007. In both years varieties differed significantly in grain yields under weed-free and weedy conditions and in the growth of weed biomass they permitted under weedy conditions, as observed at harvest. None of the lowland varieties of \{NERICA\} consistently had stronger weed suppressive ability than \{TOG5681\} across 2 years. Nine varieties of NERICA-L (-6, -32, -35, -37, -42, -53, -55, -58 and -60) were identified with high yields under both weed-free and weedy conditions. These nine NERICA-L varieties, together with Jaya, out-yielded the other 51 NERICA-L varieties as well as \{IR64\} and the two O. glaberrima varieties. Weed-free yield, crop growth duration, and weed biomass at harvest significantly correlated with weedy yield in both years. Interspecific breeding using O. glaberrima appears to be an effective approach for improving yield potential and weed competitiveness of semi-dwarf O. sativa and as such for widening the range of useful varieties for lowland rice farmers in Africa.

This practice is in apparent contrast with earlier studies in the Sahel, which suggests that irrigated rice cropping may lead to the formation of alkaline-sodic soils. Soil column experiments were done with some of Sahel's most alkaline-sodic rice soils from the Office du Niger (Mali) and Foum Gleita (Mauritania). Soils were irrigated using non-saline carbonate-rich irrigation water typical for the Sahel and percolation was maintained at 3–4 mm day−1. After one cropping season, soils had turned from sodic to non-sodic, and pH had dramatically decreased, most notably in the upper soil layers. The changes were most important in the Office du Niger soil due to its small buffering capacity (small \{CEC\} and CaCO3). Alkalinity consumed by above-ground matter of the rice plants (grain and straw) equaled or exceeded alkalinity added via irrigation in a zero percolation scenario. Hence, for a climate and irrigation water that are typical for the Sahel, removal of straw and grain prevents or substantially reduces further alkalinization of the soils if percolation is absent. However, in case of some percolation, straw can best be incorporated in the topsoil of calcareous soils as it accelerates de-alkalinization and de-sodication through increased dissolution of calcite. No evidence was found indicating that ferrolysis altered the short-term alkalinity balance of the studied soils to any extent. Our results are in line with recent field studies and suggest a de-alkalinization of sodic-alkaline flooded (rice) soils in the Sahel. "

While the impact of the reform programs has been different for each country, it is commonly observed that impact at the farm level has been less than anticipated. A central theme of this paper is to assess the impact of fertilizer market reforms on the fertilizer market structure and fertilizer use for both food and export (cotton) crop production in Bénin. This analysis of farm-level policy impact is based on data from 899 farm households randomly selected and interviewed in all six départements of Bénin in 1998/1999. Results of the study show that there have been only insignificant changes in the fertilizer market structure. Access to fertilizers has not improved; prices for fertilizer have risen in real terms, resulting in application rates lower than that recommended by extension agents. The effects of the reform programs are vital for investment decisions and provide lessons for introducing alternative approaches for improving soil fertility or management. Since 1992, 54% of farmers find maize (Zea mays L.) production more profitable, while 38% reported that cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production has become more profitable. As a result of the mixed effects of the fertilizer market reform program on the level of fertilizer use and profitability, there is need to develop efficient soil fertility management strategies for small-scale farmers. Such strategies should incorporate the use of complementary inputs, such as seeds with a high level of response to the balanced nutrient package. "

This paper reviews the plant physiological and bio-ecological factors associated with agronomic practices that could explain the extraordinary yields in terms of synergies resulting from the judicious management of the major crop production factors: time, space, water, plant nutrients and labour. The findings underscore the importance of integrated and interdisciplinary research, combining strategic and adaptive (on-farm participatory) approaches that explore and link bio-physical and socio-economic factors in crop production. Such approaches would permit to unlock currently untapped production potentials of rice and other major cereal grain crops, without extra costs to farmers or to the environment. "

Because confinement raises output, the net cost of the tax to the household is only about US$1 per unit per year. Imposing pasture taxes to induce intensification could raise community welfare, if the value of commons resources liberated by reduced grazing pressure exceeds that level. "

In mechanized production systems such as in the Senegal River delta of Africa, drainage date is important for yield, maturity and field trafficability. Randomized complete-block field experiments were conducted at the \{WARDA\} research station at Ndiaye in Senegal during the hot-dry and wet seasons to determine effects of drainage date on soil drying, grain yield and assimilate partitioning. The soil was a slightly acid, shrinking clay. Pre-germinated seed of I Kong Pao rice was sown broadcast and the plots kept flooded until drainage at four different dates after flowering (treatments). Topsoil and grain moisture content and the dry weight of panicles, stems, green leaves and dead leaves were measured on six dates between 1st flowering and 2 wk after maturity. Soil moisture content decreased more rapidly under a green canopy than with a mature crop. Grain yield was reduced by 34 to 36% in both seasons when plots were drained 3 to 4 days after flowering (DAF) (P &lt; 0.01, compared to drainage at maturity) but were not affected when drained 12 to 14 \{DAF\} or later. Grain yield reduction was due one-third to poor grain filling and two-thirds to unfilled spikelets. Maturity (20% grain moisture content) was advanced 10 to 11 d by early drainage (3 to 4 DAF), compared to drainage at maturity. Apparent mobilization of reserves based on dry weight decrease of vegetative organs after flowering was 32 to 42% and constituted 46 to 84% of panicle growth, depending on treatment. Early drainage reduced dry matter production during ripening but did not proportionally affect grain yield because of compensatory mobilization of stem reserves. Models are proposed on the buffering effect of reserves if assimilation during grain filling is variable. "

Grain yields were highly variable, ranging from 0 to 9.5 t ha−1, with an average yield over years and seasons of 5 t ha−1, indicating an average yield gap of about 4–5 t ha−1 between actual farmers’ yields and potential yields. Soil P and K status of farmers’ fields were mostly above critical limits and pH and electrical conductivity values were in the optimal range for irrigated rice. Average yield levels for three out of the four seasons were not significantly different. However, cold temperatures at the onset of the dry season induced slower development rate and lower above-ground biomass despite higher plant and tiller density at panicle initiation (PI). Analysis of growth cycle and spikelet sterility levels in the sample fields using the \{RIDEV\} simulation model showed that yield losses due to cold or heat stress around flowering could be neglected. Yield variability was, therefore, assumed to be mostly due to differences in crop management (other than choice of sowing and harvest dates) at the farmer level. Plant density in the dry season was significantly higher than in the wet season in both transplanted and direct-seeded fields, with farmers compensating for retarded growth at the onset of the dry season due to cold temperatures. Low transplanting density and the use of relatively old seedlings seriously affected plant and tiller densities determined at PI. Principal component analyses conducted with three variables, i.e. plant density, tiller density and rice—above-ground dry weight determined at \{PI\} and yield components at maturity allowed to determine the effect of crop management. Sub-optimal weed and N fertilizer management were major factors driving yield variability in farmers’ fields. Increasing the productivity of irrigated rice will require collective action at both field and scheme level. "

This study investigates morphophysiological characteristics relevant to seedling vigor, namely, the kinetics of reserve mobilization, dry matter partitioning among organs, and specific leaf area (SLA). Five diverse cultivars (O. glaberrima upland rice, improved and traditional tropical O. sativa japonica upland rices, an improved O. sativa indica cultivar and an interspecific progeny) were grown in the screenhouse for 18 days on wet soil. Dry matter fractions of plant organs were measured daily, leaf area (LA) and \{SLA\} were measured 9, 14 and 18 days after seed soaking (DAS). \{SLA\} measurements were repeated using crowded populations simulating farmers' seedbed nurseries. Seedlings achieved photo-autotrophic growth between 7.6 and 9.3 DAS, and had compensated for respiration losses during heterotrophic growth at 10.3–12.4 DAS, with O. glaberrima and improved indica cultivars requiring shorter periods than tropical japonica cultivars. For all cultivars, dry matter partitioning coefficients (PC) for roots were initially large but dropped temporarily to near zero during the transition from heterotrophic to autotrophic growth. The O. glaberrima cultivar had the largest \{PC\} for laminae and the largest \{SLA\} among the cultivars. It is concluded that the superior early growth vigor of the O. glaberrima cultivar, as documented in previous studies, is partly due to (1) early onset of autotrophic growth, (2) high \{PC\} for leaves, and (3) large SLA. Based on the previous observation that \{SLA\} is correlated with weed competitiveness, it appears that \{SLA\} measured at about 14 days after germination might be employed as a rapid screen for weed competitiveness.

Ten weed management treatments were used to identify critical periods of competition and to enable the development of more precise management recommendations. Rice yields in 1999WS ranged from 3.2 t ha−1 with no weed control to 6.3 t ha−1 in weed-free plots; a yield loss of 49%. Major weed species encountered in 1999WS were Bolboschoenus maritimus, Oryza longistaminata, Cyperus difformis and Echinochloa colona. In 2000DS, C. difformis dominated the weed flora, and rice yields ranged from 3.7 t ha−1 with no weed control to 7.9 t ha−1 in weed-free plots; a yield loss of 47%. To assess the effects of weed biomass on the rice crop over time a linear mixed model was used. This highlighted the importance of E. colona and C. difformis in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, and of O. longistaminata in both seasons. The presence of E. colona early in the crop seemed related to greater levels of rice biomass in 1999WS, while O. longistaminata always had a negative effect on crop growth even at relatively low levels of infestation. Gompertz and logistic equations were fitted to data representing increasing periods of weed-free growth and weed interference, respectively. Critical periods for weed control, obtaining 95% of a weed-free yield, were estimated as between 29 to 32 days after sowing (DAS) in the \{WS\} and 4 to 83 \{DAS\} in the DS. The lower temperatures in the early \{DS\} resulted in slower growth of rice and weeds, delaying the effects of competition. Weed competition either before or after these critical periods had negligible effects on crop yield. "

Water movement and soil swelling processes were studied in a dry, cracked Vertisol in the Senegal River Valley. Surface irrigation and simulated rainfall (intensity 88 mm h−1) on cracked 2.25 m2 plots (crack width 0.01–0.02 m; crack depth 0.3 m) resulted in crack closure within 4.5 h, starting at the soil surface. Soil swelling was separated into two components: (1) swelling of the 0.01–0.02 m border zone of a soil island (soil mass distinctively separated by cracks), and (2) swelling of the rest of the soil island as a whole. Soil swelling was heterogeneous, with a very rapid expansion of the border zone. At the moment of crack closure, the relative contributions of these two components to crack closure were respectively 80–90% and 10–20%; 24 h later these percentages changed slightly only. Maximum bulk linear shrinkage determined at the field level was only 7%. Results indicate the importance of rapid, local, heterogeneous swelling processes to water flow into cracked Vertisol, resulting in limited bypass flow. Use of bulk shrinkage curves and assumptions on isotropy of shrinkage and swelling processes when modelling water and solute flow in cracked Vertisols should therefore be done with great care. "

Previously un-described means of transmission by mammals and through leaf contact have been discovered recently. Several agricultural practices, including the use of seedbed nurseries, have also contributed to a massive build-up of \{RYMV\} inoculum. Phytosanitation is now known to be critical to reduce disease incidence in rice. A new model of the ecology of \{RYMV\} in which man plays a central role has emerged. Furthermore, estimates of the evolutionary rate of change of \{RYMV\} provided a time-frame for its epidemiology, the first attempt for a plant virus. Earlier interpretations of the patterns of virus diversity which assumed a long-term evolution, and assigned a major role to adaptive events had to be discarded. In contrast, a wave-like model of dispersal of RYMV, which postulates its initial diversification in East Africa, followed by westward spread across the continent, was developed, refined and dated. The most salient – and largely unexpected – finding is that \{RYMV\} emerged recently and subsequently spread rapidly throughout Africa in the last two centuries. Diversification and spread of \{RYMV\} has been concomitant with an extension of rice cultivation in Africa since the 19th century. This major agro-ecological change increased the encounters between primary hosts of \{RYMV\} and cultivated rice. It also modified the landscape ecology in ways that facilitated virus spread. "

Distinctive redoximorphic features, such as surface yellowish layers on mound structures from the fringe site, indicate possible alteration of iron sesquioxide forms in the mounds due to the transportation of soil from reductive (aquic subsoil) to oxidative (epigeal mound) environments by the nest-building activity of M. bellicosus. On the other hand, the iron-soluble content in the dithionite–citrate–bicarbonate (DCB) system (Fed) was generally higher in the mound structures than at the adjacent sub-surface (Ap2) horizon at each toposequence position, while there was less difference in the content of acid ammonium oxalate (AAO) extractable iron (Feo) as compared to Fed. As a consequence, the iron activity index (Fed/Feo ratio) was found for the most part to be lower in the mound structures than in the neighboring Ap2 horizon. In addition, the content of Fed, AAO-soluble Al (Alo) and DCB-extractable Al (Ald) was significantly correlated with clay content in these soils. These findings suggest that M. bellicosus preferentially collects clay particles, probably from the clay-rich subsoils, such as the argillic horizon, which has been formed by the co-migration of phyllosilicate minerals and relatively crystalline sesquioxides. The species then likely incorporates them into the mounds, which induces an increase in the Fed content relative to that of Feo, resulting in a decreased iron activity index in the mound structures.

This study aims to determine suitable areas for rice production in the inland valley of Tossahou using a GIS-based approach that evaluates and combines biophysical factors such as climate, hydrology, soil and landscape, following the \{FAO\} parameter method and guidelines for land evaluation. Soil and landscape suitability was assessed for three different rice cultivation systems: rainfed bunded (RB), cultivation under natural flooding (NF), and irrigated cultivation (RI). The results show that in the inland valley (mostly including the hydromorphic zones and the valley bottom) 52% of the area is suitable for irrigated cultivation, 18% for cultivation under natural flood and 1.2% for rainfed bunded rice. Precipitation and temperature were limiting factors for all cultivation systems. Flooding was the most limiting factor for \{NF\} while \{RI\} and \{RB\} were mostly limited by steep slopes and soil texture respectively. As a first attempt in Benin, this study can play an important role in achieving optimised rice production in inland valleys, and additional studies including socio-economic aspects, carried out in the same area, or in areas under similar conditions, are relevant to close the yield gap and improve the selection approach.

Out of 36 cultivated inland valleys visited across Benin, eight were found to be infested with Rhamphicarpa. Out of nine inland valleys inspected in 1998, Rhamphicarpa was found in five in 2007, compared with only three in 1998. Farmers estimated Rhamphicarpa-inflicted yield losses could exceed 60% and indicated that heavily infested fields are abandoned. In a pot experiment with a wide infestation range, the popular cultivar Gambiaka, combining resistance with sensitivity, showed a mean relative yield loss (RYL) of 63%. Parasitic Rhamphicarpa biomass (PRB), the difference between the above-ground biomass produced with and without a host, was suggested as indicator for infection level of this facultative parasite and hence as a practical measure for host resistance. Genetic variation in resistance and tolerance levels was observed among rice cultivars, but fertilizer applications significantly reduced parasite numbers, biomass and effects, cancelling out such genotypic differences. Depending on the tolerance level of the cultivars, the \{PRB\} only accounted for 3.7–38.8% of the average parasite-inflicted host biomass reductions, indicating phytotoxic effects of Rhamphicarpa infection. R. fistulosa is an apparently increasing constraint to rain-fed lowland rice in Benin, threatening rice production in the wider region. The use of resistant and tolerant cultivars, combined with fertilizer applications could reduce Rhamphicarpa infections and mitigate negative effects on rice yields. "

A series of field experiments was conducted at Ndiaye (shallow water table, dry and wet season) and at Fanaye (deep water table, wet season) in Senegal with four irrigation treatments, involving three water-saving regimes using alternate wetting and drying (AWD) and a flooded control, and three weed management treatments. This was followed by two experiments with the same four irrigation treatments in combination with three nitrogen (N) application rates, at the same locations. Hence four irrigation regimes were tested over three seasons. Between 480 and 1060 mm of irrigation water was used in the water-saving treatments compared with 800–1490 mm in the flooded-rice treatment. Rice yields ranged from 2.3 to 11.8 t ha−1 in the water-saving treatments, whereas in the flooded control the yields ranged from 3.7 to 11.7 t ha−1. In the wet season (WS), the treatments in which \{AWD\} was applied during part of the season resulted in the highest yields at both sites. In the dry season (DS), the continuously flooded treatment out-yielded other treatments, with the exception of \{AWD\} in Fanaye. At the Ndiaye site, the control of weeds increased yields from on average 2.0 to 7.4 t ha−1 in the \{DS\} and from 1.4 to 4.9 t ha−1 in the WS. No weed control in combination with \{AWD\} during the vegetative stage reduced yields to below 1.0 t ha−1. However, when weeds were controlled, crop yields obtained with a combination of \{AWD\} and flooding were comparable with those obtained in fully flooded plots receiving the same weed management at both sites in the 2005 WS. Increasing rates of N significantly increased grain yield. Internal N efficiency was poorer at Ndiaye than at Fanaye suggesting that yields in Ndiaye are constrained by other factors than N. In Ndiaye, agronomic N use efficiency was smaller in the \{AWD\} treatments compared with fully flooded conditions. This study demonstrates that it is possible to save irrigation water and improve water productivity in rice grown in a Sahelian environment. An irrigation regime for rice that starts as conventional (flooded), and then changes to \{AWD\} can save water with little or no yield loss, while maintaining low weed pressure and efficient use of N.

Here, we investigate the intensification option of increasing production by increasing cropping intensity and choice of varieties with different crop duration. We developed a model to generate, compare and visualise opportunities for single/double/triple cropping systems consisting of irrigated rice and optionally a vegetable. The model was applied in a case study in the Senegal River valley. Results showed that with appropriate choice of sowing dates, severe cold sterility in rice can be avoided, also in rice–rice crop rotations. At optimal sowing dates, simulated total long term average potential yields of single, double and triple cropping yields were 10.3, 19.0 and 18.9 t/ha respectively (total of 1,2 and 3 yields). With a hypothetical completely cold tolerant variety, yields could increase to 11.2, 20.2 and 20.9 respectively. Simulated Triple crop yields are hardly any higher than those of a double crop with two medium duration varieties. Delay in sowing due to late availability of resources (machinery, irrigation water allocation within a scheme, credits for pump fuel) is a known problem in the region. Therefore we also simulated how much delay was possible (width of the sowing windows) whilst still allowing for double cropping. We found enough delay was possible to allow for a rice–rice or a rice-vegetable crop. A rice-rice-vegetable triple cropping system would only be possible without delays and with a very short duration vegetable of 2 months. Most promising options to increase production are through shifting the sowing date to facilitate double cropping, adoption of medium duration varieties and breeding for cold tolerant varieties. "

The booming demand for rice in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) requires rapid increases in rice production, and hence more Si supply will be needed from soils, irrigation water, and external inputs. However, the current Si-nutrient status of rice plants and relevant factors has been so far paid little attention in the region. Therefore, an extensive survey was conducted for evaluating variability of Si concentration in rice straw in relation to soil properties, fertilizer management practices, and rice-growing environments across a wide range of local farmers’ fields in SSA. Plant and soil samples were collected at harvesting time from 99 fields in Benin, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, and Nigeria, and then chemically analyzed. The Si concentration in straw ranged 1.7–8.4%, and the values in 68% of the fields were below the critical deficiency level of 5%. The Si concentration in straw was most significantly correlated with the amounts of water-soluble Si in soils after 1-week anaerobic incubation at 40 °C (hereafter, plant-available Si). The plant-available Si was particularly low in the acidic soils of Highland and Humid Agro-ecological zones, mainly consisting of weathered Oxisols and Ultisols. The mean Si values were greatest in the order of irrigated lowland (5.3%) &gt; rainfed lowland (4.3%) &gt; upland (3.4%) among different rice-growing environments. Multiple regression analysis revealed that 59% of the variation in Si concentration in straw was explained by the plant-available Si in soils, rice-growing environments, N application rates, and mineralizable N in soils. The regression model indicated that improvement of plant-available Si in soils could increase the Si concentration in straw at a rate of 0.043% per mg kg−1, while external N application lowered the Si concentration in straw at a rate of 0.0068% per kg N ha−1 input. This extensive survey revealed that low Si nutrient status was widely observed for rice as associated with limited plant-available Si in the \{SSA\} soils. The probability of Si deficiency can be increased with abundant N application and non-submerged field conditions. By focusing on these Si-deficient field conditions, further studies should quantify the relationship between Si-nutrient status and occurrence of environmental stresses such as blast infection so as to develop appropriate Si-management practices for rice production in SSA.

Thus, policy-makers need to be aware of the potential benefits of \{GM\} rice. We provide an overview of the literature and discuss the evidence on expected agronomic and consumer benefits of genetically engineered rice. We find that while \{GM\} rice with improved agronomic traits could deliver benefits similar to already commercialized biotechnology crops, expected benefits of consumer traits could be higher by an order of magnitude. By aggregating the expected annual benefits, we estimate the global value of \{GM\} rice to be US$64 billion per year. This is only an indicative value, as more \{GM\} varieties will become available in future. Nevertheless, such a figure can help guide policy-makers when deciding on the approval or funding of biotechnology crops and it may also raise awareness among consumers about what is at stake for their societies.

Due to their general high agricultural production potential, based on relatively high and secure water availability and high soil fertility levels compared to the surrounding uplands, these landscapes could play a pivotal role in attaining the regional objectives of food security and poverty alleviation. Besides agricultural production, i.e. mainly rice-based systems including fish-, vegetable- fruit- and livestock production, inland valleys provide local communities with forest, forage, hunting and fishing resources and they are important as water buffer and biodiversity hot spots. Degradation of natural resources in these vulnerable ecosystems, caused by indiscriminate development for the sole purpose of agricultural production, should be avoided. We estimate that, following improved water and weed management, production derived from less than 10% of the total inland valley area could equal the total current demand for rice in Africa. A significant part of the inland valley area in Africa could hence be safeguarded for other purposes. The objective of this paper is to provide a methodology to facilitate fulfilment of the regional agricultural potential of inland valleys in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) such that local rural livelihoods are benefited and regional objectives of reducing poverty and increasing food safety are met, while safeguarding other inland-valley ecosystem services of local and regional importance. High-potential inland valleys should be carefully selected and developed and highly productive and resource-efficient crop production methods should be applied. This paper describes a participatory, holistic and localized approach to seize the regional potential of inland valleys to contribute to food security and poverty alleviation in sub-Saharan Africa. We analyzed over a 100 papers, reference works and databases and synthesized this with insights obtained from nearly two decades of research carried out by the Africa Rice Center and partners. We conclude that sustainable rice production in inland valleys requires a step-wise approach including: (1) the selection of ‘best-bet’ inland valleys, either new or already used ones, based on spatial modelling and a detailed feasibility study, (2) a stakeholder-participatory land use planning within the inland valley based on multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods and using multi-stakeholder platforms (MSP), (3) participatory inland-valley development, and (4) identification of local production constraints combining model simulations and farmer participatory priority exercises to select and adapt appropriate practices and technologies following integrated management principles.

abstract = "Abstract The facultative parasitic weed Rhamphicarpa fistulosa, is a widespread problem in rain-fed rice production systems in Africa. Little is known about rice varietal differences in infection level and yields in fields infested by this root hemi-parasite. During three cropping seasons (2012–2014), an experiment was conducted to address these knowledge gaps and to identify suitable variety selection criteria for R. fistulosa resistance and tolerance. Sixty-four adapted lowland rice varieties, including all interspecific lowland varieties of NERICAs, their most common parents – \{IR64\} and \{TOG5681\} – and two locally popular varieties – Mwangulu and Supa India – were grown in an R. fistulosa-infested field in southern Tanzania. As expected from a facultative parasite, host plant varieties had no effect on R. fistulosa numbers. Consistent varietal differences in R. fistulosa biomass were however observed, with no Year × Variety effects, and this parameter can therefore be used to select for resistance. Parasite-free observation plots were established in the last year. Due to the facultative nature of the parasite, creating such R. fistulosa-free plots was simply obtained by regular early weeding. The presence of parasite-free control plots enabled assessment of worthwhile additional information such as parasite-free yield, parasite-inflicted yield losses (RYLR) and varietal differences in tolerance. Under R. fistulosa-infested conditions (3-season averages, no Year × Variety interaction effect), rice grain yields ranged from 1.2 t ha−1 for the worst performing variety (TOG5681) to 2.4 t ha−1 for the best performing varieties (NERICA-L-39, -20). Under R. fistulosa-free conditions (2014 only) rice grain yields ranged from 2.4 (NERICA-L-22) to 5.4 t ha−1 (NERICA-L-17). Tolerant varieties were characterized by a low \{RYLR\} and a high parasite biomass (e.g. Supa India, NERICA-L-20). The selection measures identified are effective, easy and practical under field conditions. They facilitated identification of thirteen varieties with high resistance, sixteen varieties with low \{RYLR\} and two varieties with high tolerance. These varieties would be invaluable for future rice breeding programs. For farmers in R. fistulosa-endemic areas the most promising varieties are probably NERICA-L-40 and -31, as they combine good yields under infested conditions with low levels of parasite infection.

Without leaching, this water presents a possible alkalinization and sodication hazard for the soil. The effect of flooding on soil solution chemistry in an irrigated nondrained vertisol under rice was monitored during 3 years in northern Senegal. During flooding, soil solution redox potential dropped to about −0.15 V, and alkalinity increased to 15 meq l−1. Mg content increased as well, from about 1 to 5 meq l−1, whereas Cl and \{SO4\} contents decreased to very low levels at the end of the growing season (0.05 meq l−1). After the fallow, nonflooded period between two crop cycles, the soil solution composition returned to its initial neutral sulfate and chloride composition. The observed cycle in soil solution chemistry could not be explained by water and solute transfer because infiltration rates were very low, due to air entrapment in the soil profile. Geochemical control by calcite and gypsum was excluded during irrigation. Mössbauer spectroscopy showed that iron oxides were both well- and poorly crystallized goethite. Goethite dissolution was assessed by pH–Eh stability diagrams. We explained the increase in alkalinity and Mg concentration in the soil solution partly by the composition of the irrigation water, and partly by the reduction and dissolution of Fe oxides, and Fe2+ fixation on exchange sites of the clay minerals. These processes were reversed as soon as the soil oxidized. The decline in Cl concentration was attributed to geochemical control through the formation of a GR-Cl− mineral around the porous cups. In that case, Cl should not be used as a natural tracer. Carbonates accumulate in soil solution not only due to iron reduction, but also because of the positive residual alkalinity of the irrigation water. When the soil dries at the end of crop cycle, the carbonate concentration of topsoil will increase and calcite will precipitate. This ongoing process may result in calcium control and ultimately soil alkalinization over the years. "

The framework uses three models in succession. The dynamic ecophysiological \{ORYZAS\} model simulates potential rice yields under irrigation, based on weather conditions, cultivar choice and sowing date. This yield potential is used in the static \{FERRIZ\} model, together with site specific information on recovery efficiency of applied N, P and K, indigenous soil N, P and K supply, and maximum N, P and K accumulation and dilution in rice dry matter. Resulting outputs are required fertilizer doses to obtain different target yields depending on yield potential and soil nutrient supply. The framework allows sensitivity analysis and agro-economic evaluation of different fertilizer options. In a last step, the dynamic decision tool \{RIDEV\} is used to simulate optimal timing of different management actions such as fertilizer application, weeding, and harvest. Resulting integrated crop management recommendations ensure high resource use efficiency adapted to local socio-economic and bio-physical conditions. Provided necessary input data are available, this framework can be applied to field, perimeter or regional scale. The framework was applied to the Office du Niger in Mali, using field data of 58 farmers. In the wet season, fertilizer doses adjusted to three soil fertility classes outperformed current uniform recommendations only slightly, except on soils with very low K supply (10 cases). Only on these soils was application of K profitable. Profit-optimizing fertilizer doses had high costs and low value/cost ratios. Target yields close to potential yield increased farmers' risk. Adjusting fertilizer doses to the lower yield potential in the dry season reduced costs and risk without reducing profit, resulting in better value/cost ratios. New simple recommendations for both wet and dry seasons were formulated. "

Factors studied included relay or simultaneous planting of maize or intercrops, ridge and flat planting systems and in-row or between-row planting of intercrops. Mode of planting maize and intercrops (ridge/flat or in/between row planting) did not affect maize grain yield. However, ridge planting improved intercrop yields and reduced Striga densities. Peanut, bean, yellow gram, bambara nut and soybean intercrops produced considerable yields and increased the overall productivity of the cropping systems. The increase in output of farm produce ranged between 40% and 120% depending on the local agro-ecological conditions. Of the most productive intercrops, yellow gram provided the most stable Striga control over years and locations comparable only to cowpea. Peanut, bambara nut, bean and soybean were more variable in terms of Striga suppression in maize depending on the specific agro-ecological conditions. Shading, higher humidity and lower temperatures under the intercrop canopies were most likely the mechanisms which caused the decline of Striga numbers in intercropping systems. Intercropping can be an effective component of an integrated Striga control program compatible with the limited resources of small-scale subsistence farmers. In the long term, however, Striga populations can only diminish if intercropping is combined with handweeding of mature Striga plants to avoid the replenishment of the Striga seed bank in the soil.

Rice yields increased significantly as a result of an extra late N application on top of two N-dressings with a total of about 120 kg N ha−1 in farmer fields. Yield gains were about 1.0 t ha−1 during the 1998 \{DS\} and about 0.4 t ha−1 during the 1997 WS. Grain quality was improved through a higher milling recovery (3% increase in both seasons) and a higher percentage of head rice (30% higher in the 1997 \{WS\} and 60% higher in the 1998 DS). Benefit to cost ratios of the third nitrogen application for farmers ranged from 2.8 in the \{WS\} to 5.4 in the DS.

Actual rice yields (≤4.0 t ha−1) are low in comparison with potential yield (ca. 8 t ha−1) and with yields elsewhere in the Sahel (4–6 t ha−1). Farmers related the productivity problems to salt efflorescences on the soil surface. Rice yields on the ‘upper and middle slope’ soils were lower (3.4 t ha−1) than the yields on soils further down the slope (&gt; 4.2 t ha−1). Farmers classified the ‘upper and middle slope’ soils as degraded, but following the \{USDA\} classification the soils could not be classified saline or sodic. Low yields on the ‘degraded’ soils were related to co-limitation of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), which was due to low soil N supply (ca. 18 kg ha−1), low soil P supply (ca. 8 kg ha−1), occasional low N fertilizer doses (35 kg N ha−1) in combination with low N fertilizer recovery efficiency (0.3 kg kg−1), or non-application of P fertilizer. On the ‘non-degraded’ soils, soil P supply (ca. 16 kg ha−1) was higher and N deficiency prevailed despite a higher soil N supply (ca. 32 kg ha−1) and a higher N fertilizer recovery efficiency (0.4 kg kg−1). Higher contents of carbonate salts in the ‘degraded’ soils increase soil pH (&gt; 7.5) and are, therefore, likely to contribute to low soil P supply and low N fertilizer recovery efficiency. "

This research seeks to evaluate whether those fertilizers are profitable under current use by farmers and to identify the factors that may improve fertilizer efficiency and profitability. A combination of farmer surveys and on-farm trials were used to determine actual fertilizer use, costs, and net revenues from fertilizer in key irrigated systems in Mali (Office du Niger), Burkina Faso (Kou Valley), and Senegal (Thiagar and Guédé). A second paper provides an agronomic analysis of soil fertility management at these sites. Net returns to fertilizer use were estimated and value/cost ratios (VCRs) calculated. A value/cost ratio of 1.5–2.0 was considered desirable for farmer adoption under West African conditions. Average \{VCRs\} for fertilizers ranged from 1.6 in the Kou Valley in Burkina Faso, to 3.6 in the Office du Niger, Mali. In researcher-managed on-farm trials in Thiagar, Senegal, fertilizers had \{VCRs\} of 1.5–3.1. Large N doses of 180 kg N ha−1 still had \{VCRs\} of 2.5. Farmers in the region used less than recommended doses of N, with the exception of farmers in the Office du Niger, Mali. With an average application of 89 kg N ha−1, farmers in Thiagar, Senegal were able to gain 54 000 \{FCFA\} ha−1 (US$ 110) of net revenues from the fertilizers with fertilizer N recovery rates averaging 34%. Improving that recovery rate by 50% could increase net revenues by 50%. In field trials in Thiagar, increasing N application to 180 kg ha−1 resulted in net returns of near 200 000 \{FCFA\} ha−1 for an investment of 118 000 \{FCFA\} ha−1. Risk of negative net returns was found in Thiagar and in Kou Valley, and was related to weed infestation and water scarcity, respectively. Farmers in the dry season in Kou Valley had a 33% probability of net losses with fertilizer application because of unreliable water supply. In contrast, no farmers had negative returns in the Office du Niger inspite of high N application rates. Farmers can improve profitability and economic efficiency in irrigated rice production in two ways. First, they can modify crop management practices (date of seeding, date and mode of fertilizer application, etc.) in order to improve the recovery rate of applied N, thus relaxing the nitrogen fertilizer constraint. Second, for farmers able to purchase additional fertilizer, there are gains to be made by increasing applied nitrogen at least to recommended levels in most areas. Credit allocations that restrict fertilizer purchases are counterproductive given the profitability of fertilizers. Negative returns were found only in areas with high risks of water scarcity or weed infestation. Researchers and development agents need to develop more site-specific fertilizer recommendations that correspond to weather, cultivars, prices of inputs and outputs, and fertilizer products. "

(A second paper addresses profitability and risk issues). Grain yields were highly variable, within and across sites. Minimum grain yield was 0.2 t ha−1 (Thiagar), maximum recorded grain yield was 8.7 t ha−1 (Office du Niger).

Physiological nitrogen efficiency (δ grain yield/δ N uptake) was mostly between 40 and 80 kg grain kg−1 plant N. Apparent recovery of fertilizer N was highly variable (average: 30–40% of applied N). Timing of N fertilizer application by farmers was extremely variable and often did not coincide with critical growth stages of the rice plant. Other agronomic constraints included: use of relatively old (&gt;40 days) seedlings at transplanting (Kou, Office du Niger), P and/or K deficiency (Office du Niger), unreliable irrigation water supply (Kou, dry season), delayed start of the wet growing season resulting in yield losses of up to 20% due to cold-induced spikelet sterility (Kou, Guédé, Office du Niger), weed problems (Thiagar), and late harvesting (Thiagar). Discussions during meetings with farmers at the survey sites revealed that farmers lacked knowledge on (i) optimal timing, dosage and mode of fertilizer application, (ii) optimal sowing dates to avoid yield loss due to cold- or heat-induced sterility, and (iii) the importance of N as the main limiting factor to yield. Possibilities to achieve a sustainable increase in rice productivity and profitability in West African irrigation systems are discussed. "

Objectives were to determine agronomic constraints to rice cropping and to evaluate alternative crop management strategies aimed at overcoming these constraints. Grain yields ranged from 0.9 to 8.5 t ha−1 and averaged 4.4 t ha−1. Based on crop simulations, average yield potential in farmers' fields was estimated at 8.6 t ha−1, indicating considerable scope for increased yields. Our survey identified the following main agronomic constraints: (i) mismatches between timing of nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications and critical N demanding growth stages of the rice plant; (ii) non-use of phosphorus (P) fertilizer on P deficient soils; (iii) largely neglected or inefficient weed management and (iv) late harvesting, often due to non-availability of combine harvesters. Based on these results we tested improved nutrient and weed management practices with farmers during the 1998 wet season. Improved nutrient management (i.e. T1: application of 20 kg P ha−1 and 150 kg N ha−1 in three splits at start tillering, panicle initiation and booting) increased yields by 0.9 t ha−1. Improved weed management (i.e. T2: application of 6.0 L propanil ha−1 and 2.0 L 2,4-d-amine ha−1 at 2–3 leaf stage of weeds) also raised yields by 0.9 t ha−1 as compared to farmers' practice (TP). The combined effect of \{T1\} and \{T2\} (i.e. T3) was additive: improving both nutrient and weed management raised yields by 1.8 t ha−1 over average farmers’ yields of 3.9 t ha−1, i.e. an increase of almost 50%. The improved crop management practices were highly profitable: compared to farmers’ practice, net benefits increased by 40% for \{T1\} and \{T2\} and by about 85% for T3, with minimal additive investments. Inputs used for \{T3\} are relatively easily available in Mauritania. We concluded that increased farmer awareness of the profitability of improved nutrient and weed management may have a tremendous impact on the competitiveness of rice production in Mauritania "

However, rice yield in the lowlands is, in general, low due to various constraints such as poor soil fertility, drought, iron (Fe) toxicity, and poor crop management practices. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of bunding and fertilizer application for improving rice productivity in the two toposequential positions (upslope and downslope positions) in an inland valley. The experiment was conducted in a researcher-managed on-farm trial located in the North West of Benin Republic over four wet seasons (2007–2010). In addition to the toposequential positions, the experiment included two treatments: (1) fertilizer inputs: no fertilizer and fertilizer (60 kg N and 40 kg P ha−1) and (2) water control: with and without bunds (without drainage). Effect of bunding on rice yield was consistent across four seasons, two fertilizer application treatments, and two toposequential positions, and bunding increased rice yield by 29%. Rice yield was higher in upslope than in downslope, except for 2010. In upslope, high ponded water level in 2010, due to higher rainfall than in other years, increased Fe toxicity, resulting in lower yield in 2010. Year-to-year variation in yield response to fertilizer application was related to differences in N uptake at 38 days after sowing. When Fe concentration in leaves was lower, N uptake was higher. Thus, Fe toxicity at early stage could contribute to yield response to fertilizer application. These results indicate that while bunding is essential for improving rice productivity, improving yield response to fertilizer application requires drainage systems in the areas where risk for Fe toxicity is high.

Recent experimental studies have shown that transpirational cooling and flowering time (within the day) are important factors determining sterility. Extrapolation of the results from these experimental studies to other environments requires an integrated approach through incorporating such effects on spikelet fertility in a crop growth model. Here we review existing fertility functions (fertility as a function of panicle temperature) in different studies, and propose a simple new model that incorporates insights on diurnal patterns of temperature and relative humidity, recent studies on the relation between panicle temperature and sterility, and studies on how flowering time depends on environmental conditions. We illustrate the model for a typical arid and typical humid climate. There was a large difference between the existing fertility functions, and simulated fertility was very sensitive to differences in fertility functions, causing differences in simulated fertility of up to 59%. Ignoring transpirational cooling led to overestimation of sterility of 14–73%. Shifting flowering times from 12:00 to 9:00 led to a 7–35% reduction in sterility. Within day flowering duration had only a marginal impact (max 2%). We conclude that any climate change impact simulation is highly dependent on the choice of the fertility function, and identification of causes of differences between reported fertility functions deserves further investigation.

This study used the crop model \{EPIC\} (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate) to assess soil water dynamics and rice crop growth as affected by bunding and fertilizer application in inland valley systems of West Africa. The model was parameterized using observed soil water characteristics and crop parameters and run against observation data collected from 2007 to 2010 in a factorial trial combining bund and fertilizer rate. Simulation of soil water condition was satisfactory for unbunded conditions with coefficients of determination (R2) from comparison between simulated and observed soil water content between 0.64 and 0.68 depending on soil depth. Depth of ponded water during the growing period was adequately predicted in three out of four years. Simulated \{LAI\} development, total aboveground biomass and grain yield compared well with field observations in unbunded plots, the \{MRE\} (mean relative error) of simulated yield was 6–18%. In bund plots in 2009 and 2010, the grain yield was overestimated by the model when no fertilizer was applied (MRE = 45%). Although negative effect of elevated iron concentration in the rice plant reduces the model performance, it was used to indicate effective effect of iron on the growth of crop the presence of bund in very wet year. The general use of the model for rainfed rice production at a large scale requires identification of areas with iron toxicity risk. "

Stylosanthes guianensis (stylo), a legume species, was used as a short-term fallow crop. Rice was grown once each year and stylo was seeded during the wet season and grown until the next rice-growing season. The effects of fallow treatment and tillage management (no-tillage vs. manual-tillage) on weed biomass during the rice-growing season were evaluated in 2007 and 2008, whereas the effects on rice yield were examined in 2007 alone. Results indicated that stylo can be established as a relay crop with upland rice about 10 days after rice seeding. Stylo fallow reduced weed biomass by 71% and 95% and increased total biomass (weed + stylo + litter) by 594% and 107% at the end of the dry seasons in 2007 and 2008, respectively. No-tillage without stylo fallow increased weed biomass by 62–202% over manual-tillage during the rice-growing seasons, whereas stylo fallow reduced weed biomass by 45–83% and 11–36%, respectively, under no-tillage and manual-tillage management. There were no significant effects of fallow treatment and tillage management on soil organic C, total N, inorganic N and extractable P. Rice yields following stylo fallow were 0.7 Mg ha−1 higher than after the natural fallow. Manual-tillage increased rice yield by 0.6 Mg ha−1 over no-tillage.

abstract = "Abstract Major increases in food production are needed to feed the rapidly growing population of sub-Saharan Africa. Increased application of irrigation has often been identified as one of the main pathways to agricultural intensification. However, water flows, in particular during the dry season, often depend upon the water regulation services provided by forests and woodlands which are increasingly subject to land conversion as well as degradation from the overexploitation of wood resources. Insight in the trade-off between land conversion in sub-Saharan African uplands and sustaining water flows is, therefore, urgently needed. In this paper, we develop a general modelling approach for analysing the effects of deforestation on the availability of water for irrigation at the watershed level, and we apply the approach to the Upper Ouémé watershed in Benin. We use controlled modelling experiments based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in addition to copula functions to quantify surface water availability and irrigation potential under prevailing forest and woodland cover as well as varying forest and woodland extents. We undertake these comparative analyses for two irrigation development scenarios that are defined based on different levels of sustained water flows in the Upper Ouémé river network. Our analyses show that conservation of prevailing forests and woodlands in the Upper Ouémé watershed is needed to allow the development of 80% (15,000 ha) or 71% (20,000 ha) of the irrigation potential in the dry season depending on the scenario. At the prevailing forest and woodland extent, the loss of around 40 ha of forest and woodland area reduces the irrigation potential by 1 ha depending on the scenario. Our irrigation potential calculations are based on the water requirements of rice which is the most water intensive crop grown in the study area. For other crops, the ratio will be lower (i.e. less forest and woodland area is required to sustain 1 ha of irrigated crop production). The relation between forest and woodland extent and irrigation potential is, however, not linear, and more hectares of forest and woodland are needed to support 1 ha of irrigated crop production with increasing deforestation. This is relevant for trade-off analysis, where it needs to be noted that the forests and woodlands not only generate water regulation services but also provide other ecosystem services including fuelwood, timber, opportunities for livestock grazing and carbon sequestration.

Study focus However the Penman–Monteith (PM) equation is revealed the most accurate one; it necessitates several climatic parameters that are not always available mostly in the developing countries. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of 16 \{ETo\} equations against the ASCE-PM equation under the sahelian conditions at Ndiaye and Fanaye (Senegal) for alternate equation for \{ETo\} estimation with less climatic parameters. The results showed that the Hargreaves, modified Hargreaves, Ravazzani and Tralkovic equations systematically overestimated \{ETo\} with the highest percentage error of estimate (PE). In contrast, Makkink–Hansen, Oudin and Turc equations systematically underestimated ETo. Temperature based equations of Romenenko and Schendel performed relatively better at Fanaye with 5.5% and 9.6% PE, fitting slopes of 0.92 and 1.05, and mean ratio (MR) of 1.00 and 1.14, respectively. Mass transfer equations of Trabert and Mahringer also had good performance compared to the Penman–Monteith equation.

Because of the recent focus of regional breeding programs in West Africa on a wide diversity of interspecific (O. sativa indica×O. glaberrima) and intraspecific (O. sativa×O. sativa) crosses for lowland systems, new genotypes with promising yield potential and putatively improved weed competitiveness are now available. Our study intended to establish a screening methodology for weed competitiveness in irrigated lowlands, to evaluate weed competitive abilities of diverse rice genotypes, and to relate several morphological plant characteristics with competitive abilities. A selection of 25 cultivars and advanced breeding lines was grown under irrigated conditions during the 2000 wet season (WS) and the 2001 dry season (DS) at Ndiaye (Senegal), and their reaction to four different competition levels was assessed. Competition was greatest where the test lines were grown with a mixture of an improved O. sativa indica cultivar and natural weed growth. Average yield losses across rice lines were 36% in the \{WS\} and 31% in the DS, but differences between lines were highly significant in both seasons and yield losses ranged from 0 to 84%. Competitive abilities were not related to yields without competition. In the DS, several of the new lines combined high yield with good competitiveness and outperformed the currently widely used check variety. Height, tiller density, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area index (LAI), and growth duration were mostly negatively related to yield loss. Plant characteristics measured in monoculture had no explanatory value for the competitive ability of tested lines, indicating that screening under conditions of competition with weeds is preferable. Competitive abilities of several lines were stable across sites, years, and seasons; in others, they were strongly influenced by season. The simplified experimental layout can be used to screen advanced breeding lines or established cultivars with moderate resources (e.g., space, seed, labour). Including such a screening in the breeding process would enable more weed competitive cultivars to be identified and would be likely to contribute to increased resource-use efficiency, reduced yield losses, lower costs, and less reliance on herbicides in rice-based lowland systems.

Inventories of weed species in 19 rice schemes in Tanzania and Kenya were followed by interviews among 380 experienced rice farmers, community elders and traditional healers, grouped into 19 informant groups. Among informant groups, a high degree of consensus about uses of weeds growing in rice paddies was observed. From a total of 222 observed rice weed species, the informant groups identified 67 species with usages described in 1300 use reports. Among these 67 species, 20 are among the most commonly cited weed species in rice paddies in sub-Saharan Africa. Only in 42 cases (3% of the total use reports) did the farmers indicate that they collected (13 species) or spared (four species) these weeds during weeding. In all other cases, such plants were removed or killed during weeding, irrespective of their usefulness. Non-cultivated plants that are spared are those of which the putative agronomic qualities (i.e. for crop protection or soil improvement) are considered more important than their crop competition effects (i.e. Azolla filiculoides and Marsilea crenata) and those that are found in the field margins, which do not compete with the crop. Non-cultivated plants that are collected during weeding have food, fodder or medicinal purposes or a combination of purposes. The most cited species that are collected or spared during weeding were Bidens pilosa, Ipomoea aquatica, Corchorus olitorius and Stachytarpheta jamaicensis. This study revealed that lowland rice farmers in East Africa generally have a high level of understanding and consensus on the usefulness of the non-cultivated plants growing in lowland rice schemes. When they occur in their crop however, the vast majority of these species are primarily seen as weeds and consequently removed or killed. "

Two resistance classes (pre- and post-attachment) and several resistant genotypes have been identified among \{NERICA\} (New Rice for Africa) cultivars under laboratory conditions (in vitro) previously. However, little is known about expression of this resistance under field conditions. Here we investigated (1) whether resistance exhibited under controlled conditions would express under representative Striga-infested field conditions, and (2) whether \{NERICA\} cultivars would achieve relatively good grain yields under Striga-infested conditions. Twenty-five rice cultivars, including all 18 upland \{NERICA\} cultivars, were screened in S. asiatica-infested (in Tanzania) and S. hermonthica-infested (in Kenya) fields during two seasons. Additionally, a selection of cultivars was tested in vitro, in mini-rhizotron systems. For the first time, resistance observed under controlled conditions was confirmed in the field for NERICA-2, -5, -10 and -17 (against S. asiatica) and NERICA-1 to -5, -10, -12, -13 and -17 (against S. hermonthica). Despite high Striga-infestation levels, yields of around 1.8 t ha−1 were obtained with NERICA-1, -9 and -10 (in the S. asiatica-infested field) and around 1.4 t ha−1 with NERICA-3, -4, -8, -12 and -13 (in the S. hermonthica-infested field).

These findings are highly relevant to rice agronomists and breeders and molecular geneticists working on Striga resistance.

Different alternative \{ETo\} equations have been developed and their utilization for various local climate conditions requires analyses of their accuracy as compared to the standardized Penman-Monteith method. There is a significant lack of data and information on this topic in the Senegal River Delta (SRD). Study focus: The objective of this study was to evaluate, calibrate and validate six \{ETo\} equations ((Trabert, Mahringer, Penman1948, Albrecht, Valiantzas1 and Valiantzas2) for the SRD. Although all six equations showed good agreement with the PM-ETo (R2 &gt; 0.60) for daily \{ETo\} estimates, the Valiantzas2 equation was the best model for the Senegal River Delta and had the lowest root mean squared difference (RMSE) of 0.45 mm/day and the lowest percent error of estimate (PE) about 7.1%. New hydrological insights for the region: In the case of data limitations, the equations calibrated in this study are recommended for \{ETo\} estimation in the Senegal River Delta. The results of this study could be used by agricultural producers, crop consultants, university researchers, policy makers for the agricultural, hydrological, and environmental studies as well as proper allocation and use and forecasting in the \{SRD\} where lowland irrigated rice is predominant.

The affected area accommodates some of the poorest farmers of the world. Without appropriate management parasitic weeds in rice are expected to increase in importance in \{SSA\} due to their general invasive nature and their abilities to adapt to changing conditions such as imposed by predicted climate changes. The most important parasitic weeds in rice are: Striga hermonthica, Striga asiatica, Striga aspera and Rhamphicarpa fistulosa. The first two are primarily found in free-draining uplands while S. aspera is also found on hydromorphic soils and R. fistulosa is restricted to unimproved lowlands including inland valleys. As parasitic weeds are typical production constraints in subsistence rice production, targeting them would directly contribute to poverty alleviation and food security. This paper provides an overview of the problems caused by parasitic weeds in rice and discusses management options and opportunities for research for development. "

To quantify the single and combined effect of these biological constraints on rice yields, and to investigate whether weeds attract birds and thereby contribute to increased bird damage, a three-year factorial experiment was set-up in the Senegal River Valley. We tested two management factors (bird and weed management), each with two levels (‘complete’ and ‘absent’), and one crop cycle factor also with two levels (Sahel 202, a medium-cycle and Sahel 108, a short-cycle rice cultivar). Season-long competition from weeds resulted in high but predictable yield losses ranging from 50% to 75%, with lower yield losses for the medium-cycle cultivar Sahel 202 in two of the three seasons. Due to the nature of the pest, season-long exposure to birds resulted in less predictable yield losses ranging from 13% to as high as 94%, with high seasonal variation. In two seasons, much lower bird-inflicted yield losses were observed in the short-cycle cultivar Sahel 108, whereas in one season the medium-cycle cultivar Sahel 202 was much less damaged. When rice was exposed to both weeds and birds, the relative yield losses ranged from 80 to 99%. The yield reducing effect of weeds and birds was never additive. Bird visits to a weedy crop were more frequent compared to a weed-free crop at least in the early rice grain filling stages. This attraction of birds by weeds resulted in an additional yield loss in five of the six cases, ranging from 2 to 62%. Bird-inflicted yield losses in irrigated rice may be reduced by keeping the crop, as much as possible, free from weeds. "

Seven genotypes from Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima species and their interspecific crosses, were grown under weed-free conditions and in competition with weeds. Weed-free grain yields in \{SRI\} were never significantly different than those obtained with RMP. An average of 27% (range 18–46%) less water was applied to \{SRI\} than required for continuous flooding in RMP, resulting in consistently higher water productivity with SRI. However, when subjected to weed competition, mean \{SRI\} yields were significantly lower than \{RMP\} in three of four experimental iterations (an average of 28% less). Across experiments, weed-inflicted \{RYL\} was greater in \{SRI\} than \{RMP\} in 81% of observed cases. Weeds reduced the water productivity enhancing benefits of \{SRI\} by an average of 38% compared to weed-free treatments, resulting in significantly lower water productivity with \{SRI\} in three of four experiments. Rice genotypes Jaya and Sahel-202 were identified as relatively weed-competitive under each crop management system, however both have intermediate-length cycles and required more irrigation than shorter-duration genotypes. When weeds are carefully controlled, good yields and significant water savings can be achieved with SRI. However, this specific requirement of careful weed control might be difficult to meet by farmers coping with high weed infestations or with limited access to tools, inputs or labor to address them. Weed-competitive genotypes could help reduce weed-inflicted yield losses associated with \{SRI\} and other water-saving rice production systems, though future breeding efforts should address the trade-offs between weed competitive traits, water productivity and crop duration to meet the needs of farmers practicing double rice cropping.

Recent short fallows have reduced soil fertility and rice productivity in these systems. Genotypes adapted to a range of soil fertility conditions are needed for their food security. Rainfed experiments were conducted to identify genotypes with high yield and to examine the nature of genotype by environment (G × E) interaction for grain yield. Two improved indica genotypes and seven traditional genotypes including indica and tropical japonica groups were grown without fertilizer in ten environments over the course of 2 years. The effects of G, E and G × E interaction were significant for grain yield, yield components, plant height and days to flowering. Two improved indica genotypes (B6144F-MR-6-0-0 and \{IR\} 55423-01) and a traditional indica genotype Chao Mat out-yielded the other genotypes across the environments (2.1 t ha−1 vs. 1.6 t ha−1). Pattern analysis showed that 40.2% of the G × E sum of squares was captured by a two genotype group by two environment group summary. One environment group had higher contents of soil organic carbon and extractable P and K, and mean grain yield than another environment group. The performance of one genotype group including consisting of improved and traditional indica genotypes was more stable across two environment groups than that of another group consisting of tropical japonica genotypes, which performed well only in the high soil fertility environment group. The low grain yield of tropical japonica genotypes in the low soil fertility environment group was the result of low sink size and grain-filling percentage. In conclusion, two improved genotypes are identified for high yield in both low and high soil fertility conditions and soil organic carbon appears to be a major factor contributing the G × E interaction for grain yield as well as overall productivity.

The yield gap has been related to decreases in the number of spikelets per panicle and decreased spikelet fertility. Since these yield components highly depend on the thermal environment of the meristem which is subjected to changes when a ponded water layer is omitted, the impact of irrigation system on yield components needs to be studied under consideration of temperature at meristem level. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze yield and yield components of irrigated rice grown with and without a ponded water layer under consideration of effects of irrigation system on meristem temperature under field conditions. Field trials were conducted on two sites in Senegal, where rice was grown under flooded and non-flooded conditions with six staggered sowing dates between August 2009 and June 2010. Temperature was measured at meristem level and related to leaf area, yield and yield components of three different varieties (i.e. IR64, Sahel202 and N22). Yield reductions under non-flooded conditions were mainly observed in the cold-dry season, whereas slight yield increase were found in the hot-wet season. Among the yield components, reduced number of spikelets per panicle and spikelet fertility accounted for the largest share of the yield gap. Meristem temperature during the night was always lower under non-flooded conditions and the temperature difference between irrigation treatments increased during the cold-dry season. Leaf area per tiller was linearly related to meristem temperature in the observed temperature range, and a linear relationship was found between leaf area per tiller and the number of spikelets per panicle. Furthermore, spikelet fertility increased with meristem temperature between panicle initiation and booting stage. Therefore, lower meristem temperature led to smaller leaf area per tiller, less spikelets per panicle and decreased fertility under non-flooded conditions. Without standing water, the rice plant's meristem will be exposed to lower temperatures during night, which can lead to significant yield reductions in areas where cool nights occur. "

These observations led to the perception of rice being a plant extremely sensitive to water stress even when grown in soils where water is sufficiently available. Since the rice plant's meristem is below the water surface during the vegetative stage in flooded fields, the difference in heat capacity between water and air will lead to changes in meristem temperature, when a ponded water layer is omitted. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate leaf area development in response to meristem temperature under flooded and non-flooded conditions in the field. In Ndiaye, located in the Senegal River valley, a lowland rice variety (IR64) was sown on 13 staggered dates between July 2008 and June 2010. In a flooded treatment (FL), a continuous water layer was maintained, whereas in a non-flooded treatment (NF), irrigation water was applied until soil saturation every 2 or 3 days. Temperature at the soil surface as well as leaf area and tiller number were recorded. In most cases, leaf area was reduced under non-flooded conditions. Leaf area expansion rate was correlated with meristem temperature during the night. With temperature at the soil surface being lower under non-flooded conditions, lower leaf area expansion rates under non-flooded conditions could be attributed to lower meristem temperature. The omission of a floodwater layer can expose the rice plant's meristems to larger temperature extremes and thus affect plant growth. In environments with large temperature amplitudes, this effect should be considered when water-saving measures are applied in lowland rice fields. "

At a site in the Senegal River valley, canopy and soil temperature as well as temperature at meristem level and relative humidity inside the canopy were observed in the presence and absence of a ponded water layer in an irrigated rice field. Gas-exchange measurements were conducted at different development stages of three varieties (IR4630, IR64, and Sahel108) sown in bi-monthly intervals and the effects of climatic and microclimatic parameters on stomatal conductance, assimilation rate, and intrinsic water use efficiency were investigated. Minimum soil (Tsmin) and meristem temperature (TMmin) were usually lower in the absence of a ponded water layer. Stomatal conductance depended mainly on Tsmin, TMmin, and minimum relative humidity inside the canopy. Assimilation rate was positively correlated with solar radiation, Tsmin and TMmin, but depended mainly on stomatal conductance. Without standing water, stomatal conductance was significantly lower, but reductions could be explained with lower Tsmin and/or TMmin. Nevertheless, Tsmin and/or \{TMmin\} were the major determinants of stomatal conductance and assimilation rate, which suggests a pivotal role of root zone temperature on plant growth probably via water uptake and, thus, overall plant water status. Varietal differences were found, with assimilation rate in \{IR4630\} and Sahel108 having been less affected by low temperature than in IR64. When water-saving irrigation measures are applied in irrigated rice, the negative effects of lower soil and meristem temperature in the absence of a ponded water layer in the field on the productivity of rice need to be considered. In regions where night temperatures below 20 °C occur, varieties should be used that are less temperature-responsive, if the effect of cool nights on meristem temperature cannot be mitigated by a ponded water layer.

Development of small-scale irrigation schemes is given high priority in national rice development plans. For realizing potential of the newly developed schemes, it is essential to understand yield level, farmers’ crop management practices and production constraints. A series of field surveys were conducted in six small-scale irrigation schemes in Zou department, Benin during the dry season in 2010–2011 to assess variation in rice yields and identify factors affecting the variation. The schemes were established between 1969 and 2009. Rice yields ranged from 1.3 to 7.8 t ha−1 with an average yield of 4.8 t ha−1. The average yield was only 2.9 t ha−1 for newer irrigation schemes developed in 2002 and 2009. Multiple regression analysis using farmers’ crop management practices as well as abiotic and biotic stresses as independent variables revealed that 75% of the variation in yields could be explained by five agronomic factors (fallow residue management, ploughing method, water stress, rat damage and N application rate) and two edaphic factors (sloped surfaces and sand content in the soil). Removing fallow residue from the fields for land preparation reduced yields. Yields were lower in plots ploughed by hand than by machine. Sloped surface, water stress and rat damage reduced yields. Yield increase due to N application ranged from 0.8 to 1.6 t ha−1. Higher sand content was associated with lowered yields. The low yields in new irrigation schemes caused by sub-optimal crop management practices suggest that farmer-to-farmer learning and extension of good agricultural principles and practices can increase yields. Organizational capacity is also important to ensure the use of common resources such as irrigation water and tractors for land preparation. "

Given the diversity of soil types, cropping seasons, and the resource endowment of farmers, the magnitude of the soil fertility decline and the effectiveness of management options to counteract this decline is likely to differ. Five organic and inorganic management options were compared with farmers’ practice regarding their effects on soil fertility attributes and nutrient balances/use efficiencies in maize on three contrasting soils of Western Kenya and over two cropping seasons. Irrespective of the season, organic amendments were more effective than mineral fertilizers in enhancing soil carbon stocks and the labile and non-labile C fractions. The largest soil C content (4.1%) and C pool (72 Mg ha−1) were observed on the clay Nitisol after two seasons of reduced tillage, while the lowest C content (1.1%) and C pool (22 Mg ha−1) were observed on the sandy Acrisol with conventional tillage. Total soil N content was consistently higher with mineral than with organic fertilizer use and more so on Nitisol than on Ferralsol or Acrisol. The soil N supplying capacity increased with the application of both organic and mineral fertilizers and reached 210 mg kg−1 after two weeks of anaerobic incubation of the mineral N-amended Acrisol. Bray-I P content reflected the P application rates and was highest (50–66 mg kg−1) on the Acrisol with mineral P fertilizer use and lowest (1.5 mg kg−1) on the Ferralsol in the unamended control treatment. Partial N and P balances were generally positive except for the mineral N-amended treatments on the Nitisol. The efficiency of applied N varied from 29 to 135 kg kg−1 N with lowest values in the sandy Acrisol under reduced tillage. These differential responses to management options in different soil types were reflected in maize grain yields with highest cumulative yields of 4.7–9.4 Mg ha−1 a−1 in the Nitisol and 1.4–7.4 Mg ha−1 a−1 in the Acrisol and the Ferralsol. We may conclude that the tested technology options differentially affected soil fertility and production attributes. The extent of this response depended on the cropping season and the soil type, supporting the need for site-specific nutrient management and technology targeting. "

Briquettes produced using fine particles (&lt; 0.3 mm), hot (97 °C) water, husk–bran ratios of 0:1, 1:2, 1:1, 1:0, 2:1, and dried in the sun for 21 days had mean hardness values of 132, 89, 76, 62, and 31 N. Four types of fuel briquettes were produced: husk–bran–palm press fiber (HBF), husk–bran–palm press sludge (HBS), husk–bran only (HBO), and husk–biochar–clay (HBC). The four types of briquettes recorded shorter start-up time (&lt; 5 min) than charcoal (10 min). The average flame temperatures of HBF, HBS, and \{HBO\} during the first 20 min were higher (898 °C) than the average temperature of charcoal (546 °C). The characteristics of \{HBF\} and \{HBO\} briquettes provide the best option for consumers, especially those in the rice parboiling industry, as these briquettes recorded the following values for hardness (170 and 101 N, respectively), start-up time (2 and 3 min), burning rate (126 and 145 g/min), specific fuel consumption (121 and 136 g/l), and flame temperature (684 °C and 728 °C). It was concluded that briquettes could be produced from rice-milling by-products with acceptable quality using this affordable technology. "

We used a nation-wide dataset of over 603 farm households, which surveyed pockets of successes in using improved livestock feed technologies. Heckman two-stage estimation procedures were used to identify factors associated with success and intensity of livestock feed technology use simultaneously. Results from the first stage of selection equation show that households socioeconomic and institutional factors such as education status of the head, herd size, exercise in feed technology utilization, cooperative membership, distance to district center, and diverse use of technologies have significant effect on success in livestock feed technologies adoption. The second stage demonstrates that intensity of household collaboration or network, membership in livestock related cooperatives, training, access to livestock feed technologies with packages, diverse use of technologies, engagement in livestock enterprises, livestock management system, willingness to invest more in feed technologies, and agro-ecologies significantly influence the intensity of feed technologies use. These results suggest that success and intensified use of improved feed technologies demand different entry strategies for risk factors, enablers, and behaviors, which may differ from the classic agricultural technologies transfer system. These include availability of appropriate biophysical and resource environments, functional linkages between different actors, access to inputs and social capital, and enabling institutional support system. Moreover, this study shows that when there is limited adoption, few pockets of success in improved technologies use, positive deviant approach would be more informative to understand the underlying factors and principles for success and intensified use of technologies than the most commonly reported conventional adoption rate studies.

In this study, the strategic application of a micro-dose of P to the nursery bed was evaluated as a way to improve seedling vigor and P fertilizer use efficiency and overcome potentially reduced seedling vigor associated with low seed P concentration in transplanted rice. In a first experiment established in two fields differing in soil P supply, two rice genotypes (Mudgo and Santhi Sufaid) were grown with and without P application to a P-deficient nursery bed. In a second experiment established in the same fields with the same genotypes, P application to the nursery bed was evaluated in combination with two seed sources differing in seed P concentration. In both experiments, P application to the nursery bed doubled seedling shoot biomass of both genotypes at transplanting time with a 5-fold increase in seedling shoot P content in the first experiment. In the first experiment, P application to the nursery bed increased grain yield by 10–14% in the field with higher soil P supply and 30–40% in the field with lower soil P supply. In the second experiment, P application to the nursery bed increased grain yield by 19–20% in the field with lower P supply only, whereas no effect of P application to the nursery bed on yield was observed at higher soil P supply. We conclude that strategic application of micro-doses of P to the nursery bed can substantially enhance seedling vigor and grain yield of transplanted rice at low P supply. "

The potential yield of rice genotypes is governed by the thermal environment experienced during crop development phases when yield components are determined. Thus, knowledge on genotypic variability in phenotypic responses to variable temperature is required for assessing the adaptability of rice production to changing climate. Although, several crop models are available for this task, genotypic thermal constants used to simulate crop phenology vary strongly among the models and are under debate. Therefore, we conducted field trials with ten contrasting upland rice (O. sativa L.) genotypes on three locations along an altitudinal gradient with five monthly staggered sowing dates for two years in Madagascar with the aim to study phenological responses at different temperature regimes. We found that, crop duration is equally influenced by genotype selection, sowing date and year in the high altitude. In contrast, in mid altitudes genotype has no effect on crop duration. At low altitudes crop duration is more affected by sowing date. Grain yield is strongly affected by low temperatures at high altitudes and severly influenced by frequent tropical cyclones at low altitudes. In high altitude, genotype explained 68% of variation in spikelet sterility, whereas in mid and low altitudes environment explained more than 70% of the variation. The phenological responses determining crop duration and yield, the basic genotypic thermal constants, and the analyses of genotypic thermal responses with regard to spikelet sterility reported here, provide valuable information for the improvement of rice phenological models urgently needed to develop new genotypes and better adapted cropping calendars.

But \{YP\} has stagnated at about 10 Mg ha−1 since the Green Revolution. We present a survey of researchers’ current top yields across different environments and countries, experimentally investigate YP-related traits and radiation use efficiency (RUE) of 12 elite materials, and use a simple model to explore traits that would raise the yield ceiling. The survey indicated that maximal grain yield is between 5 and 12 Mg ha−1 depending on radiation during flowering and grain filling. The experiments conducted in several environments in the Philippines indicated that (1) different morphologies in terms of panicle number and size and leaf size lead to similar \{YP\} due to trait–trait compensation, and (2) differences in \{RUE\} are partly attributable to variation in terminal senescence which is strongly environment dependent. Simulations thus focused on post-floral physiological processes, namely dynamics of light interception, carbon assimilation and maintenance burden. Scenarios of different degree of stay-green indicated that terminal senescence is essential to limit N requirements and maintenance burden, but partial stay-green would strongly benefit \{RUE\} and YP, particularly if accompanied with increased leaf photosynthetic capacity. The need to increase pre-floral C and N reserves for grain filling is discussed, resulting in a concept to refine current ideotypes such as IRRI’s New Plant Type and China’s Super Hybrid Rice. In conclusion, current best tropical breeding products do not have higher \{YP\} than some varieties dating 30–40 years, and new concepts are needed in rice breeding. Breeding for such plants should be done under high N inputs. "

Governments in the Sahel are responding by promoting double-cropping of irrigated rice in the region's river basins, although rising fertilizer and water costs cast doubt on the future profitability of such systems. Despite controversy, the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is widely promoted as a potential solution to this dilemma. \{SRI\} includes transplanting young, single seedlings at wide spacing, compost application, mechanical weed control, and alternate wetting and drying irrigation. However, independent evaluation of the system in comparison to an appropriate control is lacking in SSA, and the Sahel in particular. Responding to this need, we compared \{SRI\} to flooded rice production following regionally Recommended Management Practices (RMP), in a five-season experiment in the Senegal River Valley. Our objectives were to evaluate yield, water productivity, fertilizer nitrogen recovery efficiency, partial macronutrient balances and soil quality under both management systems. But because compost production in the Sahel is constrained by low labor and biomass availability, we replaced these materials with waste rice straw, and compared the impact of sole mineral fertilizer application to rice straw residue incorporation with fertilizer addition, under both \{SRI\} and RMP. In seasons 1–3, fertilizer alone significantly increased yield, with no differences found between management systems. In season 4, beneficial effects of straw incorporation and fertilizer addition were observed, as significant additive increases in yield, straw and fertilizer nitrogen recovery were found for each management system. In season 5, additive benefits were found only for SRI, although \{SRI\} yields never exceeded any fertility management treatment under RMP. Across seasons, water savings from 16% to 48% were obtained with SRI, resulting in significant (11%–45%) increases in water productivity. Combined straw incorporation and fertilizer application helped stabilize partial nitrogen and potassium balances across management systems. Compared to controls, straw incorporation also increased total soil nitrogen and carbon. In contrast to the literature on \{SRI\} in the Sahel, our findings indicate that when nutrient additions are held constant, significant yield increases should not be expected over conventionally recommended rice crop management systems. However, should farmers choose to experiment with \{SRI\} to reduce water use, they would be most likely to benefit from combining rice straw incorporation with mineral fertilizer, although several seasons may be required for additive yield effects to occur.

Their depletion at the global scale may threaten global food and feed security. To prevent this depletion, improved P resource recycling from food chain waste to agricultural soils and to the food and feed industry is often presented as a serious option. However, waste streams are often complex and their recycling efficiency is poorly characterized. The aim of this paper is to estimate the P recovery and recycling potential from waste, considering France as a case study. We assessed the P flows in food processing waste, household wastewater and municipal waste at the country scale using a substance flow analysis for the year 2006. We also quantified the P recycling efficiency as the fraction of P in waste that ultimately reached agricultural soils or was recycled in the food and feed industry. Efforts were made to limit data uncertainty by cross-checking multiple data sources concerning P content in waste materials. Results showed that, in general, P recovery in waste was high but that the overall P recycling efficiency was only 51% at the country scale. In particular, P recycling efficiency was 75% for industrial waste, 43% for household wastewater and 47% for municipal waste. The remaining P was discharged into water bodies or landfilled, causing P-induced environmental problems as well as losses of nutrient resources. Major P losses were through food waste (which amounted to 39% of P in available food) and treated wastewater, and the findings were confirmed through cross-checking with alternative data sources. Options for improving P resource recycling and, thereby, reducing P fertilizer use were quantified but appeared to be less promising than scenarios based on reduced food waste or redesigned agricultural systems.

A systematic literature review is conducted to study the relation between crop protection and systems approaches to innovation in 107 publications. The analysis of the crop protection literature demonstrates that only a small fraction is systems-oriented as compared to the bulk of publications with a technology-oriented approach. The analysis of agricultural innovations systems literature shows that, although crop protection is addressed, the potential of this systems approach remains largely unexplored for crop protection innovation. A large share of the publications included in this review focus on cropping or farming ‘systems’ while ‘innovation’ often equals the development, transfer, adoption and diffusion of crop protection technologies at farm level. There is relatively little attention for the institutional and political dimensions of crop protection and the interactions between farm, regional and national levels in crop protection systems. The traditional division of roles and responsibilities of researchers as innovators, extension personnel as disseminators, and farmers as end-users, is challenged only to a limited extent. The majority of publications discusses ways to optimise existing features of crop protection systems, without exploring more structural transformations that may be required to enhance the resilience of crop protection systems.

But the increasing specialisation and spatial segregation of crop and livestock production systems both at the farm and the district scale may hamper the proper recycling of nutrients between these two activities. However, the effect of such segregation has only been investigated on some case-studies – mostly at the regional and the local scale – while we still lack of systematic assessment of this segregation in terms of mineral fertiliser use on a range of scales. In this paper, we estimated the effect of this segregation on nutrient resource use at the district scale. Phosphorus (P) fertiliser was considered since it is produced from a finite resource that needs to be more efficiently recycled in agriculture and France was chosen as a case study, representative of industrial countries with a wide range of variations in crop and livestock segregation. We quantified the effect of livestock density on mineral P fertiliser use and the effect of crop and livestock spatial segregation on P fertiliser use and its substitution with P in animal manure. Our results showed that P fertiliser use decreased with increasing livestock density at the district scale. However, the substitution of P fertiliser with P in animal manure was only partial (probably due to more N- than P-oriented decision making by farmers and low N:P ratio of organic manure), leading to large nutrient surpluses in districts with high livestock densities (&gt;1.1 livestock unit per agricultural area). Finally, P fertiliser use increased with the spatial segregation of crops and livestock. Overall, our results demonstrated that lower segregation of crops and animals could help to save non-renewable resources, and that improvements in manure management are required. "

These effects have been shown to significantly affect spatio-temporal variations in water availability and rice productivity in Asia. Therefore, this study addresses the spatio-temporal variations of the various water components within irrigated toposequences in an African inland valley and assesses its effect on water productivity and respective rice yields for two irrigation practices: (i) continuous flooding (CF), a well-known water management practice in rice cultivation used worldwide and (ii) a reduced irrigation scheme (RI) where irrigation is applied every 5 days resulting in a 1–2 cm water layer after irrigation. The lateral flow observed in the inland valley had a strong two-dimensional character, contributing to water gains between fields, located at the same toposequential level as well as along toposequences. The toposequential effect on sub-surface hydrological processes masked the overall effect of water management treatment on rice production. Additionally, the associated water productivity (WP) was not found to differ significantly between the treatments when standard calculations (i.e. net irrigation and evapotranspiration) were used but a clear toposequential effect was found for the fertilized lower lying fields when the net irrigation was corrected by the lateral flow component. Results of the established mixed regression model indicated that based on the groundwater table, rainfall and standard soil physico-chemical characteristics rice yields can be predicted in these African inland valleys under continuous flooding and reduced irrigation practices. Validation of the established regression function of inland valleys, representing various groundwater tables in the region, could lead to improved regression functions suitable to estimate spatial variation in rice production and water consumption across scales as affected by water management, fertilizer application and groundwater tables.

Innovation capacity in the agricultural system is studied by analysing (1) constraints within the institutional, sectoral and technological subsystems of the agricultural system, and (2) the existence and performance of the agricultural innovation support system. \{RAAIS\} combines multiple qualitative and quantitative methods, and insider (stakeholders) and outsider (researchers) analyses which allow for critical triangulation and validation of the gathered data. Such an analysis can provide specific entry points for innovations to address the complex agricultural problem under study, and generic entry points for innovation related to strengthening the innovation capacity of agricultural system and the functioning of the agricultural innovation support system. The application of \{RAAIS\} to analyse parasitic weed problems in the rice sector, conducted in Tanzania and Benin, demonstrates the potential of the diagnostic tool and provides recommendations for its further development and use.

We combine the tools of systems analysis and experimentation, detailed field observations and surveys, incorporate expert knowledge (local knowledge and results of research), generate databases, and apply simulation models to analyse performance of farms, and the impacts of introducing new technologies. We have analysed and described complexity of farming systems, their external drivers and some of the mechanisms that result in (in)efficient use of scarce resources. Studying sites across sub-Saharan Africa has provided insights in the trajectories of change in farming systems in response to population growth, economic conditions and climate variability (cycles of drier and wetter years) and climate change. In regions where human population is dense and land scarce, farm typologies have proven useful to target technologies between farmers of different production objectives and resource endowment (notably in terms of land, labour and capacity for investment). In such regions we could categorise types of fields on the basis of their responsiveness to soil improving technologies along soil fertility gradients, relying on local indicators to differentiate those that may be managed through ‘maintenance fertilization’ from fields that are highly-responsive to fertilizers and fields that require rehabilitation before yields can improved. Where human population pressure on the land is less intense, farm and field types are harder to discern, without clear patterns. Nutrient cycling through livestock is in principle not efficient for increasing food production due to increased nutrient losses, but is attractive for farmers due to the multiple functions of livestock. We identified trade-offs between income generation, soil conservation and community agreements through optimising concurrent objectives at farm and village levels. These examples show that future analyses must focus at farm and farming system level and not at the level of individual fields to achieve appropriate targeting of technologies – both between locations and between farms at any given location. The approach for integrated assessment described here can be used ex ante to explore the potential of best-fit technologies and the ways they can be best combined at farm level. The dynamic and integrated nature of the framework allows the impact of changes in external drivers such as climate change or development policy to be analysed. Fundamental questions for integrated analysis relate to the site-specific knowledge and the simplification of processes required to integrate and move from one level to the next. "

In this paper we implement the Rapid Appraisal of Agricultural Innovation Systems (RAAIS) as a diagnostic tool to identify specific and generic entry points for innovations to address parasitic weeds in rain-fed rice production in Tanzania. Data were gathered across three study sites in Tanzania where parasitic weeds are eminent (Kyela, Songea Rural and Morogoro Rural districts). The results demonstrate that in Tanzania, weeds in general and parasitic weeds in particular receive little attention in agricultural research, training and education curricula. Crop protection policies mainly focus on the control of (insect) pest and diseases and there is relatively little attention for weed prevention, which is essential for addressing parasitic weed problems effectively. Specific entry points for innovation include increasing awareness of parasitic weed problems among farmers, extension and crop protection officers and policymakers. In regions where awareness is relatively high, participatory research approaches can provide a basis for developing locally adapted parasitic weed management strategies. Generic entry points for innovation include enhanced collaboration and interaction between stakeholders across different levels, for example in multi-stakeholder platforms. This can provide the basis for developing and implementing coherent policy and development strategies to address structural constraints in the agricultural system, including the promotion of clean local seed systems, investments in physical and knowledge infrastructure development, adequate backstopping of agricultural extension officers, agribusiness training for farmers, quality control of agricultural inputs, timely access to agricultural inputs, and improved access to markets for farmers. Together the specific and generic entry points can strengthen the innovation capacity of Tanzania's agricultural system to address parasitic weed problems, as well as other complex agricultural problems.

To assess on a global scale where water productivity can be improved and what the causes are for not reaching its potential, the current levels must be understood. This paper describes the development and validation of a \{WATer\} \{PROductivity\} (WATPRO) model for wheat that is based on remote sensing-derived input data sets, and that can be applied at local to global scales. The model is a combination of Monteith's theoretical framework for dry matter production in plants and an energy balance model to assess actual evapotranspiration. It is shown that by combining both approaches, the evaporative fraction and the atmospheric transmissivity, two parameters which are usually difficult to estimate spatially, can be omitted. Water productivity can then be assessed from four spatial variables: broadband surface albedo, the vegetation index NDVI, the extraterrestrial radiation and air temperature. A sensitivity analysis revealed that \{WATPRO\} is most sensitive to changes in \{NDVI\} and least sensitive to changes in air temperature. The \{WATPRO\} model was applied at 39 locations where water productivity was measured under experimental conditions. The correlation between measured and modelled water productivity was low, and this can be mainly attributed to differences in scales and in the experimental and modelling periods. A comparison with measurements from farmer's fields in areas surrounded by other wheat fields located in Sirsa District, \{NW\} India, showed an improved correlation. Although not a validation, a comparison with SEBAL-derived water productivity in the same region in India proved that \{WATPRO\} can spatially predict water productivity with the same spatial variation.

Increasing water productivity is an often cited solution, though the current levels of water productivity are not systematically mapped. A global map of water productivity helps to identify where water resources are productively used, and identifies places where improvements are possible. The \{WATPRO\} water productivity model for wheat, using remote sensing data products as input, was applied at a global scale with global data sets of the \{NDVI\} and surface albedo to benchmark water productivity of wheat for the beginning of this millennium. Time profiles of the \{NDVI\} were used to determine the time frame from crop establishment to harvest on a pixel basis, which was considered the modelling period. It was found that water productivity varies from approximately 0.2 to 1.8 kg of harvestable wheat per cubic metre of water consumed. From the 10 largest producers of wheat, France and Germany score the highest country average water productivity of 1.42 and 1.35 kg m−3, respectively. The results were compared with modelling information by Liu et al. (2007) who applied the \{GEPIC\} model at a global scale to map water productivity, and by Chapagain and Hoekstra (2004) who used \{FAO\} statistics to determine water productivity per country. A comparison with Liu et al. showed a good correlation for most countries, but the correlation with the results by Chapagain and Hoekstra was less obvious. The global patterns of the water productivity map were compared with global data sets of precipitation and reference evapotranspiration to determine the impact of climate and of water availability reflected by precipitation. It appears that the highest levels of water productivity are to be expected in temperate climates with high precipitation. Due to its non-linear relationship with precipitation, it is expected that large gains in water productivity can be made with in situ rain water harvesting or supplemental irrigation in dry areas with low seasonal precipitation. A full understanding of the spatial patterns by country or river basin will support decisions on where to invest and what measures to take to make agriculture more water productive. "

Data on crop management, fulfilment of water requirements, weed density, nitrogen absorption by the crop and nutrient availability in the soil, as well as the sanitary status of the crop were recorded at two-week intervals throughout the crop cycle. The data were analysed by principal component analysis, and multiple linear regression. Yields varied between years and sites from 0.7 to 45.3 t ha−1 in 2003 and from 8.1 to 89.1 t ha−1 in 2005. In 2003, the number of fruits per m2, fruit weight, the health status of the crop, and the cation exchange capacity of the soil explained 84.7% of yield variability among fields. In 2005, the number of fruits per m2 and the health status of the crop explained 84% of yield variability. In 2003, 61.8% of the variability of the number of fruits per m2 was explained by health status and the number of plants per m2, whereas in 2005, 65.6% of the variability was explained by health status, the number of pesticide applications, and planting density. The results of this study indicate that tomato yield could be increased by improving the health status of the crop by improving the efficiency of crop protection practices and by increasing planting density.

This would be inefficient from a policy economics perspective, especially in an open economy where global trade is taken into account.

The panel was field-phenotyped under flooded conditions for duration to flowering (F) for 6 sowing dates in Senegal (capturing different thermal and day length regimes) and during two years at two altitudes (mid, 857 m asl; high, 1497 m asl; with similar latitude) in Madagascar. The experiments had an augmented design in Senegal (6 blocks × 6 dates as subplots and 209 acc. as sub-subplot) with 4 replicated check varieties; and a complete block design with 3 replications at 2 sites × 2 years in Madagascar. To dissociate different traits contributing to variation of F, five genotypic Index Variables were calculated. Among them, \{PCA\} identified three as describing 98% of diversity: Estimated basic vegetative phase (BVP), photoperiod (PP) sensitivity, and altitude response. Three clusters were identified within the indica group and related to genotype origin, agronomic type and ecosystem of adaptation. Cluster \{C1\} was PP-sensitive, \{C2\} had short \{BVP\} and \{C3\} had long BVP. Within C1, a sub-cluster was highly altitude sensitive, and within \{C3\} two sub-clusters were comparatively altitude insensitive. Harvest index (HI), aboveground dw and stem height observed in the most favorable environment (Senegal wet season) showed distinct patterns among clusters, with \{C2\} having high \{HI\} and \{C1\} being tall.

The \{ARAs\} were intermediate to high amylose rice types and their 1000-kernel weight and bulk densities were comparable to the ARVs. Volume expansion ratios of cooked kernels overlapped among rice varieties ranging from 2.5 to 4.4 and the \{ARAs\} had relatively lower cooking solids loss and harder texture compared to the \{ARVs\} which were softer and more adhesive. Flours from the \{ARVs\} formed more viscous slurries, exhibiting higher breakdown viscosities than the ARAs. Gelatinization transition temperatures and enthalpies were significantly higher for flours from \{ARAs\} than the \{ARVs\} suggesting more stable crystal structure for ARAs. This is supported by the higher energy required to liquefy the retrograded \{ARAs\} flour gels. The cooked samples of \{ARAs\} and \{ARVs\} showed close starch digestibility indices with expected glycemic index (eGI) ranging from 71 to 78. Differences observed in cooking characteristics and textural properties between \{ARAs\} and \{ARVs\} may be partially due to the ARAs’ high amylose content. "

Environments were six seasonal climatic situations (sowing dates) in Senegal, ranging from cool to hot; and at two altitudes (857 and 1497 m asl) and two years in Madagascar. The apex temperature during the critical phenological stage was estimated from weather records and an empirical model estimating the daily minimum water temperature. Sterility incidence was regressed for each accession against apex temperature across all environments after discarding observations potentially involving heat induced sterility. From the correlations, the slope of the temperature response and sterility at 20 °C (no stress) and 15 °C (chilling stress) were derived and used to evaluate the accessions and establish clusters. Indicas were on average more sensitive than temperate and tropical japonicas. Among indicas, large diversity in cold sterility was observed that formed 6 clusters, which represented the different genetic sub-groups at a distinct frequency. Sterility was greater in Senegal than in Madagascar for all clusters.

We tested different crop management systems for irrigated rice in three seasons of adaptive research trials in three locations in the middle Senegal River Valley. Our objectives were to assess the agronomic and socio-economic viability of Recommended Management Practices (RMPs) compared to the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and Farmers’ Practices (FPs). During the 2008 dry season, \{RMP\} and \{SRI\} significantly increased yields over \{FP\} by 2.3 and 2.6 t ha−1 across sites. Farmers analyzed their experiences in post-experiment meetings. They appreciated SRI’s yield and water-saving potential, but found it labor demanding, especially for weed management requirements that coincided with horticultural activities. Conversely, farmers described RMP’s elevated herbicide rate as costly, and indicated that because of poorly functioning agro-chemical markets, herbicide volumes larger than typically used in \{FP\} might be difficult to reliably source. To modify management systems to fit farmers’ needs and assets, we collaboratively developed a fourth, ‘Farmer Adapted Practice’ (FAP) that blended \{RMP\} and SRI. \{FAP\} used intermittent irrigation during the late vegetative stage, recommended crop density, intermediate seedling age, and a single round of mechanical weeding followed by localized herbicide application. Farmers compared \{FAP\} against the initial management systems in the subsequent seasons. Though no yield differences were found between RMP, \{SRI\} and FAP, each yielded significantly more (+1.0, +1.1 and +1.5 t ha−1) than FP. \{FAP\} also reduced labor requirements without increasing weed biomass compared to \{RMP\} or SRI, and used 40% and 10% less herbicide than \{RMP\} and FP, respectively. Cumulative distribution functions showed that \{FAP\} increased net profit potential and decreased economic risk. Prior to the 2009 dry season trials, the Senegalese state eliminated herbicide subsidies, doubling their cost. RMP, \{SRI\} and \{FAP\} yielded 2.9, 3.0 and 3.1 t ha−1 more than FP. \{FAP\} again reduced weeding labor and herbicide requirements while lowering production risk across sites. This study demonstrates the value-added outcomes that result from research that facilitates farmer–researcher collaboration to learn from, innovate and tailor management systems to fit local circumstances.

Groundwater decline is most severe in the Alluvial Fans where our study site is located. Avoiding a foreseeable systems collapse requires region-wide changes in crop systems management, underpinned by sound environmental policies. Here, we explore the potential of crop system adaptation to remedy the excessive water use and quantify the likely yield penalties associated with more sustainable water use practices. Using simulations with the \{APSIM\} cropping systems model we explore production opportunities in an area within the \{NCP\} with intensive cropping and no access to irrigation from rivers. We estimate the attainable production levels for wheat and maize if agriculture were made groundwater neutral, through changes in crop sequence, irrigation practices and water conservation technologies (e.g. mulching with plastic film). Total grain production would drop by 44% compared to current practice if agriculture were made groundwater neutral. Water conservation by plastic film could limit this reduction to 21–33% but possible environmental impacts of plastic film need attention. This analysis facilitates a much needed debate on alternative agronomic practices and incentives through a quantitative comparison of adaptation options. Our biophysical analysis needs to be complemented with socio-economic considerations and discussions with all stakeholders. Similar analyses in other parts of the \{NCP\} are possible but require more accurate modelling of landscape hydrology and (towards the coast) risk of salt water intrusion. "

This implies that for the future, a mixture of area expansion and imports will be needed on top of yield gap closure. Further research is needed for identification of most suitable new land for rice area expansion and areas that should be protected. "

The objective of this paper is to identify institutional and political constraints and opportunities for innovation to address parasitic weed problems in rice. Constraints and opportunities for innovation were studied across three nested systems: the parasitic weed control system, the crop protection system, and the agricultural system. Multi-stakeholder workshops, interviews and surveys were held to gather data on key constraints faced by different stakeholder groups across three parasitic weed infested study sites in both Tanzania and Benin. The results demonstrate that in both countries, the majority of institutional and political constraints relate to the functioning of the broader crop protection and agricultural systems and not specifically to parasitic weeds. Although differences were observed between the two countries and the different stakeholder groups, the majority of constraints perceived by the stakeholders were caused by a lack of capabilities and resources and a limited access to credit. Awareness raising of parasitic weed problems among farmers, extension and crop protection officers at the local level, combined with improved input and service supply and enhanced agricultural education and training curricula at the national level, were identified as important elements for improvement. More structural collaboration between key stakeholder groups is expected to contribute to a better recognition of agricultural problems, like that of parasitic weeds in rice, and a more timely identification of feasible solutions.

abstract = "Abstract Accurate estimation of yield gaps is only possible for locations where high quality local data are available, which are, however, lacking in many regions of the world. The challenge is how yield gap estimates based on location-specific input data can be used to obtain yield gap estimates for larger spatial areas. Hence, insight about the minimum number of locations required to achieve robust estimates of yield gaps at larger spatial scales is essential because data collection at a large number of locations is expensive and time consuming. In this paper we describe an approach that consists of a climate zonation scheme supplemented by agronomical and locally relevant weather, soil and cropping system data. Two elements of this methodology are evaluated here: the effects on simulated national crop yield potentials attributable to missing and/or poor quality data and the error that might be introduced in scaled up yield gap estimates due to the selected climate zonation scheme. Variation in simulated yield potentials among weather stations located within the same climate zone, represented by the coefficient of variation, served as a measure of the performance of the climate zonation scheme for upscaling of yield potentials. We found that our approach was most appropriate for countries with homogeneous topography and large climate zones, and that local up-to-date knowledge of crop area distribution is required for selecting relevant locations for data collection. Estimated national water-limited yield potentials were found to be robust if data could be collected that are representative for approximately 50% of the national harvested area of a crop. In a sensitivity analysis for rainfed maize in four countries, assuming only 25% coverage of the national harvested crop area (to represent countries with poor data availability), national water-limited yield potentials were found to be over- or underestimated by 3 to 27% compared to estimates with the recommended crop area coverage of ≥50%. It was shown that the variation of simulated yield potentials within the same climate zone is small. Water-limited potentials in semi-arid areas are an exception, because the climate zones in these semi-arid areas represent aridity limits of crop production for the studied crops. We conclude that the developed approach is robust for scaling up yield gap estimates from field, i.e. weather station data supplemented by local soil and cropping system data, to regional and national levels. Possible errors occur in semi-arid areas with large variability in rainfall and in countries with more heterogeneous topography and climatic conditions in which data availability hindered full application of the approach.

The PolSTAR design is based on the technology developed for the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) mission launched in June 2012. In particular, it uses the same X-ray optics, extendable telescope boom, optical bench, and CdZnTe detectors as NuSTAR. The mission has the sensitivity to measure ∼1% linear polarization fractions for X-ray sources with fluxes down to ∼5 mCrab. This paper describes the PolSTAR design as well as the science drivers and the potential science return. "
