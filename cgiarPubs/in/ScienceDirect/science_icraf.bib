An analysis was conducted to determine how closely Kenya’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) matches with the problems and priorities articulated by residents of 80 rural communities in 10 districts of Western Kenya. The results suggest that there was a good match between national \{PRSP\} priorities and priorities generated from the 80 rural communities, but poor matches between district level \{PRSP\} priorities and community priorities, and between national \{PRSP\} priorities and the national \{PRSP\} implementation plan. The results imply the need for a stronger multiscale approach to poverty reduction, with special emphasis on the mesoscales of locations and districts. "

In the present study we compared the population of soil macrofauna in maize grown in gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium), leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), Leucaena diversifolia, sesbania (Sesbania sesban) and acacia (Acacia anguistissima) and continuously cropped monoculture maize. The objectives of the study were to determine (1) the effect of the type and length of fallows on soil macrofauna communities and functional groups, and (2) the long-term effect of legume fallows on maize yield. The number of invertebrate orders per sampling unit was significantly influenced by the type of fallow but not by the length of fallow period. Maize grown in legume fallows had more numbers of invertebrate orders than monoculture maize. Among the soil invertebrate macrofauna, centipede and millipede populations were significantly influenced by fallow type. The density of earthworms varied with both the type and length of fallow practice. Earthworm populations under maize grown in gliricidia fallows were significantly higher than those under fully fertilized monoculture maize. The population densities of other invertebrate orders and functional groups did not significantly differ between maize grown continuously in monoculture and in legume fallows. The highest maize grain yield (3.0–6.0 t ha−1) was recorded in fully fertilized monoculture. Maize grown in gliricidia and leucaena fallows consistently gave 2.0–4.0 t ha−1 throughout the study period, while maize grown without fertilizer yielded less than 2 t ha−1. These legumes produced 0.4–2.9 t ha−1 of re-sprout biomass annually, which released nutrients contributing to higher maize yields over a long period of time. It is concluded that these legume fallows can improve maize yields in addition to their positive impact on the diversity and functions of soil invertebrates. "

Richness, estimated by the number of taxa per sample, varied significantly with land use category and treatments within a land use category at both sites. The highest and lowest richness in invertebrate taxa was recorded under the miombo woodland and monoculture maize, respectively. The abundance of total macrofauna (all taxa combined) was highest under the miombo woodland and lowest under monoculture maize. Abundance of macrofauna under the various land use categories was also higher in December–February (rainy season) than in July (dry season). Millipedes and centipedes were present in 0–5% of the soil samples under monoculture maize at the two sites, and in 10–30% of the samples at any given time under the miombo woodland and agroforestry land use categories. Earthworms, beetles and ants were generally scarcer under monoculture maize compared to the agroforestry species. Maize grain yield was higher when grown with tree species such as gliricidia that produced good quality organic inputs and harboured more litter transformers than those with low quality inputs such as calliandra. It is concluded that improved fallows using these legumes have positive impacts on soil invertebrates. "

Traditional regression approaches incur problems in such a setting, because independent variables are highly autocorrelated and their number often greatly exceeds the number of observations. Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS), a statistical analysis tool developed to handle these situations and widely used in hyperspectral remote sensing, was tested for its usefulness for explaining the climate responses of biological processes, using walnut phenology in California as an example. Observations of first female bloom, first male bloom and leaf emergence of three walnut cultivars at Davis, \{CA\} were coupled with daily temperature data since 1951. The dataset was analyzed by PLS, using three temperature inputs: (1) daily mean temperatures, (2) 11-day running means of daily mean temperatures and (3) monthly mean temperatures. For all data constellations, the Variable-Importance-in-the-Projection (VIP) statistic indicated a number of periods, during which temperatures were important determinants of phenological events, and the model-coefficients-of-the-centered-and-scaled-data (MC) statistic showed the direction, in which high temperatures during these phases influenced walnut flowering and leaf emergence. In all analyses, a delaying effect of warm winters, and an advancing effect of warm springs were clearly visible. It was also possible to identify the transition between the chilling and forcing phases, and the \{VIP\} and \{MC\} plots indicated quantitative differences in the effectiveness of winter chill during different phases of the dormancy season. Such effects have not been captured in any phenology models currently applied to fruit trees, indicating that \{PLS\} has potential to help refine such models. \{PLS\} can also be used for guiding experimental research by pinpointing the parts of the season that are most important for the timing of budburst. Results suggested that more than 20 years of observed data were necessary for producing clearly recognizable temperature response patterns, limiting the applicability of \{PLS\} to long time series.

Applying this boundary-work framework, the manuscript examines the process of knowledge co-production and evaluates its effectiveness in supporting the negotiation process of four cases of payment for watershed services (PWS) in Indonesia. Our case studies reveal that local communities and policy-makers have a diverse range of knowledge regarding watershed functions and services. Recognizing this knowledge diversity, and combining it with scientific information, leads to (i) enlightenment, by engaging local stakeholders in more active roles for knowledge co-production thus setting realistic targets for ecosystem services’ interventions in the design of \{PWS\} schemes; (ii) decision-making support for stakeholders, by providing opportunities for collaborative learning; and (iii) effective negotiations, by providing salient and credible information. We recognize 10 different prototypes that lead to a better understanding of how payments can be channeled to enhance, or at least maintain, underlying hydrological functions. The case studies, in different landscape configurations and associated \{PWS\} prototype settings, show that knowledge interfacing and sharing towards co-producing collaborative products helps to clarify the performance-based indicators for effective \{PWS\} negotiation between potential sellers and buyers of ecosystem services.

Despite this, analyses have consisted of mainly non-parametric tests and log-normal least square regression (i.e. ANOVA). Failure to accommodate zero inflation in count data can result in biased estimation of ecological effects jeopardizing the integrity of the scientific inference. The objective of this study was to compare statistical models for the analysis of soil animal count data and suggest appropriate methods for estimating abundance. The log-normal regression model, linear mixed model (LMM), standard Poisson, Poisson with correction for overdispersion (PCO), negative binomial distribution (NBD), the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) models were compared using 12 count data sets of earthworms, millipedes, centipedes, beetles, ants and termites from soils under the miombo woodland and agroforestry systems in eastern Zambia. The \{NBD\} with covariates gave a better description of the data in nine out of 12 cases than did the standard Poisson, \{ZIP\} and ZINB. The \{ZIP\} and \{ZINB\} models with covariates gave the best description of earthworm counts from the miombo and millipede counts from agroforestry, respectively. In all cases, the \{ZIP\} model was better than the standard Poisson model. The \{ZINB\} was inferior to the \{NBD\} except for earthworm counts from the miombo and millipede counts in agroforestry. Significance tests based on the PCO, ZIP, \{NBD\} and \{ZINB\} were more conservative than those based on the standard Poisson model. The 95% confidence intervals computed using the PCO, ZIP, \{NBD\} and \{ZINB\} were also wider than those computed using least squares, \{LMM\} and assuming Poisson distribution. It is concluded that for the comparison among habitat types, land-use categories or treatments, the NBD, \{ZIP\} and \{ZINB\} perform better than the log-normal and Poisson models. Considering the excess-zero problem and significant deviation of soil animal counts from the assumptions of normality and homoscedcity, the log-normal regression model is inappropriate. Therefore, routine application of the log-normal regression model and non-parametric tests for analysis of soil animal count data with many zeros should be discouraged. "

We illustrate that the products and services flowing from the integration of trees within farming systems can contribute to food security, farmer livelihoods and environmental resilience. However, for agroforestry to be adopted it should not be constrained by policies which hinder the integration of trees, with crops and livestock. This policy scenario can best be met when the governance of food production at local to global scales is multi-sectoral and based on a ‘Systems Approach’. Nevertheless, the adoption of agroforestry has recently been greatly supported by the international agenda on the mitigation of climate change and to achieve sustainable food production. In conclusion we pose the hypothesis that “Agroforestry concepts and practices can form an effective, efficient and fair pathway towards the achievement of many Sustainable Development Goals”, and discuss the main messages and research questions emerging from the papers presented in this special issue.

Similarly, the attention given to land tenure and its perceived effects on productivity varies considerably in the policy literature.

Adequate winter chill is an important site characteristic for commercial orchard operations, and quantifying chill is crucial for orchard management. Climate change may impact winter chill. With a view to adapting orchards to climate change, this review assesses the state of knowledge in modelling winter chill and the performance of various modelling approaches. It then goes on to present assessments of past and projected future changes in winter chill for fruit growing regions and discusses potential adaptation strategies. Some of the most common approaches to modelling chill, in particular the Chilling Hours approach, are very sensitive to temperature increases, and have also been found to perform poorly, especially in warm growing regions. The Dynamic Model offers a more complex but also more accurate alternative, and use of this model is recommended. Chill changes projected with the Dynamic Model are typically much less severe than those estimated with other models. Nevertheless, projections of future chill consistently indicate substantial losses for the warmest growing regions, while temperate regions will experience relatively little change, and cold regions may even see chill increases. Growers can adapt to lower chill by introducing low-chill cultivars, by influencing orchard microclimates and by applying rest-breaking chemicals. Given substantial knowledge gaps in tree dormancy, accurate models are still a long way off. Since timely adaptation is essential for growers of long-lived high-value perennials, alternative ways of adaptation planning are needed. Climate analogues, which are present-day manifestations of future projected climates, can be used for identifying and testing future-adapted species and cultivars. Horticultural researchers and practitioners should work towards the development and widespread adoption of better chill accumulation and dormancy models, for facilitating quantitatively appropriate adaptation planning.

An aerial photo interpretation and fragmentation analysis of the years 1961, 1982 and 2000 was conducted covering approximately the Kirua Vunjo Division, a transect of 152 km2 from the forest reserve edge to the plains. Earlier changes were traced from literature review. The results show the expansion of cultivation to more marginal land down the slope, the disappearance and extreme fragmentation of bush land and appearance and expansion of settlements. The home garden area has experienced some specific internal change, but has not expanded down the slope. In the 1960s there were small open fields and patches of grazing lands amongst home gardens. In the 1980s the area was more uniformly covered by homegardens. Since then it has become patchy again as new homesteads have been built on subdivided farms and more food is produced on the higher slopes. Population pressure and the ensuing expansion of agriculture to more marginal land, intensification of the homegarden system, together with climate changes affecting the water supplies, have caused changes in farmers’ livelihoods. As land scarcity now hinders expansion of agriculture, farm size has seriously decreased, common resources have become scarce, and prices of coffee in the world market remain low, farmers are trying to intensify and diversify their farm production. Local initiative is leading to change, but the locally conceived alternatives are too few and lack integrated approaches of technical agricultural research, economic analysis, and policy studies and reforms. Non-agricultural activities and paid employment are becoming increasingly important. However, due to considerable entry barriers to remunerable off-farm jobs, not all households enjoy equal access to attractive non-farm opportunities. The future welfare of the area will depend on increasing the marketable knowledge and skills of the population that will enable it to become integrated in the economy of the region and the country.

The main challenges to implementation of the current A/R \{CDM\} mechanisms are in (1) the definition of forest and its institutional implications, (2) the projectization that is embedded in the definition of CDM, (3) non-linear baselines related to forest transitions that complicate attribution, (4) inherent lack of synergy with other development activities and (5) high transaction costs and temporary nature of credits. In possible new international regimes that aim to include all relevant changes in land-use based emissions, a more outcome-based programmatic approach may partially replace the project cycle assessments of CDM. However, there will still be a need to assess the combination of factors and policies that can be expected to enhance terrestrial carbon storage through voluntary land-use decisions, by a combination of reduced emissions and enhanced storage. Tradeoffs usually exist between local livelihoods and carbon storage, but assessment of the opportunity costs of C sequestration requires analysis at the landscape and community scale at scenario level, including local adjustment and optimization. We explored such scenarios for a number of cases in Indonesia that range from a forest margin to a degraded lands setting. \{FALLOW\} model applications were set up for 4 landscapes in Indonesia (15–98% forest cover, 1–55% grassland, 17–51 persons km−2) to test the internal consistency of the hypothesis that farmer-led development of tree-based land-use systems in response to accessible markets, legal tenure arrangements, availability of reliable technical information and local investment can convert degraded forest lands at low public cost and form an attractive alternative to project-based interventions with detailed prescriptions and planning. The calculated (non-linear) baselines for carbon stocks varied from an average trend of −0.26 to +0.23 Mg C ha−1 year−1 over a 25 year period of assessment, equivalent to a net sequestration of −0.95 to 0.84 t \{CO2\} ha−1 year−1 The highest value for predicted additional carbon storage in the wider landscape did not coincide with the best results for local livelihoods, but in each of the case studies the results for a ‘programmatic’ removal of constraints to profitable smallholder tree-based production systems was more attractive than a ‘prescribed’ tree planting in designated project areas. These results support the design of international modalities for an outcome-based approach to enhancing carbon storage with local flexibility in implementation. "

Incubation reference values were calibrated to first derivative reflectance spectra using partial least-squares regression. Prediction accuracy was assessed by comparing laboratory reference values with \{NIRS\} values predicted using full hold-out-one cross-validation. Cross-validated prediction for C respired (500 days) in soil aggregate fractions had an \{R2\} of 0.82 while that of C mineralized (300 days) in organic matter fractions was 0.71. Major soil aggregate fractions could be perfectly spectrally discriminated using a 50% random holdout validation sample. \{NIRS\} is a promising technique for rapid characterization of potential C mineralization in soils and aggregate fractions. Further work should test the robustness of \{NIRS\} prediction of mineralization rates of aggregate fractions across a wide range of soils and spectral mixture models for predicting mass fractions of aggregate size classes.

abstract = "Reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD+) is widely accepted as a land use policy objective for mitigating climate change, but the ways through which REDD+ can provide incentives to simultaneously conserve forest and reduce poverty remain uncertain. The experiences of integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs) have shaped initial pilots of landscape level REDD+ action. Yet, little thought has been given to the design challenges that need to be overcome in multi-scale REDD+ programs, where local shifts of behavior need to be connected to international finance and investment. This paper highlights and discusses emerging design challenges for REDD+ at multiple levels in two distinct circumstances. First, for sub-national REDD+ design where \{ICDP\} approaches are employed as a platform for demonstration and project design and implementation. In this case, issues of scale, nesting and leakage are prominent. Secondly, \{ICDP\} is used as a strategy for implementation of REDD+ at multiple levels. In the second case, the challenges are about choices or optimal mixes between multiple policies and instruments such as “sparing” and “sharing” for addressing drivers of deforestation and payments, rewards and/or co-investments in the achievement of multiple co-benefits of emission reductions. The paper also explores how combinations of incentive paradigms can be used at the local, sub-national and national scale within a nested approach to REDD+ as derived from distinguishing features of REDD+ such as performance measurements, financial modalities and carbon as a commodity that have not hitherto been part of ICDPs. We posit that a nested land-based Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) approach could overcome design issues with REDD+ frameworks that use additional co-investment for achieving biodiversity goals on a modified \{ICDP\} platform.

Drawing on experiences in Africa, we identify the major challenges and opportunities for developing and rolling out biocarbon projects in agroforestry systems. We highlight the need for external, up-front funding to overcome high project establishment costs and the need for innovative solutions to minimize trade-offs between livelihood and environmental goals. We contend that resource constraints, flexibility, technical capacity, tenure and institutional frameworks must be addressed for smallholders to invest in and benefit from carbon projects.

A higher order sustainability concept considers the ability of farms to adapt and learn from early signs of threats. A number of response paths based on policies, incentives and information supply have been developed to support learning and adjustments.

Women, due to their increasingly productive roles, could become agents of either land degradation or restoration.

The findings illustrate how socio-economic differentiation is embedded in the historical political economy of allocation, alienation and dispossession of land and forest, which are key endowments that distinguish people in the study area. Rather than reducing it, \{CBFM\} increases vulnerability of disadvantaged groups, through two mechanisms: i) taxing access to livelihood-enhancing forest products by the state agency, and ii) elite capture of local level institutions which serve to mediate forest access. Vulnerability can be addressed by reducing revenue extracted for forest activities such as firewood collection and grazing, ensuring democratic representation in local level forest institutions, and reducing structural inequalities in access to land and forest.

In this study, genotype–environment interaction and phenotypic stability of 14 accessions were investigated for dry matter (DM) leaf biomass yield across five diverse sites in the tropics (Indonesia and Nigeria) and subtropics (Australia, Malawi and Zambia) using nonparametric methods. Results indicated that genotype–environment interaction is present and that some accessions were unstable across these diverse environments implying that blanket recommendation for germplasm deployment may not be efficient. The most unstable accessions for leaf biomass production in this study include the widely used Retalhuleu provenance, which although highly productive, appeared to be better suited to tropical wetter environments. The Belen Rivas and Monterrico provenances were found to combine high phenotypic stability and high \{DM\} leaf biomass yield across these diverse sites. Germplasm of these seed sources may be deployed in previously untested sites with perhaps, predictable \{DM\} leaf yields. Where further breeding and selection is envisaged, the results of this study could also be used to make selections and constitute breeding populations for either specific environments (Retalhuleu) or for diverse environments (Belen Rivas and Monterrico).

On a Ferralsol in sub-humid western Kenya maize (Zea mays L.) growth was primarily limited by phosphorus availability. We observed that maize growth near grevillea (Grevillea robusta A. Cunn.) tree lines was strongly reduced, while maize growth was slightly increased near cassia (Cassia spectabilis \{DC\} (syn. Senna spectabilis, DC, H.S. Irwin and R.C. Barneby). This was contrary to expectations because grevillea has a relatively low nutrient demand while Cassia has a relatively high nutrient demand. We compared maize growth in an experiment with simulations using the mechanistic tree–crop interaction model WaNuLCAS. The model simulations showed that the measured 30–40% decrease in maize growth near the Grevillea tree line was due to 0.025 m3 m−3 lower soil water contents (at mean levels of 0.35 m3 m−3 and high pF). This was not due to direct water limitation. The lower soil water content caused decreased P diffusion to roots and a cumulative decrease in crop root-growth and a concomitant decrease in crop growth over time. Measured maize yield near Cassia was 115%, unaffected by trees. Model simulations predicted it should be reduced to 80% due to direct competition for P between tree and crop. This suggests that rhizosphere modifications measured near Cassia roots probably supplied P to the tree itself and also to the maize crop. On P-limiting tropical soils, it is important to prevent soil drying to avoid soil drying induced P deficiency. In these conditions tree species that are able to mobilize P can prevent competition with the crop and may even increase crop performance. "

This study evaluated the distribution of aboveground biomass (AGB) in three 100 km2 benchmark sites in Kasungu, Salima, and Neno districts in Malawi. In 67 sample plots covering 37 cultivated fields and 30 woodland plots, a total of 2481 trees were inventoried over 6 ha. Tree species documented were 56 in Kasungu, 35 in Salima and 33 in Neno. The corresponding values of the Shannon diversity index and its standard error (SE) were 3.45 (0.01) for Kasungu, 2.78 (0.01) for Salima and 2.73 (0.01) for Neno. The three most dominant species in terms of biomass were Faidherbia albida (47.8%), Piliostigma thonningii (11%), and Mangifera indica (9%), all found in cultivated fields. Large trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) &gt;40 cm formed only 3% of the total population inventoried in Salima, but held over 80% of the biomass. These high biomass trees were hardly found in Kasungu and Neno. Smaller trees (DBH &lt; 10 cm) dominated all the sites, representing 93% of all the trees measured. These stock 14, 1, and 67% of the biomass in Kasungu, Salima, and Neno, respectively.

Belowground biomass of the harvested trees accounted for about 20% of the total tree biomass; yielding an overall \{RS\} of 0.26, which varied across an altitudinal and precipitation gradient.

Two of the equations recommended for tropical species produced estimates that were about 35 and 21% lower. The equation with dbh as predictor is therefore reliable for estimating belowground biomass in agricultural landscapes while \{RS\} should be used with great care depending on soil and management conditions as shown by the great variability among the blocks evaluated.

In most cases, estimates of aboveground carbon stocks rely on allometric equations. Although generic and species-specific allometries have been developed for conventional areas such as forests, their use in agricultural landscapes is questionable as agricultural trees are typically managed and rarely mono-specific. Therefore, there is a need to develop a robust generic allometry that accounts for the heterogeneity of tree diversity throughout the landscape. Allometric equations were developed from empirical destructive sampling of 72 trees (diameter at breast height (dbh): 3–102 cm) from three 100 km2 benchmark sites in Western Kenya. Diameter at breast height alone provided reliable prediction for aboveground biomass (17 ± 0.02 Mg C ha−1) with &gt;95% accuracy. Published equations overestimated landscape biomass due to errors in either smaller trees (dbh &lt;10 cm) which dominate the landscape (66%) or the few larger trees (dbh &gt;40 cm) which constitute 3% of all the trees but hold most of the biomass (48%). The apparently small differences in the equations for small trees could add up to a large amount of carbon when looking at a landscape. This study recommends diameter as the basis for assessing tree biomass in Western Kenyan agricultural mosaics. The equations developed are a useful tool for assessing the potential for carbon sequestration in agricultural landscapes and represent key information for scaling biomass estimates for entire landscapes.

abstract = "Forest conversion to coffee-based agroforestry leads to sudden disappearance of the litter layer and a decrease in the rate of litter fall, reducing food for ecosystem engineers such as earthworms. With time, however, a new litter layer is created potentially returning to forest-like conditions at the soil surface. This research quantified litter thickness, earthworm populations and soil macroporosity in response to land use change in the Sumberjaya benchmark area (West Lampung, Indonesia) by comparing: (a) remnant forest (control); (b) multistrata shaded coffee with fruit and timber trees, as well as nitrogen-fixing shade trees; (c) shaded coffee (nitrogen-fixing shade trees, but less than five tree species per plot); and (d) sun coffee (‘monoculture’) with coffee forming more than 80% of total stem basal area. Plots were selected with tree ages of 7–10 years in three slope classes: (a) flat (0–10°); (b) medium (10–30°); and (c) steep (&gt;30°). The mean standing necromass was 6.1, 4.5, 3.8 and 3.0 Mg ha−1 for forest, multistrata, shade coffee and sun coffee, respectively, without significant influences of slope. Fine, partly decomposed litter was 33–40% of total necromass, coarse leaf litter 14–16%, and twigs and branches comprised the remaining 43–52%. Soil organic carbon content (Corg) was highest in the forest. The largest annual litter input was found in the remnant forest (14 Mg ha−1 year−1), followed by multistrata, shaded and monoculture coffee systems, i.e., 9.8, 6.6 and 4.0 Mg ha−1 year−1, respectively. The population density of earthworms in the forest was 50% lower than in multistrata coffee gardens (150 individuals m−2), but its biomass (31 g m−2) was twice that in the multistrata coffee gardens. The lowest population density of earthworms was found in the shade coffee system (150 individuals m−2) with a biomass of 7 g m−2. A simple model suggests that the standing litter in the various land use systems is consistent with measured litter inputs and decay rates, but that the soil organic matter (SOM) content and macroporosity of the shade and multistrata systems are less than predicted. The recovery of a surface litter layer in sun coffee systems can provide protection from erosion with time, but will not be sufficient to restore macroporosity at the level of forest soils, leading to hydrologic alterations that favor overland flow.

Some scientists have questioned the wisdom of its wider promotion without clear evidence of its impacts. This review provides novel analyses of the magnitude and spatial extent of its influence on soil properties and primary productivity. A meta-analysis provided evidence for significant increases in soil organic carbon (SOC) (by 46%), total nitrogen (50%), phosphorus (21%), potassium (32%), and yields of maize (150%) and sorghum (73%) under the tree canopy compared to the open area. However, larger increases in \{SOC\} and nutrients occurred on inherently nutrient-poor sites than on nutrient-rich sites. Similarly, large increases in crop yields occurred in suboptimal conditions for crop productivity than in optimal conditions. The tree created predictable patterns in soil nutrients and crop yields consistent with distance–decay models of spatial interaction. Its growth and canopy development appear to explain the size dependence of the spatial extent of its influence, with a marked influence observed under large trees than small trees. The review also identified enormous variability in study design and statistical rigor, which appear to mask the expected patterns. Study designs and inferential statistics in current use neither address the intrinsic causality of patterns nor do they offer a mechanistic insight into the observed patterns. The major concerns and their implications are discussed and improvements for future research on single-tree influences on ecosystem properties in dry lands are suggested. "

However, measuring, monitoring and verifying how much carbon trees in smallholder farms are removing from the atmosphere has remained a great challenge in developing nations. Devising a reliable way for measuring carbon associated with trees in agricultural landscapes is essential for helping smallholder farmers benefit from emerging carbon markets. This study aimed to develop biomass equations specific to dominant eucalyptus species found in agricultural landscapes in Western Kenya. Allometric relationships were developed by regressing diameter at breast height (DBH) alone or \{DBH\} in combination with height, wood density or crown area against the biomass of 48 trees destructively sampled from a 100 km2 site. \{DBH\} alone was a significant predictor variable and estimated aboveground biomass (AGB) with over 95% accuracy. The stems, branches and leaves formed up to 74, 22 and 4% of AGB, respectively, while belowground biomass (BGB) of the harvested trees accounted for 21% of the total tree biomass, yielding an overall root-to-shoot ratio (RS) of 0.27, which varied across tree size. Total tree biomass held in live Eucalyptus trees was estimated to be 24.4 ± 0.01 Mg ha−1, equivalent to 11.7 ± 0.01 Mg of carbon per hectare. The equations presented provide useful tools for estimating tree carbon stocks of Eucalyptus in agricultural landscapes for bio-energy and carbon accounting. These equations can be applied to Eucalyptus in most agricultural systems with similar agro-ecological settings where tree growth parameters would fall within ranges comparable to the sampled population.

This paper considers the design of community forestry contracts in the Sumber Jaya area of Indonesia where community forestry contracts are agreements between the Forestry Department and community groups that provide group members with time-bound leasehold rights to protection forests, on the condition that farmers abide by specified land-use restrictions and pay any required fees. Farmers perceive that the contracts represent a bundle of restrictions and inducements, some of which are explicitly stated in the contract and others that are implied by the contract. Conjoint analysis was used to quantify farmers' tradeoffs among the explicit and implicit attributes of the contracts. The results of logit and ordered logit models show that farmers are most concerned about the length of the contract, and relatively unconcerned about requirements on tree density and species composition. An implicit attribute, greater access to forestry and agroforestry extension, emerges as an important implicit attribute. The results imply that farmers in this part of Indonesia would be willing to abide by fairly strict limitations on land use, provided that they can be assured of long-term rights to the planted trees.

This can partly be achieved if quantitative and up-to-date information on soil health indicators are not available. This study used the land health surveillance framework, which combines ground-sampling schemes based on sentinel site and infrared spectroscopy to select a minimum dataset of soil health indicators to identify key land constraints for maize production and target potential interventions. We found high variability in soil properties in the study area which was mainly due to inherent soil conditions and land management practices. The most variable soil properties (CV &gt; 0.38) were nitrogen (N), electric conductivity (ECd), exchangeable bases (ExBas), boron (B), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn) and phosphorus (P). Moderate variability (0.2 &lt; \{CV\} &lt; 0.38) was observed for carbon (C), silt and sand, while properties with least variability (CV &lt; 0.2) were pH and aluminium (Al). The effects of land-use and soil depth were significant (p &lt; 0.05) for most of the soil properties. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified soil nutrient availability, metal concentration and texture as the three main factors that explain most of the variability observed. Significant interactions were observed between soil properties confirming the need for a minimum dataset of indicators. ExBas, B, pH, Mn, ECd, P and clay content formed the minimum dataset of soil health indicators for the study area. The results also showed that the soils of the study site are marginally suitable for the production of maize (Zea mays L.). Low limitations with respect to exchangeable bases (Ca, Mg, K and Na) and severe limitations with respect to B (&lt; 0.15 mg kg− 1), pH (&lt; 6.20), P (&lt; 6.5 mg kg− 1 soil) and clay content (&gt; 63%) were detected. However, potential for improvement exists through integrated soil management practices that include the use of organic and inorganic fertilizers, minimum soil tillage, and inclusion of legumes in crop rotations that could improve soil physical and chemical properties.

Pure stands of sesbania (Sesbania sesban), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), tephrosia (Tephrosia vogelii), 1:1 mixtures of sesbania + pigeon pea and sesbania + tephrosia, and a mixed vegetation fallow were compared with a continuously cropped monoculture maize receiving the recommended fertilizer rate, which was used as the control. The legume mixtures did not differ from the respective pure stands in leaf, litter and recycled biomass, soil Ca, Mg and K. Sesbania + pigeon pea mixtures consistently increased richness in soil macrofauna, and abundance of earthworms and millipedes compared with the maize monoculture (control). The nitrate-N, ammonium-N and total mineral N concentration of the till layer soil (upper 20 cm) of pure stands and mixed-species legume plots were comparable with the control plots. Sesbania + pigeon pea mixtures also gave higher maize grain yield compared with the pure stands of legume species and mixed vegetation fallows. It is concluded that maize-legume rotations increase soil macrofaunal richness and abundance compared with continuously cropped maize, and that further research is needed to better understand the interaction effect of macrofauna and mixtures of organic resources from legumes on soil microbial communities and nutrient fluxes in such agro-ecosystems.

In this paper we propose a novel approach extending occupancy–abundance relationships to zero-inflated count data. This approach involves three steps: (1) selecting distributional assumptions and parsimonious models for the count data, (2) estimating abundance, occupancy and variance parameters as functions of site- and/or time-specific covariates, and (3) modelling the occupancy–abundance relationship using the parameters estimated in step 2. Five count datasets were used for comparing standard Poisson and negative binomial distribution (NBD) occupancy–abundance models. Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) occupancy–abundance models were introduced for the first time, and these were compared with the Poisson, NBD, He and Gaston's and Wilson and Room's abundance–variance–occupancy models. The percentage of zero counts ranged from 45 to 80% in the datasets analysed. For most of the datasets, the \{ZINB\} occupancy–abundance model performed better than the traditional Poisson, \{NBD\} and Wilson and Room's model. He and Gaston's model performed better than the \{ZINB\} in two out of the five datasets. However, the occupancy predicted by all models increased faster than the observed as density increased resulting in significant mismatch at the highest densities. Limitations of the various models are discussed, and the need for careful choice of count distributions and predictors in estimating abundance and occupancy parameter are indicated. "

abstract = "Abstract The ‘parklands’ that form the most widespread farming systems in the Sahelian zone of West Africa are farming systems in which annual crops are grown under scattered trees preserved from the natural vegetation by farmers following clearing the woodlands to make crop fields. Being mixed agricultural systems, the interactions between trees and crops have always been a key element determining the management options applied by farmers. This has also attracted the attention of scientists, with the first studies of this nature dating back to the 1960’s. A combination of field trials, observational studies and modeling has been deployed to understand soil–tree–crop interactions, including sharing of growth resources by the system components. Based on this understanding, management options have been discussed with farmers. The most common experimental designs used are transects from the base of tree trunk toward the open field, concentric zones around trees or sectors under trees where various experimental treatments are applied, depending on the objectives of the studies. Key findings disentangled the contributions of each component of the system to the island of high fertility around trees using isotopic techniques, tree effects on adjacent \{C4\} cultivated plants and alternative \{C3\} crops that tolerate tree shade. Tree management practices such as pruning have been tested to modify the crown architecture and the patterns of root distribution in order to improve light availability and resource use efficiency. Increases in land use intensity require more active management by farmers of tree regeneration. Despite scientific advances, there are still some methodological challenges in determining the “park effect”, the tradeoffs and synergies between and among goods and services, and how to boost the provisioning, supporting and regulating functions of such agroforestry systems. Providing such ecosystem service functions is critical in the quest for ensuring food security while achieving adaptation and mitigation goals in vulnerable environments like the drylands. "

Despite the existence of natural populations in eastern Zambia, considerable seed originating from Kenya has been introduced to the area, while further introductions from Malawi are planned. Large-scale anthropogenic seed dispersal raises concerns regarding genetic management, which were addressed here by random amplified polymorphic \{DNA\} (RAPD) analysis. Eleven populations of Sesbania from southern and East Africa were assessed, including S. sesban populations already or likely to be introduced into eastern Zambia and reference taxa. Seventeen primers revealed a very large number of polymorphisms (538) in surveyed material. Differentiation among S. sesban populations was unusually high for a woody perennial (70% of variation among populations), with all individuals stringently assigned to specific populations in cluster analysis, even for geographically proximate sites. High differentiation, combined with the unusually large number of polymorphisms determined, resulted in the identification of a number of population-diagnostic markers. High differentiation may reflect the restricted ecology of S. sesban, human disturbance and frequent natural fluctuations in niche availability. Hydrochory, posited as a mechanism for gene flow between populations located along the same drainage system, appears to be discounted. Geographic proximity was not always a good guide for genetic similarity among S. sesban populations. In particular, rather proximate populations from Zambia and Malawi appeared highly differentiated genetically, while Zambian populations were relatively similar to a geographically distant population from Namibia. Differentiation was consistent with the presence of two botanic varieties in the southern Africa region, vars. nubica and zambesiaca. Estimates of Nei's genetic diversity suggested that S. sesban populations from East Africa were most diverse. Overall, population diversity estimates were low, possibly due in part to frequent bottlenecks, short longevity and a short juvenile phase. The unusually large number of polymorphisms detected here provided an opportunity to test for data redundancy and primer selection methodologies during \{RAPD\} analysis. Combined data from a subset of eight primers selected according to three different approaches provided a very good overall fit to the complete data set (rM &gt; 0.95). Different primer selection approaches influenced the reliability of clustering and diversity analysis, with a minimum of eight primers required for reliable ranking of diversity estimates. The implications of our data for conservation, cultivation and monitoring of S. sesban in the southern Africa region are discussed. Caution is advised during the introduction of germplasm into eastern Zambia from both distant (Kenya) and relatively proximate (Malawi) sources. "

Trees are typically harvested at 6–10 years of age, but demand for wood is forcing farmers and loggers to harvest trees at increasingly younger ages. Previous research in farming communities led to the recommendation that local seed sources should be used for agroforestry plantations. Therefore, a provenance/progeny test of G. crinita was established in farming communities to determine if there was significant genetic variation within a representative watershed. The test includes 7 provenances and 200 families from the Aguaytía watershed, and is replicated in three planting zones (upper, middle and lower elevations) in the same watershed. Tree height and stem diameter were analyzed at 12 months across and within planting zones. In the analysis across planting zones, there was significant variation in height and diameter due to provenances, but in height only due to families within provenances. Means for provenances and families were relatively stable across zones, suggesting that the best provenance and families within that provenance could be used for agroforestry projects throughout the watershed. Variation due to provenances and families within provenances was most significant in the upper planting zone where trees grew most rapidly. Heritability of height and diameter was relatively low across zones, but again was notably higher in the planting zone where trees grew most rapidly. Results suggest that there is potential to improve yield of G. crinita by selecting faster-growing provenances and families within watersheds. However, selection would not be very efficient at 12 months since heritability was quite low at this stage of development (0–0.14 depending on planting zone). Heritability of growth traits, genetic correlations between growth and wood traits, and variation in mortality should be evaluated for at least 3 more years before deciding on the tree improvement strategy. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate significant variation due to provenances and families within a single small watershed in the Amazon. Results suggest that watershed-scale genetic studies should be conducted for other tropical hardwood species that are of interest to local communities. "

This paper investigates the impacts of rattan harvesting on tree and understorey vegetation structure, species richness and diversity. Tree and understorey vegetation characteristics and soil and topographic variables were recorded in forest plots. Interviews with rattan harvesters recorded information on harvesting techniques and locations. The relationships between tree and understorey vegetation characteristics and soils, topography and rattan harvesting techniques were assessed with the multivariate ordination technique of Redundancy Analysis (RDA). Analysis of the relationships with rattan harvesting proximity and forest designation zone used Multivariate Analyses of Covariance (MANCOVA). Tree species richness and diversity are primarily affected by slope gradient and altitude, while tree size is affected mainly by soil chemical factors. Only a small part of the variation in tree structure measures can be attributed to the impacts of rattan cane harvesting. Stronger adverse effects on understorey vegetation density, including tree saplings and seedlings, were found. This is thought to be a case of rattan harvesting exacerbating the effects of competition between rattan plants and other understorey vegetation. Longer term monitoring of forest characteristics could provide stronger understanding of the impacts. However, rattan harvesting appears to have little effect on forest structure and diversity in Lambusango Forest, suggesting that relatively small scale \{NTFP\} extraction does not necessarily conflict with forest conservation.

The practice most often focused on is deforestation through slash-and-burn cultivation (tavy), and shifting cultivators are often portrayed as being ignorant, poverty-stricken peasants felling trees for fields and food. However, there is uncertainty whether soil degradation is related to recent tavy or earlier forest clearance, and whether some highland areas were ever forested. In this paper we use stable isotopes (δ13C) and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) to study the impacts of deforestation and various other land use changes on ecosystem properties, soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics and soil quality (fertility) in the highlands of Madagascar. Land cover transitions (between \{C3\} and \{C4\} systems) are defined and quantified in the study area. Historical land use had greater effect on soil organic carbon concentrations than current land use, with cultivated areas previously under \{C3\} and \{C4\} systems having 37.3 and 14.8 g \{SOC\} kg− 1, respectively. Grasslands previously under \{C3\} had approximately 124% more \{SOC\} than grasslands previously under C4, while \{SOC\} concentrations were 65.3 and 54.9 g C kg− 1 under natural forest and in mixed fallow systems, respectively. A soil fertility index developed for the study area based on diagnostic soil spectra was compared with findings related to \{SOC\} dynamics and land use change. "

This study tested the potential of Vis-NIR soil spectral libraries for predicting and mapping soil properties in the eastern highlands of Madagascar. Stable calibration models were developed for several key soil properties. Cross-validated r2 values were soil organic carbon (SOC), 0.94; total nitrogen (TN), 0.96; and cation exchange capacity (CEC), 0.80. A spectral soil fertility index (SFI) was developed based on ten commonly used agronomic indicators of soil fertility. \{SFI\} varied significantly with current and historic land use. The index was successfully calibrated to both soil reflectance measured in the laboratory (p = 0.003) and Landsat \{TM\} reflectance (p = 0.003), which permitted mapping of the index. "

In land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities through afforestation and reforestation projects, known as A/R CDM, the deliverables that demonstrate sustainable development remain unclear. While the methods to convincingly demonstrate carbon benefits are fine-tuned, there is growing concern on a lack of socio-economic benefits of the projects. With the criteria for sustainable development left with the national approval process, \{CDM\} projects in a medium-income country with transparent criteria may be more supportive to the socio-economic targets of \{CDM\} than in a low-income country without further specifications. At national scale, priority areas can be identified on the basis of publicly available data on land cover and the human development index (HDI). In a case study for Indonesia we found that population density between a lower and upper limit, and risks of fire incidence are socio-economic indicators which could further guide choices within the domain of technically eligible lands (without forest cover in 1990). Within the 302 districts across Indonesia covering a land area of around 193 million ha, the eligibility criteria based on the Marrakesh Accord (later called “hard” criteria) identified 47 million ha of land. With additional (later called “soft”) criteria of a population density between 10 and 100 persons km−2 and a below-average HDI, 17.3 million ha of eligible lands distributed over 53 districts were prioritized. Differences in fire risk lead to a further stratification of clusters of similarity within this priority domain, with \{CDM\} possible at high as well as low fire risk, but requiring different types of project. By grouping districts in clusters of overall similarity of land cover, three main clusters with 7.9, 0.7 and 3.7 Mha of prioritized eligible lands were identified where pilot activities for \{CDM\} may be implemented with higher probability of development benefits and extrapolation potential.

Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), which employed 39 \{RAPD\} markers, indicated that a significantly greater proportion of total country variation partitioned among eight stands in Kenya than among nine stands in Cameroon (values of 55% and 24%, respectively), with important implications for conservation strategies. Kenyan stands appear to represent a particularly diverse resource for conservation, evaluation and domestication, although possible human movement of germplasm during cultivation raises integrity concerns. Data also shed light on the evolutionary history of P. africana stands. A genetic disjunction between western and central Kenyan populations was observed, with individuals from western Kenya more similar to geographically distant stands from Cameroon (&gt; 2000 km) than to central Kenya (&lt; 400 km). In the context of present-day floristic distributions and the historical data available, this disjunction appears more consistent with genetic exchange between east and west African highlands via migration (associated with climate change) than via long distance seed dispersal. Data suggested that conservation strategies for P. africana should place relatively more emphasis than currently on the status of surrounding phytochoria. "

Apart from providing financial incentives, the state has also promoted local autonomy and participation in the program. This promotion represents a big shift in forest policy that grants more power to local communities and increases the involvement of local governance in decision-making. Whether the \{SLCP\} has been effectively implemented, the extent of its ecological and socioeconomic outcomes and how its performance can be improved are still unclear in the absence of adequate biophysical and socioeconomic data. To gain a holistic understanding of the SLCP's implementation and impacts, this research examines the interplay between the governance of the policy's implementation and local variations leading to the various ecological and socioeconomic outcomes observed, based on a comparative case study in two communities. It provides a novel explanation for why the SLCP, generally implemented via a top-down approach, produces better positive outcomes in one place than in the other, and argues for the significance of local institutions in shaping the policy's outcomes. This paper recommends institutional reform across the country's socio-ecological system, with the national policy-maker considering local dynamics in policy formulation and implementation and developing mechanisms of accountability and local institutions.

This results in an ‘ecological footprint’ of food: negative environmental impacts per capita. The footprint depends on the dietary choice of types and amounts of food, on the non-consumed part of product flows and its fate (‘waste’ or ‘reused’), on transport and processing along the value chain, on the environmental impacts of production per unit area, and on the area needed per unit product. Yield gaps indicate inefficiency in this last aspect: resource-use efficiency gaps for water and nutrients indicate that environmental impacts per unit area are higher than desirable. Ecological intensification aimed at simultaneously closing these two gaps requires process-level understanding and system-level quantification of current efficiency of the use of land and other production factors at multiple scales (field, farm, landscape, regional and global economy). Contrary to common opinion, yield and efficiency gaps are partially independent in the empirical evidence. Synergy in gap closure is possible in many contexts where efforts are made but are not automatic. With Good Agricultural Practice (GAP), enforceable in world trade to control hidden subsidies, there is scope for incremental improvement towards food systems that are efficient at global, yet sustainable at local, scales.

Less often, however, have scholars examined the necessary corollary of such initiatives; that is, both new and enhanced law enforcement initiatives to combat the global trade in illegal forest products and secure property rights to conserved forests. Drawing upon recent consultative experiences for relevant multinational agencies in East Africa, we critically analyze the emergent features of this additional ‘dark side’ of REDD+, highlighting in particular both its potential for ‘leakage’ effects on adjacent jurisdictions and deleterious implications for forest-dependent communities. Specifically, we highlight the ways in which such activities threaten to conflate illegal with informal trade in forest products; the ways in which they are potentially ill-suited for addressing the trade in charcoal as opposed to the trade in timber; and the incentives that they may provide for states to further marginalize indigenous forest-dwelling populations in the region. In doing so, we argue that this nascent synthesis of REDD+ and transnational law enforcement threatens to contribute significantly and regressively to the broader securitization of conservation in Sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere.

Although deforestation is severe in the Ethiopian highlands, some remnants of dry afromontane forests still exist. However, the resilience of these forests under climate change scenarios is unknown. Therefore, we studied (1) the extent and spatial patterns of standing dead stems along an elevational gradient and (2) the effects of dieback on forest carbon sequestration potential and aboveground carbon stocks, in Juniperus procera and Olea europaea dominated dry afromontane forest in northern Ethiopia, using allometric models combined with tree ring analysis. Juniperus procera and Olea europaea constitute 67% of the total tree population. Tree dieback affected a quarter of the total population. This loss is critical because 92.2% of snags belong to J. procera and O. europaea, which are the foundation species of the study forest. The total estimated mean aboveground C-stock was 19.3 (±3.9) Mg C ha−1. Of this estimate, snags contributed 34.5% of total C-stock. The estimated annual C-sequestration potential of the study forest was 0.33 (±0.03) Mg C ha−1 year−1, which is 27% less when compared to the pre-tree dieback C-sequestration potential. We found a decreasing trend in tree dieback with increasing elevation, which implies that the aboveground C-stocks and climate change mitigation potentials of the forest, was highly affected at lower elevations which is the drier part of the landscape. Tree ring analysis showed that trees reach medium-sized stem diameter (i.e., 20–25 cm) after no less than 100 years, indicating that the effect of forest dieback on C-sequestration potential and ecosystem function is long-lasting. Our results provide information on the magnitude of tree dieback and its long-lasting impact on forest carbon fluxes and forest ecosystem services. Evidently, the results substantiate the importance of protecting such forest to maintain the quality of the environment and to reduce efforts and cost for forest restoration after major loss. Finally, the information gained by this study provides baseline information for comparison of future carbon sequestration estimates. "

It provides a range of essential products (wood, fuel, food, fodder and medicines) and services (soil fertility improvement), and is one of many native tree species maintained in the traditional agroforesty system, known as the parkland. However, this and other valuable species are disappearing in many parts of the region due to over-exploitation and, perhaps, due to increasingly drier conditions in the region. A provenance/progeny test (275 families from 28 provenances in Burkina Faso and Niger) was established at one location in Niger to investigate geographic variation in the species. Mean annual rainfall decreases from south to north and from west to east in the seed collection area. Given these gradients, one would expect clinal variation in growth and survival of P. africana and other tree species that occur naturally in the region. Tree growth (height, number of primary branches, stem diameter at 20 cm and 1.3 m) and survival were analyzed at 11 years. Variation due to provenances was significant for growth variables and almost significant for survival. Variation due to families within provenances was not significant for any variable. Provenance means for growth and survival increased from the more humid to the drier parts of the sample region. The clines in growth and survival with regional rainfall patterns suggest that tree improvement and conservation programs should collect seeds from populations in the drier zones for planting and conservation in the West African Sahel. This may be particularly important when one considers the trend in global warming. "

Information on patterns of genetic variation is useful in informing both reforestation and genetic conservation activities. However, to date, no such information is available in Peru or elsewhere in South America. In the present study, genetic diversity between and within nine Peruvian populations of the species, based on amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers, is reported. Overall diversity level was high (Ht = 0.22), as expected for a widespread, long-lived tropical species, and consistent with previous studies carried out in Central America. Levels of intrapopulation diversity were higher than those previously reported for the species (Hs = 0.13–0.21). Analysis of molecular variation revealed genetic differences between two population groups located on different rivers and between populations located on the same rivers. Differences between groups were greater than those within groups. Genetic and geographical distances were significantly correlated. The relatively strong genetic differences between populations may be related to the riparian, essentially one-dimensional spatial distribution pattern of the populations studied. No difference was found in percentage of polymorphic loci between relatively undisturbed and logged populations. The existence of appreciable genetic differentiation over a relatively small part of the species range in the Peruvian Amazon suggests the need for caution in use of seed outside its zone of origin. For genetic conservation purposes, it would probably be prudent to sample (ex situ) or conserve (in situ) populations in each of the major watersheds of the Peruvian Amazon. "

Simpukng is managed secondary forests in which selected species of fruits, rattan, bamboo, timber and other plants are planted. While most are owned by families and passed down from one generation to the next, some are managed on a communal basis. Complex customary Dayak rules exist that control the use and inheritance of these forests that help to avoid over-exploitation of resources. There is clear gender division of labour among Dayak in the management of simpukng that provide a range of products – for household consumption and sale and for customary rituals – fruits, vegetables, medicines, fire wood, honey, rattan, bamboos, and timber. Local knowledge about the more highly valued species are discussed. These indigenous forest garden systems are currently under threat from large-scale mining and logging activities; conflicts between local and external agencies are unfortunately frequent. This paper examines the development and management of simpukng in four Dayak villages in East Kalimantan and their implications on sustainable management of natural resources, with particular emphasis on the role of local knowledge of some of the more highly valued species and the current challenges faced by these communities in maintaining their traditional agroforest management practices.

Little information is however available on regional genetic variation in these species, knowledge essential for their proper use and conservation. Here, we begin to address this gap by assessing \{RAPD\} and chloroplast variation in Sclerocarya birrea, a fruit tree that has been important to humans in the region for millennia. A strong overall positive correlation between genetic (RAPD) and geographic distances was observed for 12 populations of S. birrea subsp. caffra sampled from seven countries (standardised Mantel statistic, rM = 0.857, P &lt; 0.001), supporting a ‘structuring-by-distance’ model in devising genetic management strategies. Cluster analysis indicated, however, that genetic distances between geographically proximate stands were high on occasions, suggesting that inclusion of multiple stands nationally can sometimes be useful in rangewide management. Overall, an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that 19% of \{RAPD\} (assumed nuclear) variation partitioned among S. birrea subsp. caffra stands. Consistent with other nuclear–organellar comparisons for tree species, a much greater proportion of chloroplast variation (70%) partitioned among stands, suggesting a rather limited role for seed compared to pollen in mediating gene flow. Further analysis of S. birrea involved additional sampling from Tanzania of two other recognised subspecies (subsp. birrea and subsp. multifoliolata) that are not otherwise found in the southern Africa region. \{AMOVA\} indicated that more \{RAPD\} (29%) and chloroplast (75%) variation partitioned among relatively proximate subspecies stands (4 populations, 1 subsp. caffra, 2 subsp. birrea and 1 subsp. multifoliolata) in Tanzania than among subsp. caffra stands sampled extensively across southern Africa, suggesting Tanzania should be a focus for genetic management activities.

Effects on soil carbon stock (soil Cstock) of land use change trajectories from forest and non-forest to oil palm on mineral soils include initial decline and subsequent recovery, however modeling efforts and life-cycle accounting are constrained by lack of comprehensive data sets; only few case studies underpin current debate. We analyzed soil Cstock (Mg ha−1), soil bulk density (BD, g cm−3) and soil organic carbon concentration (Corg, %) from 155 plots in 20 oil palm plantations across the major production areas of Indonesia, identifying trends during a production cycle on 6 plantations with sufficient spread in plot age. Plots were sampled in four management zones: weeded circle (WC), interrow (IR), frond stacks (FS), and harvest paths (HP); three depth intervals 0–5, 5–15 and 15–30 cm were sampled in each zone. Compared to the initial condition, increases in Corg (16.2%) and reduction in \{BD\} (8.9%) in the \{FS\} zone, was compensated by decrease in Corg (21.4%) and increase in \{BD\} (6.6%) in the \{HP\} zone, with intermediate results elsewhere. For a weighted average of the four management zones and after correction for equal mineral soil basis, the net temporal trend in soil Cstock in the top 30 cm of soil across all data was not significantly different from zero in both forest- and non-forest-derived oil palm plantations. Individual plantations experienced net decline, net increase or U-shaped trajectories. The 2% difference in mean soil Cstock in forest and non-forest derived oil palm plantations was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). Unless soil management changes strongly from current practice, it is appropriate for C footprint calculations to assume soil Cstock neutrality on mineral soils used for oil palm cultivation. "

Despite the wide recognition of the importance of these services, drivers of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics across various land uses in East Africa are poorly understood. The objectives of this study were threefold: to quantify \{SOC\} stocks across Tanzania; assess the effect of land cover and erosion on SOC; and investigate the relationship between inherent and dynamic soil properties under diverse land uses. The Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF) was used to assess the variability of ecological metrics at different spatial scales. \{SOC\} was quantified within and between different land cover types (forest, woodland, shrubland, grassland and cropland) in Tanzania. A total of 2052 soil samples from 1082–1000 m2 plots were collected from seven 100-km2 sentinel sites in 2010. Composite soil samples were collected at each plot from two depths (0–20 and 20–50 cm) and cumulative soil mass samples were collected to 100 cm. Soil samples were analyzed using a combination of traditional analytical laboratory methods and mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR). Model performance of \{MIR\} spectral predictions for carbon was good, with an \{R2\} of &gt; 0.95 and \{RMSEP\} of 4.3 g kg− 1, when using an independent validation datasets. Woodland and cropland were the most frequently occurring vegetation structure types in the sampled sites, with 388 and 246 plots, respectively. Average topsoil \{OC\} (and range) was 12.4 (1.5–81.4) g C kg− 1 (n = 1082) and average subsoil \{OC\} (and range) was 7.3 (0.64–53.8) g C kg− 1 (n = 970) for the seven sites. Forested plots had the highest mean topsoil organic carbon concentrations (17.3 g C kg− 1) followed by cropland (13.3 g C kg− 1), for all sites included in the study, but with high levels of variability between sites. Soil mass at 30 cm was measured and these data were used to calculate carbon stocks for the different land cover types. An approach based on remote sensing was explored for the mapping of \{SOC\} stocks at 30 cm for Tanzania using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery from 2012. Results indicate that the use of image reflectance for the mapping of \{SOC\} stocks has promising potential, with \{R2\} values ranging from 0.77 to 0.81 and \{RMSEP\} values from 0.90 to 1.03 kg m− 2 for the three validation datasets. There is high utility of these maps for strategic land management interventions that prioritize ecosystem services. "

The framework uses hybrid and dynamic \{BNs\} containing both discrete and continuous variables over multiple time stages. The \{BN\} framework calculates costs and benefits based on multiple causal factors including the effects of individual risk factors, budget deficits, and time value discounting, taking account of the parameter uncertainty of all continuous variables. The framework can serve as the basis for various project management assessments and is illustrated using a case study of an agricultural development project. "

The proposed four methods include (a) cosine angle spectral matching; (b) hit quality index spectral matching; (c) self-organizing maps and (d) archetypal analysis methods. Then evaluate prediction accuracies for global and subspaces calibration models. These methods were tested on a mid-infrared spectral library containing 1907 soil samples collected from 19 different countries under the Africa Soil Information Service project. Calibration models for pH, Mehlich-3 Ca, Mehlich-3 Al, total carbon and clay soil properties were developed for the whole library and for the subspace. Root mean square error of prediction was used to evaluate predictive performance of subspace and global models. The root mean square error of prediction was computed using a one-third-holdout validation set. Effect of pretreating spectra with different methods was tested for 1st and 2nd derivative Savitzky–Golay algorithm, multiplicative scatter correction, standard normal variate and standard normal variate followed by detrending methods. In summary, the results show that global models outperformed the subspace models. We, therefore, conclude that global models are more accurate than the local models except in few cases. For instance, sand and clay root mean square error values from local models from archetypal analysis method were 50% poorer than the global models except for subspace models obtained using multiplicative scatter corrected spectra with which were 12% better. However, the subspace approach provides novel methods for discovering data pattern that may exist in large spectral libraries. "

abstract = "Many external effects of land use change are based on modifications of lateral flows of soil, water, air, fire or organisms. Lateral flows can be intercepted by filters and thus the severity and spatial range of external effects of land use change is under the influence of filter effects. Wherever lateral flows are involved, research results cannot be simply scaled on an area basis, and overall impact does not follow simple linear causal relationships. This complexity has consequences for relationships amongst the primary agents who initiate or exacerbate external effects, other stakeholders who are affected by them and policymakers who attempt to mitigate problems that reach sufficient visibility in society. In this paper we review how the relative importance of lateral flows and filter effects differs among a number of externalities, and the implications this has for research methods. If flows and filters are incompletely understood, policies may be based on fallacies. Whereas ‘fire-breaks’ act as filters in the lateral flow of the high temperature pulse of a fire, smoke from land-based fires can be intercepted only by rainfall acting as a filter and the external impact of smoke is determined by the atmospheric conditions governing lateral flow and chemical transformations along the pathway. Causal relations in smoke and haze problems are relatively simple and may form a basis for designing policy interventions to reduce downwind damage. For biodiversity issues, landscape connectivity, the absence of filters restricting dispersal and movement of organisms, is increasingly recognised as an influence on the dynamics of species richness and its scaling relations. Biodiversity research methods can extend beyond the current descriptive stage into clarifying causal relations with a lateral flow perspective. The question whether connectivity is in fact desired, however, depends on stakeholder interests and situation. Forest functions in watershed protection, presumably leading to a continuous flow of clean water in the dry season through the subsoil instead of a rapid surface transfer, have been generally attributed to the trees rather than the forest, with its rough surface structure, swamps and infiltration sites. A new synthesis of site-specific hydrological knowledge and tree water balance studies may be needed to separate myth from reality, and avoid wasting public funds on tree planting under the heading of reforestation, without restoring the hydrological regime of a real forest. Soil movement can be intercepted at a range of scales and in as far as soil transport entails movement of soil fertility, filter zones can be very productive elements of a landscape. To achieve ‘integrated natural resource management’ all external effects of land use will somehow have to be taken into account in farmer decision making about the use of natural resources on and off farm. Farmers’ ecological knowledge may include concepts of lateral flows and should be further explored as an integral part of a new landscape ecological approach. "

Governments, markets and communities are simultaneously weak in places characterized by fractal poverty traps. No unit operates at a high-level equilibrium in such a system. All seem simultaneously trapped in low-level equilibria. The fractal poverty traps formulation suggests four interrelated strategic emphases for poverty reduction strategies. "

Information on yield risk could give an idea of where a particular input may not work well, and thus has low potential for adoption by farmers. Using analytical methods combining features of meta-analysis, response surface regression and generalized additive models, this work synthesizes information on variation of maize yield gaps and risks with inorganic fertilizer and organic inputs in relation to soils and climate. The organic inputs included in situ green manure from sunhemp (Crotalaria spp.), velvetbean (Mucuna spp.), sesbania (Sesbania spp.), tephrosia (Tephrosia spp.) and gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium). Yield gap (YG) was defined as the difference in grain yield between maize grown using a given nutrient input and without external nutrient inputs (i.e. control) under a specific study condition. Yield risk was defined as the probability of obtaining yields lower than or equal to the control across similar conditions. Yield gaps with the recommended rate of inorganic fertilizer were significantly higher on farmers’ fields compared with research stations, while with organic inputs such differences were smaller. With inorganic fertilizer, yield risks were higher (up to 22%) on Nitosols (one of the most fertile soils), compared with Luvisols (&lt;5% risk). With sunhemp, yield risks were higher on Ferralsols (40%), which have low resilience to degradation and low sensitivity to yield decline, compared with Cambisols (&lt;5%), which have high resilience and low sensitivity. Yield risks with velvetbean were higher on Acrisols (35%) and Lixisols (20%), which have very low resilience and high sensitivity, compared with Nitosols and Ferralsols (&lt;15% risk). With sesbania higher yield risks were noted on Nitosols (53%) and Acrisols (39%) compared with Luvisols (17%), Ferralsols (20%) and Lixisols (22%). Response surface regression and generalized additive models indicated that yields and yield gaps with the different inputs vary with soil clay content, elevation and mean annual precipitation on the study sites. With all inputs, yield risks were lower on sites with 20–40% soil clay content, while the effect of elevation and precipitation differed widely with the type of input. It is conclude that yield gaps and yield risks vary with the soil fertility input, the sensitivity and resilience of soils and management. This study could not confirm the superiority of any of the legume species over the other across all locations. Therefore, blanket recommendation of species should be avoided. Instead, species should be targeted in niches where they can reduce yield risks and increase adoption by small-holder farmers. "

At 33 months after planting, growth and survival of U. kirkiana and S. birrea were lower in plots that received fertilizer, compost and irrigation compared with those that did not. The best growth and survival in U. kirkiana was obtained when irrigation was applied with neither fertilizer nor manure. The best growth in S. birrea was recorded where plants received irrigation without fertilizer and manure, while survival was highest when none of the treatments was applied. Growth and survival of V. infausta was not affected by manure application, but fertilizer and irrigation increased root collar diameter, leaf, shoot and branch numbers. At 33 months after planting, U. kirkiana and S. birrea had not reached reproductive maturity, while V. infausta and M. indica had started fruiting in the second year. It is concluded that fertilization, manure and irrigation do not increase early growth or survival of U. kirkiana and S. birrea contrary to the commonly held assumption about factors that affect growth and survival in this species. The poor response to fertilizer and dry-season irrigation could be attributed to either their adaptation to infertile soils and unimodal rainfall regimes in their natural stands or delayed response that could not have been observed in the short period of the study.

There were no significant differences between the proportions of women and men planting improved fallows nor were there differences between single women and female heads of households who were married. There was some evidence of association between planting improved fallows and wealth. That 22% of the ‘poor’ group and 16% of the ‘very poor’ group were planting them suggests that there are no barriers preventing low-income households from doing so. Moreover, the proportion of females, poor, and very poor people planting improved fallows varied considerably among villages, suggesting that opportunities exist for increasing their use of the technology. Whereas the use of mineral fertilizer is strongly associated with high-income, male farmers, improved fallows appear to be a gender-neutral and wealth-neutral technology. Poor farmers appreciate improved fallows because it permits them to substitute small amounts of land and labour for cash, their most scarce resource. Finally, the high degree of consistency among different key informants in classifying households among wealth groups confirmed the effectiveness and accuracy of the wealth ranking exercise. "

Results showed no vascular cambium continuity above the scion/stock unions. Significant differences in total soluble phenols and cell wall bound phenols were obtained. Fluorescence microscope indicated the presence of flavonoids and other polymers above the union. The RP-HPLC identified ferulic acid as a major phenol component found in U. kirkiana plant cells and responsible for wood discolouration. High phenol concentrations were obtained in less compatible combinations than in compatible combinations. High peaks of ρ-coumaric acid were obtained above the union. It is concluded that phenols, especially ρ-coumaric acids and flavonoids caused poor callus formation at the union, and hence implicated in graft incompatibility. "

Questionnaires containing a scale that measures attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control in relation to tree planting were administered to 200 farmers in Chiradzulu and Mzimba districts in Malawi. Farmers who reported planting trees in the last five years had more positive attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control compared to farmers who have not planted trees. A hierarchical logistic regression analysis showed that membership of a farmer group and attitudes had a significant positive influence on reported behaviour. Nevertheless, many farmers considered household needs such as buying food and agricultural inputs, as well as children's education, as more urgent than investing their scarce resources in tree planting, suggesting that poverty is a barrier to tree planting.

However, little has been done to explore the necessary enabling conditions for synergistic design and implementation. This paper proposes an analytical framework to assess enabling conditions for synergies at the national level and applies it to developing countries to explore the potential move toward synergy. Four enabling conditions for integrating adaptation and mitigation, i.e. policies and strategies, programs and projects, institutional arrangements and financial mechanisms, were used to score developing countries relative to each other. We hypothesized that low income and vulnerable countries might more likely pursue synergy given the urgency for both adaptation and mitigation. Despite the relative infancy of the synergy concept, about half of countries studied exhibited good synergy potential, 80% of which were middle-income developing countries. The assumption of vulnerability as a precursor for pursuing synergy was supported by the fact that small island states possessed relatively high synergy potential. Income was weakly associated with the synergy potential with least developed countries having low synergy scores. Emerging economies possessed strong synergy potential which might be associated with better capacity available and/or potential for shaping their global images due to their growing emissions. In sum, the proposed analytical framework could be useful to identify areas of emphasis to promote holistic and efficient climate policies. As this study largely focused on the enabling conditions, further studies are needed to scrutinize and manage the mitigation-adaptation balances in countries possessing good synergy potentials. "

Land degradation is, however, widespread and improved targeting of land management interventions is needed, taking into account the variability of soil properties that affect agricultural productivity and land degradation risk across landscapes. In the current study we demonstrate the utility of Landsat \{ETM\} + imagery for landscape-level assessments of land degradation risk and soil condition through a combination of systematic field methodologies, infrared (IR) spectroscopy and ensemble modeling techniques. The approaches presented allow for the development of maps at spatial scales that are appropriate for making spatially explicit management recommendations. Field data and soil samples collected from 38 sites, each 100 km2, were used to develop predictive models that were applied as part of a case study to an independent dataset from four sites in Ethiopia. The predictions based on Landsat reflectance were robust, with R-squared values of 0.86 for pH and 0.79 for soil organic carbon (SOC), and were used to create predicted surfaces (maps) for these soil properties. Further, models were developed for the mapping of the occurrence of soil erosion and root depth restrictions within 50 cm of the soil surface (RDR50), with an accuracy of about 80% for both variables. The maps generated from these models were used to assess the spatial distribution of soil pH and SOC, which are important indicators of soil condition, and land degradation risk factors in order to target relevant management options.

We developed a simple Monte Carlo-based decision model, calibrated to global data-sets and parameterized to local conditions, to predict the range of yield benefits farmers may obtain when adopting \{CA\} in two ongoing agricultural development projects in East Africa. Our general model predicts the yield effects of adopting CA-related practices average −0.60 ± 2.05 (sd) Mg maize ha−1 year−1, indicating a near equal chance of positive and negative impacts on yield. When using site-specific, socio-economic, and biophysical data, mean changes in yield were more negative (−1.29 and −1.34 Mg ha−1 year−1). Moreover, practically the entire distributions of potential yield impacts were negative suggesting \{CA\} is highly unlikely to generate yield benefits for farmers in the two locations. Despite comparable aggregate effects at both sites, factors such as land tenure, access to information, and livestock pressure contrast sharply highlighting the need to quantify the range of livelihood and landscape effects when evaluating the suitability of the technology. This analysis illustrates the potential of incorporating uncertainty in rapid assessments of agricultural development interventions. Whereas this study examines project-level decisions on one specific intervention, the approach is equally relevant to address decision-making for multiple interventions, at multiple scales, and for multiple criteria (e.g., across ecosystem services), and thus is an important tool that can support linking knowledge with action.

However, progress in promoting agroforestry is held back because decision-makers lack reliable tools to accurately predict yields from tree-crop mixtures. Amongst the key challenges faced in developing such tools are the complexity of agroforestry, including interactions between various system components, and the large spatial domains and timescales over which trees and crops interact. A model that is flexible enough to simulate any agroforestry system globally should be able to address competition and complementarity above and below ground between trees and crops for light, water and nutrients. Most agroforestry practices produce multiple products including food, fiber and fuel, as well as income, shade and other ecosystem services, all of which need to be simulated for a comprehensive understanding of the overall system to emerge. Several agroforestry models and model families have been developed, including SCUAF, HyPAR, Hi-SAFE/Yield-SAFE and WaNuLCAS, but as of 2015 their use has remained limited for reasons including insufficient flexibility, restricted ability to simulate interactions, extensive parameterization needs or lack of model maintenance. An efficient approach to improving the flexibility and durability of agroforestry models is to integrate them into a well-established modular crop modeling framework like APSIM. This framework currently focuses on field-scale crops and pastures, but has the capability to reuse or interoperate with existing models including tree, livestock and landscape models, it uses parameters that are intuitive and relatively easy to measure, and it allows scenario analysis that can include farm-scale economics. Various types of agroforestry systems are currently being promoted in many contexts, and the impacts of these innovations are often unclear. Rapid progress in reliable modeling of tree and crop performance for such systems is needed to ensure that agroforestry fulfills its potential to contribute to reducing poverty, improving food security and fostering sustainability.

Twenty stem disks were collected from three land-use types (parklands, fallows and protected areas) in Koutiala and Yanfolila districts. We combined a standard dendrochronological approach with biomass allometric equations to estimate the growth and carbon stocks. The results showed that V. paradoxa forms distinct growth ring boundaries but most of the disks from parklands did not successfully cross-date due to management operations like pruning. The tree-ring width showed a significant standardized coefficient of regression with rainfall (r2 = 0.66, p &lt; 0.001) but insignificant correlation with temperature. One-way analysis of variance showed no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) for C-sequestration as well as for carbon stocks in aboveground biomass for both land-use types and sites. Mean values of the amount of C-sequestered in Yanfolila were 0.112 ± 0.0.065 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 in parklands, 0.075 ± 0.018 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 in fallows and 0.064 ± 0.028 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 in protected areas. In Koutiala, the values were 0.068±0.020 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 in the parklands and 0.053 ± 0.017 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 in the fallows. These results clearly indicate that dendrochronology can be applied to assess growth and carbon sequestration potential of V. paradoxa. These results also suggest that climate change could affect the growth and carbon sequestration potential of V. paradoxa. Given the limited size of our sample, figures on the amount of carbon are indicative calling for applying the tested approaches to larger samples and also to other tree species in West Africa. "

The present study attempts to provide a comprehensive, quantitative synthesis of existing reports on the effect of conservation agriculture (CA) practices on crop yield response in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Senegal. Out of a total of 155 reports found, 63 fulfilled all the appropriate criteria to be included in the meta-analysis of the effect of various conservation agriculture practices on the yield response of maize, millet and sorghum. The study revealed significant variability in cereal yield response (and hence risk) with all the practices examined. Despite the variability, the mean effects of the six \{CA\} practices on crop yield were more positive than negative except with parkland trees. However, for this last practice, species like Faidherbia albida exerts more positive impact on crop yield. Yield increases relative to the control were higher with green manure and mulching than with coppicing trees and parklands. Increases in yield in the six \{CA\} practices were higher on low to medium productivity sites for maize, millet and sorghum. Coppicing trees and rotations improved yields when the rainfall is &gt;800 mm whereas the opposite happens with parkland and soil–water conservation measures. Mulching performed better when the rainfall is &lt;600 mm. The variability (and hence yield risks) calls for more understanding of the processes and application of appropriate tree management to reduce crop yield losses while still providing products (fruits, leaves, wood, etc.) and services (soil carbon building up) for long-term sustainability of the production systems in drylands of West Africa.

We analyzed the temporal patterns of land-use change inside and outside four PAs, with one located in each of Laos, Indonesia, Madagascar and Cameroon. In Laos, in the Viengkham landscape, the rates of conversion of natural forest increased after the designation of the \{PA\} and were higher than the spatial baseline predicted. In the three other landscapes, the policies associated with the implementation of \{PAs\} increased the conversion rate immediately outside the boundary of the PAs. In Indonesia, in the Bungo landscape, forms of land-use associated with multifunctional agroforestry activities involving rubber trees land-use became the target for conversion to oil palm and monoculture rubber tree crops when the rules on the protection of the remaining natural forest were tightened. We tested a new metric for the degree of integration of forest in multifunctional landscapes which recognizes the surrounding matrix, both as surrogate habitat and as a corridor for tree species. Two important findings were: (i) a ‘leakage’ zone of influence of at least 10 km around a \{PA\} needs to be included for quantification of the deforestation and degradation changes that may be due to forest protection inside the \{PA\} and (ii) agroforest and other mixed tree cover can maintain or increase the degree of integration of forest in the multifunctional landscape for biodiversity maintenance and conservation, while providing a source of livelihood for the local people.

Management practices are a key factor in the amount and quality of ecosystem services provided. There is relatively abundant information on ecosystem services provision within agroforestry systems, but comparatively scant information regarding how coffee farmers manage their plantations, the factors influencing their farming practices and the extent to which farmers’ local knowledge – as opposed to global scientific understanding – underpins management decisions. Policymakers and scientists too frequently design development programs and projects in the coffee sector. On occasion technicians are included in the design process, but farmers and their knowledge are always excluded. This research explores farmers’ knowledge regarding how trees affect coffee productivity and ecosystem services in Costa Rica. Farmers’ knowledge on the effects of trees on coffee productivity was compared with that of other knowledge sources: coffee processors, technicians and scientists. Farmers were shown to have detailed knowledge regarding ecosystem services that their coffee agroforestry systems provide as well as on the interactions between trees and coffee productivity. When asked on the services that trees provide, farmers classified trees according to water protection, soil formation, or contribution to biodiversity conservation. These classifications were related to tree attributes such as leaf size, biomass production or root abundance. Comparison of coffee productivity knowledge from different knowledge sources revealed considerable complementarity and little contradiction. The effects of shade trees on biophysical conditions and their interactions with coffee productivity were well understood by farmers. They recorded and classified shade trees as ‘fresh’ (suitable for integration with coffee) or ‘hot’ (unsuitable) based on their leaf texture and size, foliage density, crown shape, and root system attributes. The fresh/hot classification significantly related to positive/negative provision of services. This classification was widely used by farmers, and unknown by coffee technicians. Detailed local knowledge included several different topics, such as the role of trees in soil formation and in abundance of pollinators. Farmers were also aware of the influence of these ecosystem services on crop productivity. Generally, management decisions were made to maintain coffee productivity rather than ecosystem services. Based on these results, it is suggested that technical interventions addressing the improvement of coffee plantations are more likely to be successful if they take into account not only the scientific information on agroforestry interactions but also the knowledge possessed by farmers. Lack of comprehension of local coffee knowledge could be expected to reduce the success of development programs and projects aimed at improving productivity or other ecosystem services. "

Apart from the difficulty to directly monitor them by Remote Sensing and \{GIS\} technology, a particular challenge arises from the sampling limitations for this seasonal mushroom. This problem is common in geology, where underground mineral resources must be mapped without direct observations. Geologists apply the ‘Weights of Evidence’ method for such situations, and this approach may have potential for underground mushrooms as well. We thus constructed potential habitat maps for T. indicum using the Weights of Evidence method. Based on field survey and published sources, ten influential indicators associated with T. indicum were selected and mapped for Longyang district in southwestern Yunnan, China. Two predictive models were established from independent environmental layers. In order to build better understanding of the models’ predictive ability, apart from the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, the Area Adjusted Frequency (AAF) approach was also applied for model evaluation.

We developed and tested a method for the use of \{TXRF\} for direct quantification of total element concentrations in soils using an \{S2\} PICOFOX™ spectrometer (Bruker \{AXS\} Microanalysis GmbH, Germany). We selected 15 contrasting soil samples from across sub-Saharan Africa for element analysis to calibrate the instrument against concentrations determined using the inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) standard method. A consistent underestimation of element concentrations using \{TXRF\} compared to ICP-MS reference analysis occurred, indicating that spectrometer recalibration was required. Single-element recalibration improved the \{TXRF\} spectrometer's sensitivity curve. Subsequent analysis revealed that \{TXRF\} determined total element concentrations of Al, K, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Ga accurately (model efficacy/slope close to 1:1 line, and \{R2\} &gt; 0.80) over a wide range of soil samples. Other elements that could be estimated with an acceptable precision (R2 &gt; 0.60) compared with ICP-MS although generally somewhat under- or overestimated were P, Ca, As, Rb, Sr, Y, Pr, Ta and Pb. Even after recalibration, compared to ICP-MS the \{TXRF\} spectrometer produced underestimations for elements Na, Mg, Ba, Ce, Hf, La, Nd, W and Sm and overestimations for elements Bi, Tl and Zr. We validated the degree of accuracy of the \{TXRF\} analytical method after recalibration using an independent set of 20 soil samples. We also tested the accuracy of the analysis using 2 multi-element standards as well as the method repeatability on replicate samples. The resulting total element concentration repeatability for all elements analyzed were within 10% coefficient of variability after the instrument recalibration except for Cd and Tl.

If converted to forest, large areas deemed suitable for CDM-AR would exhibit increases in actual evapotranspiration (AET) and/or decreases in runoff. Almost 20% (144 Mha) of all suitable land showed little or no impact on runoff and another 28% (210 Mha) showed only moderate impact. About 27% (200 Mha) was in the highest impact class, exhibiting an 80–100% decrease in runoff, and prevalent in drier areas (based on Aridity Index (AI)), the semi-arid tropics, and in conversion from grasslands and subsistence agriculture. Significant impacts on local hydrologic cycles were evident, however large impacts were not predicted at regional or global scale due primarily to the current limit on carbon offset projects under the Kyoto Protocol. Predicted decreases in runoff ranged from 54% in drier areas to less than 15% in more humid areas, based on four case studies located across a range of biophysical conditions and project scenarios in Ecuador and Bolivia. Factors other than climate, e.g. upstream/downstream position, were shown to be important in evaluating off-site impacts. This study demonstrates that it will become increasingly important to consider implications on local to regional water resources, and how the hydrologic dimension of CDM-AR impacts on issues of sustainability, local communities, and food security.

We measured CH4, N2O, NO, and \{CO2\} fluxes from improved fallows of Inga edulis and Acacia mangium during two successive fallow periods in an old agricultural frontier on sandy soils in eastern Amazonia. Sampling for the first fallow period was done in 1996 and 1997 while that for the second fallow was done in 1999 and 2000. We observed net \{CH4\} uptake during majority of the sampling campaigns. We did not observe any significant difference in \{CH4\} flux between improved fallows and unimproved fallows (control) during either of the sampling periods (P &gt; 0.05). We observed significantly higher uptake during the dry season relative to wet season, indicating the importance of soil water content and gas transport on \{CH4\} fluxes. For both wet and dry seasons, soil respiration rates (CO2), \{N2O\} and \{NO\} fluxes were similar for improved fallow plots and the control (P &gt; 0.05). We did not observe any significant seasonality in soil respiration or \{NO\} fluxes, but there was a significant difference in \{N2O\} flux between seasons (P = 0.0638). Contrary to other studies, our observations suggest that improved fallows using N-fixing trees do not appear to decrease the soil \{CH4\} sink and also do not seem to increase \{CO2\} and N-oxide emission in these sandy Amazonian soils. The result for N oxides is particularly pertinent to greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting methods that assess \{N2O\} emissions as a fraction of N fixation. "

Soil organic matter (SOM) fractions, particulate organic matter (POM), POM-carbon, POM-nitrogen, soil nutrient status and underlying soil characteristics were quantified on the 14th year of a gliricidia/maize intercrop establish in 1991 on a Ferric Lixisol in southern Malawi.

Soil was sampled to a 20 cm depth, post-harvest to analyze biophysical and chemical characteristics of soil organic matter, POM, POM-C and POM-N, as well as inorganic N, available P, exchangeable K+ and particle size distribution. The gliricidia/maize intercrop had a significant and positive effect on SOM, POM, and \{SOM\} fractions: \{SOM\} was 12% higher, \{POM\} 40%, POM-C 62%, and POM-N 86% higher in the gliricidia intercrop compared to sole maize, indicating nitrogen enrichment of POM. Nitrogen fertilizer was associated with modest increases in POM, 15% in gliricidia and 27% in sole maize. The impacts of these changes were directed mostly at increasing maize yields and increasing storage of soil nutrients over the short term, while decreasing the proportion of organic matter stored over the long term. Both the gliricidia/maize intercrop and increasing soil clay content were associated with significantly increased soil CEC. The gliricidia intercrop maintained \{CEC\} in coarse-textured soils over a 14-year time span, indicating a role for legume trees in intensified cropping of coarse-textured soils. "

Opportunities for ecological intensification, utilizing trees in agricultural landscapes, vary along stages of a tree cover transition of forest alteration and deforestation followed by agroforestation. The nonlinear forest transition curve can provide both a theory of change (similarity of processes) and a theory of place (configuration of state variables). We reviewed local perspectives on food security for four configurations of the forest and landscape transition in Southeast Asia, with local human population densities ranging from less than 10 to 900 km−2 to explore how current generic ‘theories of change’ on how to achieve global food security need more explicit ‘theories of place’ that take such differences into account.

However, these suppositions need to be verified especially as some of them are solely based on theory. This study uses data on producers' perceptions of expected benefits attainment through group sale initiatives to analyse the case of two \{NTFP\} producer groups in Cameroon. Results show that by joining groups, farmers can reduce some transaction costs while other costs may increase. Although overall negotiation power may increase following interventions from group activities, certain elements of negotiation are fundamental to success like bargaining better prices commensurate to efforts put in by members to meet quality standards set by traders. By using transaction cost theory, the study identifies certain elements hidden in the attributes of the transactions between producer groups and traders such as the nature of products and roads, or dispersed settlement of producers that may frustrate group market initiatives and may account for differences in performance between one group and another.

This study explored the use of the spatially explicit \{FALLOW\} model, with a new livestock module, to assess the impact of land use zoning strategies, in combination with access to fodder harvesting, on welfare, fodder availability and landscape carbon stocks in the Upper Konto catchment, Indonesia. The existing land zoning in Upper Konto catchment is in name ‘land-sparing’ but de facto combined with ‘land sharing’ approach with access to cut and carry fodder sources in watershed protection areas. Scenario analysis revealed that the existing land zoning approach is the most promising in terms of balancing fodder availability, farmers’ welfare (total profits gained from production in the landscape minus products consumed by people living in the area) and ecosystem functions (with above-ground carbon stocks as indicator). A pure land sparing approach with agricultural intensification indicates increase in farmers’ welfare but with a higher decrease (in percentage) of landscape above-ground carbon stocks. Hence, careful integration of livestock systems into zoned conservation areas can achieve multiple goals including enhancing peoples’ livelihoods and protecting environmental services. "

Two samples sets representing different soils from across the Lake Victoria basin of Kenya were used for the study: A model calibration set (n = 136) was obtained using a conditioned Latin hypercube sampling, and a validation set (n = 120) using a spatially stratified random sampling strategy. Spectral measurements were obtained for air-dried (&lt;2 mm) soil sub-samples using a Fourier-transform diffuse reflectance near infrared (NIR) spectrometer. Soil laboratory reference data were also obtained for liquid limit (LL), plastic limit (PL), plasticity index (PI), linear shrinkage (LS), coefficient of linear extensibility (COLE), volumetric shrinkage (VS), clay activity number (Ac), total clay content, air-dried moisture content, and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Soil reference data were calibrated to smoothed first derivative \{NIR\} spectra using partial least squares (PLS) regression. At the calibration stage, coefficient of determination for full cross-validation (R2) of ≥0.70 was obtained for CEC, mc, LL, PI, LS, \{COLE\} and VS. Further independent validation gave R2 ≥ 0.70 and \{RPD\} (ratio of reference data \{SD\} and root mean square error of prediction) 1.7–2.2 for LL, PI, mc and CEC. The results suggested that NIR–PLS has potential for the rapid estimation of several key soil engineering properties.

However, landholders may have little or no incentives to take these impacts into account in their decision-making process. In recent years, reward-based provision of environmental services has emerged as an important market-based incentive for motivating landholders to adopt environmentally friendly land-use changes and agricultural practices. In this regard, for instance, the Pro-Poor Rewards for Environmental Services in Africa (PRESA) project has emerged as a large network to support and facilitate reward mechanisms in Africa. However, in many African rural settings, little is known about landholder attitudes and preferences related to the alternative land-management schemes. Using locally identified sets of six key land-management attributes, this paper applies conjoint methods to evaluate landholder preferences towards alternative land-management schemes aimed at enhancing the provision of watershed services in the River Kapingazi catchment in central Kenya. Data were collected from primary sources through focus groups and a questionnaire based conjoint survey. Three conjoint models were used; a traditional conjoint ratings model, a binary logit model, and an ordered logit model. Results from the focus groups indicated that shortage of water for both domestic use and irrigation was perceived as the most acute environmental problem in the area. Deforestation, poor river bank management and agricultural practices were identified as the major causes of the problem. Results from conjoint models show that the three principal attributes influencing landholder’s ratings and probability of adopting the proposed land management options were ‘size of land area to be committed’, ‘length of contract period’, and ‘granting or prohibiting rights to harvest environmental products from the committed land’. Thus, these attributes should be the focal points in designing land-management contract for watershed services in the study area. "

The analyses revealed a significant decline in soil clay and silt, soil nutrients, herbage biomass, grazing and browsing with distance from termite mounds consistently with distance–decay models. This has both theoretical and practical significance to our understanding of processes and resource degradation in dryland ecosystems where termite mounds are common.

While these species are well integrated in the Sahel region, besides mango, they are generally absent from smallholder farms in East and Central Africa. Fruits of the species in this region are mostly harvested unsustainably from the wild communal areas. Unlike the situation in the neighboring Southern Africa region, where S. birrea is utilized extensively in the wine industry, there is virtually no use for the tree in this region, largely because of limited knowledge. Z. mauritiana use is also limited because of low quality germplasm—the hard stone clings to the flesh. An analytical framework based on five factors (site requirements, genetic variability, propagation methods, nutritional properties and utilization, and commercial potential) is used to compare knowledge status and gaps on the species in the region. While this analysis reveals the existence of considerable knowledge between and within the species, lack of improved germplasm and markets emerge as two key constraints limiting their conservation through on-farm planting. Key research and development needs identified are: (a) fostering cross-collaboration and knowledge exchange with other regions where the species are fairly well utilized, and (b) developing criteria and indicators for monitoring impacts and increased investments on the “Big Five” on livelihood of dryland communities and on biodiversity conservation.

Yet so far there have been few explicit linkages drawn between these debates. This paper moves both debates forward by presenting the first review of how the neoliberalisation of conservation has affected the kinds of impacts that conservation projects entail for local communities. It finds that, whilst there are important variegations within neoliberal conservation, processes of neoliberalisation nevertheless tend to produce certain recurring trends in their social impacts. Firstly, neoliberal conservation often involves novel forms of power, particularly those that seek to re-shape local subjectivities in accordance with both conservationist and neoliberal-economic values. Secondly, it relies on greater use of use of representation and spectacle to produce commodities and access related markets, which can both create greater negative social impacts and offer new opportunities for local people to contest and reshape conservation projects. Thirdly, neoliberal conservation projects frequently widen the distribution of social impacts by interacting with pre-existing social, economic, and political inequalities. Accordingly, the paper illuminates how neoliberal approaches to conservation generate novel opportunities and constraints for struggles toward more socially and environmentally just forms of biodiversity preservation.

Previously, a Landsat 2002 satellite imagery was employed to derive land cover maps, which were then combined with vegetation characteristics, i.e., stand height, stem diameter and planting density to obtain LCRs. The present study tested \{LCRs\} extracted from 2003 and 2004 Landsat (30 m) images as well as a combination of 2003 and 2004 higher spatial resolution \{SPOT\} (10 m) imagery, while keeping the previous vegetation characteristics. Transects along the coast were used to extract land cover, whenever availability and visibility allowed. These new \{LCRs\} applied in previously developed tsunami impact models on wave outreach, casualties and damages confirmed previous findings regarding distance to the shoreline as a main factor reducing tsunami impacts. Nevertheless, the models using the new \{LCRs\} did not perform better than the original one. Particularly casualties models using 2002 \{LCRs\} performed better (δAIC &gt; 2) than the more recent Landsat and \{SPOT\} counterparts. Cloud cover at image acquisition for Landsat and low area coverage for \{SPOT\} images decreased statistical predictive power (fewer observations). Due to the large spatial heterogeneity of tsunami characteristics as well as topographic and land-use features, it was more important to cover a larger area. Nevertheless, if more land cover classes would be referenced and high resolution imagery with low cloud cover would be available, the full benefits of higher spatial resolution imagery used to extract more precise land use roughness coefficients could be exploited.

Crop suitability maps derived with and without consideration of low \{SOC\} were compared. \{SOC\} values were extracted for 1036 locations of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) presence and the 2-percentile (0.9% SOC) was taken as a lower limit for suitability. The EcoCrop model was then run with current climate data, with and without \{SOC\} as a limiting factor, to create suitability maps. An independent spatial point dataset of registered bean presence/absence (n=1113), and regional production statistics were used for validation. The agreement between bean presence and bean suitability was higher (Cohen's unweighted kappa=0.06) when low \{SOC\} was included in the model compared to when only climate was considered (kappa=0.02). The regional statistics showed that the proportion of the area where low \{SOC\} restricted the suitability was negatively correlated with the proportion of the area planted with beans (r =-0.42, p=0.07). In summary, we identified a lower limit of \{SOC\} for the soil to be suitable for common beans production and investigated the importance of taking this soil fertility constraint into account for accurate suitability modelling. It was concluded that for more accurate suitability modelling, e.g. for decision support for adaptation to climate change, low \{SOC\} should be considered as a constraining factor. "

Land health surveillance and response is designed to overcome limitations of current assessment approaches. It is modelled on science principles and approaches used in surveillance in the public health sector, which has a long history of evidence-informed policy and practice. Key elements of the science framework are: (i) repeated measurement of land health and associated risk factors using probability based sampling of well defined populations of sample units; (ii) standardized protocols for data collection to enable statistical analysis of patterns, trends, and associations; (iii) case definitions based on specific diagnostic criteria; (iv) rapid low cost screening tests to permit detection of cases and non-cases in large numbers of samples; (v) cost-effectiveness evaluation of interventions based on projected reduction in risks and problem incidence; (vi) design of statistically analysable studies to evaluate interventions in the real-world; (vii) meta-analysis of these data to guide design of public policy and intervention programmes; and (viii) integrating surveillance and the communication and use of results into operational systems as part of regular policy and practice. The scientific rigour of land health surveillance has potential to provide a sound basis for directing and assessing action to combat land degradation. Specialized national surveillance units should be established to harness and realign existing resources to provide integrated national land health systems. An international unit is needed to provide science and technology support to governments and develop standards, whereas an international agency should coordinate land health surveillance globally. Application of the surveillance framework could result in a shift away from a focus on rehabilitation of severely degraded land towards a preventive approach that focuses more on reducing distal risks at national and regional levels.

Also, there is a need for approaches to soil mapping that capture the ever increasing effects that humans are having on the environment in general and specifically on soil properties worldwide. In this paper, we develop models for digital soil mapping based on remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) platform for Africa. The article presents maps of soil organic carbon (SOC), pH, sand and sum of exchangeable bases, as well as prevalence of root-depth restrictions in the upper 50 cm of the soil profile. Prediction models were developed based on spatially balanced field survey data, representing all major climate zones on the continent. The prediction models for soil property mapping performed well, with overall \{RMSEP\} values of 10.6, 0.34, 9.1, and 6.5 for SOC, pH, sand, and sum of bases, respectively. The accuracy of the prediction model for root-depth restrictions was 77%, with an \{AUC\} of 0.85 and Cohen's kappa value of 0.52 when averaged across predictions run on independent test data. The methods and maps developed can provide much improved identification of soil and land health constraints, and spatial targeting of land management interventions at various scales, informing both policy and practice.

It is considered one of the world's largest payments for ecosystem services (PES) scheme for its reliance on financial incentives. This paper examines the outcomes of the \{SLCP\} by way of a case study from the Yangliu watershed in Yunnan province. It focuses on the notions of justice embedded in state policy and held by villagers and local state officials in order to understand the observed outcomes in terms of people's participation in the implementation of the SLCP, land use changes and livelihood effects. Villagers, local state officials, and state policy share a primary concern about distributive justice despite significant differences in their specific notions. The shared concern underlies the villagers’ positive reactions to the SLCP, which among other factors, have led to the intended expansion of tree plantations and a livelihood transition in Yangliu since 2003. The insights from Yangliu suggest the need to consider justice for a fuller understanding of the dynamics and outcomes of the \{SLCP\} and other \{PES\} schemes worldwide as the notions of justice applied by the involved actors may influence land use and livelihood dynamics in addition to the other factors considered in research this far.

In this paper we review the relevant literature and make a case for an integrated resource management to control the spread of water hyacinth while generating energy, restoring soil and water quality, and improving the environment. Notwithstanding energetic gains in water hyacinth-bioenergy systems, there is a wide range of uncertainty in their economic viability due to underdeveloped extraction and processing technologies.

Maize grain yield was monitored for six years beyond the initial organic matter additions. During the years when amendments were added, tithonia applications resulted in the greatest yield increases, between 153 and 183% more than the unamended control in comparison to increases by136% with biochar and by 107% with sawdust additions. In contrast to application of tithonia, peak yields with sawdust or biochar in most cases occurred 1–2 years after additions had ended. Yet during the same period, yields in fields that had previously received tithonia were on average still 71% of peak yields. Four years later, yields declined to between 28 and 22% of peak yields, whereas yields after biochar and sawdust applications declined to between 57 and 25% of peak values. Six years after organic matter additions ended, maize yields were not significantly different irrespective of additions of the quality of organic amendments. The data indicate that yield responds in the short-term to input quality and specifically the amount of applied N; while the residual effects of organic matter additions on yield dynamics may relate more to legacy effects of high crop residue return, input C quality and increasing soil C.

Air-dried ground (&lt;0.5 mm) soil was scanned using a high-throughput screening accessory for diffuse reflectance attached to a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The soil properties were calibrated to smoothed first derivative \{MIR\} spectra using partial least-square regression (PLS), and screening tests were developed for various limitation classes applicable in civil works using the soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA). The hold-out full cross-validation coefficient of determination (r2)≥0.8 was obtained for the liquid limit (LL), linear shrinkage (LS), coefficient of linear extensibility (COLE), air-dried moisture content, (W) and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Further independent validation gave r2≥0.73 and the ratio of prediction deviation (RPD) 4.4–2.1 for LL, LS, COLE, W, CEC, plastic limit (PL), plasticity index (PI), and volumetric shrinkage (VS).

Leaf litter production was low (267–536 kg ha−1 at the end of the growing season) and contained, on average, 1.23% N, 0.14% P and 2.61% K. Litter decomposed rapidly, losing 80% of total mass between 70 and 105 days after incubation in the field and followed a negative exponential pattern with an average decomposition constant, k, of 0.08 week−1. No significant effects of plant accession, plant spacing or pruning on the decomposition rate were detected. K, P, Mg and Na had nutrient release rates exceeding mass loss, explained by their high mobility and solubility, together with high soil temperature and rainfall conditions. Others, such as Ca and Mn, were initially retained in the decaying leaf litter before later release. The rate of N release closely approached that of mass loss. J. curcas litter can be a supplemental source of nutrients in areas known for nutrient deficiency and low organic matter, which represents an additional input in intercropping systems above biofuel production. Considering that the total primary nutrient input through J. curcas litterfall to the soil is limited (for example, for nitrogen between 9.7 and 14.2 g kg−1 and for phosphorus between 0.8 and 1.9 g kg−1), organic or mineral fertilizer application remains crucial to satisfy fully the nutrient requirements of surrounding crops.

Fingerprinting of soil elemental composition may form a useful basis for evaluating soils in a way that relates to soil-forming factors and inherent soil functional properties. The objectives of this paper are to quantify the proportion of variability in total elemental composition by total X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) method of 1074 soil samples from the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) Project baseline and to determine the relationships with soil forming factors. The samples were from 34 sentinel sites measuring 10 × 10 km, randomized within major climate zones in SSA. Within each sentinel site there were sixteen spatially stratified 1 km2 clusters, within which there were ten 100 m2 plots. The within and between site patterns of variation in total element composition of 17 elements; Al, P, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Sr, Y, Ta, and Pb, were explored. Total element concentration values were within the range reported globally for soil Cr, Mn, Zn, Ni, V, Sr, and Y and higher than reported range for Al, Cu, Ta, Pb, and Ga. There were significant variations (P &lt; 0.05) in total element composition within and between the sites for all the elements analyzed with the greatest proportion of total variance and number of significant variance components occurring at the site (55–88%) followed by the cluster nested within site (10–40%) levels. The explorations of the relationships between element composition data and site factors using Random Forest regression demonstrated that soil-forming factors have important influence on total elemental composition in the soil. The fact that the soil-forming factors are related to the concentration of naturally occurring elements in the soil gives rise to the notion that they might be predicted from the soils' element composition. Results implied that &gt; 70% of variation in soil element composition patterns can be predicted using information in existing databases or readily observable features. Successful use of \{TXRF\} technique would open up possibilities for using total soil elemental composition fingerprints as a useful basis for characterizing soils in a way that relates to soil-forming factors and inherent soil functional properties.

Forty-eight mid-lactation Holstein dairy cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments according to a completely randomized design. Cows were fed a basal diet (control; CON) or a basal diet supplemented with 4% rubber seed oil (RO), 4% flaxseed oil (FO), or 2% rubber seed oil plus 2% flaxseed oil (RFO) on a dry matter basis for 9 wk. Feed intake, milk protein percentage, and milk fat levels did not differ between the treatments. Cows fed the RO, FO, or \{RFO\} treatments had a higher milk yield than the \{CON\} group (up to 10.5% more), whereas milk fat percentages decreased. Compared with the CON, milk concentration of \{ALA\} was substantially higher in cows receiving \{RO\} or RFO, and was doubled in cows receiving FO. The \{ALA\} yield (g/d) increased by 31.0, 70.3, and 33.4% in milk from cows fed RO, FO, or RFO, respectively, compared with the CON. Both C18:1 trans-11 (vaccenic acid) and C18:2 cis-9,trans-11 (conjugated linoleic acid; CLA) levels were higher in cows fed added flaxseed or rubber seed oil. The \{CLA\} yield (g/d) increased by 336, 492, and 484% in cows fed RO, FO, or RFO, respectively, compared with the CON. The increase in vaccenic acid, ALA, and \{CLA\} was greater in cows fed \{RFO\} than in cows fed \{RO\} alone. Compared with the CON, the milk fat from cows fed any of the dietary supplements had a higher concentration of unsaturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids; conversely, the saturated fatty acids levels in milk fat were 30.5% lower. Insulin and growth hormones were not affected by dietary treatments; however, we noted an increase in both cholesterol and nonesterified fatty acids levels in the RO, FO, or \{RFO\} treatments. These results indicate that rubber seed oil and flaxseed oil will increase milk production and the concentration of functional fatty acids (ALA, vaccenic acid, and CLA) in milk fat while decreasing the content of saturated fatty acids.

The purpose of this research was to test visible near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (VNIR) as a tool for rapid assessment and benchmarking of soil condition and erosion severity class. The study was conducted in the Saiwa River watershed in the northern Rift Valley Province of western Kenya, a tropical highland area. Soil 137Cs concentration was measured to validate spectrally derived erosion classes and establish the background levels for different land use types. Results indicate \{VNIR\} could be used to accurately evaluate a large and diverse soil data set and predict soil erosion characteristics. Soil condition was spectrally assessed and modeled. Analysis of mean raw spectra indicated significant reflectance differences between soil erosion classes. The largest differences occurred between 1350 and 1950 nm with the largest separation occurring at 1920 nm. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis indicated that the spectral model had practical predictive success (72%) with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) of 0.74. The change in 137Cs concentrations supported the premise that \{VNIR\} is an effective tool for rapid screening of soil erosion condition. "

This review was motivated by many mistakes and pitfalls I encountered in the recent literature regarding BEMs. The most common mistakes were the arbitrary choice of analytical methods, model dredging and inadequate model diagnosis, ignoring collinearity, uncritical use of model selection criteria and uninformative reporting of results. Sometimes, errors in parameter estimates were not checked and model uncertainty was ignored when interpreting and reporting results. Consequently, biologically implausible and statistically dubious equations such as ln(M) = ln(a) + b(lnD) + c(lnD)2 + d(lnD)3 + e(lnρ) have been published as allometric models. These are perpetuated in the literature, databases and field manuals and will pose a serious threat to the integrity of future forest biomass estimates. Through worked examples, I also illustrate that (1) allometric coefficients can be biased by the choice of analytical procedures and methodological artefacts; (2) collinearity of predictors can result in coefficients with unacceptable levels of error; (3) the \{R2\} and Akaike information criterion (AIC) have been misused and have resulted in the selection of implausible BEMs; and (4) differences in the definition of model “bias” has sometimes led to contradictory reports. I propose corrective measures for most of these problems and provide suggestions for prospective authors on how to avoid pitfalls in interpretation and reporting of results. "

Here, we examine the benefit distribution policy and practice of a prominent REDD+ project in Kenya with the aim of understanding the extent to which it addresses equity. We reveal that while the project design was attentive to equity concerns in distributing benefits amongst the project implementer, landowners and the wider population of small-scale farmers and pastoralists in the area, in practice, the initial flow of benefits were concentrated in the hands of a few. This was because developments in land tenure since pre-colonial times had involved processes of dispossession and elite capture, enabled by colonial and post-colonial land policies that left the majority of local people with little or no land entitlement. As the distributive policy of the project maps onto the existing unequal land distribution, it reinforces inequality. By illustrating how current, well-intended, REDD+ efforts inadvertently come to entrench a long process of dispossession of marginalized people, we call attention to the pivotal importance that historical context plays in discussions of equity and social safeguards related to implementing REDD+ initiatives and related policy.

They also provide green fodder that complements crop residues for livestock feeds, and fruits and leaves for human consumption and for income generation. The interactions between various components of the system influence the ecosystem service functions of trees of parklands (provisioning, regulating and supporting services) in several ways. These ecosystem functions have been at the center of the local ecological knowledge guiding the management options of the farmers and have also attracted the attention of scientists. Findings revealed new challenges that call for production options ensuring increased and diversified productivity of the systems while preserving the environment.

However, trees in forests and on farms may have both beneficial and detrimental hydrological impacts at farm and watershed levels. In this article, the focus is on the opportunities and challenges of using \{AF\} in the semiarid tropics and examines how to: (1) modify water productivity and make better use of unproductive water; (2) enhance the hydrological impacts of simultaneous and sequential \{AF\} systems; (3) improve water infiltration and reduce evaporation, runoff, and nutrient leaching; and (4) minimize below-ground competition between trees and crops are explained. The role of trees in improving watershed functions and the importance of hydraulic lift in dryland environments are also considered. It is also shown that there are substantial opportunities to increase water productivity in the semiarid tropics because trees can access unproductive water which crops cannot acquire. Nevertheless, competition for water in \{AF\} remains a serious challenge where rainfall is too low to recharge soil below the crop rooting zone unless tree roots have access to deepwater reserves. To avoid competition, it may be necessary to root- or shoot-prune trees, use species with ‘reverse phenology’, or adopt sequential planting of trees and crops to permit spatial complementarity in resource capture.

This paper reviews the status of the woodfuel sector in SSA, and estimates the magnitude of impacts of increasing wood demand for charcoal production on tree cover, which will be obviously unsustainable under business-as-usual scenarios. Agroforestry, if widely adopted as an integrated strategy together with improved kilns and stoves, can have a significant impact to reduce wood harvest pressures in forests through sustainably supplying trees on farm. A systematic approach is required to promote multi-purpose agroforestry systems compatible with farmers’ needs under local farming systems and current dryland socio-economic contexts. "

abstract = "Smallholder farmers are vulnerable to environmental, climate and weather-related stress, including climate change. There is an increase in understanding of the benefits of agroforestry systems both at farm and landscape scales, and that incorporating trees on farms through agroforestry systems has emerged as having the potential to enhance the resilience of smallholders to current and future climate risks including future climate change. Drawing on global examples with a focus on African case studies, this paper demonstrates the versatile roles of trees and agroforestry in reducing smallholder's exposure to climate-related risks. It goes on to identify challenges in the promotion and adoption of agroforestry at the farm and landscape levels as a climate change adaptation strategy. The paper highlights areas for further research, policy and dissemination efforts, and identifies entry points for agroforestry adoption. "

First, we use a global hydrological model to identify regions likely to be exposed to drought, defined here as a location where the available soil moisture is projected to decline by the 2050s and 2080s relative to the mean soil moisture observed between 1990 and 2005. Second, we use agricultural, meteorological and socio-economic data to develop models of adaptive capacity and run these models to show where adaptive capacity is likely to decline by the 2050s and 2080s relative to the baseline period of 1990–2005. Third, we contrast the hydrological and adaptive capacity model outputs to identify “vulnerability hotspots” for wheat and maize. Here, a vulnerability hotspot is defined as a region that the models project as likely to experience both a decline in adaptive capacity and in available soil moisture. Results from the hydrological model project significant drying in many parts of the world overt the 21st century. Results from the adaptive capacity models show that regions with the lowest overall adaptive capacity for wheat include much of western Russia, northern India, southeastern South America, and southeastern Africa. In terms of maize, regions with the lowest adaptive capacity include the northeastern USA, southeastern South America, southeastern Africa, and central/northern India. When taken together, this study identifies five wheat and three maize growing regions likely to be both exposed to worse droughts and a reduced capacity to adapt. For wheat, these are: southeastern USA, southeastern South America, the northeastern Mediterranean, and parts of central Asia. For maize, our analysis suggests that vulnerability hotspots are: southeastern South America, parts of southern Africa, and the northeastern Mediterranean. "

abstract = "To guide soil fertility investment programmes in sub-Saharan Africa, better understanding is needed of the relative importance of soil and crop management factors in determining smallholder crop yields and yield variability. Spatial variability in crop yields within farms is strongly influenced by variation in both current crop management (e.g. planting dates, fertilizer rates) and soil fertility. Variability in soil fertility is in turn strongly influenced by farmers’ past soil and crop management. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative importance of soil fertility and crop management factors in determining yield variability and the gap between farmers’ maize yields and potential yields in western Kenya. Soil fertility status was assessed on 522 farmers’ fields on 60 farms and paired with data on maize-yield and agronomic management for a sub-sample 159 fields. Soil samples were analysed by wet chemistry methods (1/3 of the samples) and also by near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (all samples). Spectral prediction models for different soil indicators were developed to estimate soil properties for the 2/3 of the samples not analysed by wet chemistry. Because of the complexity of the data set, classification and regression trees (CART) were used to relate crop yields to soil and management factors. Maize grain yields for fields of different soil fertility status as classified by farmers were: poor, 0.5–1.1; medium, 1.0–1.8; high, 1.4–2.5 t ha−1. The \{CART\} analysis showed resource use intensity, planting date, and time of planting were the principal variables determining yield, but at low resource intensity, total soil N and soil Olsen P became important yield-determining factors. Only a small group of plots with high average grain yields (2.5 t ha−1; n = 8) was associated with use of nutrient inputs and good plant stands, whereas the largest group with low average yields (1.2 t ha−1; n = 90) was associated with soil Olsen P values of less than 4 mg kg−1. This classification could be useful as a basis for targeting agronomic advice and inputs to farmers. The results suggest that soil fertility variability patterns on smallholder farms are reinforced by farmers investing more resources on already fertile fields than on infertile fields. \{CART\} proved a useful tool for simplifying analysis and providing robust models linking yield to heterogeneous crop management and soil variables.

As nutrient use efficiency varies strongly along these gradients, such heterogeneity must be considered when designing soil management strategies, aimed at an improved overall resource use efficiency at farm scale. Here, we quantify the magnitude and study the origin of farmer-induced, within-farm soil fertility gradients as affected by biophysical and socio-economic conditions, and investigate farmers’ perceptions of such heterogeneity. Farm transects, participatory resource flow mapping, farmers’ classification of land qualities, and soil sampling for both chemical and spectral reflectance analyses were performed across 60 farms in three sub-locations (Emuhaia, Shinyalu, Aludeka) representing the variability found in the highlands of western Kenya. Differences between the various field types of a farm were observed for input use (e.g. 0.7–104 kg N ha−1), food production (e.g. 0.6–2.9 t \{DM\} ha−1), partial C (e.g. −570 to 1480 kg ha−1) and N (e.g. −92 to 57 kg ha−1) balances and general soil fertility status, despite strong differences across sub-locations. Concentration of nutrients in the home fields compared with the remote fields were verified for extractable P (e.g. 2.1–19.8 mg kg−1) and secondarily for exchangeable K (e.g. 0.14–0.54 cmol(+) kg−1), on average, whereas differences for soil C and N were only important when considering each individual farm separately. Farmers managed their fields according to their perceived land quality, varying the timing and intensity of management practices along soil fertility gradients. Fields classified by them as poor were planted later (up to 33.6 days of delay), with sparser crops (ca. 30% less plants m−2) and had higher weed infestation levels than those classified as fertile, leading to important differences in maize yield (e.g. 0.9 versus 2.4 t ha−1). The internal heterogeneity in resource allocation varied also between farms of different social classes, according to their objectives and factor constraints. Additionally, the interaction of sub-location-specific socio-economic (population, markets) and biophysical factors (soilscape variability) determined the patterns of resource allocation to different activities. Such interactions need to be considered for the characterisation of farming system to facilitate targeting research and development interventions to address the problem of poor soil fertility. "

The goal of this review is to use these three domains of diversity deficit to evaluate existing models, with a longer term goal of creating a more robust framework for assessing landscape models in the future. To that end, we evaluate the behaviour characteristics and routines of agents in some current models. We also address one of the fundamental challenges to modelling diversity, which is the integration of non-economic motivations in the decision making of human agents. "

(containing alkaloids). The plants with low levels of tannins and alkaloids were Neonotonia wightii Lackey and Lablab purpureus L. cv. Rongai (Sweet). Both unfractionated legumes and their isolated neutral detergent fiber (xNDF) were studied. In addition, polyethylene glycol (PEG, \{MW\} 4000) was added to the fermentations of tannin-containing forages and their isolated NDF. Unfractionated legumes varied widely in \{NDF\} digestibility. The \{NDF\} digestibility of intact C. calothyrsus, A. angustissima, C. ochroleuca and D. intortum was less than 40% and lower than that of the other legumes. C. calothyrsus and C. ochroleuca had the greatest increase (P&lt;0.05) in \{NDF\} digestibility following extraction with \{ND\} solution when compared to their respective intact forages (0.32 vs. 0.23 and 0.46 vs. 0.22, respectively). There was no difference (P&gt;0.05) in degradability of isolated and intact \{NDF\} in the other legumes. Cumulative gas production was nonlinearly related to \{NDF\} degradability (y = 15.5 ln(x) + 27.8; \{R2\} = 0.94). Generally, the rate of gas production among the intact legumes was lower in tannin-containing legumes and C. ochroleuca compared to legumes with lower levels of anti-nutritional compounds. Addition of \{PEG\} to fermentations of tannin-containing legumes significantly (P&lt;0.05) improved the amount and rate of gas production compared to the respective non-PEG controls. Microbial protein synthesis was significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) in C. calothyrsus, L. purpureus and C. ochroleuca than in the other legumes. L. purpureus and C. calothyrsus contained more sugar (131 and 154 g/kg DM, respectively) than the other forages. Tannins suppressed production of volatile fatty acids (VFA) compared to \{VFA\} production from forages with low levels of anti-nutritional factors (ANF). Addition of \{PEG\} increased \{VFA\} production from fermentation of tannin-containing forages. This study suggests that tannins and alkaloids in forages can adversely affect their fermentation characteristics and thereby their nutritive value. "

While considerable attention has been directed at improving crop yields to alleviate the pressure on land, there has been far less attention on the implications of the expected intensification of livestock production. Here, we present and analyse the land availability and land footprints of livestock intensification for five scenarios representing various degrees of intensification of meat and milk production by cattle, sheep, goats and camels in arid, semi-arid and humid production systems in Kenya. The first three scenarios are defined by increasing levels of input and management, ranging from low (scenario S1), intermediate (S2) to high (S3) input feed crop cultivation and livestock production. Reference scenario \{S1\} has production practices and output of meat and milk similar to current production practices. In scenarios \{S2\} and S3, the total land used for livestock production remains the same as in S1. Two additional scenarios, \{S4\} and S5, explore opportunities for lessening environmental pressure through reduction of the land footprint of meat and milk production. For each scenario, we quantify the potential availability of grassland and cropland for meat and milk production by cattle, sheep, goats and camel in the arid, semi-arid and humid production systems. A resource use indicator, land footprint (ha), is used to assess changes in land use associated with livestock production. We estimate that the potential increase in production due to intensification from scenario \{S1\} to \{S2\} is 51% for milk and 71% for meat. The potential increase due to improving production from scenario \{S1\} to \{S3\} is 80% for milk and 113% for meat. The area of grazing land, as a percentage of the total potentially available grazing land, decreases from 10% to 6% as productivity increases from scenario \{S1\} to S5. Cropland usage increases from 4% in scenario \{S1\} to 11% in scenario S5. Reduced land demand in scenarios \{S4\} and \{S5\} indicates the possibility that intensification may help reduce the pressure on land and hence promote environmental conservation. Overall, the results suggest that it is possible to increase production to meet increasing demands for meat and milk while also gaining land for environmental conservation through intensification. Realizing the potential presented by the intensification scenarios will be contingent upon successfully establishing and operationalizing enabling policies, institutional arrangements and markets and ensuring that relevant information, services, inputs, and other essential requirements are available, accessible and affordable to herders and farmers.

The use of \{BMEC\} to uncover the microRNA (miRNA) profile would allow us to obtain a more specific profile of miRNA sequences that could be associated with lactation and avoid interference from other cell types. The objective of this study was to characterize the miRNA sequences expressed in isolated BMEC. The miRNA were identified by Solexa sequencing technology (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Furthermore, novel miRNA were uncovered by stem-loop reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing of \{PCR\} products. To detect tissue specificity, expression of novel miRNA sequences was measured by stem-loop RT-PCR and sequencing of \{PCR\} products in mammary gland, liver, adipose, ileum, spleen and kidney tissue from 3 lactating Holstein cows (50 ± 10 d postpartum). After bioinformatics analysis, 12,323,451 reads were obtained by Solexa sequencing, of which 11,979,706 were clean reads, matching the bovine genome. Among clean reads, 9,428,122 belonged to miRNA sequences. Further analysis revealed that the miRNA bta-mir-184 had the most abundant expression, and 388 loci possessed the typical stem-loop structures matching known miRNA hairpins. In total, 38 loci with novel hairpins were identified as novel miRNA and were numbered from bta-U1 to bta-U38. One novel miRNA (bta-U21) was specific to mammary gland. Seven novel miRNA, including bta-U21, had tissue-restricted distribution. Uncovering the specific roles of these novel miRNA during lactation appears warranted. "

However, the effect of soil nutrients added by fallow species on the incidence of pests, weeds and pathogens in the subsequent crop has not been assessed in southern Africa. In this study, we assessed the relationships between nutrients in the soil after fallows of crotalaria (Crotalaria grahamiana), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), sesbania (Sesbania sesban), tephrosia (Tephrosia vogelii), and their mixtures, and the incidence of soil insects, namely, snout beetles (Diaecoderus sp.) and termites, and weeds in eastern Zambia. Rotational fallows of sesbania+crotalaria, sesbania+tephrosia, sesbania+pigeon pea and tephrosia+pigeon pea increased infestation of maize by snout beetles as compared to the natural fallow or unfertilised maize grown continuously in monoculture. The beetles showed aggregated spatial distribution, influenced mainly by the nitrate and total inorganic nitrogen content of the soil. Termite incidence was higher in maize after a natural fallow and pure crotalaria, which had 11 and 7 times as much damage as maize planted after pigeon pea+tephrosia mixture. Total weed biomass in maize grown after a natural fallow was six times higher than in maize planted after pure sesbania fallows. The weed biomass was correlated positively with the potassium content of the top 20 cm soil and negatively with plant litter on the soil surface. It is concluded that organic inputs from pure sesbania, sesbania+pigeon pea, sesbania+tephrosia and tephrosia+pigeon pea reduce infestation by termites and weeds, and give maize grain yield comparable with the recommended rates of inorganic fertilisers. However, these fallows have the potential to increase infestation by snout beetles. This is the first study on the snout beetle in Africa, and we recommend more systematic investigation on its ecology in agroforestry systems. "

The objective was to find a simple technique to germinate seed of each species so that such a technique can be applied under village conditions in Malawi. More than 80% germination was achieved for Bridelia cathartica, Bridelia micrantha, Diospyros mespiliformis, Parkia filicoidea, Piliostigma thonningii, Strychnos spinosa, Syzygium cordatum, Tamarindus indica, Uapaca kirkiana, Ziziphus abyssinica and Ziziphus mauritiana by simply cleaning and soaking the seeds. Quicker germination could be achieved by partial removal of the seedcoat for some species. Azanza garckeana and Parinari curatellifolia, however, required partial or complete removal of the seedcoat to achieve some germination. Flacourtia indica and Parinari curatellifolia had very poor germination of 20% and 17%, respectively. "

Results suggested that the two Sesbania species were poorly adapted to the region (based on survival rate). P. falcataria and Calliandra calothyrsus were among the fastest growing species and their foliage had high nutrient values, making them promising candidates for agroforestry technologies aimed at improving soil fertility. However, the coppicing ability of P. falcataria was below average. Primary growth of the Acacia species was relatively high, but they were poor coppicers.

This study was conducted at the Kianjuki catchment in central Kenya to predict annual soil loss using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE Version 1.06) to determine the erosion hazard in the area and target locations for appropriate initiation of conservation measures. All factors used in \{RUSLE\} were calculated for the catchment using local data. The rainfall erosivity R-factor was 8527 \{MJ\} mm ha−1 h−1per year and the annual average soil erodibility K-factor was 0.016 Mg h MJ−1 mm−1. Slopes in the catchment varied between 0 and 53% with steeper slopes having overall LS-values of over 17. The C-factor values were computed from existing cropping patterns in the catchment, including corn–bean (Zea mays–Phaseolus vulgaris) 1-year rotation, coffee (Coffea arabica), and banana (Musa sapientum). Support practice P-factors were from terraces that exist on slopes where coffee is grown. Total annual soil loss predictions varied from one overland flow segment to the next and ranged from 134 Mg ha−1 per year for slopes with average LS-factors of 0–10 to 549 Mg ha−1 per year for slopes with average LS-factors of 20–30, which is more than the estimated soil loss tolerance (T) for the area of 2.2–10 Mg ha−1 per year. Using 3 years of field data, the \{RUSLE\} model was able to pinpoint site-specific erosion hazards associated with each overland flow segment in the catchment for different cropping patterns and management practices. This work highlights the severity of erosion in tropical highlands of east Africa and gives suggestions on possible intervention strategies; however, there is still a need for developing more long-term data to validate the model to suit local agro-ecological conditions.

The acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (ACSL1) is an important enzyme in the process of milk lipid synthesis. In a previous study dealing with incubations of stearic acid in bovine mammary epithelial cells, an opposite expression pattern was observed between \{ACSL1\} and miR-181a. Bioinformatics analysis with TargetScan and PicTar revealed \{ACSL1\} as a potential target gene of miR-181a. The objective of this work was to determine the potential function of miR-181a on milk fat synthesis by defining the regulatory relationship between miR-181a and ACSL1. Primary bovine mammary epithelial cells were harvested from mid-lactation cows and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 μg/mL of insulin, 10 ng/mL of epidermal growth factor, 5 μg/mL of transferrin, 1 μg/mL of hydrocortisone, 1 μg/mL of progesterone, 5 μg/mL of estradiol, and 5 μg/mL of prolactin. Cells were transfected with an miR-181a mimic to increase its expression and an miR-181a inhibitor to decrease its expression before culturing for 48 h. The results revealed that the overexpression of miR-181a inhibited the expression of ACSL1, whereas the downregulation of miR-181a increased \{ACSL1\} expression. Western blot analysis of \{ACSL1\} revealed similar effects. Oil-red-O staining indicated that cellular lipid droplet synthesis was decreased with the overexpression of bta-miR-181a, and treatment with the bta-miR-181a inhibitor increased concentration of lipid droplets. Furthermore, overexpression of bta-miR-181a resulted in a decrease in concentration of triacylglycerol in the cells, whereas inhibition of bta-miR-181a increased concentration of triacylglycerol. Therefore, the results indicated that bta-miR-181a may contribute to negative regulation of lipid synthesis in mammary cells via targeting ACSL1. "

In 1998, seed collections were made from Spanish cedar in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, for genetic conservation and tree improvement projects. Progeny from these collections were established in genetic trials at Bacalar, Noh Bec, and Zoh Laguna in the Yucatan. Survival at 2 years was 73.5% at Bacalar, 72% at Noh Bec, but only 20% after 6 months for several replicates at Zoh Laguna. Mean 2-year height, number of years of Hypsipyla attack on apical shoots (over 2 or 3 years) and total branching over 2 years, were 1.3 m, 0.04 years, and 2.5 branches at Bacalar, and 1.9 m, 0.35 years, and 1.6 branches at Noh Bec. Selection of the three best provenances (Escárcega, Bacalar, and Calakmul) would result in an estimated cross-site gain of 8.6% in 2-year height.

Timing and accumulation rate of chill and heat are understood to determine the timing of spring events, but both processes are difficult to observe in dormant tree buds. Where long-term phenological observations are available, Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression offers a statistical opportunity to delineate phases of chill and heat accumulation and determine the climatic requirements of trees. This study uses \{PLS\} regression to explore how the timing of spring events of chestnut in China, cherry in Germany and walnut in California is related to variation in the daily rates of chill and heat accumulation, as calculated with horticultural models. Dependent variables were 39 years of flowering dates for chestnuts in Beijing (China), 25 years of cherry bloom in Klein-Altendorf (Germany) and 54 years of walnut leaf emergence in Davis (California, USA). These were related to daily accumulation rates of chill, calculated with the Dynamic Model, and heat, calculated with the Growing Degree Hours Model. Compared to an earlier version of the procedure, in which phenological dates were related to unprocessed temperature data, delineation of chilling and forcing phases was much clearer when using horticultural metrics to quantify chill and heat. Chestnut bloom in the cold-winter climate of Beijing was found to depend primarily on the rate of heat accumulation, while cherry bloom in the temperate climate of Germany showed dependence on both chill and heat accumulation rates. The timing of walnut leaf emergence in the mild-winter climate of California depended much more strongly on chill accumulation rates. Chilling (in Chill Portions = CP) and heat (in Growing Degree Hours = GDH) requirements determined based on \{PLS\} regression were 79.8 ± 5.3 \{CP\} and 13,466 ± 1918 \{GDH\} for chestnut bloom in Beijing, 104.2 ± 8.9 \{CP\} and 2698 ± 1183 \{GDH\} for cherry bloom in Germany, and 37.5 ± 5.0 \{CP\} and 11,245 ± 1697 \{GDH\} for walnut leaf emergence in California. Spring phases of cherry in Klein-Altendorf and especially chestnut in Beijing will likely continue to advance in response to global warming, while for walnut in California, inadequate chilling may cause delays in flowering and leaf emergence. Such delays could serve as an early-warning indicator that future productivity may be threatened by climate change. The R package ‘chillR’ makes the method used in this study available for wider use.

On the two Zambian sites, sole maize (Zea mays) grown continuously (for 11–12 years) with the recommended fertilizer achieved the highest \{RUE\} (3.9–4.6 kg ha−1 mm−1) followed by maize intercropped with Leucaena (2.5–3.4 kg ha−1 mm−1). This translated to 192–383% increase in \{RUE\} over the control (maize grown without nutrient inputs), which is the de facto resource-poor farmers’ practice. \{RUE\} was more stable in fully fertilized sole maize on the first Zambian site and not statistically different from the maize–Leucaena associations on the second site. On the Nigerian site, \{RUE\} was higher in maize planted between Leucaena hedgerows supplemented with 50% of the recommended fertilizer (3.9 kg ha−1 mm−1), maize grown between Leucaena hedgerows without fertilizer (3.0 kg ha−1 mm−1) and sole maize receiving the recommended fertilizer (2.8 kg ha−1 mm−1), which translated to increases in \{RUE\} of 202%, 139% and 85%, respectively, over the control. \{RUE\} was more stable in the maize grown between Leucaena hedgerows than in the fully fertilized maize. On all sites \{RUE\} was least stable in the control. Yield stability in the maize–Leucaena association was not significantly different from the fully fertilized maize on the Zambian sites. On the Nigerian site, maize yields were more stable in maize grown in Leucaena hedgerows than in fully fertilized sole maize. Supplementation of maize grown in Leucaena hedgerows with 50% of the recommended fertilizers resulted in greater yield stability. It is concluded that intercropping cereals with legume trees and supplementation with inorganic fertilizer can increase rain use efficiency and yield stability in rain-fed agriculture in SSA. "

Ecosystem management in the Lake Victoria basin has been highly extractive for most of the last 60 years, with the 1990s a period of marked decline in food production, economic contraction, rising poverty, increased burden of human disease, and more frequent floods. Lake Victoria itself is becoming eutrophic, with related problems of species extinctions and invasive species. There is evidence of poverty–environment traps: some households and areas appear to be caught in vicious cycles of low income, low investment in soil management, declines in soil fertility, and soil loss, while other households and areas are able to achieve higher incomes and investments, maintain soil fertility, and conserve soil on their farms. Concepts and approaches from the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) were applied in a study of ecosystem service tradeoffs, synergies and traps in two of the river basins that flow into Lake Victoria from Kenya (Yala and Nyando). Hydrologic units are the main geographic unit used in the analysis, with predictions of sediment yield serving as the main measure of regulating services. Provisioning services are evaluated through a spatially disaggregated analysis of agricultural production, yield and area that combines spatial data from aerial photographs with division-level price and yield estimates. The results illustrate considerable year-to-year variation in land use, agricultural production and sediment yield in the two basins. While overall production appears to be relatively stable at the basin level, there have been shifts in the geographic locus of production toward the upper parts of both basins. A spatial overlay of production and sediment yield indicates that different parts of the basins exhibit tradeoffs, synergies and traps. Results from this study have multiple uses in rural planning, agricultural investment, and watershed management. The results also suggest that the poverty traps conceptual framework may help to enrich the interpretative content of the \{MA\} approach. "

Rural households depend on farming for at least part of their livelihood, and poverty rates are among the highest in Kenya. Land is often depleted of nutrients, and for most farmers, access to inputs and markets is poor. There is a need to identify options that are manageable within the context of the farmer’s resource base and the household’s objectives that could improve farm household well-being. In this study we integrated qualitative informal participatory approaches with quantitative mathematical programming and biophysical simulation modelling. Households in four sub-locations in Vihiga District were clustered and pilot cases identified. Meetings were held with farmers to elicit their perceptions of what their ideal farm would look like, and how its performance might compare with their own farm’s performance. With farmers’ help, a range of scenarios was analysed, relating to changes in current enterprise mixes, changes in current farm sizes, and changes in prices of staples foods and cash crops. A considerable mismatch was found between farmers’ estimates of their own farm’s performance, and what was actually produced. There seems to be a threshold in farm size of 0.4 ha, below which it is very difficult for households to satisfy their income and food security objectives. Even for larger farms whose households are largely dependent on agriculture, the importance of a cash crop in the system is critical. There is a crucial role for extension services in making farmers aware of the potential impacts on farm revenue of modest changes in their farm management systems. We are monitoring nine households in the district, whose farmers have made some changes to their system in an attempt to increase household income and enhance food security. "

A critical constraint to managing soils in sub-Saharan Africa is poor targeting of soil management interventions. This is partly due to lack of diagnostic tools for screening soil condition that would lead to a robust and repeatable spatially explicit case definition of poor soil condition. The objectives of this study were to: (i) evaluate the ability of near infrared spectroscopy to detect changes in soil properties across a forest-cropland chronosequence; and (ii) develop a heuristic scheme for the application of infrared spectroscopy as a tool for case definition and diagnostic screening of soil condition for agricultural and environmental management. Soil reflectance was measured for 582 topsoil samples collected from forest-cropland chronosequence age classes namely; forest, recently converted, \{RC\} (17 years) and historically converted, \{HC\} (ca.70 years). 130 randomly selected samples were used to calibrate soil properties to soil reflectance using partial least-squares regression (PLSR). 64 randomly selected samples were withheld for validation. A proportional odds logistic model was applied to chronosequence age classes and 10 principal components of spectral reflectance to determine three soil condition classes namely; “good”, “average” and “poor” for 194 samples. Discriminant analysis was applied to classify the remaining 388 “unknown” samples into soil condition classes using the 194 samples as a training set. Validation r2 values were: total C, 0.91; total N, 0.90; effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), 0.90; exchangeable Ca, 0.85; clay content, 0.77; silt content, 0.77 exchangeable Mg, 0.76; soil pH, 0.72; and K, 0.64. A spectral based definition of “good”, “average” and “poor” soil condition classes provided a basis for an explicitly quantitative case definition of poor or degraded soils. Estimates of probabilities of membership of a sample in a spectral soil condition class presents an approach for probabilistic risk-based assessments of soil condition over large spatial scales. The study concludes that reflectance spectroscopy is rapid and offers the possibility for major efficiency and cost saving, permitting spectral case definition to define poor or degraded soils, leading to better targeting of management interventions.

The \{CDM\} allows for a small percentage of emission reduction credits to come from afforestation and reforestation (CDM-AR) projects. We conducted a global analysis of land suitability for CDM-AR carbon ‘sink’ projects and identified large amounts of land (749 Mha) as biophysically suitable and meeting the CDM-AR eligibility criteria. Forty-six percent of all the suitable areas globally were found in South America and 27% in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia, despite the larger land mass, relatively less land was available. In South America and Sub-Saharan Africa the majority of the suitable land was shrubland/grassland or savanna. In Asia the majority of the land was low-intensity agriculture. The sociologic and ecological analyses showed that large amounts of suitable land exhibited relatively low population densities. Many of the most marginal areas were eliminated due to high aridity, which resulted in a generally Gaussian distribution of land productivity classes. If the cap on CDM-AR were raised to compensate for a substantially greater offset of carbon emission through sink projects, this study suggests that it will be increasingly important to consider implications on local to regional food security and local community livelihoods.

Rotenoids were absent from chemotype 2 (C2), which was characterised by prenylated flavanones, including the previously unrecorded examples (2S)-5,7-dimethoxy-8-(3-hydroxy-3-methylbut-1Z-enyl)flavanone, (2S)-5,7-dimethoxy-8-(3-methylbut-1,3-dienyl)flavanone, (2S)-4′-hydroxy-5-methoxy-6″,6″-dimethylpyrano[2″,3″:7,8]flavanone, (2S)-5-methoxy-6″,6″-dimethyl-4″,5″-dihydrocyclopropa[4″,5″]furano[2″,3″:7,8]flavanone, (2S)-7-hydroxy-5-methoxy-8-prenylflavanone, and (2R,3R)-3-hydroxy-5-methoxy-6″,6″-dimethylpyrano[2″,3″:7,8]flavanone. The known compounds (2S)-5-methoxy-6″,6″-dimethylpyrano[2″,3″:7,8]flavanone (obovatin 5-methyl ether) and 5,7-dimethoxy-8-(3-hydroxy-3-methylbut-1Z-enyl)flavone (Z-tephrostachin) were also found in C2. This chemotype, although designated Tephrosia candida DC. in collections originating from the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), was confirmed to be T. vogelii on the basis of morphological comparison with verified herbarium specimens and \{DNA\} sequence analysis. Sampling from 13 locations in Malawi where farmers cultivate Tephrosia species for insecticidal use indicated that almost 1 in 4 plants were T. vogelii C2, and so were unsuitable for this application. Leaf material sourced from a herbarium specimen of T. candida contained most of the flavanones found in T. vogelii C2, but no rotenoids. However, the profile of flavonol glycosides was different to that of T. vogelii \{C1\} and C2, with 6-hydroxy-kaempferol 6-methyl ether as the predominant aglycone rather than kaempferol and quercetin. The structures of four unrecorded flavonol glycosides present in T. candida were determined using cryoprobe \{NMR\} spectroscopy and \{MS\} as the 3-O-α-rhamnopyranosyl(1 → 6)-β-galactopyranoside-7-O-α-rhamnopyranoside, 3-O-α-rhamnopyranosyl(1 → 2)[α-rhamnopyranosyl(1 → 6)]-β-galactopyranoside, 3-O-α-rhamnopyranosyl(1 → 2)[α-rhamnopyranosyl(1 → 6)]-β-galactopyranoside-7-O-α-rhamnopyranoside, and 3-O-α-rhamnopyranosyl(1 → 2)[(3-O-E-feruloyl)-α-rhamnopyranosyl(1 → 6)]-β-galactopyranosides of 6-hydroxykaempferol 6-methyl ether. Tentative structures for a further 37 flavonol glycosides of T. candida were assigned by LC–MS/MS. The correct chemotype of T. vogelii (i.e. C1) needs to be promoted for use by farmers in pest control applications. "

The major objectives were to determine if gross \{CV\} was positively correlated with wood density and tree growth, and if gross \{CV\} and/or \{CVm3\} varied with rainfall gradients in the sample region. Provenances were grouped into a drier and more humid zone, and correlations were computed among all trees and separately in each zone. Results indicated that gross \{CV\} was not significantly correlated with density in either species. Gross \{CV\} was positively correlated with growth of P. africana (but not B. aegyptiaca) only in the drier zone. Gross \{CVm3\} was positively correlated with growth of both species, and the correlations were stronger in the drier zone. Multiple regressions with provenance latitude, longitude and elevation indicated that provenance means for gross \{CV\} increased, in general, from the drier to the more humid zones.

However, due to lack of legal alternatives, \{CSM\} is largely an informal activity. We rely on the theory of access to understand the mechanisms of access to timber resources, and to the income derived from their use, implemented by local actors to participate in the growth of this informal sector. Among eight common access mechanisms, two have played a particularly important role in the development of \{CSM\} for the benefit of rural economies. On the one hand, the growth of \{CSM\} was built on the customary tenure system, by valuing traditional knowledge and abiding by the traditional rules of access to trees. On the other hand, domestic timber markets remained accessible to independent operators in Cameroon, in Central African Republic and in Gabon, but the situation is less true in Republic of Congo and in Democratic Republic of Congo. Even if the financial impacts of \{CSM\} are substantial for rural economies in Central Africa, the application of the theory of access cannot conclude that this activity supports a decentralized, democratic and sustainable management of timber resources. Two elements lack in this analysis, the accountability of resource managers and the ecological sustainability of the harvest. These issues could be better addressed through a fine-tuned formalization of the \{CSM\} sector that would not compromise its present positive impact on rural people's livelihoods. "

The reviews presented in this special edition of Forest Ecology and Management on forest genetic resources complement the first ever synthesis of the State of the World’s Forest Genetic Resources (SOW-FGR) that has just been published by the Food and Agriculture Organization. In this editorial, we present some of the key findings of the SOW-FGR and introduce the seven reviews presented in this special edition on: (1) tree genetic resources and livelihoods; (2) the benefits and dangers of international germplasm transfers; (3) genetic indicators for monitoring threats to populations and the effectiveness of ameliorative actions; (4) the genetic impacts of timber management practices; (5) genetic considerations in forest ecosystem restoration projects using native trees; (6) genetic-level responses to climate change; and (7) ex situ conservation approaches and their integration with in situ methods. Recommendations for action arising from the SOW-FGR, which are captured in the first Global Plan of Action for the Conservation, Sustainable Use and Development of Forest Genetic Resources, and the above articles are discussed. These include: increasing the awareness of the importance of and threats to forest genetic resources and the mainstreaming of genetic considerations into forest management and restoration; establishing common garden provenance trials to support restoration and climate change initiatives that extend to currently little-researched tree species; streamlining processes for germplasm exchange internationally for research and development; and the intelligent use of modern molecular marker methods as genetic indicators in management and for improvement purposes.

The types of pesticides used by the farmers in the study areas were insecticides (59%), fungicides (29%) and herbicides (10%) with the remaining 2% being rodenticides. Pesticides were bought from pesticides shops (60%), general shops (30%) and cooperative shops (10%). The pesticides were supplied in containers ranging from 0.5 to 5 l or in packets ranging from 0.5 to 25 kg. Vendors often dispensed smaller quantities of pesticides in unlabelled containers. About a third of the farmers applied pesticides in mixtures. Up to 90% of this third had a maximum of 3 pesticides in a mixture. In all cases, there were no specific instructions either from the labels or extension workers regarding these tank mixtures. More than 50% of the respondents applied pesticides up to 5 times or more per cropping season depending on the crop. Insecticides and fungicides were routinely applied by 77% and 7%, respectively. Fifty-three percent of the farmers reported that the trend of pesticide use was increasing, while 33% was constant and 14% was decreasing. Sixty-eight percent of farmers reported having felt sick after routine application of pesticides. Pesticide-related health symptoms that were associated with pesticides use included skin problems and neurological system disturbances (dizziness, headache). Thirty-nine percent of farmers reported spending between 20 and 130,200 Tanzanian shillings (0.018–116 \{US\} dollars) in a year on health due to pesticides.

These fallow-based management strategies have often followed processes of nature by protecting or substituting for specific ecological functions of the natural forest. When exposed to a changing biophysical social, economic, and/or political environment, certain driving factors influence and condition farmers’ decisional behavior leading to the development of management strategies that may either protect or destroy the forest functions of the fallow. A decision to decrease the length of the fallow period may result in the disappearance of forest fallows and potentially result in degradation due to over-intensification. On the other hand, fallow management focused on improvement of the economic productivity of the fallow vegetation itself often leaves a forest-like structure intact. Examples are presented of successful and sustainable fallow-based management strategies that were developed by farming households in Southeast Asia within the context of social, economic, political, and environmental change. Key issues are identified for research and development initiatives that begin to develop in the region to work towards long-term socio-economic and environmental sustainability of fallow-based farming systems.

Recognizing the ecosystem perspective, complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory and transdisciplinary collaboration as conceptual opportunities to developing innovative and socially robust solutions is an important step in the right direction. However, because ecosystems are constantly evolving, human co-development has to account for inherent ecological uncertainty. Thus, sustainability depends on a continuous reevaluation of objectives, continuous knowledge generation, stakeholder involvement and a deeper understanding of evolving social and ecological dynamics. These requirements of continuity are hardly met by current approaches consisting of consecutive transdisciplinary projects focused on solving the most urgent problems of mismanagement at hand. Therefore, in this paper we argue for an organizational setup when pursuing an ecosystem approach and outline essential characteristics, inherent opportunities and fundamental challenges. Promising benefits of this approach include tested yet proactive interventions, public credibility, resource efficiency, long-term relationship building, community participation and ultimately sustainable development. Thereby, sustainability is aspired to and supported by a shared vision, organizational co-evolution, an organizational culture promoting innovation and an external autonomy to self-organize. "

We pooled gas samples –analogously to soil pooling – to overcome this challenge. Our sample pooling technique collects a composite gas sample from several chambers instead of the conventional practise of analyzing samples from chambers individually, thus reducing numbers of gas samples. The method was verified to be reasonably accurate in forest, grassland and agricultural fields over a four week measurement campaign. Pooling technique results differed by 2–8% for \{CO2\} and by 3–4% for \{N2O\} when compared to individual chamber means. That shows pooling of gas samples across individual static chambers is an acceptable approach to integrate spatial heterogeneity. "

Addressing this issue is relevant, especially when combined with other challenges such as preserving biodiversity. The present study assessed tree diversity (Shannon–Wiener’s index) and carbon stocks of different land uses in Balé and Ziro sites in Sudanian zone of Burkina Faso. Aboveground carbon stock was evaluated using generalized equation. Belowground carbon was assessed by excavating plant parts in samples of soil in each plot. Regarding soil sampling for C-content assessment, four locations were selected in each plot and soil was sampled at the depths of 0–20 cm and 20–50 cm, using an auger. The four soil samples from each depth were pooled, thoroughly mixed and a composite soil sample taken to the laboratory for carbon content measurement using the Black and Walkley method. The C-content was then used for calculating SOC. In Balé and Ziro, 85 and 106 species, 63 and 82 genera, 29 and 35 families were identified, respectively, with the Leguminosae family as most dominant. Natural vegetation stands (NV) and fallows showed high richness and diversity compared to parklands. Soil was found the most important carbon pool. Highest values of aboveground, belowground and soil C-stocks in Ziro (13.9, 14.71 and 67.1 Mg/ha) were recorded in community managed forests (CMF) logged 12 years ago, while equivalent values for Balé (25.76, 14.96 and 53.02 Mg/ha) were recorded in the dense NV. However, irrespective of C pool, the difference between \{CMFs\} and the 100 trees/ha Vitellaria parkland was not significant. Correlations were found between species richness and above and belowground C-stocks (R2 = 0.22, p &lt; 0.0001; \{R2\} = 0.33, p &lt; 0.0001). Overall, dense Vitellaria parklands, apart from allowing tree-crop integration, have real potentials for C sequestration.

Our study evaluated agroforestry adoption and practices within smallholder farms in a former large-scale maize growing area of Trans Nzoia County, Rift Valley Province, Kenya. This was followed by investigation of factors influencing heterogeneity in the adoption and practices. The factors include: household resource endowment, land tenure and time under current management. Five settlement schemes which were formerly large estates dominated by maize mono-cropping were selected for the current study. Tree inventories of the farms were obtained through transect walks across each settlement. A total of 123 farms were assessed representing households of different resource endowment levels, tenure and number of years under current management. Different analyses were carried out including farm size and tree number, tree density, tree diversity and utilization of the dominant tree species. In total, we identified 44 tree/shrub species, 24 of which were indigenous and the rest exotic. However, the exotic tree species dominated strongly in abundance with Eucalyptus spp. being the most frequent taxon and constituting 34.6% of all trees. Species richness was found to be low compared to other agricultural landscapes in the region. Resource constrained households were found to prefer fruit tree species and maintained high tree diversity on their farms. Households with secure tenure had higher tree diversity than those without who had higherspecies richness and opted for fast growing fodder and fertilizer/firewood trees. Younger farms had fewer trees but higher species richness than older farms. The study, therefore, explains heterogeneity in agroforestry adoption in terms of variation in household resource endowment, land tenure and time under current management levels. "

Education had an inverse relationship with use of forest foods. Knowledge and positive attitude towards the nutritional value of forest foods were also found to positively influence consumption of forest foods. Since knowledge was found to influence attitude and consumption, there is need to invest in awareness campaigns to strengthen the current knowledge levels among the study population. This should positively influence the attitudes and perceptions towards increased consumption of forest foods. "

Its production has been conventionally considered as an agricultural off-season activity to supplement household income and cope with harvest failures. This study used primary data at the household level from an important charcoal supplying dryland region in Kenya to evaluate if income from charcoal contributes to wealth accumulation. The findings show that small-scale producers were more dependent on income from charcoal and casual labor, the two sectors whose income was uncorrelated to wealth index. This group was the poorest among the producer groups and vis-à-vis non-producers in terms of both total income and wealth level. In contrast, large-scale producers derived about half of their income from charcoal production but had more diversified livelihood sources especially in business and agriculture. Despite the fact that charcoal income was not directly correlated with the wealth index, large-scale producers derived absolutely large income from charcoal activities which made them well-off among all the categories of households. The findings challenges the dichotomous policy debates on either promoting or banning charcoal production but necessitate better targeted policy interventions, which explicitly consider differences in charcoal producers to properly target social goals.

Satellite data have been an important source of information because of limited in situ data. Previous studies relied on the assumed existence of a relationship between vegetation productivity and the NDVI, in particular the annually integrated \{NDVI\} (iNDVI). This study examines this assumption and its limitations, based on in situ time series measurements of biomass, species composition, \{NDVI\} and soil moisture at the Dahra test site in northern Senegal. It is shown that, there are large differences between the \{NDVI\} – vegetation productivity relationships, and these differences can be linked to species composition. There is moderate correlation between \{NDVI\} and above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) at the peak season (r2 = 0.39). In particular, the species Zornia glochidiata is characterized by high peak \{NDVI\} and low ANPP, compared to other common species such as Cenchrus biflorus and Aristida adscensionis. It is concluded that spatial and temporal variations in species dominance is likely to add noise to the relationship between \{NDVI\} and biomass. However, the seasonal cyclic fraction of the \{NDVI\} – “small seasonal integral” – reduces such noise. "

The complex nature of recycled products as soil amendments coupled to the large diversity of soil types and their inherent properties make it difficult to optimize the benefits and minimize the risks from potentially toxic elements often present in recycled materials. Here we investigated how wheat grain cadmium (Cd) concentration was affected by soil amendments, namely human urine and biogas digestate compared to traditional farm manures and mineral fertilizers. We show that Cl− inadvertently added to soils with e.g. urine or biogas digestate strongly increased crop Cd concentrations, largely by mobilizing inherent soil Cd. This resulted in wheat grain Cd levels that could result in exceeding recommended \{WHO\} limits for dietary intake. This was evident even in soils with low inherent Cd content and when Cd inputs were low. The future of a circular economy that helps to underpin global food security needs to ensure that the effects of applying complex materials to different types of agricultural land are fully understood and do not jeopardize food safety.

This is an imperative if countries are to respond to the \{COP21\} agreement and meet their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs). The CSA-RA is designed to assess biophysical including climatic, socio-cultural, economic and technological characteristics at the household, farm and community/regional level. The CSA-RA employs gender-disaggregated methods, including gender differences in perceptions of climate change and its impacts. The CSA-RA combines common participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and rapid rural appraisal (RRA) tools into one methodology, that disaggregates the gender dimension, and includes resource mapping; climate calendars; historical calendars; cropping calendars; organization mapping; transect walks; key informant interviews; farmer interviews; and pairwise ranking matrix. The tool collects qualitative and quantitative data from various stakeholders (farmers, local leaders, researchers, local-level agricultural experts, private sector actors, donor organizations, and policy implementers), allowing expansive analysis, triangulation and validation. Application of the CSA-RA in Tanzania and Uganda reveals heterogeneity across the sites in terms of vulnerability, constraints and \{CSA\} priorities among different social groups (gender) and agro-ecological zones.

The model estimates the total canopy cover of all woody phanerophytes and the concept is based on the significant difference in phenophases of dryland trees, shrubs and bushes as compared to that of the herbaceous plants. Whereas annual herbaceous plants are only green during the rainy season and senescence occurs shortly after flowering towards the last rains, most woody plants remain photosynthetically active over large parts of the year. We use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Satellite pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) — \{VEGETATION\} (VGT) Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) time series and test 10 metrics representing the annual \{FAPAR\} dynamics for their ability to reproduce in situ woody cover at 43 sites (163 observations between 1993 and 2013) in the Sahel. Both multi-year field data and satellite metrics are averaged to produce a steady map. Multiple regression models using the integral of \{FAPAR\} from the onset of the dry season to the onset of the rainy season, the start date of the growing season and the rate of decrease of the \{FAPAR\} curve achieve a cross validated r2/RMSE (in % woody cover) of 0.73/3.0 (MODIS) and 0.70/3.2 (VGT). The extrapolation to Sahel scale shows agreement between \{VGT\} and \{MODIS\} at an almost nine times higher woody cover than in the global tree cover product \{MOD44B\} which only captures trees of a certain minimum size. The derived woody cover map of the Sahel is made publicly available and represents an improvement of existing products and a contribution for future studies of drylands quantifying carbon stocks, climate change assessment, as well as parametrization of vegetation dynamic models.

Studies were conducted across three sites in Ethiopa [Mekelle (MK) in 2012 and 2016, Ilala (IL) in 2012 and Debrezeit (DZ) in 2009 and 2010]. The objectives of these studies were (1) to assess the response of Quncho-teff to different fertilizer and irrigation levels; 2) to quantify irrigation water productivity (IWP), and (3) to collect data to calibrate and validate AquaCrop model for simulating yield and evaluate optimal irrigation and sowing date strategy for Quncho-teff at different locations in Ethiopia. The different fertilizer levels were: 1) 64 kg N and 46 kg P/ha (N2P2); 2); 32 kg N and 23 kg P/ha (N1P1); 3) 0 kg N and 0 kg P/ha (N0P0) and 4) 52 kg N and 46 kg P/ha (N3P3). The four irrigation treatments were: zero (rainfed), two, four and full irrigation applications. Findings showed that full irrigation in combination with high fertilizer (N2P2) could give better yield. However, during abnormal rainfall, spreading the available fertilizer at a rate of 32 kg N and 23 kg P/ha may be preferable to applying 64 kg N and 46 kg P/ha. This study also indicated that the regional fertilizer recommendations for teff need to be revised taking in to account the soil characteristics, climate and irrigation water availability. The AquaCrop model was able to simulate the observed canopy cover, soil water, biomass and yield of teff satisfactorily. Canopy cover was simulated with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), index of agreement (I) and \{R2\} of 7%, 0.5 and 0.8, respectively. Soil moisture during the season was simulated with \{NRMSE\} of 11.4–15.7%, I of 0.99 and \{R2\} of 0.85–0.9. Simulated final aboveground biomass values were in close agreement with the measured (NRMSE, 7.8%, I, 0.89 and R2, 0.66). There was also good agreement between simulated and measured grain yield with NRMSE, I and \{R2\} values of 10.9%, 0.93, 0.80, respectively. Scenario analysis indicated that early sowing was the best option to maximize teff yield with the least amount of irrigation. Scenario analysis also showed that one irrigation during flowering stage could substantially improve irrigation water productivity (IWP) of teff and minimize the yield loses which could occur due to shifting of sowing date from early to normal. Two irrigation applications also substantially improved the yield and \{IWP\} of late sown teff. However, to get high yield, a late sown teff should receive at least four irrigation applications during the mid-growth stage of the crop. These results suggest that AquaCrop model can be used to identify optimal farm resource management strategies for teff production. "

In addition, they are vital sources and sinks of carbon and contribute to the rate of climate change. The \{UN\} Food and Agriculture Organization has been collecting and presenting data on global forest resources and forest cover since 1948. This paper builds on data from FAO’s 2015 Global Forest Resource Assessment (FRA) and presents information on growing stock, biomass, carbon stock, wood removals, and changes of forest area primarily designated for production and multiple use of the world’s forests. Between 1990 and 2015, the total growing stock volume has increased in East Asia, Caribbean, Western and Central Asia, North America, Europe (including the Russian Federation), and Oceania with the highest relative increase in East Asia and the Caribbean. In all other subregions the total growing stock volume decreased. North and Central America, Europe and Asia report forest C stock increases while South America and Africa report strong decreases and Oceania reports stable forest C stocks. The annual rate of decrease of forest C stock weakened between 1990 and 2015. The total volume of annual wood removals including woodfuel removals increased between 1990 and 2011, but shows a remarkable decline during the 2008–2009 economic crisis. Forest areas designated for production purposes differ considerably between subregions. The percentage of production area out of total forest area ranges between 16 percent in South America and 53 percent in Europe. Globally about one quarter of the forest area is designated to multiple use forestry. The balance between biomass growth and removals shows considerable sub-regional differences and related implications for the sustainable use of forests. "

Contrasting evidence suggest that farmers’ more holistic understanding of ecosystems may challenge scientific studies and payment schemes typically focussing on a fraction of ecosystem services, e.g. Viet Nam׳s PES-policy which covers forest carbon, water and landscape beauty. Against this backdrop we explored how farmer groups in two villages (one with \{PES\} and one without) in northeast Viet Nam rated and justified fifteen ecosystem services from seven land-uses, including non-PES functions and non-forest land uses. The villagers gave overall analogous ranking and reasoning. For overall ecosystem services natural forests and forest plantations rated highest and paddy rice lowest, however for economic values natural forests rated lowest and rice-fish cultivation highest. With regards to the PES-policy, farmers failed to see the logic of excluding agricultural land and agrochemical pollution from water services. We recommend that research and capacity building aiming to prepare for PES-schemes embrace a wider range of local knowledge and understandings of ecosystem functions than those immediately considered for payment schemes. We present a participatory matrix ranking tool to support such purposes. "

Innovative integrated technologies have been developed: the ‘push–pull’ system (intercropping with Desmodium and surrounded by Napier grass), soybean and Crotalaria rotations, and imidazolinone-resistant (IR) maize seed. In 12 demonstration trials in four villages in Siaya and Vihiga districts (Kenya) and two villages in Busia (Uganda) in 2003 and 2004, 504 farmers evaluated all cropping systems and a mono-cropped continuous maize, each cropped with \{IR\} or local maize, and supplemented or not with fertilizer, totaling 16 treatments. Farmers evaluated all treatments for yield, resistance to Striga and stem borer, improvement of soil fertility, and provided an overall evaluation score, using an ordered scale of 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). Data were analyzed using ordinal regression, estimating log odds ratios. The results show significant preferences for all treatments over the control. Push–pull with \{IR\} and fertilizer had the highest log odds ratio (2.93), so the odds of farmers preferring this treatment are 18.7 times the odds that farmers prefer the control. The odds ratios for the other push–pull combinations were generally highest (9–15), followed by the rotation systems with Crotalaria (3.5–7.0), and soybeans, especially with \{IR\} maize and fertilizer (odds ratio of 5.7). In mono-cropping systems, \{IR\} maize was only appreciated in combination with fertilizer, and then only in 2004. Push–pull and Crotalaria were more appreciated in 2004 than in 2003. Farmers in Vihiga had a stronger preference for push–pull, and those in Busia for soybean rotations. Significant differences among farmers were observed, but the effects were small. Women appreciated push–pull more than men, while other technologies were gender-neutral. Older farmers were more likely to prefer push–pull and Crotalaria with fertilizer. Livestock ownership was not found to have an effect on technology preferences. Measured yield, stem borer and Striga infestation all had significant but small effects, although their inclusion did not eliminate the treatment effects, indicating that other factors are still important. \{OLS\} of the scores for different criteria on the overall score shows yield to be the most important criterion (coefficient of 0.40), followed by soil fertility enhancement (0.25) and Striga resistance (0.13). Labor saving (0.09) and stem borer resistance (0.03) are relatively minor criteria. This research shows that scoring and analysis with ordinal regression is a convenient way to solicit and analyze farmers’ preferences for new technologies, with wide applicability in farming systems and participatory research. Its application here shows that farmers like the new technologies, especially push–pull, but that there are substantial differences between years, sites and farmers. The use of this method can be very helpful to define and focus further research and formulate specific and targeted recommendations for agricultural extension. "

The samples exhibited significant tree-to-tree variation in viscosity, drawability and fat content, and differences between their villages of origin were significant. Thickening was found not to be directly associated with protein content. Similarly, the fat content did not contribute to the thickening properties at temperatures above fat melting point.

We have profiled Cameroon, a country where modern bioenergy remains largely untapped due to a lack of availability of biomass data and gaps in existing policies. This study assessed the biomass resource potential in Cameroon from sustainably extracted agricultural and forest residues. We estimated that environmentally benign residues amount to 1.11 million bone dry tons per year. This has the potential to yield 0.12–0.32 billion liters of ethanol annually to displace 18–48% of the national consumption of gasoline. Alternatively, the residues could provide 0.08–0.22 billion liters of biomass to Fischer Tropsch diesel annually to offset 17–45% of diesel fuel use. For the generation of bioelectricity, the residues could supply 0.76–2.02 \{TW\} h, which is the equivalent of 15–38% of Cameroon's current electricity consumption. This could help spread electricity throughout the country, especially in farming communities where the residues are plentiful. The residues could, however, offset only 3% of the national consumption of traditional biomass (woodfuel and charcoal).

We determined biomass allocation, allometric relationships and plant traits. Well-watered J. curcas seedlings grew 0.81 ± 0.15 cm day−1 in length and produced 1.49 ± 0.31 g dry biomass day−1. Under medium stress (40% plant available water) the plants maintained a similar stem shape, although they grew at lower rate (stem length: 0.28 ± 0.11 cm day−1; dry biomass production: 0.64 ± 0.18 g day−1). Seedlings under extreme drought stress (no irrigation) stopped growing, started shedding leaves and showed shrinking stem diameter from the 12th day after the start of the drought treatment. The drought treatment did not influence the wood density (0.26 g cm−3). The root/shoot ratio of the wet treatment was 0.27, which is low compared to other tropical trees. Both the biomass allocation and root/shoot were significantly influenced by drought. Plants of the different accessions were uniform in biomass production and plant traits. The allometric relationship predicting total aboveground biomass (B) with the stem diameter (D) (B = 0.029 × D2.33; \{R2\} = 0.89) fits well in universal scaling models in which the exponent is expected to converge to ∼2.67 at plant maturity. Based on a small validation data set from mature J. curcas individuals this hypothesis could be confirmed. A second regression model predicts the total leaf area (LA) as a function of stem diameter (LA = 2.03 × D2.41; \{R2\} = 0.95). The estimated transpiration crop coefficient Kcb ranged from 0.51 to 0.60 for the well-watered plants. "

The dry tropical montane forest of Munessa-Shashemene in south-east Ethiopia is a prominent example of degradation and deforestation in the sub-humid tropics. In recent years an increasing number of precipitation events has been observed, mainly during the short rainy season. Moreover, the recent \{IPCC\} Report envisages an increase in total annual precipitation, accompanied by more frequent extreme weather events (drought, torrential rains) for the Horn of Africa until the end of the 21st century. To evaluate possible consequences for local forest ecosystems, we applied the process-based, individual-oriented forest simulation model Formix3 to identify the influence of precipitation variability on the forest growth dynamics. We parameterised the model using field observation data including, for the first time, a tree-ring chronology of Croton macrostachyus. By using different levels of annual precipitation and intra-annual precipitation patterns, we analysed explicit simulation scenarios focussing on both overall and species-specific aboveground biomass dynamics and tree species composition. We found that the model reproduces aboveground biomass productivity precisely under current precipitation conditions. Variations in precipitation cause ecological shifts in the conditions for tree growth. Biomass and species richness both increase with mean annual precipitation, with the effects stabilising over time. Our results emphasise the impact of the duration and frequency of periods of water limitation on forest structure and growth. Our model has a variety of potential applications including investigation of the impacts of precipitation variability on forest structure and tree species diversity. It is thus a useful tool for extrapolating local growth measurements and succession, and analysing the impact of different management strategies on dry tropical montane forests. "

Biomass has extensively been estimated based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a measure of the vegetation greenness. The vegetation optical depth (VOD) derived from satellite passive microwave observations is mainly sensitive to the water content in total aboveground vegetation layer. \{VOD\} therefore provides a complementary data source to \{NDVI\} for monitoring biomass dynamics in drylands, yet further evaluations based on ground measurements are needed for an improved understanding of the potential advantages. In this study, we assess the capability of a long-term \{VOD\} dataset (1992–2011) to capture the temporal and spatial variability of in situ measured green biomass (herbaceous mass and woody plant foliage mass) in the semi-arid Senegalese Sahel. Results show that the magnitude and peak time of \{VOD\} are sensitive to the woody plant foliage whereas \{NDVI\} seasonality is primarily governed by the green herbaceous vegetation stratum in the study area. Moreover, \{VOD\} is found to be more robust against typical \{NDVI\} drawbacks of saturation effect and dependence on plant structure (herbaceous and woody compositions) across the study area when used as a proxy for vegetation productivity. Finally, both \{VOD\} and \{NDVI\} well reflect the spatial and inter-annual dynamics of the in situ green biomass data; however, the seasonal metrics showing the highest degree of explained variance differ between the two data sources. While the observations in October (period of in situ data collection) perform best for \{VOD\} (r2 = 0.88), the small growing season integral (sensitive to recurrent vegetation) have the highest correlations for \{NDVI\} (r2 = 0.90). Overall, in spite of the coarse resolution, the study shows that \{VOD\} is an efficient proxy for estimating green biomass of the entire vegetation stratum in the semi-arid Sahel and likely also in other dryland areas.

Understanding local farmers’ land-use options in response to drought and policy intervention is crucial for future adaptation strategies. We assessed farmers’ land-use options and the socio-economic factors affecting decisions under drought and water policy scenarios using household surveys. From the total of 174 households surveyed, whether under a drought scenario or a drought scenario with water policy intervention, we found that respondents preferred land-use options focusing on four choices: keep current pattern; keep crops, but reduce areas; abandon farming; rent out farmlands. Findings suggest that there is a growing pattern of agricultural abandonment for urban jobs as a strategy to cope with climate change impacts. The results identified a total of five socio-economic factors that have a significant effect on the households’ land-use options. These factors are important for the households’ land-use decisions and could prevent people from altering their livelihood strategies. We provide some specific recommendations which could enhance local households’ potential adaptation to drought, as well as for effective management of water to prevent potential conflicts in the design or implementation of water policy with the local community.

To monitor this trend, international policy processes have created a wealth of indicators over the last two decades. However, genetic diversity indicators are regrettably absent from comprehensive bio-monitoring schemes. Here, we provide a review and an assessment of the different attempts made to provide such indicators for tree genetic diversity from the global level down to the level of the management unit. So far, no generally accepted indicators have been provided as international standards, nor tested for their possible use in practice. We suggest that indicators for monitoring genetic diversity and dynamics should be based on ecological and demographic surrogates of adaptive diversity as well as genetic markers capable of identifying genetic erosion and gene flow. A comparison of past and present genecological distributions (patterns of genetic variation of key adaptive traits in the ecological space) of selected species is a realistic way of assessing the trend of intra-specific variation, and thus provides a state indicator of tree genetic diversity also able to reflect possible pressures threatening genetic diversity. Revealing benefits of genetic diversity related to ecosystem services is complex, but current trends in plantation performance offer the possibility of an indicator of benefit. Response indicators are generally much easier to define, because recognition and even quantification of, e.g., research, education, breeding, conservation, and regulation actions and programs are relatively straightforward. Only state indicators can reveal genetic patterns and processes, which are fundamental for maintaining genetic diversity. Indirect indicators of pressure, benefit, or response should therefore not be used independently of state indicators. A coherent set of indicators covering diversity–productivity–knowledge–management based on the genecological approach is proposed for application on appropriate groups of tree species in the wild and in cultivation worldwide. These indicators realistically reflect the state, trends and potentials of the world’s tree genetic resources to support sustainable growth. The state of the genetic diversity will be based on trends in population distributions and diversity patterns for selected species. The productivity of the genetic resource of trees in current use will reflect the possible potential of mobilizing the resource further. Trends in knowledge will underpin the potential capacity for development of the resource and current management of the genetic resource itself will reveal how well we are actually doing and where improvements are required.

Yet, the effects of fire on soil inhabiting organisms are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to examine the responses of soil macro-invertebrates to early fires in a Sudanian savanna-woodland on a set of experimental plots subject to different fuel load treatments. The abundance of major macro-invertebrate taxa and functional groups, and taxon richness were quantified in soil cores collected from three different soil layers before and immediately after burning. The results indicated that, overall, there was substantial spatial and temporal variation in the composition of macro-invertebrate assemblages. The immediate effects of fire were to reduce total invertebrate numbers and numbers of many invertebrate groups dramatically. This is probably due to the fact that many of the surface-dwelling macrofauna perished as a result of less favorable microclimate due to fire, diminished resources, or migrate to safer environments. Fuel load treatment did not affect the community taxonomic richness or abundance of the soil-dwelling fauna. Furthermore, annual changes in community composition were more pronounced at the burnt site than in the control. This could be related to the inter-annual difference in precipitation pattern recorded during the two-year study period at our site. Since soil macrofauna population declines in fire-disturbed areas, increasing fire prevalence may jeopardize the long-term conservation of fire sensitive macrofauna groups. Special fire management attention is therefore recommended with due consideration to the type of burning and fuel properties to avoid the detrimental effects of intense fire affecting the resilience of savanna soil macrofauna species.

We conducted a meta-analysis of the effects of agroforestry on the abundance of invertebrate pests, weeds, natural enemies and plant damage due to pests and diseases. We also tested whether effects of agroforestry were dependent on crop type (annual or perennial), type of pest association (above or belowground) and weed type (parasitic Striga weeds or non-parasitic weeds). Agroforestry practices resulted in lower abundances of both parasitic and non-parasitic weeds, and in higher abundances of natural enemies. The effects of agroforestry on invertebrate pests and diseases were dependent on crop type. In perennial crops (e.g. coffee, cocoa and plantain), agroforestry was associated with lower pest abundances and less plant damage. However, the effects were not significant in annual crops (e.g. maize, rice and beans). Despite the limited number of crop-pest systems available for the analyses, overall our results suggest that agroforestry is beneficial in terms of pest, disease and weed management. "

To test our hypothesis, we isolated and analyzed the conserved nucleotide-binding sites (NBS) of resistance gene analogues (RGAs) of an invasive weed, Wedelia trilobata (WTRGA). We then used the information in GenBank to compare the dN/dS of the \{NBS\} R-gene/RGAs in invasive and homologous non-invasive plants. Three W. trilobata \{NBS\} \{RGA\} sequences were obtained, belonging to the Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) (WTRGA1 and WTRGA2) and non-TIR subclasses (WTRGA3). Compared with the homologous non-invasive plants, the invasive plants showed a significantly greater dN/dS for \{TIR\} \{NBS\} R-gene/RGAs (p &lt; 0.0001), supporting our hypothesis. Future research should include an examination of R-genes/RGAs from more invasive plants on a population level to understand diversity and R-gene functions in invasive plant species, as well as to explore how disease resistance allows plants to adapt to changing pathogen stresses.

Savannas cover c. 20% of the Earth's land surface and changes in the structure and dynamics of savanna vegetation may strongly influence local people's living conditions, as well as the climate system and global biogeochemical cycles. In this study, we use a dynamic vegetation model, the aDGVM, to explore interactive effects of climate and land use on the vegetation structure and distribution of West African savannas under current and anticipated future environmental conditions. We parameterized the model for West African savannas and extended it by including sub-models to simulate fire management, grazing, and wood cutting. The model projects that under future climate without human land use impacts, large savanna areas would shift toward more wood dominated vegetation due to \{CO2\} fertilization effects, increased water use efficiency and decreased fire activity. However, land use activities could maintain desired vegetation states that ensure fluxes of important ecosystem services, even under anticipated future conditions. Ecosystem management can mitigate climate change impacts on vegetation and delay or avoid undesired vegetation shifts. The results highlight the effects of land use on the future distribution and dynamics of savannas. The identification of management strategies is essential to maintain important ecosystem services under future conditions in savannas worldwide. "

Under the RFFP, state authorities have redefined large areas of land as afforestation area intended to provide environmental services including erosion control, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity regeneration. Tensions among the program’s social and environmental objectives as well as the combination of formal rigidity and practical flexibility manifest in ambiguous forest classifications and tremendous variation in outcomes. The \{RFFP\} centers on two forest categorizations: ecological forest, intended to rehabilitate environmental services, and commercial forest, which may provide lesser ecological benefits but delivers more immediate economic benefits to households. \{RFFP\} policy documents designate “dual-function species” that can be planted as “forests with a primary goal of ecological service provision which also generate commercial value.” A substantial portion of “ecological forests” are dual landscapes intended to accomplish both environmental and socioeconomic goals. Drawing from cases in Yunnan, Sichuan, and Hainan provinces, this paper examines the processes of central policy-making and local implementation through which dual-function forests have proliferated, showing how rural residents have responded to the risks and promises of dual-function forests and exploring implications for rural livelihoods and landscapes. While they might be expected to bring win-win outcomes, the performance of dual-function forests on social and environmental goals depends on how local officials and residents respond to the program. Their proliferation demonstrates tensions inherent in state projects aimed at generating both environmental and economic values from rural landscapes. "

It has been recognized for its success in producing scientific outputs and real world impacts and as a pioneer in integrated natural resource management (iNRM). Until now, there has been little understanding of the reasons for its success in integrating different perspectives and ways of working. To fill this gap, an on-line consultation involving \{ASB\} researchers was structured following an analytical framework developed by the Initiative on Science and Technology for Sustainability. The structure of the presentation of major results presented in this article also follows that framework, which includes four dimensions of integration (disciplinary, functional, spatial/temporal, and knowledge) and linked challenges of institutional learning and adaptation, fostering appropriate participation, and managing resource and capacity constraints. To lay the foundations for interpreting these insights and to motivate the study, introductory sections present qualitative evidence regarding organizational learning within the consortium (using research hypotheses as indicators) and success in producing integrated results (using a selection of research results as evidence). This report on ASB's experience in integrative science and organizational learning is intended to advance understanding of the scope and limits of a complex international consortium to integrate activities across disciplines, organizations, scales and knowledge systems in order to produce knowledge and policy relevant outputs. ASB's processes and structures have weaknesses as well as strengths.

Moreover, from a methodological perspective, the use of information technology reported in this article proved to be an effective means of triangulating the perceptions of geographically dispersed researchers. In doing so, this web-based consultation provided a medium for reflection by a large ‘virtual team’ on whether words about integration are translated into practice, at least as perceived and self-reported by the scientists who participated. These techniques could be employed for process documentation by other dispersed teams, thereby adding to the stock of information on what works (and what does not) in efforts to put integrative science into practice on a significant scale.

The resource allocation (C, N and P) between cluster roots and nodules has been largely understudied during P-deficient conditions. The aim of this investigation was therefore to determine the changes in resource allocation between these organs during fluctuations in P supply. Lupinus albus was cultivated in sand culture for 3 weeks, with either sufficient (2 mM high) or limiting (0.1 mM low) P supply. Although variation on P supply had no effect on the total biomass, there were significant differences in specialised below-ground organ allocation to cluster roots and nodule formation. Cluster root formation and the associated C-costs increased during low P supply, but at sufficient P-supply the construction and growth respiration costs of cluster roots declined along with their growth. In contrast to the cluster root decline at high P supply, there was an increase in nodule growth allocation and corresponding C-costs. However, this was not associated with an increase in BNF. Since cluster roots were able to increase P acquisition under low P conditions, this below-ground investment may also have benefited the P nutrition of nodules. These findings provide evidence that when lupins acquire N via \{BNF\} in their nodules, there may be a trade-off in resource allocation between cluster roots and nodules. "

While deforestation was continuing at the forest frontier, farmers were already ‘re-treeing’ the landscape and many monoculture coffee gardens were gradually transformed into mixed systems with shade trees. In this case study we illustrate that the factors driving deforestation were strong, interconnected and generally outside the forestry domain. The current agroforestry landscape generates a significantly higher discharge than in the past, allowing a hydropower dam to revise its power-production targets upwards. One of the main reasons given to justify the eviction of farmers in the watershed, based on claims that the past land use change would negatively affect the discharge and the dam’s power generation, proved wrong. In this area, various myths about watershed functions – already dismissed in other parts of the world – still dominate the thinking of many foresters and policymakers; this paper illustrates how and why this situation came about.

At any time of the year sufficient rain events are able to cause cambial activity in P. falcatus. This permanent growing readiness leads to irregular wood formation with the formation of intra-annual density fluctuations and missing rings. Wood anatomical studies of microcores collected around the circumference of a mature P. falcatus revealed locally different activity status of the cambium on different lobes of the stem. Tree-ring width measurements of stem disks resulted in tentative tree ages that were confirmed by radiocarbon dating of selected wood samples. Although our efforts to cross-date ring-width series from several stem disks were not successful, further sampling in areas with different rainfall regimes, additional radiocarbon dating and measurements of stable isotopes hopefully would enable the establishment of a multi-century-long tree-ring series for climate reconstruction.

Faced with energy poverty many poor households turn to briquette making. This study assessed the additional cooking fuel obtained from recycling charcoal dust into charcoal briquettes. It applied Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to assess the global warming potential (GWP) from use of charcoal and production of briquettes from charcoal dust and cooking a traditional meal for a standard household of five people. Native vegetation of Acacia drepanolobium and a low efficiency kiln were considered the common practice, while an Acacia mearnsii plantation and a high efficiency kiln was used as an alternative scenario. Charcoal and kerosene were considered as reference fuels. Recovering charcoal dust for charcoal briquettes supplied an additional 16% cooking fuel. Wood carbonization and cooking caused the highest GWP, so there is a need for technologies to improve the efficiency at these two stages of charcoal briquettes and charcoal supply chain. Supplying energy and cooking a traditional meal in a combined system using charcoal and recovering charcoal dust for charcoal briquettes and charcoal alone accounted for 5.3–4.12 and 6.4–4.94 kg \{CO2\} eq. per meal, respectively, assuming trees were not replanted. These amounts declined three times when the carbon dioxide from the carbonization and cooking stages was assumed to be taken up by growing biomass. This requires replanting of trees cut down for charcoal if the neutral impact of biomass energy on \{GWP\} is to be maintained. "

In response to climate change, international funding to support reductions in emissions needs to balance conservation and development. The Government of Vietnam is currently coordinating the design of a comprehensive benefit-distribution system, with the ambition to convert certified net emissions reductions into REDD+ revenue and distribute it to local partners in a transparent, equitable and cost-effective manner. A pilot scheme is underway in Bac Kan province. With forest cover of 56.6% and a poverty rate of 36.6%, Bac Kan is among the most heavily forested and poorest provinces of Vietnam, making it a potential site for pioneering REDD+ schemes in the country. Research questions were how to incorporate international, national and local stakeholders’ investments into any distribution scheme; and how to sustain and manage an efficient, effective and equitable funding scheme for environmental services, including REDD+ revenues. Multiple data collection and analytical methods (including participatory approaches) were used to answer both research questions. Additionally, for the second question, we employed cost-benefit, opportunity cost and economic analyses. Three key concepts formed the research frame for this paper: (1) benefit-distribution systems; (2) reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation plus conservation (REDD+); and (3) the broader concept of payments or rewards for ecosystem services; as well as lessons learned from existing, similar schemes. This results shows that an appropriate benefit-sharing system for REDD+ revenues can be developed in such a way that meets international regulations as well as national and sub-national circumstances, particularly for the environmental services’ providers who directly protect forests. Vietnam's payments for forest environmental services’ and integrated conservation schemes (where conservation and rural development are integrated) serve as a base for the development of a REDD+ benefit-distribution system. We discuss ways of bundling such schemes with REDD+ ‘service’ payments and income streams from forestry and agroforestry ‘goods’ to provide short-term food-security/economic return and long-term environmental benefits. This combination is expected to provide sustainable incentives, but further effort is needed in the use of participatory methods and a ‘bottom-up’ approach to provide a strong base for an effective and equitable REDD+ mechanism at landscape level. Experience drawn from Vietnam, in general, and in Bac Kan, in particular, can be replicated and directly contribute to reducing carbon emissions globally. "

Meristem temperature, cumulative thermal time, intercepted radiation, spatial distribution of shade and gas exchange were determined for maize grown as sole crops, in an agroforestry system, or under shade nets providing 25 or 50% reductions in incident radiation to discriminate between effects of shade and below-ground competition. The major benefit of shade was to reduce exposure to the supra-optimal temperatures experienced in many tropical regions, and which are predicted to become increasingly common by climate change models. However, although trees decreased photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) incident on understorey maize by ca. 30%, the yield reduction was much greater than in the 25% shade net treatment in four seasons providing contrasting rainfall. Maize yield was unaffected by 50% artificial shade in the driest season (168 mm) but decreased with increasing shade when rainfall was high (628 mm). Shade reduced meristem temperature and delayed flowering by 5–24 days depending on treatment and seasonal rainfall. Thermal time to flowering in the agroforestry system doubled from 600 to 1200 °C day as rainfall decreased. Photosynthetic and transpiration rates for understorey maize were similar to the 25 and 50% shade treatments when rainfall was high, but were ca. 10% of those for unshaded sole maize in dry seasons. PPFD-saturated photosynthetic rate was initially similar in all treatments but fell sharply in the agroforestry system as the season progressed. Radiation conversion coefficients did not differ between unshaded sole and understorey maize. The results suggest that the ameliorative influence of tree shade was greater in low rainfall seasons, as in savannah systems, but that potential benefits were outweighed by below-ground competition. This may be managed by root-pruning trees. "

Data on livelihood assets were collected from 292 households, which were clustered to test how differences in outcomes (asset building) reflect variations in initial asset endowments. The results suggest that most households built particular elements of their asset base and increased their resilience to future shocks. However, households struggled to make effective use of the gains for intensifying their livelihoods. Of the least-endowed households, few made investments in the scale or productivity of coffee, and most continued to depend heavily on subsistence production and seasonal off-farm income for survival. In conclusion, improved market access alone, even under relatively favorable market conditions and with considerable external support, will have uncertain impacts on rural poverty if the underlying constraints on household assets and investments are not addressed concurrently.

In China, the unclear distinction between natural forest and commercial plantations has permitted the expansion of rubber into protected forest areas of nature reserves. However, the impact of such land-use changes on landscape carbon balances within nature reserves has rarely been investigated. We selected the Naban River Watershed National Nature Reserve (NRWNNR) in Xishuangbanna, China as a case study area and evaluated carbon stocks using the Rapid Carbon Stock Appraisal (RaCSA) method based on tree, plot, land use and landscape assessments, integrating field sampling with remote sensing and \{GIS\} technology. Six dominant land use systems were surveyed: lowland forest (&lt;800 m above sea level), highland forest (&gt;800 m a.s.l.), lowland rubber, highland rubber, bush and grassland and agricultural crops. Land use type-specific time-averaged carbon stocks (Cta) were calculated based on total above ground biomass (AGB). Soil organic carbon (surface 30 cm) and below ground biomass were measured, but not included in Cta calculations due to large uncertainties unrelated to land use change. The Cta of lowland and highland rubber plantations were 58 Mg C ha−1 and 28 Mg C ha−1 respectively, showing larger carbon sequestration potential than nonforest land use types (agricultural crops, bush and grassland) but much lower than Cta of natural forest (156–185 Mg C ha−1). Sensitivity analysis of Cta variability showed that forest C stocks have the largest influence on landscape carbon balance. Time series analysis of land-use and land-cover maps (1989, 2007, 2012) demonstrated that during 23 years, the whole landscape of the nature reserve (26,574 ha) gained 0.644 Tg C. Despite rubber expansion, biosphere zoning strategy (i.e. experimental, buffer, core zones), and reforestation activities conducted in \{NRWNNR\} were able to enhance the carbon stocks. "

Value depends on managing both the diversity of tree species present in landscapes and the genetic variation within these species. The benefits from trees and their genetic resources are, however, often not well quantified because trade is frequently outside formal markets, there is a multiplicity of species and ways in which trees are used and managed, and genetic diversity within species is frequently not given proper consideration. We review here what is known about the value of trees to rural communities through considering three production categories: non-timber products harvested from trees in natural and managed forests and woodlands; the various products and services obtained from a wide range of trees planted and/or retained in smallholders’ agroforestry systems; and the commercial products harvested from cultivated tree commodity crops. Where possible, we focus on the role of intra-specific genetic variation in providing support to livelihoods, and for each of the three production categories we also consider wider conservation and sustainability issues, including the linkages between categories in terms of management. Challenges to ‘conventional wisdom’ on tree resource use, value and management – such as in the posited links between commercialisation, cultivation and conservation – are highlighted, and constraints and opportunities to maintain and enhance value are described.

Although heritabilities for height were too low for cross-site selection, sufficient heritability ( h I 2 = 0.26 ), additive genetic coefficients of variation (AGCV = 22%), and type B genetic correlations (rb(f) = 0.74) for \{RHGR\} across the two sites with poorer growth indicated that this trait might be used as a surrogate.

We compared Karen and Lawa knowledge of medicinal plants in the Mae Cheam watershed of northern Thailand, where both ethnic groups have settled and share ecological conditions for resource extraction. We were interested in documenting the degree to which these two ethnic groups use the same or different medicinal plant species. The use of the same plant species by the two groups was considered a sign of uniform and cross-cultural local knowledge, whereas the use of different medicinal plants by each group was considered a sign of culturally specific local knowledge that developed within each ethnic group. Materials and methods We inventoried the plant species in different habitats around one Karen village and one Lawa village using stratified vegetation plots and using semi-structured questionnaires we interviewed 67 key informants regarding their use of plants for medicine. We then calculated the Fidelity level \{FL\} (FL values near 100% for a species indicate that almost all use reports refer to the same way of using the species, whereas low \{FL\} values indicate that a species is used for many different purposes) and cultural importance index \{CI\} (the sum of the proportion of informants that mention each of the use categories for a given species) to estimate the variation in medicinal plant use. We used Jaccard's Index \{JI\} (This index relates the number of shared species to the total number of species) to analyze the similarity of medicinal plant use between the two villages. Results A total of 103 species of medicinal plant species in 87 genera and 41 families were identified and they were used to cure 35 ailments. The \{FL\} of the medicinal plant species varied from 10% to 100%, was different for each ailment, and differed between the two ethnic groups. The most important medicinal plant species, those with the highest \{CI\} value, were not the same in the two villages. Costus speciosus, which is used to treat urinary infections and wounds in animals, had the highest \{CI\} value in the Karen village, whereas Sambucus javanica, which is used to treat wounds, fractures, bloat, and edema in humans, had the highest \{CI\} value in the Lawa village. Only 17 medicinal species (16.5%) were shared between the two villages. Methods of preparation and application were significantly different between the two villages, whereas the plant parts used, habit, and route of administration were similar. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that ethnic groups that live in the same geographic area can have significantly different traditional knowledge systems for medicinal plants, at least when it comes to the species used and their preparation and medicinal application. We assume that differences in cultural history and background in the two villages led to differences in medicinal plant use, preparation, and application. "

In Cameroon, commercial exploitation of most \{NTFP\} is regulated by a permit system. However a majority of traders who sell these products do not have the necessary permits. The objective of this paper is to assess and use transactions costs economics (TCs) to explain why traders in Cameroon do not comply with regulations on permits. Results show that the process to obtain permits may require more than 26,000 \{USD\} and may require regular monitoring during a time span of more than 4 years. Analyses of traders' perceptions illustrate that the major sources of high \{TCs\} in the forest sector are the perceived complex administrative procedures and information asymmetry on procedures and the requirements to obtain permits. The study concludes that it is the impracticality to abide to high \{TCs\} rather than the inclination to disobey the law that pushes traders to operate without permits. "

This paper synthesizes 133 papers from China on the impacts of land use conversion and improved management practices on soil organic carbon (SOC) in China's grasslands. The synthesis finds that overgrazing and conversion of freely grazed grassland to cropland lead to an annual average decline of 2.3–2.8% in SOC, and have caused a loss of 30–35% of total grassland \{SOC\} in China. Improved management practices may reverse the loss of SOC. Exclosure of degraded grassland from grazing and conversion of cropland to abandoned fields (i.e. natural restoration) increased carbon content by 34% and 62% on average. Carbon sequestration rates were greatest during the first 30 yr after treatments began and tended to be greatest in the top 10 cm of soil. Carbon sequestration potential was negatively related to initial carbon and nitrogen concentrations in soils. Exclosure from grazing and the conversion of cropland to abandoned fields resulted in average carbon sequestration rates of 130.4 g C m−2 yr−1 for 0–40 cm soil and 128.0 g C m−2 yr−1 for 0–30 cm soil, representing annual average increases of 5.4–6.3%. Based on our results, achievement of the national objective to exclude grazing livestock from 150 million ha of China's grasslands and to establish 30 million ha of cultivated pasture by 2020 would sequester over 0.24 Pg C yr−1, which is equivalent to about 16% of fossil fuel \{CO2\} emissions in China in 2006.

This study evaluated the environmental impact of rotational grass/clover ley for anaerobic digestion in a cereal-dominated grain production system in Sweden. Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was used to compare two scenarios: (i) a cropping system including only spring barley and winter wheat; and (ii) a cropping system including 2-year grass/clover ley in combination with spring barley and winter wheat. The functional unit was one tonne of grain. The two main functions of the grass/clover crop were to provide feedstock for biogas production and to act as an organic fertiliser for allocation among the cereal crops in the rotation. Special consideration was given to nitrogen (N) management and the rotational effects of the grass/clover ley. In total, 73% of the N requirement of cereals in the ley scenario was met through symbiotic N fixation. Replacing diesel with biogas and mineral fertiliser with digested grass/clover biomass (digestate) reduced the use of fossil fuels substantially, from 1480 \{MJ\} per tonne in the reference scenario to −2900 \{MJ\} per tonne in the ley scenario. Potential eutrophication per tonne grain increased in the ley scenario, mainly owing to significantly higher ammonia emissions from spreading digestate and the larger area required for producing the same amount of grain. Potential acidification also increased when N mineral fertiliser was replaced by digestate. Crops relying on symbiotic N fixation are a promising feedstock for reducing the use of non-renewable energy in the production chain of farm-based bioenergy, but careful handling of the N-rich digestate is required. Replacing cereals intended for feed or food with bioenergy crops leads to indirect land use changes (iLUC) when the displaced crops must be produced elsewhere and the benefits obtained when biofuels replace fossil fuels may thereby be outweighed. In this study, the iLUC factor assumed had a critical effect on global warming potential in the ley scenario. However, carbon sequestration and the higher yield potential of subsequent cereal crops can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from iLUC to a varying extent. We recommend that crop sequences rather than single crops be considered when evaluating the environmental impact of production systems that include perennial legumes for food, feed and bioenergy. "

Discussions and interviews were held with 126 key-informants (56 males and 70 females) ranging in age from 16 to 80 years in three age groups (age 16–40, 41–60, and 61–80). We calculated the informant consensus factor (ICF) for use category, use value index (UV) for use report of plant. We tested differences between the knowledge of different age groups and locations using principal component analysis (PCA). Results These Tai Yai people used of 141 medicinal plants belonging to 59 families. Of the medicinal plant species, the highest percentage was in the family Euphorbiaceae: Croton acutifolius and Croton roxburghii. The highest number of Informant consensus factor was for metabolic system disorders. Overall, Tai Yai people use medicinal plants to cure many sicknesses such as hypertension, lumbago, wounds, puerperium, kidney disorders, kidney stones, coughs, fevers, hemorrhoids, flatulence and malaria. There were no significant differences in knowledge of plants usage among villages of different ages. In addition, the knowledge of the plants was not significantly different between men and women. However, we found that the younger had less experience with and knowledge of medicinal plants than older people. Conclusions The result indicates loss of accumulated knowledge of medicinal plants and traditional use. Although, the medicinal plant knowledge was passed from one generation to the next by word of mouth, the detailed documentation of medicinal plants and their use may effectively prevent the knowledge-loss through time.

These trees are important sources of nutrients and income to thousands of farmers. However data on farmers’ perceptions and behaviour towards such policy instruments are scarce and contradictory. Based on data collected from 394 households in Cameroon, using a structured questionnaire, farmers’ awareness, perception and willingness to accept policy instruments governing on-farm trees were assessed. The study further investigated whether the policy instruments would affect their intentions to plant selected indigenous fruit trees on their farms. The analysis found that a majority of farmers are unaware of the laws governing access and trade in indigenous fruit tree species. Furthermore, even if strictly applied, a significant majority of farmers (60%) would not be discouraged by the regulations, from planting trees on their farms because it constitutes part of their traditional farming practices. Yet, the authors argue that planting of indigenous fruit tree species could increase under simplified rules, as 40% of the farmers do claim they would refuse to plant such trees if existing regulations are strictly enforced. The study therefore concludes that there is a need for new policies to attract more farmers to integrate indigenous fruit trees on their farms. Given the current trend to encourage on-farm tree planting to address food security and climate change issues, this is especially relevant. "

We collected diverse biophysical data to allow spatial variability of soil organic carbon and factors contributing to this variation to be determined statistically, and used well established simulation models to interpret the data, predict long-term carbon dynamics and determine the potential for improvements in soil quality and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. The spatial variation in soil organic carbon in the 0–20 cm soil depth was significant across study areas (P &lt; 0.01, 21.6 g kg−1–37.8 g kg−1), and between land-uses (P &lt; 0.05, 27.9 g kg−1 in cropland and 43.0 g kg−1 soil in forestland). In a multiple linear regression model, among the 11 explanatory variables used, four (total nitrogen, shrubs, trees and land use) showed a significant positive effect (P &lt; 0.01), while three (impact of grazing, impact of erosion and clay) showed a significant negative effect (P &lt; 0.01). Simulations using the assumption of steady state to estimate carbon dynamics suggested that plant inputs from croplands are generally lower than grass or shrublands, resulting in build-up of recalcitrant organic matter in shrublands compared to grass or croplands. Erosion results in a decline in both the absolute and relative amounts of carbon in recalcitrant pools, but the more active pools remained unchanged, meaning that the overall activity of soil organic matter is increased when the soil is eroded, and it becomes more difficult to sequester soil carbon. More rapid decrease in soil organic carbon is likely to be due to increased erosion, persistent removal of organic materials, grazing pressures, and higher rate of decompositions in cropland and grazing land-uses. Conversion to shrubland shows high potential to quickly restore eroded soils and build up a pool of recalcitrant soil carbon, suggesting that management of land using periodic 20 year exclosures, preventing cropping and grazing and allowing shrubland succession, could be beneficial in restoring degraded soils. Simulations using a calibration approach, rather than assuming steady state, corroborated these findings, suggesting that after 30 years of current management, croplands will deplete soil organic carbon by 5.6, 7.1 and 7.2 t ha−1, and grasslands by 3.5, 3.9 and 2.7 t ha−1, while shrublands will build-up soil organic carbon by 0.6, 0.1 and 1.3 t ha−1 at study sites. At one study site, forests, will further increase soil organic carbon by 6.7 t ha−1 after 30 years. The significant positive impact of shrubs and trees on soil organic carbon suggests the need to focus on introduction of agroforestry systems in crop and grasslands. "

Inefficient cooking techniques consume large amounts of fuel and create indoor pollution, with negative health impacts particularly among women and small children. Efficient cooking stoves can potentially save fuel and reduce the health risks of smoke in the kitchen. This study compared the ease of use, energy consumption, fuel use efficiency and gas and particle emissions of a small-scale gasifier cooking stove with that of a traditional three-stone stove and an improved Hifadhi stove in a smallholder farming setting in Kenya. This was done by participatory evaluation of these cooking techniques by women on smallholder farms, assessing fuel consumption, time used in cooking and indoor air concentrations of carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter. It was found that compared with traditional and improved cooking stoves, the gasifier domestic cooking system saved 27–40% of fuel, reduced cooking time by 19–23% and reduced emissions by 40–90%. Thus the gasifier system has potential to alleviate energy and time poverty among small-scale farmers, while improving kitchen air quality. These new findings can assist in development of cleaner biomass cooking technologies in developing countries. Women who cooked using the gasifier preferred it to current cooking practices due to perceived benefits. Thus the gasifier is appropriate for rural areas; it constitutes a cleaner cooking system that saves fuel, produces charcoal for another round of cooking, cooks rapidly, and reduces indoor air pollution from cooking with biomass fuel. However, there is a need to improve the design to make it more stable and safer. "

The loss of forests greatly affects biodiversity and ecosystem services. This paper assesses the economic return from increasing tree cover in agricultural landscapes in two tropical locations, West Java, Indonesia and eastern Bangladesh. Agroforestry systems are compared with subsistence seasonal food-crop-based agricultural systems. Data were collected through rapid rural appraisal, field observation, focus groups and semi-structured interviews of farm households. The inclusion of agroforestry tree crops in seasonal agriculture improved the systems’ overall economic performance (net present value), even when it reduced understorey crop production. However, seasonal agriculture has higher income per unit of land area used for crop cultivation compared with the tree establishment and development phase of agroforestry farms. Thus, there is a trade-off between short-term loss of agricultural income and longer-term economic gain from planting trees in farmland. For resource-poor farmers to implement this change, institutional support is needed to improve their knowledge and skills with this unfamiliar form of land management, sufficient capital for the initial investment, and an increase in the security of land tenure.

However, in the (sub)humid tropics, on P-fixing Oxisols/Ferralsols small decreases in soil water content caused a decrease in P-transport to roots and therewith a soil-drying induced P-deficiency. The aim of this study was to assess the spatial distribution of soil water content in crop fields bordering tree lines and its relation with root length density distribution of the trees throughout the soil profile. To achieve this, soil water content and tree root length densities throughout the soil profile were measured over a period of 2 years in an experiment with lines of four tree species in the middle of maize fields in sub-humid western Kenya. Soil water content was significantly reduced (2–7 vol.%) near two of the three fast-growing tree species, Eucalyptus grandis and Grevillea robusta, but not near Cedrella serrata and the slower growing Markhamia lutea. These differences were related to differences in water use. Eucalyptus and Grevillea showed high water use and Cedrella and Markhamia low water use. However, soil water content distribution was not related to root length density distribution. Root length densities hardly decreased with distance to Grevillea and clearly decreased with distance to Cedrella. Most water-uptake models, including those of agroforestry models, assume that root length density distribution throughout the profile is proportional to water extraction throughout the profile. The absence of a clear relation between root length density and water extraction near Grevillea tree lines opposed this view. It can be explained by a decrease in water-potential gradient between root and soil at increasing distance from the tree base. If the change in root length density is similar or smaller than the change in water-potential gradient between root and soil, the decrease in water-potential gradient between root and soil is of similar or larger importance for determining tree-water extraction distribution throughout the profile than root length density. Thus, modeling of spatial agroforestry systems cannot assume a direct relation between tree-water extraction and root length density, but needs to include decreasing water-potential gradient between root and soil along roots with increasing distance to the stem base, especially over the horizontal dimension.

The species generally grows in the wild and very little efforts have been made to domesticate it. As part of a prioritization exercise a field survey was undertaken to quantify, at the farm-level, the economic importance of the species. Uses, management and farmers' improvement objectives were also identified. The results of the survey indicate that Irvingia gabonensis is propagated rather by transplanting wildings than by planting of seedlings and is found mostly in tree crop fields (e.g. cocoa and coffee). The kernel or seed is highly traded and is also transformed into a paste which is used in the preparation of sauces. Irvingia wood is used for timber, its dead branches for firewood and the bark is used as medicine.

abstract = "Novel approaches involving a combination of sap flow measurements of transpiration and allometric estimates of biomass production were used to determine seasonal water use by trees and crops in agroforestry systems. The results were used to test the hypothesis that agroforestry may improve productivity by capturing a greater proportion of annual rainfall than annual crops. Grevillea robusta A. Cunn., which is reputed to have a deep rooting habit, was grown in semi-arid Kenya either as sole stands or in combination with maize (Zea mays L.). Water use by individual trees and maize plants was determined using constant temperature heat balance gauges and scaled to provide stand-level estimates of transpiration based on linear relationships (r2&gt;0.70) between sap flow and leaf area across a range of tree ages and environmental conditions. Maximum stand-level transpiration rates for grevillea ranged from 2.6 to 4.0 mm per day, consistent with previous studies in similar environments. Biomass production by grevillea was closely correlated with stand-level transpiration (r2&gt;0.69–0.74), suggesting that non-destructive estimates of biomass increments can be used to provide reliable estimates of seasonal transpiration. Cumulative water use by grevillea over the 4.5-year observation period was comparable in the sole tree and agroforestry treatments, reaching a maximum utilisation of annual rainfall of 64–68% 3–4 years after planting. Approximately 25% of the water transpired by the trees was used during the dry season, indicating that they were able to utilise off-season rainfall, comprising 16% of the total annual rainfall, and residual water remaining in the soil profile after the cropping period. During the 1995 long rains, when 221 mm of rain was received, transpiration by sole maize was &lt;50% of precipitation, compared to ca. 85% by the trees in the sole grevillea and agroforestry treatments. These results confirm that agroforestry systems may greatly increase rainfall utilisation compared to annual cropping systems. However, careful consideration of the tradeoffs between the loss of crop production and the additional value provided by tree products is essential. "

Short-duration planted tree fallows have been considered as a solution to overcome the problems of the traditional land use system and increase crop production and income. An experiment was conducted at Yurimaguas evaluating planted tree fallows of inga (Inga edulis) and colubrina (Colubrina glandulosa), with and without centrosema (Centrosema macrocarpum) cover, compared with the traditional bush fallow and herbaceous centrosema cover crop in terms of weed suppression, their ability to increase subsequent crop production and overall economic benefits. The fallow vegetation was cleared and burnt after 3 years of growth for cropping. Maize, cowpea, and rice were grown in the three subsequent seasons. The planted trees grew faster and accumulated more biomass than those in natural fallow. Centrosema as a pure cover crop as well as an understorey between trees effectively suppressed weeds. The tree fallows with or without centrosema did not increase crop yields compared with natural fallow and resulted in significantly lower yields in the third post-fallow season. Only pure centrosema significantly increased maize yields in the first season after its harvest compared with natural fallow. Utilizing very conservative price and production parameters for the improved fallow systems, the inga and inga + centrosema systems had the highest net present values (NPV) of \{USD\} 509 and 392 ha−1, respectively. However, natural fallow had the highest benefit/cost ratio of 1.5, due to its lower costs relative to the more intensive fallow systems. All other fallows had lower benefit/cost ratios. Using the sensitivity analysis of \{NPV\} and returns to labor under more optimistic conditions in a graduated manner, the \{NPV\} for the two systems with colubrina (poles) increased to \{USD\} 1421 and 1782, with higher labor returns. Planted fallows with economically valuable trees such as inga and colubrina have the potential to raise farmers’ income and alleviate degradation of natural resources in the humid tropics of Peru, but they require more extensive testing under a range of biophysical and socio-economic conditions.

Soil samples were taken from short-term natural fallows (&lt;3 years), old natural fallows (&gt;20 years), maize/beans cultivated fields and improved fallows with Crotalaria grahamiana, Sesbania sesban and Tephrosia vogelii. The Shannon diversity index and evenness were used to assess nematode diversity in the different cropping systems. The relationships between plant-parasitic nematodes and the soil physico-chemical properties were investigated with principal component analysis and co-inertia analysis. Planting trees/shrubs as improved fallows in croplands dramatically increased the populations of nematodes in the soil. However, the diversity of plant-parasitic nematodes was reduced. The distribution of plant-parasitic nematodes was correlated with that of some soil physical and chemical properties. Scutellonema spp. were dominant in the improved fallows where the highest values of magnesium and potassium were recorded. The plant-parasitic Dorylaimida (Xiphinema spp. and Paratrichodorus minor) were more abundant in the maize/beans plots and this abundance seemed related to high soil bulk density. Meloidogyne spp. and Rotylenchulus borealis had a strong positive correlation with soil organic matter and clay, and were abundant in the long-term natural fallows. The correlations between soil physico-chemical properties and nematodes indicate that, apart from the direct influence of the host plant, the soil characteristics play an important role in the abundance, distribution and structure of nematode communities. This validates the potential of nematodes as bio-indicator organisms of soil status. "

Maize crop (MM604) was grown after fallow period at 0, 37, 74 and 112 kg N ha−1 to evaluate the effects of nitrogen (N) and fallow on grain yield. There were no significant differences between the two provenances of S. sesban. Wood biomass after 1, 2 and 3 years fallow at close spacing was 8.3, 17.6 and 21.4 t ha−1 for the Kakamega provenance and 10.8, 14.5 and 21.2 t ha−1 for the Chipata provenance. Litter fall in both provenances ranged from 0.6 t ha−1 in June to 0.01 t ha−1 in November. Stand mortality increased with plant density and fallow years: 27% in the first year and about 90% by the end of the third year. Weed biomass ranged from 6.8 t ha−1 to 6.0 t ha−1 at close and wide spacing respectively. Maize grain yield without N was 2.27, 5.59 and 6.02 t ha−1 after 1, 2 and 3 years fallow respectively compared with the control plots with 1.6, 1.2. 1.8 t ha−1 after 1, 2 and 3 years of continuous cropping. Even with addition of 112 kg N ha−1, yield in the control plots declined from 6.09 to 4.88 and 4.28 t ha−1 after 1, 2 and 3 years of continuous cropping. In the planted fallows at 112 kg N ha−1, maize yield increased from 6.75 to 7.16 and 7.57 t ha−1 following 1, 2 and 3 years fallow. It is concluded that short fallow rotations of 1–3 years using S. sesban have a potential in increasing maize yield even without fertilizers. Thus, increasing the fallow period decreases the effectiveness of inorganic fertilizers but increases grain yield for low fertilizer input. "

Objectives were to investigate the effects of energy overfeeding on expression profile of genes associated with inflammation, lipid metabolism, and neutrophil function, in 12 multiparous Holstein cows (n = 6/dietary group) fed control [CON, 1.34 Mcal/kg of dry matter (DM)] or higher-energy (HE, 1.62 Mcal/kg of DM) diets during the last 45 d of pregnancy. Blood was collected to evaluate 43 genes in polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes (PMNL) isolated at −14, 7, and 14 d relative to parturition. We detected greater expression of inflammatory-related cytokines (IL1B, STAT3, NFKB1) and eicosanoid synthesis (ALOX5AP and PLA2G4A) in \{HE\} cows than in \{CON\} cows. Around parturition, all cows had a close balance in mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory \{IL1B\} and the anti-inflammatory IL10, with greater expression of both in cows fed \{HE\} than CON. The expression of CCL2, LEPR, TLR4, IL6, and \{LTC4S\} was undetectable. Cows in the \{HE\} group had greater expression of genes involved in \{PMNL\} adhesion, motility, migration, and phagocytosis, which was similar to expression of genes related to the pro-inflammatory cytokine. This response suggests that \{HE\} cows experienced a chronic state of inflammation. The greater expression of \{G6PD\} in \{HE\} cows could have been associated with the greater plasma insulin, which would have diverted glucose to other tissues. Cows fed the \{HE\} diet also had greater expression of transcription factors involved in metabolism of long-chain fatty acids (PPARD, RXRA), suggesting that immune cells might be predisposed to use endogenous ligands such as nonesterified fatty acids available in the circulation when glucose is in high demand for milk synthesis. The lower overall expression of \{SLC2A1\} postpartum than prepartum supports this suggestion. Targeting interleukin-1β signaling might be of value in terms of controlling the inflammatory response around calving. The present study revealed that overfeeding cows during late pregnancy results in activation, ahead of parturition, of \{PMNL\} responses associated with stress and inflammation. These adaptations observed in \{PMNL\} did not seem to be detrimental for production. "

Rainfall erosivity, or the R-factor based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), indicates the potential water erosion risk and it plays an important role in water and soil conservation assessments. However, calculation of the R-factor requires high resolution data series, and thus we present an alternative model that can be used to accurately calculate the R-factor. Our erosivity model uses daily rainfall with advised regression parameters to estimate the R-factor in the watershed, which was selected by comparing the actual R-factor with 10 min high resolution rainfall data and the estimated R-factor with daily rainfall data from 1998 to 2002. The mean annual R-factor map was derived in the study using cokriging. The annual R-factor in the Kejie watershed was classified as medium and medium-strong erosivity, with a mean value of 3264 MJ.mm.ha− 1.h− 1.yr− 1 which represented a range from 2505 to 5538 MJ.mm.ha− 1.h− 1.yr− 1. A simple power relation between annual R-factor and annual rainfall was derived. The long-term change trend analysis showed no significant increasing or decreasing trend observed for the region; however, there was a significant increasing trend observed in two stations in September, one station in March. The annual R-factor with a coefficient of variation of 0.30 indicated inter-annual variation of the R-factor in the watershed was not so apparent. The intra-annual R-factor analysis illustrated the apparent seasonal and monthly distribution, about 65% from the summer season, and the maximum monthly R-factor occurring in July, followed by August and June. Consequently, the adjusted daily model can be applied in this Himalayan mountain area when high-resolution rainfall data is unavailable. The R-factor map and the simple power relation provided a useful tool for land-use planner and agriculture management in the Kejie watershed. "

Unfortunately, very little is known about the distribution of this species in Nepal, despite it being endemic to the Trans-Himalayas. In the earlier collections it was mis-identified as another very common Nyctaginaceae species Boerhavia diffusa L. We used species distribution modelling technique to determine the climate space of these two species. We used an \{SDM\} ensemble method in the BiodiversityR R-package to identified the bioclimatic variable that defines the climate space for B. diffusa and O. himalaicus. Species distributions were modelled using a subset of least correlated variables from bioclimatic data and elevation dataset. The most favourable conditions for B. diffusa were centrally located at well-drained and hot lowlands of Nepal whereas that of O. himalaicus was located in highlands valleys. Discontinuities in suitable climatic conditions coincided with biogeographical barriers associated with topographic transitions. The rising slope of mountains limit the climatic suitability of B. diffusa particularly due to low temperature and high aridity, whereas this condition was suitable for O. himalaicus. But presence of high Himalayas fragmented the suitable climatic condition for this species. We speculate that historic climatic changes associated with changes in the geology of the Himalayas, formed by tectonic forces and sculpted by weathering and erosion, are responsible for the fragmentation of habitat of this species. The extensive study of such a species could provide insight into the history of species colonization in the Himalayas, as well as the potential distribution of Himalayan species. "

The planting of trees in these monoculture systems is one way to improve soil nutrition and biodiversity. Therefore, the objective was how planting the N-fixing tree Alnus nepalensis (7 years old), into monoculture tea (Camellia sinensis var., assamica) plantations (32 years old), influences the soil fungal and bacterial communities, and how this impacts on tea productivity. Soil samples (0–15, 15–30, 30–60 cm depths) were collected from plantations of monoculture tea and tea interplanted with A. nepalensis trees. The samples were analyzed for basic soil properties and nutrients. Phospholipid fatty-acid analyses were conducted on the soil samples to determine the microbial functional groups and biomass of bacterial and fungal communities. Biomass of soil fungi and bacteria were 41% and 10% higher in the tea + A. nepalensis sites than in the tea monoculture sites, respectively. These higher levels were recorded despite there being no changes in the diversity of the soil fungi and bacteria, or the soil nutrition, between the different sites. Tea productivity increased between 52% and 72%, and is attributed to the increases in the soil community biomass. Ectomycorrhizal biomass, as well as Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and actinomycetes bacterial biomass, all increased ranging from 10% to 83%. These groups of organisms have been shown to contain plant growth promoting characteristics, contributing toward increased crop productivity. We provide clear evidence that A. nepalensis in tea plantations promotes the growth and development of the soil microbial communities and that this impacts on above ground productivity. This study highlights the benefits of introducing N-fixing tree species, such as A. nepalensis, into monoculture systems, and how this relates to soil health and harvest yield. "

A field study was conducted in western Kenya for 2 yr, comparing direct seeding of sesbania with transplanting of bare-rooted seedlings in pure stands, with and without nematicide application in the field and in the nursery. In moist conditions, neither planting method nor nematicide had any influence on seedling survival and early growth. When early season rainfall was low and erratic, transplanted seedlings survived and grew better than seedlings from direct sowing, and nematicide application in the field and/or nursery improved seedling survival. Direct seeded sesbania had significantly less nematode galling and smaller nematode populations in the roots than transplanted sesbania. Both the establishment methods produced similar quantities of biomass, but direct seeded sesbania produced significantly greater biomass than the transplanted crop, if seedlings were already infected with nematodes in the nursery. Nematode infection on average reduced total sesbania biomass by 19%. Where sesbania cover crops have to be established by transplanting for socio-economic reasons, it is essential to use healthy seedlings free from nematodes for a good plant stand and early growth. Nematode-free seedlings can be produced on farms by at least one month of solarization of seedbeds. Neither field establishment method, nor nematicide application altered the soil nematode populations over a 12-month period. This means that the potential threat of increased Meloidogyne populations to nematode-susceptible crops following sesbania cover crops remains the same irrespective of how sesbania is established. "

Known by different names in various places, these agroforestry systems are common in all ecological regions of the tropics and subtropics, especially in humid lowlands with high population density. An analysis of the structural and functional aspects of ten selected homegarden systems from different ecological and geographical regions shows that the average size of the homegarden units is less than 0·5 ha; yet they are composed of a large number of woody and herbaceous species, carefully structured to form 3–5 vertical canopy strata, with each component having a specific place, as well as function. Food production is the primary function of most homegardens, the vast majority of them being subsistence production systems. While there is a remarkable similarity among the different homegardens with respect to the type and nature of the herbaceous crops, the nature of woody perennials varies, depending on environmental and ecological factors. In general, most woody components produce fruits or other types of food in addition to other outputs such as fuelwood, timber, etc. These various food products provide a substantial proportion of nutritive and energy requirements of the local diet. Moreover, the species diversity and varying production cycles of the different components ensure continuous production throughout the year from the homegarden unit. Little or no research has been done to improve homegarden systems. Structural complexity, species diversity, multiple output nature, tremendous variability from farm to farm, etc., are some of the main characteristics that make the homegardens extremely difficult models to work with according to the currently available research procedures.

abstract = "While tropical multistrata home gardens (or tree home gardens) are classically said to be sound, efficient and sustainable land-use systems, there is little quantitative evidence and detailed analysis of home gardens in the literature to support this. In order to strengthen the basis of this assumption and to contribute to an operational understanding of sustainability, a literature review was applied to home gardens, covering different bio-physical and socio-economic conditions. For this, a series of sustainability descriptors were identified, hypothesis formulated on what should be the effect of home gardens on these descriptors, and possible indicators confirming the hypothesis mentioned, when found in the literature. Home gardens possess a number of sustainability attributes, with regard not only to their ability to meet a number of farmers' needs without negatively affecting the resource base, and in many cases even improving it, but also to their potential to meet several economic, social, ecological and institutional conditions which contribute to their sustainability.

The objective of this research was to identify changes in agricultural practice and landscape in Lampung area in southern Sumatra as this area has undergone the largest changes in land cover of all the provinces of Indonesia over the last 60 years. These changes were characterized using maps from 1930, 1969 and 1985, and a 1996 satellite image to understand the dynamic of the slash-and-burn agriculture over time. In 1930, shifting cultivation was practised along rivers and forest cover was high (77.5%). Between 1969 and 1985 major changes occurred and most of the forest area was reduced to 10%. A massive front of clearing moved from the southwest with the transmigration programme and the development of the agro-industrial plantations. Finally in 1996 there was no more forest and the landscape was shaped by cleared land for small farms in transmigration areas and by large industrial plantations. Settlements have also changed from indigeneous river settlements first to transmigrant street villages and then to marked-out square villages. The present spatial distribution of agro-industrial estates and transmigration areas shows a well organized division called a ‘burger landscape’, as the links between the two areas are strong in both space and time. These changes seen over 60 years in the province of Lampung could prove fruitful when looking at actual agricultural frontiers around the world. "

Using aerial photos and spot satellite image on two nearby but different agroecological zones of the Kenyan highlands, an extensive semi-arid area in the lower zone and a humid area in the upper zone, significant land-use changes were identified between 1958, 1985 and 1995. These land-use changes were observed through a photo-interpretation of photos and image with a common classification scheme. The pattern and the development of land-use change differed markedly over the 40-year period between the upper and the lower zone. The introduction of cash-crops had a significant impact on the land-use in the upper zone. Tree plantations whose lines characterize the present landscape came with the switch to cash-crops. In contrast, although no significant land-use changes occurred between 1958 and 1985 in the lower zone, the changes over the last 10 years were significant, with a 75 % increase in cultivated land area. Part of these land-use changes can be explained by strong links between the two zones, as the lower zone became an outlet for the very high population density of the upper zone. This study is a first step for an in-depth characterization of the various driving forces and for land-use planning in these Kenyan highlands. "

The model, which runs in time units of 1 year, links soil management practices, nutrient availability, plant and livestock productivity, and farm economics A case study is presented of the application of the model to existing, mixed farm systems in Vihiga district, in the highlands of western Kenya. Three representative farm types were developed using participatory techniques to reflect differences in resource endowments and constraints faced by farmers. The model was used to assess the sustainability of the existing systems for the three farm types as a basis for recommending improved practices for each. A summary model for calculating new sustainability indicators of soil productivity is presented. The low (LRE) and medium (MRE) resource endowment farms, which comprise about 90% of the farms in the area, have declining soil organic matter and low productivity and profitability. In contrast, the high resource endowment category of farms (HRE) have increasing soil organic matter, low soil nutrient losses and are productive and profitable. Crop nutrient yields were 17, 19 and 86 kg N ha−1 year−1 on LRE, \{MRE\} and \{HRE\} farms, respectively. Soil C, N and P budgets were negative in \{LRE\} and \{MRE\} but positive in HRE. Farm revenue in \{LRE\} and \{MRE\} was 2–13% of farm revenue in HRE. It comprised 7% of household income in \{LRE\} compared with 25% in \{MRE\} and 63% in HRE. It is concluded that low land and capital resources constrain the adoption of ecologically and economically sustainable soil management practices on the majority of farms in the area. Strategies are needed to (i) increase the value of farm output (ii) increase high quality nutrient inputs at low cash and labour costs to the farmer, and (iii) increase off-farm income. "

Walp.), (3) maize rotated with long-duration legume, pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L. Millsp.), (4) maize intercropped with pigeonpea, (5) hedgerow intercropping of maize and a perennial legume, gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium), and (6) continuous sole maize, green-manured with gliricidia prunings produced from an equivalent area outside the cropped field (‘biomass transfer technology’). Maize–cowpea sequential and pigeonpea/maize intercropping systems produced, respectively, 17 and 24% higher maize yields than continuous sole maize, but maize–pigeonpea rotation yielded only marginally better. Hedgerow intercropping did not increase maize yields because increased yields during the few high rainfall seasons did not compensate the yield losses in other seasons due to the competition of hedgerows for water with crop. Green manuring with gliricidia prunings increased maize production by 27%, but this technology was not economical because of high labour costs for production and application of prunings to the crop. The annual grain legume-based cropping systems were 32–49% more profitable than continuous sole maize, making them attractive to small farmers in semi-arid tropics. Both cowpea and pigeonpea were affected by pests and diseases, which indicated the need for integrated pest management for realising the potential benefits of these legume-based systems. "

Yearly tree growth records collected over a ten-year period in two one-hectare 70-year-old damar agroforest plots in Sumatra are analysed. These agroforests are mixed tree plantations, dominated by Shorea javanica K. &amp; V., a dipterocarp tree cultivated and tapped for its commercially valuable resin (damar). Many indigenous fruit tree species grow in these agroforests, as well as timber tree species originating from the nearby natural forest. During the census period the multi-species stands were subjected to three El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related droughts (1994, 1997 and 2002). At the tree community level, these droughts were associated with a marked decrease in radial stem growth. Multilevel modelling was used to explore the relative contribution of species, tree size and individual tree characteristics to the observed response to drought. All tree species appeared to be sensitive to drought but the amplitude of the response varied significantly across species. Predicted species mean decrease in stem radial growth rate on drought years (i.e. years with 6 months with less than 50 mm/month rainfall) ranged from less than 5% to more than 80%. Shared species were ranked consistently between plots indicating that the results were robust. Stem diameter significantly affected tree sensitivity to drought in two species only, but in opposite ways: in S. javanica, larger trees appeared to be less sensitive while the opposite was true for Lansium domesticum, an abundant fruit tree. Individual tree sensitivity to drought contributed significantly albeit to a small extent to the overall response to drought. This individual tree effect did not show any pattern of spatial correlation and hence could not be related to topographic features. It is likely to reflect the individual's unique history and genotype. "

Farmer-managed trials from 2004 (on 60 farms in 3 districts, no replications, using farmer's maize variety as control) showed good control in two districts, increasing average yield by 0.69 tons/ha. In the third district, the IR-maize and control plots showed similar levels of Striga infestation, probably caused by heavy rains and flooding which can wash off the herbicide. The yield response to IR-maize seed was categorized at two levels. The germplasm effect was estimated at 0.37 tons/ha. The herbicide effect was estimated at 0.13 tons/ha (49 kg/ha for each reduction of the Striga numbers/m2). With maize prices at US$202/ton, seed prices at US$34/ha and herbicide cost at US$4/ha, the overall marginal rate of return (MRR) was 2.4 (good), with an \{MRR\} of 1.9 (respectable) for the germplasm and an \{MRR\} of 5.6 (very good) for the IR-maize technology. Farmers generally appreciated the technology and indicated their willingness to pay (WTP), which was, however, very price-sensitive. The methodology of on-farm work can be improved substantially by including a sufficient number of sites, by measuring compounding factors (soil fertility, Striga seed bank, rainfall), by involving the farmers more (explain the design better, visit more often), by inviting more farmers for the evaluation and by using experimental auctions of IR-maize seed to estimate their \{WTP\} for this new technology.

The objective of this study was to answer a number of methodological questions regarding sampling schemes, sample handling recommendations, and assay procedures to facilitate the use of enzyme assays in the tropical highlands of East Africa. We used para-nitrophenol (pNP) based substrates for five enzymes: β-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, chitinase, acid phosphatase, and alkaline phosphatase. In the first experiment, we examined sampling procedures and compared the results of determining enzyme activities on a plot using composite or discrete samples. Composite samples usually had higher activities than the means of individual cores (P&lt;0.05), but relative ranking of sites was the same if analyses were based on composite or discrete samples. In the second experiment, we examined the effects of storage time and conditions on enzyme activity. Enzyme activity degraded rapidly in frozen samples, but was better maintained in samples stored at 4 °C. Phosphatase and cellobiohydrolase activity declined after 14 days of storage, while the activity of the other enzymes remained close to the values of fresh samples for 28 or more days. In the third experiment, we examined the effect of the addition of an antiseptic, toluene, to prevent bacterial growth during the assay. We found no consistent toluene effect (P&gt;0.4), probably because the assays were of short duration and microbial growth was minimized. Finally, we looked at the incubation time necessary to produce reliable results. Phosphatases, with relatively high activities could reliably be determined in 2 h incubations, but the other enzymes had much lower activities and required longer incubation times for reliable determination. For the enzymes we looked at, 4 h was a good standard time for determining the activity of even the lowest activity enzymes. The results of this study provide practical guidelines for applying these enzyme assays in the degraded tropical soils. "

As Crotalaria spp. are antagonistic to Meloidogyne, and S. sesban and T. vogelii suppress Pratylenchus, a field study was conducted on farms in western Kenya to test whether mixing S. sesban or T. vogelii with C. grahamiana can resolve the nematode problems associated with pure crops of the respective species. The pure and two-species mixed cover crops, grown for 10 or 12 months, were evaluated against natural and bare fallows. Maize (Zea mays) and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) were then intercropped and the plots split to determine the effects of incorporating the biomass of natural fallows/cover crops against its removal on nematode infection of crops. T. vogelii and S. sesban were highly infected by Meloidogyne and their pure crops supported increased populations of this nematode. In mixed systems, C. grahamiana did not affect Meloidogyne infection of S. sesban and T. vogelii, but it significantly reduced the soil nematode populations compared with the respective pure crops. Root-lesion (Pratylenchus zeae, P. thornei and P. pseudopratensis) and spiral nematodes (Helicotylenchus pseudorobustus and Scutellonema brachyurus) were greatest in number following pure C. grahamiana. Mixing C. grahamiana with either S. sesban or T. vogelii did not restrict these nematode populations. Meloidogyne infection of bean following S. sesban+C. grahamiana and T. vogelii+C. grahamiana was restricted and the crop after these mixed systems did not lose yield compared with that after pure S. sesban and T. vogelii. All cover crops, except pure C. grahamiana and its mixture with S. sesban at Yala, increased maize yields compared with natural and bare fallows. In situ decomposition of the foliar biomass of cover crops and natural fallow did not affect nematode infection of both the annual crops. The Meloidogyne problem associated with S. sesban and T. vogelii covers on subsequent annual crops such as bean can be limited by mixing either of these shrubs with C. grahamiana. "

An experiment was conducted in Machakos, Kenya, during November 1989–July 1995 to explore the potential of hedgerow intercropping (HI) with Leucaena leucocephala as an alternative strategy to the use of inorganic fertilizers for improving maize yields in semiarid bimodal highlands. The study, conducted in a randomized block design with three replications, evaluated on an operational scale with four treatments: sole maize with or without fertilizer; and \{HI\} with prunings of L. leucocephala hedges used as green manure or with prunings and maize stover fed to oxen and manure returned to soil. About 1.4 t ha−1 of L. leucocephala foliar biomass and 1.2 t ha−1 manure were incorporated each season in green-manure and ox-manure systems, respectively. Although sole maize responded to inorganic fertilizer in six of 11 seasons, maize yield was improved by HI, with prunings used as green manure, only once, 5 yrs after the commencement of the study, when rainfall exceeded 500 mm. Over the experimental period, maize yields were 15% and 30% less in green-manure and ox-manure systems, respectively, than in unfertilized maize, primarily because of the competition of hedgerows with crops for water. The fodder system of \{HI\} recycled only 27% of N and 50% of P exported from the field in fodder, grain and stover, and depleted nutrients more than the other systems. The green-manure system made a positive N balance, with similar P depletion as in the fodder system. No changes were detected in soil organic carbon or cations in any of the systems during the experimental period while extractable P was significantly improved by fertilizing maize. Net present value of returns from fertilizing maize at 40 kg N and 18 kg P ha−1 was 10% higher than from the unfertilized control. Fertilizer use would be 25% more profitable, however, if P were applied only to match the amount of P removed by crop (9 kg P ha−1 per season) and if maize were not topdressed (amounting to 50% of the recommended N) in poor rainfall seasons. Of the two \{HI\} systems, only the fodder system was more profitable than either system of sole-cropped maize because the high value of fodder more than compensated the smaller maize yield obtained in HI. However, the fodder system may not give higher economic returns than a sole L. leucocephala fodder bank. Hence, \{HI\} using competitive species such as L. leucocephala and with the level of productivity observed in this study, is not appropriate for semiarid climates to increase cereal yields, either directly through green manuring or indirectly by fodder production and nutrient cycling through livestock.

Following 12-month sesbania, the plots were split for nematicide treatment during the cropping phase. Infestations of the root-knot (Meloidogyne spp.), root-lesion (Pratylenchus zeae), reniform (Rotylenchulus variabilis) and spiral (Helicotylenchus spp. and Scutellonema spp.) nematodes were monitored. Although a number of plant species in natural fallows were hosts to both M. incognita and M. javanica, even natural fallows 12 months long did not increase populations of these nematodes to cause any significant yield reduction in the subsequent nematode-susceptible bean. Crotalaria cover crop and continuous maize decreased M. incognita and M. javanica populations but increased P. zeae populations to levels that could limit their growth. Only the 12-month sesbania cover crop increased Meloidogyne populations greatly in soil and roots at the site of light-textured soil. Sesbania itself appeared to be fairly tolerant to the nematode over a 12-month growing period. Maize was not damaged by the root-knot nematodes after sesbania, but bean yield reduced by 52–87% following 12-month sesbania. A one-season interval with maize after sesbania cover was adequate to limit root-knot nematode damage on susceptible bean. Crotalaria can be considered as an alternative cover crop to sesbania where crops susceptible to root-knot nematode are an integral part of the cropping system after fallows. However, there is a need to screen Crotalaria species to identify species that produce large amounts of biomass without increasing Pratylenchus population. Neither cover crops nor natural fallows had any influence on reniform and spiral nematodes, and none of these nematodes affected subsequent crops. "

In the sub-humid highlands the most common form of livestock management is a mixture of grazing, tethering and stall feeding. In the arid and semi-arid lowlands of Kenya the normal livestock management practice is grazing. Leucaena leucocephala was a popular fodder species until it was attacked by the leucaena psyllid (Heteropsylla cubana) to which other species like L. diversifolia, L. esculenta and L. pallida have shown some degree of tolerance. Sesbania spp. showed early promise but did not withstand intensive cutting management. In Kenya, when Calliandra calothyrsus is grown in 4:1 and 1:1 grass-legume combinations the fodder yields are higher than for pure hedgerows. Cutting C. calothyrsus 6 months before the height of the dry season gives maximum yield during that season. For dairy cows 1 kg of concentrates can be successfully replaced by 3 kg of fresh C. calothyrsus. At altitudes above 2300 m supplementation with Mimosa scabrella enabled local goats to gain 50 g day−1 compared with 31 g day−1 for grass alone. In Kenya a survey was conducted of farmers' practices and knowledge of indigenous fodder trees. Some identified popular species were Commiphora zimmermanii, Triumfetta spp., Tithonia diversifolia, Melia volkensii and Crotalaria goodiiformis. Both indigenous and exotic tree species are being fed to cattle to determine the exact parts that are consumed and to assess their nutritive value. Further research is needed on inclusion levels of tree fodder in diets, optimal management of fodder trees in the dry land farming systems and anti-nutritive factors in some tree species. "

When shifting from plantation forestry to mixed forestry or multi-species agroforestry systems, however, short-cuts to the empirical approach for establishing such equations are desirable. Fractal branching models provide a transparent scheme for deriving tree-specific scaling rules (especially, the b parameter) on the basis of easily observable, non-destructive methods. The relation between link (section of stem or branch between two branching points) length and link diameter has a direct influence on the b parameter of the allometric equation in the range 2–3.5, providing substantial variation around the claims of a universal value of 8/3. Apart from the total tree biomass, the models can provide rules for total leaf area; relative allocation of current growth to leaves, branches or stem. The power of the allometric scaling relation (b) necessarily has the same value, for a given tree, for all properties that are dominated by the endpoints of the branching process, and that are thus ‘additive’. Below ground, similar descriptions hold for individual root axes, where the proximal root diameter can be used for predicting total length or biomass of all its branches. Sampling error was analyzed to derive rules for the number of branching points that should be observed for reliable estimates of the fractal branching parameters. For the inherent parameter variability that was chosen as default setting a minimum number of 50 branching points should be observed. A spreadsheet model (functional branch analysis, FBA) is made available through the \{WWW\} that allows users to derive results for new parameter combinations and/or seek new applications. "

Previous models of shifting cultivation or crop-fallow rotations have described the fate of soil fertility and crop productivity for an average plot, as a function of intensity of land use, without explicit consideration of the scaling rules between plot and landscape. Up to medium land use intensities, a negative tradeoff exists between farmers's interest in crop productivity per unit area, and environmental interests in carbon stock and other parameters related to age of the fallow vegetation such as biodiversity. If land use intensity increases beyond a critical point, land will further degrade from a farmer's as well as from environmental perspective. In the Forest, Agroforest, Low-value Lands Or Waste model (‘FALLOW?’) this description is applied at landscape scale to a mosaic of plots, to investigate the transient behavior under non-equilibrium conditions for different land use intensification scenario's. The \{FALLOW\} model is implemented in the \{STELLA\} environment and in the default form keeps track of the soil fertility changes in 100 fields, which may differ in initial fertility and dynamics. During any year in the simulation a number of these fields is cropped, while others are fallowed. During the fallow period aboveground C stocks accumulate and plot-level biodiversity changes in character during the succession from pioneer, via early and late secondary vegetation into ‘primary’ forest. The model user can define the time frames for each of these transitions, as well as determine the degree of species overlap between categories and area-based scaling rules within each category, to derive an indicator of landscape-level biodiversity. The model allows comparisons of spatially segregated as well as integrated solutions to multiple functionality of land use by applying ‘forest reserve’ rules. Depending on the amount of between-plot variation in parameter values, the trade-off between carbon stock and crop productivity can shift by a factor 2, even though both properties are directly related to area. The trade-off between local and external stakeholder interests for a landscape mosaic can thus differ from that derived for a ‘representative landscape element’. "

This study describes traditional practices utilized to protect home gardens from animals, how these practices have evolved over time and examines factors that affect the adoption of live hedges. Informal and formal surveys were undertaken in the study area in 1993. Five types of traditional method for protecting gardens from animals were identified. A logit model integrating technology profitability as an explanatory variable was used to study farmers' decision processes to live hedges adoption. The results indicate that water availability and the profitability of the technology itself enhance the probability of adopting live hedges.

It addresses the question of whether individual private landownership is an appropriate form of tenure within land redistribution programs. It does so by examining the emergence of inequality in access to and control over land and resources from an early stage of the land redistribution process, extending several years after the redistributed land was classified as private property. The research was conducted in two upland sites in Java and Sumatra, inhabited by mixed farming (agroforest) communities, where areas of “state” forest** The term “state” forest is used here to describe the situation where the land that is owned informally by the local community communally or owned informally by a household but claimed one-sided by the Ministry of Forestry (MoF) as state forest, even though the MoF did not follow its own administrative procedures; that is, forest delineation and consensus reached with the local communities regarding the status of the land (Colchester et al., 2003). were transferred to tillers following the 1998 political reforms. Specific cases of public land redistribution have emerged in Indonesia in recent years that differ from those described in the literature on redistributive land reforms, which emphasize redistribution of private land holdings to small and landless farmers. By contrast, the land reform process in Indonesia has entailed redistribution of “state” (forest) land to tillers who, prior to the reform, were cultivating this land using traditional mixed farming methods. In these cases, “state” lands were redistributed to peasants not as an empty space, but rather as land that was already subject to an informal tenure system, and already allocated for long-term lease to forest concessions (state-owned logging concessions and timber plantations) or converted to other large-scale concessions (palm oil plantations and mining concessions). As a part of the conflict resolution process, the land was taken from the state-owned concessions without any compensation and provided to the tillers as individual property in the sense that land could be bought and sold, as well as transferred from one generation to the next.

In this paper the life cycle energy balance, global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential and land use impact on ecosystem quality is evaluated for a small scale, low-input Jatropha biodiesel system established on wasteland in rural India. In addition to the life cycle assessment of the case at hand, the environmental performance of the same system expanded with a biogas installation digesting seed cake was quantified. The environmental impacts were compared to the life cycle impacts of a fossil fuel reference system delivering the same amount of products and functions as the Jatropha biodiesel system under research. The results show that the production and use of Jatropha biodiesel triggers an 82% decrease in non-renewable energy requirement (Net Energy Ratio, \{NER\} = 1.85) and a 55% reduction in global warming potential (GWP) compared to the reference fossil-fuel based system. However, there is an increase in acidification (49%) and eutrophication (430%) from the Jatropha system relative to the reference case. Although adding biogas production to the system boosts the energy efficiency of the system (NER = 3.40), the \{GWP\} reduction would not increase (51%) due to additional \{CH4\} emissions. For the land use impact, Jatropha improved the structural ecosystem quality when planted on wasteland, but reduced the functional ecosystem quality. Fertilizer application (mainly N) is an important contributor to most negative impact categories. Optimizing fertilization, agronomic practices and genetics are the major system improvement options.

This study was concerned with how different dissemination pathways impacted on farmers’ time to adoption while controlling the effects of selected socio-economic and regional factors. This assessment was necessary in order to recommend which dissemination pathway or combination of pathways that could provide an effective dissemination strategy that speed up adoption, while ensuring continued practice of the technology. Data were analyzed using a parametric (Weibull) functional form to specify time to adoption from the first date of a farmer being aware of the technology. The findings indicate positive duration dependence and a positive rate of change in the adoption process. Field days (FD) had the highest effect on the speed of uptake, followed by Farmer Teachers (FT). Other variables that accelerated adoption were education, household size and high-income level. Gender, Tropical Livestock Units (TLUs), group membership, and district dummy variables had delaying effects on the adoption process. The findings suggest the need to fast track the scale up and uptake of \{PPT\} through pathways which allow for interactive information sharing and learning as exemplified through farmer teachers and field days.

By 2008 it became gradually evident that jatropha plantations (both mono- and intercropping) are uneconomical and risky due to competition for land and labour with food crops. Cultivation of jatropha hedges was found to have better chances of economic success and to present only little risks for the adopting farmers. Still, after 2008 a number of farmers went on adopting jatropha in plots rather than as hedges. It is hypothesised that lack of awareness about the low economic prospects of jatropha plantations was the main reason for continued adoption, and that smallholder farmers with higher resource endowments mainly ventured into its cultivation. In this study we provide an empirical basis for understanding the role of households' capital assets in taking up new livelihood strategies by smallholder farmers in three rural districts in Kenya. For that purpose, we assess the motivation and enabling factors that led to the adoption of jatropha as a new livelihood strategy, as well as the context in which promotion and adoption took place. A household survey was conducted in 2010, using a structured questionnaire, to collect information on household characteristics and capital asset endowment. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and non-parametric statistical tests. We established that access to additional income and own energy supply were the main motivation for adoption of jatropha, and that financial capital assets do not necessarily have a positive influence on adoption as hypothesised. Further, we found that the main challenges that adopting farmers faced were lack of access to information on good management practices and lack of a reliable market. We conclude that continued adoption of on-farm jatropha after 2008 is a result of lacking awareness about the low economic value of this production type. We recommend abandoning on-farm production of jatropha until improved seed material and locally adapted agronomic knowledge about jatropha cultivation becomes available and its production becomes economically competitive.

abstract = "Although there has been increasing research on the adoption of agroforestry technologies over the last decade, few such studies have assessed uptake over a long period and many are based on a single snapshot in time. Furthermore, most of these studies have mainly looked at non-adopters and adopters: only recently have social scientists considered testers. A further category of users neglected in adoption studies has been re-adopters of technologies. Studying this group provides an interesting and more nuanced understanding of adoption and re-adoption. Methodologically, most adoption studies use quantitative methods and fail to link their findings to wider socio-economic, political and institutional settings. This paper presents a study of the dynamics of improved tree fallow use by farmers in Siaya and Vihiga districts of western Kenya over a period of eight years. It uses both qualitative and quantitative data to critically discuss the motivations of adopters, testers/rejecters and re-adopters. The results show that the process of adoption is highly dynamic and variable with farmers planting improved fallows and discontinuing or re-adopting them due to a whole range of factors, of which soil fertility improvement is just one. These factors included incentives from projects, the tying of adoption to credit programmes, prestige, participation in seminars/tours and the availability of a seed market from projects promoting improved fallows. Farmers planting improved fallows for such reasons may be termed ‘pseudo-adopters’. There were significant differences in adoption between the two districts, with more farmers in Siaya planting improved fallows than in Vihiga. A majority of farmers in Vihiga (53%) who were given seed never planted improved fallows, even though they had been exposed to the technology. Some 40% of farmers in Siaya and 38% in Vihiga planted improved fallows but later rejected them. This has some important implications for research and development. For improved fallow technologies to be attractive to farmers, they must provide other tangible economic benefits besides soil fertility improvement. This presents a challenge to researchers who must better attune themselves to the needs and demands of farmers if they wish to see their research findings widely adopted. "

This paper applies content analysis of policy documents, semi-structured interviews and case study analysis to examine the interplay between \{REDD\} + rules and Kenyan sectorial policies and local socioeconomic settings. Results reveal that the preparation of national \{REDD\} + strategies in Kenya is usefully coordinated by the Kenyan forestry sector drawing on the sector's policy mandate and past experiences in forest management. This sectoral mainstreaming however degenerates into negative vertical policy interplay caused by poor consultations with key sectors outside the forestry sector e.g. lands and agriculture and is further exacerbated by sectoral competition for climate finance. Analysis of \{REDD\} + coherences with sectoral policies revealed that forest polices on reforestation and decentralisation are coherent with \{REDD\} + rules (horizontal interplay) but this coherence is impeded by limited implementation of these measures e.g. poor support and coordination of Community Forest Associations. Lack of coherence was mainly observed between \{REDD\} + rules and resettlement and agricultural mechanisation policies prescribed in the lands and agriculture policies. Agricultural mechanisation and resettlement policies are synonymous with deforestation especially through illegal and politically motivated agricultural or settlement expansions into Kenya's forest areas. At the local level, \{REDD\} + showed potential to positively influence local livelihoods but the aforementioned national institutional gaps and strict carbon standards and prices lead to negative trade-offs between carbon sequestration and alternative livelihoods. The paper advocates for strong multi-stakeholder consultative mechanism so that both Kenyan policy and socioeconomic settings can support effective \{REDD\} + implementation. "

This paper proposes a categorisation of household diversity based on a functional typology of livelihood strategies, and analyses the influence of such diversity on current soil fertility status and spatial variability on a sample of 250 randomly selected farms from six districts of Kenya and Uganda. In spite of the agro-ecological and socio-economic diversity observed across the region (e.g. 4 months year−1 of food self-sufficiency in Vihiga, Kenya vs. 10 in Tororo, Uganda) consistent patterns of variability were also observed. For example, all the households with less than 3 months year−1 of food self-sufficiency had a land:labour ratio (LLR) &lt; 1, and all those with \{LLR\} &gt; 1 produced enough food to cover their diet for at least 5 months. Households with \{LLR\} &lt; 1 were also those who generated more than 50% of their total income outside the farm. Dependence on off/non-farm income was one of the main factors associated with household diversity. Based on indicators of resource endowment and income strategies and using principal component analysis, farmers’ rankings and cluster analysis the 250 households surveyed were grouped into five farm types: (1) Farms that rely mainly on permanent off-farm employment (from 10 to 28% of the farmers interviewed, according to site); (2) larger, wealthier farms growing cash crops (8–20%); (3) medium resource endowment, food self-sufficient farms (20–38%); (4) medium to low resource endowment relying partly on non-farm activities (18–30%); and (5) poor households with family members employed locally as agricultural labourers by wealthier farmers (13–25%). Due to differential soil management over long periods of time, and to ample diversity in resource endowments (land, livestock, labour) and access to cash, the five farm types exhibited different soil carbon and nutrient stocks (e.g. Type 2 farms had average C, N, P and K stocks that were 2–3 times larger than for Types 4 or 5). In general, soil spatial variability was larger in farms (and sites) with poorer soils and smaller in farms owning livestock. The five farm types identified may be seen as domains to target technological innovations and/or development efforts. "

There are three crucial parameters that must be considered when planning early-season prescribed fires: the ignition probability, the rate of spread of a fire and the amount of fuel consumed. In this study, 231 early-season prescribed fires were conducted in three savanna ecosystems in Senegal in order to characterize these three fundamental parameters. Logistic regression analyses revealed that fuel moisture content and relative humidity are good predictors of ignition probability. Multiple linear regressions were used to investigate the relationships between fire rate of spread, fuel consumption or fire intensity and fuel and weather conditions. Readily usable nomographs for forest managers were created based on those relationships that proved to be significant. Kruskal–Wallis tests performed to compare the observed rates of fire propagation with those predicted using BehavePlus showed no statistically significant difference between them. "

We develop a phenology driven model and train/validate \{MODIS\} (MCD43A4, 500 m) derived metrics with 178 ground observations from Niger, Senegal and Mali to estimate woody cover trends from 2000 to 2014 over the entire Sahel. The annual woody cover estimation at 500 m scale is fairly accurate with an \{RMSE\} of 4.3 (woody cover %) and r2 = 0.74. Over the 15 year period we observed an average increase of 1.7 (± 5.0) woody cover (%) with large spatial differences: No clear change can be observed in densely populated areas (0.2 ± 4.2), whereas a positive change is seen in sparsely populated areas (2.1 ± 5.2). Woody cover is generally stable in cropland areas (0.9 ± 4.6), reflecting the protective management of parkland trees by the farmers. Positive changes are observed in savannas (2.5 ± 5.4) and woodland areas (3.9 ± 7.3). The major pattern of woody cover change reveals strong increases in the sparsely populated Sahel zones of eastern Senegal, western Mali and central Chad, but a decreasing trend is observed in the densely populated western parts of Senegal, northern Nigeria, Sudan and southwestern Niger. This decrease is often local and limited to woodlands, being an indication of ongoing expansion of cultivated areas and selective logging. We show that an overall positive trend is found in areas of low anthropogenic pressure demonstrating the potential of these ecosystems to provide services such as carbon storage, if not over-utilized. Taken together, our results provide an unprecedented synthesis of woody cover dynamics in the Sahel, and point to land use and human population density as important drivers, however only partially and locally offsetting a general post-drought increase.

The relatively high altitude northern area around the main Ngozi, Rungwe, Tukuyu and Kyejo volcanoes, is characterised by cold and gas-rich springs. In contrast, hot springs occur in the southern and low-altitude area between the Kyela and Livingstone faults. The isotopic signature of the almost stagnant, cold springs of the Northern district is clearly influenced by H2O–CO2(g) exchange as evidenced from negative oxygen-shifts in the order of few deltas permil. In contrast, the isotopic signature of waters discharged from the hot springs of the Southern district is markedly less affected by the H2O–CO2(g) interaction. This evidence is interpreted as an effect of the large, permanent outflow of these springs, which supports the hypothesis of a regional-scale recharge of the major thermal springs. Measurements of carbon isotope variations of the dissolved inorganic carbon of waters and CO2(g) from the Northern and Southern springs support a model of CO2(g)-driven reactivity all over the investigated area. Our combined chemical and isotopic results show that the composition of hot springs is consistent with a mixing between (i) cold surface fresh (SFW) and (ii) Deep Hot Mineralised (DHMW) Water, indicating that the deep-originated fluids also supply most of the aqueous species dissolved in the surface waters used as local potable water. Based on geothermometric approaches, the temperature of the deep hydrothermal system has been estimated to be higher than 110 °C up to 185 °C, in agreement with the geological and thermal setting of the Malawi rift basin. Geochemical data point to (i) a major upflow zone of geothermal fluids mixed with shallow meteoric waters in the Southern part of the province, and (ii) gas absorption phenomena in the small, perched aquifers of the Northern volcanic highlands.

We use panel data covering over a decade to estimate output supply functions for smallholder farmers in Kenya, and compare these among three commodities with distinctive product attributes: maize, kale and milk. We find that despite improved market access over the decade, there is little discernible growth in market participation except in the case of milk. A minority of households consistently sell from year to year and market concentration remains high across all the commodities, indicating that production is largely subsistence. Nevertheless, there is greater market orientation and less market concentration in kale and milk than in maize. For all the commodities, market participation is strongly associated with access to land, productive assets, technology use, expected prices and rainfall amount and reliability. We argue that broad-based smallholder market participation can only be realized through interventions that raise smallholder production of marketable surpluses through raising productivity, and this cuts across even the high value sub-sectors such as horticulture and dairy. Also essential alongside such interventions are strategies to improving market access by reducing transaction costs. "

Bolivia is a centre of wild relative diversity for several crops, among them potato, which is an important staple worldwide and the principal food crop in this country. Despite their relevance for plant breeding, limited knowledge exists about their in situ conservation status. We used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and distribution modelling with the software Maxent to better understand geographic patterns of endemic wild potato diversity in Bolivia. In combination with threat layers, we assessed the conservation status of all endemic species, 21 in total. We prioritised areas for in situ conservation by using complementary reserve selection and excluded 25% of the most-threatened collection sites because costs to implement conservation measures at those locations may be too high compared to other areas. Some 70% (15 of 21 species) has a preliminary vulnerable status or worse according to \{IUCN\} red list distribution criteria. Our results show that four of these species would require special conservation attention because they were only observed in &lt;15 locations and are highly threatened by human accessibility, fires and livestock pressure. Although highest species richness occurs in south-central Bolivia, in the departments Santa Cruz and Chuquisaca, the first priority area for in situ conservation according to our reserve selection exercise is central Bolivia, Cochabamba; this area is less threatened than the potato wild relatives’ hotspot in south-central Bolivia. Only seven of the 21 species were observed in protected areas. To improve coverage of potato wild relatives’ distribution by protected areas, we recommend starting inventories in parks and reserves with high modelled diversity. Finally, to improve ex situ conservation, we targeted areas for germplasm collection of species with &lt;5 accessions conserved in genebanks. "

However, land systems often undergo periods of nonlinear and abrupt change that invalidate predictions calibrated on past trends. Rapid land-system change can occur when critical thresholds in broad-scale underlying drivers such as commodity prices and climate conditions are crossed or when sudden events such as political change or natural disasters punctuate long-term equilibria. As a result, land systems can shift to new regimes with markedly different economic and ecological characteristics. Anticipating the timing and nature of regime shifts of land systems is extremely challenging, as we demonstrate through empirical case studies in four countries in Southeast Asia (China, Laos, Vietnam and Indonesia). The results show how sudden events and gradual changes in underlying drivers caused rapid, surprising and widespread land-system changes, including shifts to different regimes in China, Vietnam and Indonesia, whereas land systems in Laos remained stable in the study period but show recent signs of rapid change. The observed regime shifts were difficult to anticipate, which compromises the validity of predictions of future land-system changes and the assessment of their impact on greenhouse gas emissions, hydrological processes, agriculture, biodiversity and livelihoods. This implies that long-term initiatives such as \{REDD\} must account for the substantial uncertainties inherent in future predictions of land-system change. Learning from past regime shifts and identifying early warning signs for future regime shifts are important challenges for land-system science. "

Upon evaluation of the bioactivity of the isolated compounds, it was found that some or most of the compounds have potent or moderate inhibitory activities against the following: melanogenesis in \{B16\} melanoma cells induced by α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH); generation of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals, against Epstein–Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) activation induced by 12-O-teradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) in Raji cells; t TPA-induced inflammation in mice, and proliferation of one or more of HL-60, A549, AZ521, and SK-BR-3 human cancer cell lines, respectively. Western blot analysis established that paradoxoside E inhibits melanogenesis by regulation of expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), tyrosinase, and tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1) and TRP-2. In addition, tieghemelin A was demonstrated to exhibit cytotoxic activity against \{A549\} cells (IC50 13.5 μM) mainly due to induction of apoptosis by flow cytometry. The extract of defatted shea kernels and its constituents may be, therefore, valuable as potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, skin-whitening, chemopreventive, and anticancer agents. "

A statistically derived bioclimatic stratification is used to analyze projected bioclimatic conditions across Yunnan by the year 2050. The multi-model approach is based on an ensemble of \{CIMP5\} Earth System Models, downscaled to a set of 1 km2 resolution climate projections (n = 63), covering four representative concentration pathways (RCP). Nine bioclimatic zones, composed of 33 strata, are currently found within Yunnan. By 2050, the mean elevation of these zones is projected to shift upwards by an average of 269 m, with large increases in area of the warmer zones, and decreases in the colder, higher elevation zones. Temperate and alpine areas of high biodiversity value are at risk. Displacement in the geographic distribution of bioclimatic conditions is likely to have substantial impact across all bioclimatic zones, vegetation types, and habitats currently found in Yunnan. On average, across all RCPs, 45% of the total combined area of the protected area network will shift to a completely different zone, with 83% shifting to a different strata. The great majority of protected area will experience substantially changed, spatially shifted, and novel bioclimatic conditions by 2050. The spatial displacement and upwards shifting of bioclimatic conditions indicates a prolonged period of significant ecological perturbation, which will have a major impact upon the conservation effectiveness of the established protected area network, and other conservation efforts across Yunnan.

The lime contained 14.6 g kg− 1 vanadium. The aim with this study was to evaluate the vanadium concentration and speciation in the soil 26 years after application. Samples of the organic mor layer and the mineral soil were analyzed separately. The vanadium concentration decreased with soil depth, from 680 to 8 mg kg− 1 soil. Analysis by vanadium K-edge \{XANES\} spectroscopy showed that vanadium(IV) was the predominant species in the mor layer. Further, iron and/or aluminum (hydr)oxides were important sorbents for vanadium(V) in the mineral soil. The speciation of dissolved vanadium, as determined by HPLC-ICP-MS, was dominated by vanadium(V), which is considered the most toxic vanadium species. However, the vanadium sorption capacity of the soil was sufficient to reduce the total bioavailable vanadium below phytotoxic levels. By combining two different vanadium speciation methods, this study was able to conclude that vanadium speciation in soils is governed by soil properties such as pH, organic matter content and the content of metal (hydr)oxides, but not by the vanadium species added to the soil.

Temperature increases in spring can advance spring phases, but warming in autumn and winter may slow the fulfilment of chilling requirements and lead to later onset of spring events, as evidenced by recent phenology delays in response to warming at some locations. As warming continues, the phenology-delaying impacts of higher autumn/winter temperatures may increase in importance, and could eventually attenuate – or even reverse – the phenology-advancing effect of warming springs that has dominated plant responses to climate change so far. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the temperature responses of apricot bloom at five climatically contrasting sites in China. Long-term records of first flowering dates were related to temperature data at daily resolution, and chilling and forcing periods were identified by Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression of bloom dates against daily chill and heat accumulation rates. We then analyzed the impacts of temperature variation during the chilling and forcing periods on tree flowering dates for each site. Results indicated that in cold climates, spring timing of apricots is almost entirely determined by forcing conditions, with warmer springs leading to earlier bloom. However, for apricots at warmer locations, chilling temperatures were the main driver of bloom timing, implying that further warming in winter might cause delayed spring phases. As global warming progresses, current trends of advancing phenology might slow or even turn into delays for increasing numbers of temperate species. "

Three common chilling models (the 0–7.2 °C, Utah and Dynamic Models) and one forcing model (the Growing Degree Hour Model) were used to convert daily temperature data into daily chill and heat accumulation rates. The results indicated that \{PLS\} regression analysis is a useful approach to estimate the \{CR\} and \{HR\} of fruit trees wherever phenology and climate observations have been conducted for long periods. Use of all chilling models indicated similar chilling periods for apricot in Beijing (mid-September to early March), while the identified forcing period started in early January and extended to the first flowering date for each year. The Dynamic Model appeared to be the most accurate model with smallest year-to-year variation in chill accumulated during the chilling period (coefficient of variation of only 7.5%). Using the Dynamic Model for chill, and the Growing Degree Hour Model for heat quantification, the \{CR\} of apricot in Beijing was determined at 75 ± 6 Chill Portions (CP) and the \{HR\} at 3055 ± 938 Growing Degree Hours (GDH).

Eight multiparous Holstein cows, 4 of which were fitted with rumen cannulas, were evaluated in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design, with each period lasting 21 d. The cows were randomly assigned into 4 treatment groups: low-energy (LE) ground corn (GC), \{LE\} steam-flaked corn (SFC), high-energy (HE) GC, and \{HE\} SFC. Changes to ruminal energy degradation rates were induced by feeding the cows diets of either finely ground corn or \{SFC\} as components of diets with the same total energy level. Milk yield, milk protein content and yield, and milk lactose yield all increased in response to higher levels of dietary energy, whereas contents of milk fat and lactose were unaffected. Cows fed \{HE\} diets had a higher crude microbial protein yield and total-tract apparent digestibility than those receiving \{LE\} diets. Milk yield, milk protein yield, and microbial protein yield were also higher when \{SFC\} replaced \{GC\} as the main energy source for lactating cows fed \{LE\} diets. These results suggest that an increased dietary energy level and ruminal degradation rate are beneficial to milk protein production, which we suggest is due to increased yields of microbial proteins, when cows are fed corn stover as a dietary forage source.

A survey of six main stressors in China – ecosystem degradation, food security, energy, water, urbanization and climate change – reveals that domestic environmental policies are inadequate and need to be reformed. China’s ecosystems remain subject to widespread degradation and food insecurity is increasing. There are growing conflicts over water quality and quantity, and energy demand is rising rapidly. Urbanization is set to power future growth in China, yet sustainable urban planning cannot proceed without fundamental environmental and social policy reforms. Climate change is already negatively impacting China and is projected to grow in strength. China’s new leaders must act soon to recalibrate environmental policies across all these sectors. In addition, they must address the lack of interdisciplinary problem-framing and gaps between central government policy and local level implementation. While many sectoral solutions are already in progress, over the next decade and beyond, institutional reform across the country’s social–ecological systems will be key to solving China’s environmental problems.

The paper argues that as well-intentioned as the programs are, they fail to accomplish the envisaged goal of mitigating erosion and surface flow in upper watersheds and subsequently having a positive impact in flood plains and preventing floods. In addition, it also reveals some of the negative impacts on livelihoods of mountain communities, their environment and overall agro-biodiversity.

Comparisons of seed yield across tree age classes and along an elevation gradient were carried out. The rubber seed yield survey was then used as a predictor for potential rubber seed oil production, both locally and regionally, and calculates the potential biodiesel production from the rubber seed oil. The results indicate that rubber seed yield is directly linked with tree age and size, and that elevation does not affect rubber seed yield within this region. Seed yield varied greatly (3-fold) between the two cultivars studied. Furthermore, it was calculated that there is a potential production of 1.94 Mt of rubber seed oil and 1.80 Mt of biodiesel from this oil, within \{SE\} Asia (Southeast Asia). "

Understanding of the relationships between photosynthetic and transpiration rates and chlorophyll content may help to explain variation in growth rate, productivity and \{WUE\} between species and growth environments. Such information is lacking for the species examined here, the evergreen Grevillea robusta (A. Cunn), semi-deciduous Alnus acuminata (HBK) and deciduous Paulownia fortunei (Hemsl.). Although differences in leafing phenology influence the extent of competition or complementarity between trees and crops in agroforestry systems, and hence crop yield, farmers may deliberately plant fast-growing, competitive tree species if they provide attractive economic returns or carbon credit subsidies. The objectives were to characterise: (1) the extent of variation in foliar gas exchange and instantaneous water use efficiency (WUEi) between trees with contrasting leafing phenologies; (2) the influence of leaf age and available soil moisture on gas exchange and \{WUEi\} of trees; and (3) chlorophyll and foliar nitrogen (N) concentrations and gas exchange parameters for maize in agroforestry and sole crop systems. Foliar chlorophyll and N concentrations, assimilation (A) and transpiration rate (E) were much greater in P. fortunei than in A. acuminata or G. robusta. A, E and \{WUEi\} were greatest in young mature leaves of all three species but declined as they senesced. \{WUEi\} increased as soil moisture content declined and was similar in all species, suggesting their differing leafing phenologies were responsible for observed differences in long-term water use and growth. A and \{WUEi\} were greater in maize than in tree species, consistent with its \{C4\} photosynthetic pathway. The implications for tree and crop growth, yield and acceptability to subsistence farmers in the semi-arid tropics are discussed. "

Governments faced with increasing biodiversity loss as a result of human activities have resorted to the creation of protected areas as a strategy to both slow down habitat loss and/or degradation and eventually mitigate species extension and reduction rates. However, the creation of a protected area can have strong implications on the livelihoods of people inhabiting the forest and depending on it, especially those caught within its borders. The involvement of such inhabitants in the management process of the protected area can be profitable. This paper discusses the case of the Korup National Park, Cameroon, considered in the late 1980s by some to be a flagship of conservation and development efforts, and later on in the late 1990s by others as a catastrophic failure as an example of integrated conservation and development. As a means of updating the program's management information base, an in-depth participatory and socio-ecological survey was conducted by some of the program's technical staff. This study aimed at appraising the extent to which the Park's human community of 4200 inhabitants continued to relate to its resources and depend on them for their livelihood. The aim was to evaluate the potential links between the communities' livelihood and the long-term management and survival of the Park as the important biodiversity conservation zone it had been found to be. Results indicate that the successful management of a Park like Korup may well depend on the involvement of the local communities; and that successful management through approaches that minimize the potential contributions and aspirations of the local people is difficult to achieve.

This paper presents a case from Yunnan, Southwest China, in which indigenous knowledge has been integrated into the development of an agroforestry model with non-timber forest products for the Sloping Land Conservation Programme (SLCP) by using a participatory technology development (PTD) approach. This approach was adopted to increase the likelihood that technologies developed would be suitable for resource-poor households. It is expected that integrating indigenous and scientific knowledge, will lead to positive ecological and economic outcomes. Finally, the paper argues that the integration of indigenous knowledge in both forestry policy formulation and implementation is important in the context of sustainable forest management in mountain areas.

Various actors are now actively lobbying and disbursing \{REDD\} demonstration funds on the premise of spurring pro-poor carbon investments in less developed areas that were otherwise excluded from the Clean Development Mechanism. In practice, little is known as to whether the \{REDD\} projects are actually pro-poor in their spatial targeting. This paper focuses on Kenya to analyse the distribution of \{REDD\} projects across quantified subnational vulnerability indices. A vulnerability index map for Kenya was first developed from long-term socioeconomic (crop yields, literacy rates and poverty rates) and climate (rainfall) data drawn from the 47 counties of Kenya. The number and types of \{REDD\} projects were located on the vulnerability map. Correlation tests were performed and experts consulted to clarify the socioeconomic features of vulnerability that significantly influence spatial choices for the projects. Results show that most projects are located in low-vulnerability counties and are mainly developed and managed by international private and consulting companies. Correlation tests revealed that the low-vulnerability counties, hosting more projects, are endowed with humid forest resources at .728; p &lt; 0.01, land title deeds at .552; p &lt; 0.01 and better access to water at .475; p &lt; 0.01. Experts suggested that such conditions posit low transaction costs and higher carbon revenues for profit-seeking project developers that currently dominate the \{REDD\} demonstrations. Conversely, some project experiences indicate that medium to high-vulnerability areas e.g. dry-lands with mitigation potential, enable projects to have low opportunity costs and explicit livelihood impacts. By directing \{REDD\} funds to relatively vulnerable areas, projects and national \{REDD\} policies are likely to enhance synergies between mitigation and adaptation. More targeted field assessment of the interaction between projects and local socioeconomic conditions can be formulated from this study. "

A study was undertaken to understand how scientists can introduce new soil-related technologies as part of the already functioning farmers’ soil knowledge (FSK) system and achieve soil-specific fertility management interventions. Farmer participatory research and biophysical diagnostic methods were used in Akavuguto watershed, southern Rwanda. Results from this study show that the \{FSK\} system is not only rational but also practical and consistent with the technical soil knowledge and has the potential of being user-friendly for local fertility experts, agronomists and extensionists compared to the international soil classification systems. The farmers’ rationality is demonstrated by a clear agreement between farmers’ cognitive soil knowledge and farmers’ soil-related practices. The farmers’ practices follow a clear coping strategy in a poor and complex biophysical environment. In the Akavuguto watershed case study, the mountains, with their Urubuye (Entisols), are limited by the slope gradient and stoniness; they are planted with trees. The upper hills, with their Urusenyi (Entisols) and Inombe (Ultisols), do not have major edaphic limitations; they are used for growing beans and sorghum, crops that are demanding but key in farmers’ food security strategy. The back slopes, with their Umuyugu/Mugugu (Oxisols), are limited by poor fertility status; they are used for growing cassava and sweet potato which are acid tolerant and less demanding. The valley bottoms, with their Nyiramugengeri (Histosols) and Ibumba (Ultisols), are limited by very strong acidity; they are used for growing sweet potatoes. It was concluded that understanding the biophysical environment in terms of land units and associated farmers’ soil types constitutes an appropriate entry point to achieve soil-specific and replicable fertility management technologies "

Nevertheless, rubber yields can be surprisingly high in sub-optimal environments. This paper investigates climatic factors which contribute to the higher than expected rubber yields in a suboptimal environment in Jinghong, Yunnan, Southwest China. Two mathematical analysis methods were used to relate climate to rubber yield and dry matter content: partial least square regression and classification and regression tree models were used. Greater diurnal temperature difference was found to increase dry rubber yield, and has been previously overlooked as an explanatory factor. Average temperatures below 25.7 °C, and more sunshine hours in the day before tapping, were also found to significantly improve dry rubber yield, although more sunshine hours during the month prior to tapping were found to reduce rubber yield. Lower relative humidity was found to increase dry rubber content of latex and increase yield. Greater diurnal temperature difference and more sunshine hours in a day before tapping facilitate photosynthesis and rubber formation. Lower relative humidity reduces the water content in the latex, thus increasing dry rubber content of the latex. In summary, this study finds that lower average temperature (within certain thresholds), greater diurnal temperature difference in both a day and a month before tapping, more sunshine hours in a day before tapping and lower sunshine hours in a month before tapping are the most important factors which promote dry rubber yield, and lower relative humidity in the day prior to tapping is the most important factor in determining dry rubber content of latex. Diurnal temperature difference has not been previously investigated as a driver of rubber yield. The case study site has a greater diurnal temperature difference than many other main rubber producing areas, which may contribute to explaining why rubber yields in Jinghong are higher than might be expected in a sub-optimal environment.

The \{EU\} is a multi-state grouping of economically developed democratic countries, while China is a unitary sovereign state and a developing economy with a strong government bureaucracy. Our hypothesis is that given their diverse political systems, the \{EU\} and China would develop different kinds of systems for the governance of adaptation to climate change. We test this hypothesis through a comparative analysis of policy documents from the two study areas, in which we examine framework policies, programmatic actions and specific actions that have been adopted to date in order to address climate change, with a specific focus on the water sector. We find that climate change adaptation began to be addressed through formal policy on a similar timeline in the two regions. The \{EU\} and China are also similar in that they use framework laws and existing sectoral policy, such as for the water sector. We find that the \{EU\} has primarily relied on integration of climate change adaptation concerns through legal instruments which set a framework for implementation of adaptation policy. In China, specific actions to be incorporated in socio-economic development plans under the existing legislation on adaptation have been the main mode for integrating adaptation into sectoral actions, though the future trend may be to develop more regulations.

Studies have focused on how REDD+ can benefit or harm local people, with little attention paid to how people, their assets and institutions can promote or impede REDD+. This paper examines the key local assets necessary for REDD+ to protect forests and support local livelihoods based on evidence from a globally-linked REDD+ project in Kenya. Household interviews (n = 100), focus group discussions (n = 6) and in-depth interviews with government (n = 8) and project stakeholders (n = 14) were undertaken to rank and explain how local assets interact with the project's efforts to protect forests, and the role of State institutions in shaping project–asset interactions. Locally, pro-poor assets such as land tenure and water access had most influence on the project's ability to protect forests. Inclusion of communal forests as part of the REDD+ project entitled local poor peasant farmers to participate in and benefit from the project and so dissuaded them from using protected forests for charcoal production. Water access determined agricultural productivity and intensity of forest use for livelihoods and coping. Even though carbon revenues were distributed equally between social groups and support directed to pro-poor livelihood initiatives, efforts were impeded by State decisions on land that interfered with communal approaches to forest conservation, by strict carbon standards that limited trade-offs between livelihoods and forest protection and by fluctuating carbon prices and buyers that limited funds needed for project operations and local livelihoods. Equitable and pro-poor benefit sharing are necessary but not sufficient for effective REDD+ implementation unless national institutions are reformed and global carbon pricing harmonized with local livelihood needs.

However, few studies compare the ability of \{MSBBs\} versus \{HNBs\} to capture crop biomass variability. Therefore, we used standard data mining techniques to identify a set of \{MSBB\} data from the IKONOS, GeoEye-1, Landsat ETM+, MODIS, WorldView-2 sensors and compared their performance with \{HNB\} data from the EO-1 Hyperion sensor in explaining crop biomass variability of four important field crops (rice, alfalfa, cotton, maize). The analysis employed two-band (ratio) vegetation indices (TBVIs) and multiband (additive) vegetation indices (MBVIs) derived from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and stepwise regression. Results demonstrated that HNB-derived \{TBVIs\} and \{MBVIs\} performed better than MSBB-derived \{TBVIs\} and \{MBVIs\} on a per crop basis and for the pooled data: overall, \{HNB\} \{TBVIs\} explained 5–31% greater variability when compared with various \{MSBB\} TBVIs; and \{HNB\} \{MBVIs\} explained 3–33% greater variability when compared with various \{MSBB\} MBVIs. The performance of \{MSBB\} \{MBVIs\} and \{TBVIs\} improved mildly, by combining spectral information across multiple sensors involving IKONOS, GeoEye-1, Landsat ETM+, MODIS, and WorldView-2. A number of \{HNBs\} that advance crop biomass modeling were determined. Based on the highest factor loadings on the first component of the SVD, the “red-edge” spectral range (700–740 nm) centered at 722 nm (bandwidth = 10 nm) stood out prominently, while five additional and distinct portions of the recorded spectral range (400–2500 nm) centered at 539 nm, 758 nm, 914 nm, 1130 nm, 1320 nm (bandwidth = 10 nm) were also important. The best \{HNB\} vegetation indices for crop biomass estimation involved 549 and 752 nm for rice (R2 = 0.91); 925 and 1104 nm for alfalfa (R2 = 0.81); 722 and 732 nm for cotton (R2 = 0.97); and 529 and 895 nm for maize (R2 = 0.94). The higher spectral resolution of the EO-1 Hyperion hyperspectral sensor and the ability of users to choose distinct \{HNBs\} for improved crop biomass estimation outweigh the benefits that come with higher spatial resolution of MSBBs.

Combining different techniques allows the assessment of aspects of system behaviour via various perspectives, thereby generating complementary knowledge.

The \{EU\} requires that national \{VPA\} negotiations include participation by the relevant stakeholders. Based on primary data, we compare the \{VPA\} negotiations in Cameroon (2006–2009) with three different ‘ideal’ models of participatory policy-making: the rationalist, the communicative incremental and the mixed model, which we expect have different implications for legitimacy. We conclude that the Cameroonian process is closest to a rationalist model with elements of the mixed model, and that this has increased legitimacy and support only to a limited extent. For future processes in other countries, we recommend stronger elements of the mixed model, and more careful considerations about stakeholder identification processes; how to adapt policy-process to specific contexts; and how to strengthen communication and information flows. Considerations about these elements could also strengthen the applicability of the ideal models. "

These traditional methods create serious health and environmental hazards, leading to renewed efforts to bring cleaner, more efficient stoves to people around the world but particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia where poverty is highest. Through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and voluntary markets, carbon finance is emerging as an attractive option to help scale-up cookstove projects. However, there is little understanding of how carbon-financed projects can help transform markets. This article begins to fill that gap by examining the role of carbon finance in cookstove projects in Kenya. Data was gathered through a review of project design documents for carbon-financed cookstove projects in Kenya and 26 interviews with stakeholders in the cookstove sector. Our analysis shows that carbon finance can help build a vibrant market for improved cookstoves by attracting international actors and technologies, helping establish standards for monitoring stoves and facilitating better follow-up and after-sales support. However, we highlight risks, such as potential mismatch between cheap and efficient technology and meeting user expectations and preferences. The study shows the need for further research on impact of carbon finance on improved cookstove project implementation across a broader range of contexts. "

Fieldwork and document reviews revealed 24 lessons drawn from both positive and negative \{ICDP\} experiences. At the design level, the REDD+ project maintained the commonly critiqued top-down intervening approach as used by the \{ICDPs\} by excluding community input into its globally-linked design. At the implementation level, the REDD+ project promoted better community representation in project decisions and benefit sharing when compared to the ICDPs. A landscape approach, democratic institutional choices and pro-poor benefit sharing were the key interventions that enabled the REDD+ project to improve on the \{ICDP\} experiences. The usefulness of the \{ICDP\} experiences was however weakened by a lack of direct consultative platform between the projectsl. The REDD+ project relied mainly on the local community to learn fromICDP experiences, but this led to partial implementation deficits by promoting local participation interests over global mitigation goals. Further, community-driven lesson learning appeared to disconnect the project from State institutions that the community perceived negatively due to past resource centralization regimes. These State institutions are however the legal custodians of most assets (such as land) required for REDD+ implementation. \{ICDP\} lessons are therefore necessary for effective REDD+ implementation but can only be useful if the process of adopting lessons is cognizant of relevant stakeholders such as the State.

Changes in climate may exacerbate these limitations to productivity, but current research on projecting responses of maize yields to climate change in Ethiopia is inadequate. The research objectives of this project were to (1) calibrate and evaluate the performance of the APSIM-maize and \{DSSAT\} CSM-CERES-Maize models, and (2) assess the impact of climate change on future maize yield. The climate periods considered were near future (2010–2039), middle (2040–2069) and end of the 21st century (2070–2099). Climate simulations were conducted using 20 General Circulation Models (GCMs) and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs; RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Both crop models reasonably reproduced observations for time to anthesis, time to physiological maturity and crop yields, with values for the index of agreement of 0.86, 0.80 and 0.77 for DSSAT, and 0.50, 0.89 and 0.60 for APSIM. Similarly root mean square errors were moderate for days to anthesis (1.3 and 3.7 days, for \{DSSAT\} and APSIM, respectively), maturity (4.5 and 3.1 days), and yield (1.1 and 1.2 tons). Deviations of simulated from observed values were low for days to anthesis (DSSAT: −2.4–2.3%; APSIM: 0–6%) and days to maturity (DSSAT: −0.6–4.4%; APSIM: −1.9–3.3%) but relatively high for yield (DSSAT: −18.5–21.2%; APSIM: −19.1–37.1%). Overall the goodness-of-fit measures indicated that models were useful for assessing maize yield at the study site. Simulations for future climate scenarios projected slight increases in the median yield for the near future (1.7%–2.9% across models and RCPs), with uncertainty increasing toward mid-century (0.6–4.2%). By the end of the 21st century, projections ranged between yield decreases by 6.3% and increases by 4%. Differences between the \{RCPs\} were small, probably due to factor interactions, such as higher temperatures reducing the CO2-induced yield gains for the higher RCP. Uncertainties in studies on the impact of climate change on maize might arise mostly from the choice of crop model and GCM. Therefore, the use of multiple crop models along with multiple \{GCMs\} would be advisable in order to adequately consider uncertainties about future climate and crop responses and to provide comprehensive information to policy makers and planners. Overall, results of this study (based on two different crop simulation models across 20 GCMs, and two \{RCPs\} under similar crop management) consistently indicated a slight increase in yield. "

Trade-offs among soil C, crop and animal and crop productivity were analysed using the NUANCES-FARMSIM (FArm-scale Resource Management SIMulator) dynamic model. Retention on the soil surface of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% of the maize stover yield produced per farm, and the use of the remainder as animal feed was quantified over a 12 year period for four farm types in Murehwa, Zimbabwe. Retaining 100% maize residues in the field led to an annual loss of on average 68 and 93 kg body weight per animal for cattle on farms of the relatively wealthiest farmers (Resource Group, RG1) who had most land and cattle and \{RG2\} respectively), and is therefore unsustainable for livestock production. There was an increase in grain yield of 1.6 t farm−1 and 0.7 t farm−1 for \{RG1\} and \{RG2\} respectively. Farmers without cattle (RG3 and RG4) may have a greater incentive for retaining their crop residues but they have to invest labour to keep the residues during the dry season. However, improved crop productivity for these farmers is limited by lack of access to fertiliser. The current practice of allocating all crop residues to animals results in average gross margin of US$7429 and US$4037 for \{RG1\} and \{RG2\} farmers respectively. Our results showed that from an economic perspective, it is logical that farmers prioritise the sustenance of cattle with crop residues over soil fertility management. We conclude that at current productivity levels, farmers who own cattle have limited scope to allocate crop residues for soil cover as it leads to significant loss in animal production and economic value.

Distributions of two members of this sub-species were modelled using bioclimatic data for current conditions (1950–2000). A subset of the least correlated bioclimatic variables was used for ecological niche modelling (ENM). We used an \{ENM\} ensemble method in the BiodiversityR R-package to map the suitable climatic space for tree rhododendrons based on 217 point location records. Ensemble bioclimatic models for tree rhododendrons had high predictive power with bioclimatic variables, which also separated the climatic spaces for the two species. Tree rhododendrons were found occurring in a wide range of climate and the distributional limits were associated with isothermality, temperature ranges, temperature of the wettest quarter, and precipitation of the warmest quarter of the year. The most suitable climatic space for tree rhododendrons was predicted to be in western Yunnan, China, with suitability declining towards the west and east. Its occurrence in a wide range of climatic settings with highly dissected habitats speaks to the adaptive capacity of the species, which might open up future options for their conservation planning in regions where they are listed as threatened.

Sixty-four cuttings from each of four tested clones (MB, NG1, NG2, NG4) were set in each of four replicate blocks arranged in a randomised split-split plot factorial design. Each main plot was randomly divided into two types of rooting medium (sand or a 50:50 mixture of sand/sawdust). Sub-plots received three types of auxin at 50 μg per cutting (IAA, \{IBA\} or NAA) dissolved in 10 μl of alcohol, the control receiving 10 μl of alcohol. Sub-sub plots had four cutting leaf areas (0, 12.5, 25 and 50 cm2). Interaction of these factors was also investigated. Clone × substrate (variance = 0.01706) and clone × substrate × leaf area (variance = 0.00835) interactions were identified as important factors on rooting of A. floribunda single-node cuttings at week 38. Rooting medium, clone and leaf area had highly significant effects (p &lt; 0.001). Application of auxin did not enhance rooting percentage in cuttings by the end of experiment. Optimising important factors (substrate, clone and leaf area) for rooting identified best rooting percentages (68.7%) in leafy cuttings from clone \{MB\} in sand. None of the tested factors had significant effects on number of roots, and rooted cuttings had on average one root. These results indicate that A. floribunda is difficult to root, but is amenable to vegetative propagation.

In general, maize growth (indicated by height and dry matter measured at roughly fortnightly interval) was higher (P &lt;0.01) in fertilized alleys than in unfertilized alleys, and there were no differences between Leucaena and Flemingia alleys. In both fertilized and unfertilized alleys, the maize plants were 20% shorter (P &lt;0.01) in the first row (nearer the hedgerows) than in the second and third maize rows. Maize dry matter yield was 30% more (P&lt;0.01) in unfertilized Flemingia alleys than in corresponding Leucaena alleys. The grain yield was similar in the fertilized alleys of Leucaena and Flemingia. However, in unfertilized alleys, the grain yield in Flemingia alloys was 50% more than that of the corresponding Leucaena alleys. The fertilized alleys produced twice as much grain as unfertilized alleys when hedgerow prunings were added to the plots. The prunings as a source of nutrient did not appear to have any noticeable effect on crop productivity. The soil moisture content under both Leucaena and Flemingia hedgerow was higher than under the maize rows in the alleys throughout the growing season. The study shows that, under conditions of low fertility and no addition of fertilizers, Leucaena is twice as competitive, as Flemingia for soil resources, and reduces yield of alley-cropped maize from 2.2 t ha−1 to 0.7 t ha−1. If, however, fertilizer is added, there are no short-term differences between the two hedgerow species. "

A formal survey of 71 farmers showed that half periodically fallow 10–50% of their land for at least one season, mainly for soil fertility restoration. This is a higher proportion than expected for areas of high population density. An improved-fallow prototype, established by direct seeding Sesbania sesban, an indigenous tree, into the maize crop preceding the fallow, was subjected to an economic analysis, based on twenty farmer-managed trials where the technology was tested. One would intuitively expect that the yield of maize grown after a fallow would need to be at least double that obtained before the fallow in order to compensate for the lost production during the fallow period. Instead, the break-even yield increase following the one-season fallow, compared to continuous cropping, was only 21% of the long rains yield of 600 kg/ha for the base scenario. It was relatively, low, because the foregone maize yield during the fallow was compensated by savings in crop labour. Improved fallow is a promising technique for reclaiming depleted land, especially for households with access to off-farm income or having low labour-to-land ratios. The farm trials facilitated a realistic economic analysis and farmers' input into the design of the technology to help focus research on improving the practice. "

Grevillea robusta (A. Cunn.; grevillea) trees were grown in a dispersed planting arrangement, either as sole stands or in combination with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) or maize (Zea mays L.). Allometric approaches were used to monitor leaf area and leaf, branch and trunk biomass over a 4.5-year period. Seasonal and annual growth increments and the corresponding mean daily growth rates were calculated; crop growth, development and yield were also determined over nine growing seasons. Tree height, leaf area and trunk and branch biomass were reduced in the agroforestry treatment (CTd) during the first 600 days after planting as a result of competition with the associated crops. Tree height subsequently increased more rapidly in the agroforestry treatment (CTd) and regained parity with the sole grevillea treatment (Td) by ca. 820 days after planting. However, although seasonal and annual biomass increments were comparable in both treatments once the trees became the dominant component of the system, above-ground biomass in \{CTd\} grevillea never recovered fully to Td values during the observation period; trunk volume and biomass were consistently lower in \{CTd\} than in Td grevillea, reducing their economic value. Tree growth continued throughout the dry season, sometimes at rates similar to or greater than observed during the cropping seasons, indicating that the trees were able to utilise residual soil moisture or deep reserves within the profile. This finding is discussed in relation to recent interpretations of niche separation in savanna vegetation. The factors responsible for the observed reductions in tree growth in the agroforestry system are examined; effects on crop yields and system performance are considered in Part II. "

Crop and system performance were examined over a 4.5-year-period (nine growing seasons) commencing in October 1991; failure of the rains caused the loss of one cropping season. A rotation of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) and maize (Zea mays L.) was grown during the first five seasons after planting the trees, while maize was grown continuously during the final four seasons. Sole maize was also grown under spectrally neutral shade netting which reduced incident radiation by 25, 50 or 75% to establish the relative importance of shade and below-ground competition for water and nutrients in determining the performance of understorey crops. The above-ground biomass and grain yield of understorey crops were not significantly affected by the presence of grevillea during the first four seasons, but were greatly reduced in subsequent seasons as the trees became increasingly dominant; maize yields reached 50% of the sole crop values only once during the final four seasons, when rainfall was unusually high. The hypothesis that competition for water was the primary limiting factor for understorey crops was supported by the observation that above-ground biomass and grain yield were greater in the shade net treatments than in agroforestry maize, demonstrating that shade was not solely responsible for the substantial yield losses in the latter treatment. Performance ratios (ratio of values for the agroforestry system relative to sole stands) for total above-ground and trunk biomass in grevillea were initially low, reflecting the impact of competition with associated crops during tree establishment, but increased to unity within 2.5 years. Performance ratios for the understorey crops exhibited the reverse trend, initially being close to unity but approaching zero for three of the final four seasons. Performance ratios were never close to unity for both trees and crops during the same season, indicating that there was always competition for available resources irrespective of crop species or tree size.

abstract = "Sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing a steadily aggravated food security crisis. “New” approaches are necessary to ensure tomorrow's food-bowl. With a growing population and diminishing resources, any investment (labour or monetary) to improve self-sufficiency must produce an acceptable return. Sufficient water commonly represents one crucial factor in farmers' yearly gamble in securing a harvest. If the availability of water is better ensured, the farmer could be spurred to invest his limited means to further improve the probability of obtaining a harvest. Cereal crops are essential, yet for many self-subsistence farmers on the African continent, it is considered a “waste” of efforts to irrigate it — “irrigation is for more economically worthwhile crops”. Surface run-off dynamics in the Sahel have in a number of studies proven to be of considerable magnitudes. Rainwater harvesting into small ponds for supplemental irrigation during intra-seasonal dry-spells during crop growing seasons could therefore prove to be a viable solution. During an on-farm study carried out in semi-arid Burkina Faso, supplemental irrigation during dryspells increased sorghum harvests by 41%, and in combination with added fertilization, by 180 %. Only applying fertilization gave yield improvements of 132% indicating that nutrients and not water was the most limiting factor in 1998. This paper aims to present a theoretical situation for a small self-subsistence farmer in a semi-arid context using supplemental irrigation in order to better secure the cereal needs of an average size family. A project description of an on-farm trial site in the Yatenga region of Burkina Faso is presented. The focus is on water and nutrient balances. "

Direct comparison of evapotranspiration rates published in the literature is hardly possible, since differences in soils and climate make data incomparable. This paper presents literature data on crop parameters and environmental conditions that determine transpiration for four crops (oil palm, cocoa, maize and rice) and evaporation. Transpiration at leaf scale and soil evaporation as well as evaporation of intercepted rainfall have been computed using these data and are scaled-up to canopy scale. The objective is to quantify evapotranspiration of the crops under identical environmental conditions at two temporal scales: daily and annual evapotranspiration. Variation among crops in transpiration at leaf scale owing to crop characteristics is levelled out in scaling up to canopy scale. Differences in annual evapotranspiration between perennial and annual crops mainly are due to the fact that perennial crops transpire during the dry season, although at low rates, but still considerably higher than evaporation rates of bare and dry soils.

However, their environmental sustainability is increasingly debated because of land competition with food production, negative carbon balances and impacts on biodiversity. Arid and semi-arid lands have been proposed as a more sustainable alternative without such impacts. In that context this paper evaluates the carbon balance of potential land conversion to Jatropha cultivation, biofuel production and use in arid and semi-arid areas. This evaluation includes the calculation of carbon debt created by these land conversions and calculation of the minimum Jatropha yield necessary to repay the respective carbon debts within 15 or 30 years. The carbon debts caused by conversion of arid and semi-arid lands to Jatropha vary largely as a function of the biomass carbon stocks of the land use types in these regions. Based on global ecosystem carbon mapping, cultivated lands and marginal areas (sparse shrubs, herbaceous and bare areas) show to have similar biomass carbon stocks (on average 4–8 t C ha−1) and together cover a total of 1.79 billion ha. Conversion of these lands might not cause a carbon debt, but still might have a negative impact on other sustainability dimensions (e.g. biodiversity or socio-economics). Jatropha establishment in shrubland (0.75 billion ha) would cause a carbon debt of 24–28 t C ha−1 on average (repayable within 30 year with yield of 3.5–3.9 t seed ha−1 yr−1). Land use change in the 1.15 billion ha of forested area under arid and semi-arid climates could cause a carbon debt between 70 and 118 t C ha−1. This debt requires 8.6–13.9 t seed production ha−1 yr−1 for repayment within 30 years. If repayment is required within 15 years, the necessary minimum yields almost double. Considering that 5 t seed ha−1 yr−1 is the current maximum Jatropha yield, conversion of forests cannot be repaid within one human generation. Repayment of carbon debt from shrubland conversions in 30 years is challenging, but feasible. Repayment in 15 year is currently not attainable. Based on this analysis the paper discusses the carbon mitigation potential of biofuels in arid and semi-arid environments. "

Cereals depend on silicon (Si)-based defences to fight off herbivores. Using altitudinal ranges in the East African highlands as ecological surrogates for inferring climate change, it was shown that Si concentrations in soil and maize decreased with altitude. This was attributed, in part, to low temperatures at high altitudes, which negatively affected Si assimilation by maize. Experiments showed that B. fusca was more susceptible to Si than C. partellus. Hence the predominance of B. fusca in the highlands and of C. partellus in the lowlands could be partly explained by altitudinal differences in Si concentrations in maize plants. Therefore, a rise in temperature due to climate change should enhance the plants’ Si assimilation and as a result C. partellus might move into the higher altitudes and increasingly displace B. fusca.

We quantified abundance, size, and spatial pattern of tree dieback in 57 plots (50 m × 50 m) established at 100 m intervals along five transects. The snag density and basal area (mean ± SE) of the two species combined were 147 ± 23 stems ha−1 and 5.35 ± 0.81 m2 ha−1, respectively. The percentages of snags were extremely high for both J. procera (57 ± 7%) and O. europaea subsp. cuspidata (60 ± 5%), but showed a decreasing trend with increasing elevation suggesting that restoration is even more urgent at the lower elevations. Snags of the two species accounted for 31 and 45% of total stand density and basal area, respectively. Living stems exhibited truncated inverse-J-shaped diameter and height class distributions, indicating serious regeneration problems of these foundation species in the study area. In addition to direct interventions to assist recruitment of climax tree species, sites with high dieback would probably benefit from snag reduction to prevent fire incidents in the remaining dry Afromontane forests in northern Ethiopia.

Despite considerable diversity in production systems and contexts, sugarcane is a particularly “high impact” crop with significant positive and negative environmental and socio-economic impacts. Our analysis is focused on Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which is a critical region for continued expansion, due to its high production potential, low cost of production and proximity, and access, to European markets. Drawing on a systematic review of scientific evidence, combined with information from key informants, stakeholders and a research-industry workshop, we critically assess the impacts of sugarcane development on water, soil and air quality, employment, food security and human health. Our analysis shows that sugarcane production is, in general, neither explicitly good nor bad, sustainable nor unsustainable. The impacts of expansion of sugarcane production on the environment and society depend on the global political economy of sugar, local context, quality of scheme, nature of the production system and farm management. Despite threats from climate change and forthcoming changes in the trade relationship with the European Union, agricultural development policies are driving national and international interest and investment in sugarcane in SSA, with expansion likely to play an important role in sustainable development in the region. Our findings will help guide researchers and policy makers with new insights in understanding the situated environmental and social impacts associated with alternative sugar economy models, production technologies and qualities of management.

However, lack of research on appropriate sampling design prevents accurate assessment of soil carbon stocks and stock changes at community and regional scales. Here, we conducted an intensive survey with 1196 sampling sites over an area of 190 km2 of degraded alpine meadow. Compared to lightly degraded meadow, soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in moderately, heavily and extremely degraded meadow were reduced by 11.0%, 13.5% and 17.9%, respectively. Our field survey sampling design was overly intensive to estimate \{SOC\} status with a tolerable uncertainty of 10%. Power analysis showed that the optimal sampling density to achieve the desired accuracy would be 2, 3, 5 and 7 sites per 10 km2 for lightly, moderately, heavily and extremely degraded meadows, respectively. If a subsequent paired sampling design with the optimum sample size were performed, assuming stock change rates predicted by experimental and modeling results, we estimate that about 5–10 years would be necessary to detect expected trends in \{SOC\} in the top 20 cm soil layer. Our results highlight the utility of conducting preliminary surveys to estimate the appropriate sampling density and avoid wasting resources due to over-sampling, and to estimate the sampling interval required to detect an expected sequestration rate. Future studies will be needed to evaluate spatial and temporal patterns of \{SOC\} variability. "

These negative impacts include changes to the biodiversity and function of soil fungal communities, which contribute towards nutrient cycling and interact with other organisms in belowground ecosystems, and may be pathogens. Despite the important role of soil fungi in rubber plantations, these communities have been poorly studied. In this paper, we review the existing literature on the diversity and ecology of belowground fungi in rubber plantations. Various groups of soil fungi, including saprobes, symbionts, and pathogens are discussed. Additionally, the role of plantation management is discussed in the context of both pathogenic soil fungi and the promotion of beneficial soil fungi. Management practices include clone selection, tree age and planting density, application of chemicals, and intercropping systems. Our review shows the strong need for further research into the effects of monoculture rubber plantations on soil fungal communities, and how we can best manage these systems in the future, in order to create a more sustainable approach to rubber production.

Active forest management is often prescribed to accelerate natural regeneration, but evidence for the efficacy of interventions is scarce for tropical forests. In this study we examine the hypothesis that the selective removal of abundant pioneers in the understory of recovering selectively logged forests can improve the composition of forest stands and accelerate succession. Four selective thinning treatments of increasing intensity were implemented in 8.75 ha compartments and replicated six times. Within each compartment, three monitoring plots were established and measured immediately after thinning and one year later to assess implementation of thinning treatments, growth and survival of stems, and changes in stand composition. Canopy openness was measured using hemispherical photography. Thinning treatments substantially reduced the abundance of pioneers, but there was only a slight increase in canopy openness (3.7–4.3%) relative to the control (1.8%) 8 months after implementation. Canopy openness increased dramatically across all treatments in the follow year due to the 2015–16 El Niño event and increased more in thinning treatments. Large (&gt;10 cm dbh) and small (2–10 cm dbh) late-successional stems showed enhanced growth only in the low intensity thinning treatment, whereas the growth of small pioneer stems increased across the thinning intensity gradient. The cost of implementing thinning treatments was $US80 per ha or approximately 10% of the cost of planting treatments in the same forest. Our findings suggest that selective thinning of understory pioneer stems is a practical option for manipulating stand composition and potentially accelerating natural regeneration. Continued monitoring of the experiment should reveal the long-term impact and cost-effectiveness of treatments. "

We present a study of wood use in the \{YUS\} area (combined watersheds of Yopno, Uruwa and Som rivers) in northern Papua New Guinea, where 57 communities depend on forests for their subsistence. Using a survey methodology based on the Poverty and Environment Network (PEN) survey protocol, we assess the annual volume of wood used, primary sources for this wood and evaluate the capacity of natural forest to sustainably support current rates of wood-use as well as their per capita \{CO2\} emissions. The primary reason for wood extraction was for fuelwood (6.4 kg person−1 day−1 or ∼11.1 tonne household−1 year−1) and housing construction (0.6 m−3 household−1 year−1). Fuelwood was collected primarily from areas close to the village, in fallow (grassland) and agroforestry land types, while construction wood was being sourced primarily from secondary and primary forests. The volume of construction wood currently harvested across \{YUS\} was approximately 11% the annual increase in timber volumes in available and accessible natural forest. Under this wood use rate and projected population growth (2.5–4%) these communities can harvest construction wood at a sustainable rate for between 55 and 90 years. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the \{CO2\} emissions from wood extraction, and in particular fuelwood, are high; approaching 1.15 tonnes \{CO2\} person−1 year−1. Household surveys revealed that all smallholders had a strong interest in planting trees for production of wood for house construction, which could reduce pressures on forests and compensate for \{CO2\} emissions.

Agricultural lands are believed to be a major potential sink and could absorb large quantities of C if trees are reintroduced to these systems and judiciously managed together with crops and/or animals. Thus, the importance of agroforestry as a land-use system is receiving wider recognition not only in terms of agricultural sustainability but also in issues related to climate change. The objective of this paper was to analyse C storage data in some tropical agroforestry systems and to discuss the role they can play in reducing the concentration of \{CO2\} in the atmosphere. The C sequestration potential of agroforestry systems is estimated between 12 and 228 Mg ha−1 with a median value of 95 Mg ha−1. Therefore, based on the earth’s area that is suitable for the practice (585–1215×106 ha), 1.1–2.2 Pg C could be stored in the terrestrial ecosystems over the next 50 years. Long rotation systems such as agroforests, homegardens and boundary plantings can sequester sizeable quantities of C in plant biomass and in long-lasting wood products. Soil C sequestration constitutes another realistic option achievable in many agroforestry systems. In conclusion, the potential of agroforestry for \{CO2\} mitigation is well recognised. However, there are a number of shortcomings that need to be emphasised. These include the uncertainties related to future shifts in global climate, land-use and land cover, the poor performance of trees and crops on substandard soils and dry environments, pests and diseases such as nematodes. In addition, more efforts are needed to improve methods for estimating C stocks and trace gas balances such as nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) to determine net benefits of agroforestry on the atmosphere.

The effects of crop rotation of maize (Zea mays L.) with crotalaria (Crotalaria grahamiana Wight &amp; Arn.) versus continuous maize and phosphorus (P) fertilization on \{AMF\} spore community composition and diversity were studied in a long term field experiment in western Kenya. The spores were isolated from the soil, identified according to their morphologies, and enumerated. Trap pots using soil from the maize–crotalaria rotation were sown with four different plant species, sunflower (Helianthus annuus (L.) Merill.), leek (Allium porrum L.), maize, and crotalaria. The spores isolated from the traps were identified according to their morphology and by sequencing of their large ribosomal subunits (LSU). Ten \{AMF\} species were isolated from the field soil and 16 species from the traps. Altogether, 18 species were recorded in the field site. The spore communities in the field soil were dominated by Scutellospora and Acaulospora species. The species diversity of \{AMF\} spores in the soil was affected neither by crop rotation nor by P fertilization. However, the composition (relative species abundances) of \{AMF\} spore communities was significantly affected by crop rotation. The abundance of Acaulospora scrobiculata and Scutellospora verrucosa spores was significantly higher in soil under maize–crotalaria rotation than under continuous maize. Both the composition and diversity of spore communities, as well as spore densities in the traps were strongly affected by species identity of the host plant, whereas the P fertilization history of the soil only affected diversity of the spore communities. Functional consequences of changing composition of \{AMF\} communities through agricultural management practices are discussed. "

Poverty alleviation is a process that needs to be understood before impact can be measured. Workshops such as those we describe can help researchers to identify farmers' different ways of managing and using a technology and likely effects, unanticipated impacts, major impacts to pursue in more quantitative studies, the primary links between agricultural technology and poverty, and key conditioning factors affecting adoption and impact that can be used to stratify samples in more formal analyses.

The study associated soil properties with representative farm types and showed how the impact of soil fertility replenishment depends on initial soil conditions as well as the resource endowment level of the farmer. Two hundred and ten different strategies for phosphorus replenishment with different sources of phosphorus applied at various levels were analyzed for seven farm types. The farm-level analysis showed that phosphorus replenishment was generally profitable for farms with low and medium pH (4.9–6.2) soils, but not for farms with high pH (6.2–7.0) soils. A regional analysis showed that benefits were higher when phosphorus replenishment was targeted to farmers with low and medium resource endowments on low and medium pH soils rather than spread evenly across all soil and farm types.

This is due to frequent evolution and selection of virulence in pathogen overcoming the deployed race-specific resistance genes. Although the life of effective race-specific resistance genes can be prolonged by using gene combinations, an alternative approach being implemented at \{CIMMYT\} is to deploy varieties that posses adult plant resistance (APR) based on combinations of minor, slow rusting genes. When present alone, the \{APR\} genes do not confer adequate resistance especially under high disease pressure; however, combinations of 4 or 5 minor genes usually result in “near-immunity” or a high level of resistance. Although only a few \{APR\} genes are catalogued, various \{APR\} \{QTLs\} are now known and could lead to further characterization of additional genes. Four characterized genes have pleiotropic effects in conferring partial \{APR\} to all 3 rusts and powdery mildew, thus simplifying the task of breeding wheat varieties that are resistant to multiple diseases. Significant progress was made recently in developing high-yielding wheat germplasm that possesses high levels of \{APR\} to all three rusts by implementing a Mexico-Kenya shuttle breeding scheme. Parents with \{APR\} to Ug99 were hybridized with high-yielding parents that had adequate to high levels of \{APR\} to leaf rust and yellow rust. Segregating populations and advanced lines from these crosses were selected under high rust pressures in Mexico (leaf rust and yellow rust) and Kenya (Ug99 stem rust and yellow rust) to identify high-yielding progenies that possess high to adequate \{APR\} to all three rusts. International distribution of these high-yielding wheats is underway through \{CIMMYT\} international yield trials and screening nurseries. It is expected that several wheat varieties with \{APR\} to three rusts will be released and grown in various countries in the near-future that will allow determining the durability of resistance. "

At the 6th harvest, earthworm biomass was significantly lower in the treatment with no organic input than in treatments with crop residues and legume green manure. Earthworm activities did not prevent C and nutrient stocks from being significantly depleted although P, K and Ca concentrations tended to be higher than in non-inoculated treatments at the 6th harvest. Plant production was significantly increased by 36% due to earthworm inoculation in a traditional low-input rotation (maize, rice, cowpea, rice, rice, rice) with variation between − 43 and + 78%, depending on the crop and climatic conditions. In a continuous maize culture that received fertilizers for the last three crops, grain production was increased by 2.45-fold on average, due to earthworm inoculation. These results demonstrate that the maintenance of active earthworm populations was favourable to crop production during the time scale of our experiments (3 y).

Two rumen fistulated goats fed on L. leucocephala/maize stover diet (1:3, w/w) were used as donor animals for rumen liquor. Gas production from the fermentation of tree fodder legume/maize stover diets was measured in 24 and 96 h in vitro gas tests adapted to describe kinetics of fermentation based on the modified exponential model P=b(1−e−ct). Correlation and simple and multiple regression analysis were used to test relationships between gas production parameters and chemical composition and in vivo data. Potential gas production (b), the rate constant (c) and gas volumes were negatively correlated to digestible organic matter intake (DOMI) and organic matter digestibility.

During this period, 98% of the deforestation occurred. Some 1800 settler families continue to convert forest into pasture in a system based on the slash-and-burn agriculture and dual-purpose cattle production. Trends in carbon emissions and plant species losses during the 20-year history of Theobroma were analyzed by combining observed shifts in land-use types with estimates for the carbon stocks and plant species richness of each of these types. Carbon stocks declined from about 200 t ha−1 in the forest to 28 t ha−1 in the pasture and of 326 plant species encountered in the forest, only 20 remained in pastures (along with 66 species not found in forests). The effects of converting more than 93 000 ha of forest into other uses over 20 years include approximate losses of 14 million tons of C to the atmosphere and substantial losses of plant species. Land use alternatives that would store more C include agroforestry and – given the strong incentives for settlers to convert lands into pasture –improving pasture management or developing silvopastoral systems. Plant species conservation may be improved with proposed ways to add private value to the forest. "

Germination in other treatments involving partial removal of the seed coat was higher than that of unscarified seed in the nursery, although laboratory values were nearly the same. Seeds whose seed coat was completely removed germinated poorly (5–16%), as a result of rapid water uptake which caused damage to internal seed structures.

As a result, smallholder farmers end up selling their grain soon after harvest, only to buy it back at an expensive price just a few months after harvest, falling in a poverty trap. The potential impact on poverty reduction and greater livelihood security will not be realized, however, if farmers are unable to store grains and sell surplus production at attractive prices. Apart from causing quantitative losses, pests in stored grain are also linked to aflatoxin contamination and poisoning. To address this problem, a metal silo was developed as a valid option and proven effective in protecting stored grains from attack by storage insect pests. A metal silo is a cylindrical structure, constructed from a galvanized iron sheet and hermetically sealed, killing any insect pests that may be present. The impact of metal silo technology in Africa, Asia and Latin America includes, improving food security, empowering smallholder farmers, enhancing income opportunities and job creation, and safeguarding the agro-ecosystems. The metal silo can be fabricated in different sizes, 100 kg–3000 kg holding capacity by trained local artisans, with the corresponding prices of $35 to $375. The use of metal silo, therefore, should be encouraged in order to prevent storage losses and enhance food security in developing countries. "

Each treatment was fertilized with 120 kg N ha−1 as urea [(NH2)2CO] or not fertilized. The soils used in the mesocosms were obtained from a three-year old-field experiment in which the same treatments as in the mesocosm were applied annually. No crops were grown in both the mesocosms and the thee-year field experiment. Soil samples were collected at zero, two, five and eight months after installation of the mesocosms and separated into four aggregate size fractions by wet sieving. Macroaggregates were further fractionated to isolate the microaggregates-within-macroaggregates; all soils and fractions were analyzed for \{SOC\} and N. The addition of \{ORs\} increased soil aggregation and whole \{SOC\} and soil N compared to the control and sole N fertilizer treatments. There were no differences among different \{OR\} qualities for whole \{SOC\} or soil N, but maize alone resulted in greater mean weight diameter (MWD), macroaggregate \{SOC\} and N than sole added Calliandra. The addition of N fertilizer only influenced \{SOC\} and soil N dynamics in combination with maize where SOC, soil N and aggregation were lower with the addition of N fertilizer, indicating an increased decomposition and loss of \{SOC\} and soil N due to a faster aggregate turnover after addition of N fertilizer. In conclusion, compared to high quality ORs, low quality \{ORs\} result in greater aggregate stability and a short-term accumulation of macroaggregate \{SOC\} and N. However, the addition of N fertilizers negates these effects of low quality ORs. "

The experiment involved two treatments: (a) sole crops of rice and cowpea in annual rotation and (b) intercropping of annual crops between inga contour hedgerows 4 m apart, replicated three times in a randomised block design. Non-replicated plots of bare-fallow and secondary forest were also monitored for soil loss and runoff. Contour hedgerow intercropping conserved, on average annually, 287 mm water and 73 t ha−1 soil, which represented 83% and 93% respectively of the amounts that were lost from sole cropping; it maintained soil nutrients at a much higher level and improved soil physical conditions compared with sole cropping of annuals. The significant soil and water conservation achieved by hedgerows, however, did not translate into a striking crop yield increase during the 5 year monitoring period; only the yields of three out of 15 crops in the last 2 years were significantly higher in hedgerow intercropping than in sole cropping. The lack of response was partly due to the fact that 22% of the land area was lost to the hedgerows and partly that a longer time span may be required to realise the benefits of soil conservation. However, contour hedgerow intercropping is recommended for moderate sloping lands of the humid tropics in Peru, considering the long-term conservation of land resource and the potential for continuous cropping with minimal inputs.

This increase, which represented the amount of protected soil organic carbon (SOC), was much higher in soil under pasture than under market gardening cultivation. There was a positive correlation between the amount of protected \{SOC\} and total \{SOC\} content. The rate of decay of the protected \{SOC\} seemed to be slightly higher than the rate of decay of the unprotected SOC. Because Vertisol is a clayey soil dominated by 2/1 clays, it showed a high capacity to protect mineralisable \{SOC\} from mineralisation in macro-aggregates compared with literature results. Even if the protected \{SOC\} in aggregates amounted to less than 10% of the total SOC, it represented more than 50% of the mineralisable \{SOC\} of a pasture soil.

abstract = "The assumed relationship between biodiversity or local richness and the persistence of ‘ecosystem services’ (that can sustain productivity on-site as well as off-site, e.g. through regulation of water flow and storage) in agricultural landscapes has generated considerable interest and a range of experimental approaches. The abstraction level aimed for, however, may be too high to yield meaningful results. Many of the experiments on which evidence in favour or otherwise are based are artificial and do not support the bold generalisations to other spatial and temporal scales that are often made. Future investigations should utilise co-evolved communities, be structured to investigate the distinct roles of clearly defined functional groups, separate the effects of between- and within-group diversity and be conducted over a range of stress and disturbance situations. An integral part of agricultural intensification at the plot level is the deliberate reduction of diversity. This does not necessarily result in impairment of ecosystem services of direct relevance to the land user unless the hypothesised diversity–function threshold is breached by elimination of a key functional group or species. Key functions may also be substituted with petro-chemical energy in order to achieve perceived efficiencies in the production of specific goods. This can result in the maintenance of ecosystem services of importance to agricultural production at levels of biodiversity below the assumed ‘functional threshold’. However, it can also result in impairment of other services and under some conditions the de-linking of the diversity–function relationship. Avoidance of these effects or attempts to restore non-essential ecosystem services are only likely to be made by land users at the plot scale if direct economic benefit can be thereby achieved. At the plot and farm scales biodiversity is unlikely to be maintained for purposes other than those of direct use or ‘utilitarian’ benefits and often at levels lower than those necessary for maintenance of many ecosystem services. The exceptions may be traditional systems where intrinsic values (social customs) continue to provide reasons for diversity maintenance. High levels of biodiversity in managed landscapes are more likely to be maintained for reasons of intrinsic, serependic (‘option’ or ‘bequest’) values or utilitarian (‘direct use’) than for functional or ecosystem service values. The major opportunity for both maintaining ecosystem services and biodiversity outside conservation areas lies in promoting diversity of land-use at the landscape and farm rather than field scale. This requires, however, an economic and policy climate that favours diversification in land uses and diversity among land users. "

Therefore, we carried out an on-farm assessment of the energy consumption for food preparation, the biomass availability relevant to conventional and pyrolytic cook stoves, and the potential biochar generation in rural households of western Kenya. Biomass availability for pyrolysis varied widely from 0.7 to 12.4 Mg ha−1 y−1 with an average of 4.3 Mg ha−1 y−1, across all 50 studied farms. Farms with high soil fertility that were recently converted to agriculture from forest had the highest variability (CV = 83%), which was a result of the wide range of farm sizes and feedstock types in the farms. Biomass variability was two times lower for farms with low than high soil fertility (CV = 37%). The reduction in variability is a direct consequence of the soil quality, coupled with farm size and feedstock type. The total wood energy available in the farms (5.3 GJ capita−1 y−1) was not sufficient to meet the current cooking energy needs using conventional combustion stoves, but may be sufficient for improved combustion stoves depending on their energy efficiency. However, the biomass that is usable in pyrolytic cook stoves including crop residues, shrub and tree litter can provide 17.2 GJ capita−1 y−1 of energy for cooking, which is well above the current average cooking energy consumption of 10.5 GJ capita−1 y−1. The introduction of a first-generation pyrolytic cook stove reduced wood energy consumption by 27% while producing an average of 0.46 Mg ha−1 y−1 of biochar. "

Awareness has been increasing that much of this erosion may be due to tillage operations rather than water-induced soil movement. This field study estimated soil translocation and tillage erosion for four tillage systems on Oxisols with slope gradients of 16–22% at Claveria, Misamis Oriental, Philippines. Soil movement was estimated using `soil movement tracers' (SMT) which consisted of painted 12-mm hexagonal steel nuts. The \{SMT\} were buried in three replicate plots of the following tillage treatments: (1) contour moldboard plowing in the open field (MP-open); (2) contour ridge tillage in the open field (RT-open); (3) contour moldboard plowing plus contour natural grass barrier strips (MP-strip); and (4) contour natural grass barrier strips plus ridge tillage (RT-strip). Two hundred \{SMT\} were placed at the 5-cm depth at 5-cm spacings on 10 rows and 20 columns in two microplots within each plot. The microplots were oriented with the boundaries running downslope and along the contour of each 8-m-wide × 38-m-long (downslope) tillage plot. After tilling the land for four successive corn (Zea mays L.) crops (20 tillage operations), the \{SMT\} were manually excavated and their positions recorded. Recovery of \{SMT\} ranged from 82% to 85%. Displacement of \{SMT\} was directly related to slope length, percent slope, and tillage method. Mean displacement distance of \{SMT\} during the four corn growing seasons was 3.3 m for MP-open, 1.8 m for RT-open, 1.5 m for the RT-strip, and 2.2 m for MP-strip. Based on tillage operations associated with two corn crops per year, mean annual soil flux was estimated to be 241, 131, 158 and 112 kg m−1 for MP-open, RT-open MP-strip, and RT-strip, respectively. Compared to the mean annual soil loss for MP-open of 63 Mg ha−1, soil loss was reduced by 30%, 45%, and 53% for the MP-strip, RT-open, and RT-strip systems, respectively. Both ridge tillage and natural grass barrier strips reduced soil displacement, soil translocation flux, and tillage erosion rates. "

Eleven insect species belonging to 11 genera were collected and identified. A further four heteropteran and two lepidopteran species have not yet been identified. A leaf beetle, Mesoplatys ochroptera (Stal.), caused severe defoliation of Sesbania spp. and an unidentified lepidopteran caterpillar species fed gregariously on Sesbania spp., also causing considerable defoliation. In February 1991 a severe outbreak of the scale insect, Macropulvinaria inopheron (Laing), occurred on six species of multipurpose trees and on Cajanus cajan (L.) growing in the surrounding home gardens. Some of the pest species found feeding on the multipurpose trees are also known to cause minor or occasional economic damage to field crops. The remainder of the species are either of no known pest status or natural enemies of other fauna. The purpose of agroforestry systems and the likely effects of such systems on pests and disease are outlined. Some of the factors that are likely to influence pest severity and may be altered by crop/tree mixed cropping systems are also described. Past research findings on the effects of mixed cropping on pest incidence and damage to crops are reviewed. Economic implications of the occurrence of an important multipurpose tree and/or field crop pest in agroforestry system have also been examined to illustrate the need to incorporate some aspects of pest management in agroforestry research programmes.

Based on climate projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this study quantified groundwater recharge under irrigated agriculture in response to variations of atmospheric \{CO2\} concentrations (550 and 970 ppm) and average daily temperature (+1.1 and +6.4 °C compared to current conditions). \{HYDRUS\} 1D, a model used to simulate water movement in unsaturated, partially saturated, or fully saturated porous media, was used to simulate the impact of climate change on vadose zone hydrologic processes and groundwater recharge for three typical crop sites (alfalfa, almonds and tomatoes) in the San Joaquin watershed in California. Plant growth with the consideration of elevated atmospheric \{CO2\} concentration was simulated using the heat unit theory. A modified version of the Penman–Monteith equation was used to account for the effects of elevated atmospheric \{CO2\} concentration. Irrigation amount and timing was based on crop potential evapotranspiration. The results of this study suggest that increases in atmospheric \{CO2\} and average daily temperature may have significant effects on groundwater recharge. Increasing temperature caused a temporal shift in plant growth patterns and redistributed evapotranspiration and irrigation water use earlier in the growing season resulting in a decrease in groundwater recharge under alfalfa and almonds and an increase under tomatoes. Elevating atmospheric \{CO2\} concentrations generally decreased groundwater recharge for all crops due to decreased evapotranspiration resulting in decreased irrigation water use. Increasing average daily temperature by 1.1 and 6.4 °C and atmospheric \{CO2\} concentration to 550 and 970 ppm led to a decrease in cumulative groundwater recharge for most scenarios. Overall, the results indicate that groundwater recharge may be very sensitive to potential future climate changes. "

P. fortunei and A. acuminata established well at two experimental sites (Naro Moru and Thika), and basal stem diameter, diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height were comparable to G. robusta. P. fortunei was leafless for approximately three months during the annual cycle, partly during the cropping season, providing potential benefits for associated crops. A. acuminata shed some leaves during the dry season in August and September, while G. robusta was evergreen. The presence of trees affected maize growth and yield 2.5 years after planting to an extent which depended on tree species and location. A positive interaction between A. acuminata and maize was apparent at Thika, but growth was suppressed in the first two crop rows at Naro Moru. G. robusta reduced maize yield by 36% close to the tree rows at Thika, whereas yield reductions were negligible adjacent to P. fortunei.

In this paper we present results of a household survey conducted during October 2010 in Kibera slums in Nairobi, Kenya. The results revealed that widely various household characteristics influence demand for charcoal and briquettes for cooking. In addition to these factors, the household income level affects the use of kerosene for cooking. At the same time, we found the fact households tend to switch to multiple fuels strategy as their increasing in income instead of completely switching from the consumption of traditional fuels to modern energy sources.

abstract = "Trees dispersed in pastures are a prominent feature of many Central American landscapes, particularly in cattle producing regions where farmers retain trees to serve as shade, fodder, timber and firewood. The presence of dispersed trees in pastures is often considered as important for the conservation of biodiversity by providing habitat and enhancing landscape connectivity. However, despite their critical productive and environmental roles, little is known about tree distribution within pastures or how farmers’ management decisions influence the trees themselves and their impact on farm productivity and biodiversity conservation. Here, we present a synthesis of (a) the abundance, composition, and size of dispersed trees in four important cattle producing regions of Costa Rica (Caňas and Río Frío) and Nicaragua (Rivas and Matiguás), based on inventory of 18,669 trees on 1492 ha of pasture, (b) the local knowledge, management and use of trees by cattle farmers, and (c) opportunities for ensuring sustainable management of dispersed trees in pasture-dominated landscapes. Dispersed trees were common in all four landscapes, with mean frequency ranging from 8.0 trees ha−1 in Caňas to 33.4 trees ha−1 in Matiguás. A total of 255 tree species were found in pastures across the four landscapes. The total number of tree species per landscape varied from 72 in Rivas to 101 in Caňas and Rio Frio, with mean species richness per farm ranging from 22.9 in Rio Frio to 45.9 in Matiguás. In all four landscapes, a handful of tree species dominated the pastures, with the ten most abundant species in each landscape accounting for &gt;70% of all trees recorded. Most of these common tree species provide fruits or foliage eaten by cattle, or are important timber or firewood species, and are deliberately retained by farmers for these uses. In all four landscapes, farmers had a detailed knowledge of tree attributes affecting pasture and animal productivity, and influenced tree cover through pasture management activities and occasional tree cutting. Current farm management practices are gradually decreasing the diversity of trees in pastures, and in some cases also tree density, reducing their contribution to farm productivity and biodiversity conservation. To reverse this trend, incentives are required to encourage cattle farmers to retain and enhance tree cover in pastures, through the adoption of pasture management practices that favor the regeneration and persistence of a diverse range of tree species.

We identify four systemic barriers to conservation in China that contribute to this poor integration: weak rule of law; unclear land tenure; top down government authority; and disconnects between scientific research and management implementation. To advance China toward an environmentally secure future, we suggest that combining traditional Chinese environmental values with contemporary science and international conservation practices will help to create a ‘Conservation with Chinese Characteristics’. We do not believe that traditional values should replace modern science and management. Rather, we suggest that, given the cultural and political conditions in China today, using traditional values to frame contemporary environmental science and ecosystem-based management may create stronger societal support for conservation implementation.

Two storage conditions/methods were evaluated, one representing a proposed storage method (SM 1), the other mimicking storage conditions characteristic to the Xishuangbanna region (SM 2). Furthermore, \{RSO\} storage was evaluated by testing \{RSO\} acid levels over a 2-month period, under standard storage conditions. Seeds from \{SM\} 2 displayed increased seed pile temperatures, higher levels of Mildew infection, lower seed oil content and higher acid levels. Low seed oil content and high acid values of \{SM\} 2 were resultant of the high Mildew infection and increased seed pile temperatures. In addition, a critical value of 90% relative humidity of seed piles was identified, above which Mildew infection increased sharply. Storage of crude \{RSO\} resulted in increased acid values. This data shows that in order to reduce high acid values, seed pile temperature, humidity and Mildew infections need to be kept to a minimum, as well as the storage time of the seeds and the RSO. "

In this study we investigate how marriage and inheritance patterns affect tree-planting behavior by gender in two villages. Results show that tree planting by men may indeed be dissuaded by uxorilocal marriage patterns. Furthermore, tree planting by married women is not necessarily promoted under uxorilocal patterns. Rather, a high incidence of non-married women appears to be associated with increased tree planting by women. "

In this study, we investigated the effects of grazing on \{CH4\} uptake during the growing season in three types of steppe (meadow steppe, typical steppe and desert steppe and) in Inner Mongolia, China, to quantify and compare \{CH4\} uptake in steppe ecosystems under different grazing management conditions. The \{CH4\} fluxes were measured using an automatic cavity ring-down spectrophotometer at three steppe locations that differed primarily in grazing intensity. The results indicated that steppe soils were \{CH4\} sinks throughout the growing season. \{CH4\} uptake at all sites averaged 7.98 kg CH4-C ha−1 yr−1 (ranging from 1.53 to 18.74 kg CH4-C ha−1 yr−1), of which approximately 43.8% occurred in the desert steppe. \{CH4\} uptake in the desert steppe increased 20.4% and 51.2% compared with the typical steppe and meadow steppe, respectively. Light grazing (LG) of steppe did not significantly change \{CH4\} uptake compared with un-grazed (UG) steppe, but moderate and heavy grazing (MG, HG) reduced \{CH4\} uptake significantly (by 6.8–37.9%, P &lt; 0.05). These findings imply that reducing the grazing pressure on steppe would help increase the atmospheric \{CH4\} sinks in steppe soils. Our results suggest that \{HG\} exerts a considerable negative impact on \{CH4\} uptake in a continental steppe. Further studies involving year-round, intensive measurements of \{CH4\} uptake are needed. "

This paper examines patterns of association between household wealth, poverty, and livelihood dependency either on forest extraction or agricultural activities in Ucayali, Peru. The analysis is based on survey data of 578 households with geographical, ethnic and environmental heterogeneity. A typology of economic strategies was defined through relative income shares derived from agriculture, forest, wages and other income sources. Our results show that households have multifaceted livelihood systems. While forest/environmental products provide nearly 40% of total income, agriculture is critical to both indigenous communities and to farmers of non-Amazonian origin. We test the hypothesis that households relying on agriculture are wealthier than forest-dependent households. In addition, we examine the role played by ethnicity and location as interacting variables. The analysis suggests a strong role of specific ethnic and locational configurations in shaping income and asset patterns, with some weak evidence of statistically lower poverty levels being credited to dependency on forest products. Context-specific assessments of livelihood–environment interactions provide critical insights to development and environmental policies and programs, which need to recognize different forms through which households integrate forest use and agriculture.

This paper reports of a study undertaken in Malawi to determine the occurrence and distribution of Aflatoxigenic Aspergilli in the soil and \{AFB1\} contamination in groundnuts. A total of 1397 groundnut samples collected from farm homesteads, local markets, warehouses and shops in 2008 and 2009 were analyzed for \{AFB1\} contamination using the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and A. Aspergilli population densities in 1053 soil samples collected from the same sites were estimated using serial dilutions plated on A. Aspergilli medium. Farmer socio-economic profile information was also collected to determine relationships to \{AFB1\} contamination. The results revealed 46% and 23% of the total samples, from 2008 to 2009, respectively, had \{AFB1\} contamination levels greater than 4 ppb, and those above 20 ppb were 21% for 2008 and 8% for 2009, respectively. Fitted smooth curve relationships show that there is a clear increase in the chance of groundnut contamination when the population density of A. Aspergilli in the soil increased beyond 3000 (log (cfu) &gt; 8). The measured level of A. Aspergilli in soil varied by location, as well as ecologies within location. Low-altitude ecologies, which were warmer and experienced low precipitation levels, had the highest densities of A. Aspergilli, whereas cooler high-altitude ecologies had the lowest density of these fungi. Similarly high \{AFB1\} contamination, was recorded across the country with 11–28% of all samples collected from the warm low to mid-altitude ecologies recording contamination ≥20 ppb and low contamination (2–10% of samples) in the mid to high altitude cool ecologies. From a crop management perspective, this study also suggests that both less experienced and older farmers were more likely to produce groundnuts contaminated with aflatoxin. These findings have implications in the design of intervention strategies to avoid short- and long-term human health effects from aflatoxin exposure. "

We conducted household surveys and ecological surveys in and near two settlements to assess both fuelwood consumption and existing above ground biomass of R. arboreum. According to local residents, this species contributes 20–25% to household fuelwood requirements, while forest surveys and a survey of freshly cut stumps indicate that 15% of trees felled for fuelwood were R. arboreum. Trees were mostly young, comprised about 20% of all tree species in the forest, and accounted for 70.41 × 103 kg ha−1 biomass in average. The biomass of felled trees was calculated as 8.71 × 103 kg ha−1 at the time of study. Simulation based on the current rates of extraction and increment showed that the species will be in a critical condition in future at most of the monitored sites. In some places however, biomass was found to increase in spite of ongoing extraction. The results indicate that there is an urgent need of forest management which in a first step can be achieved through rotational harvesting that allows forest stands to regenerate and build up biomass. In addition, depletion of rhododendron stands can be reduced by economic development through ecotourism on the theme of rhododendrons, and by providing access to alternative sources of energy. "

Thus, the aims of this study are to identify which factors influence the percentage seed oil of Camellia reticulata, a by investigating both seed and environmental variables. Firstly, fruit traits were studied and correlated against percentage seed oil data, and then environmental variables linked to seed oil production were investigated. The first experiments analyzed how well fruit characteristics (size, length, weight, seed number, seed oil) of the Camellia plants predict percentage seed oil. The second experiment modelled the effect of environmental variables (soil, elevation, temperature and rainfall) on seed oil production. The results indicated that the kernel ratio per fruit, seed weight to fruit weight ratio and fruit weight positively influenced percentage seed oil while, when these previous effects are accounted for, the number of seeds reduced percentage seed oil. The environmental model showed that seed oil was influenced most strongly by elevation and soil type, with haplic Acrisols providing the highest seed oil. Thus it is clear that Camellia seed oil is affected by a variety of factors, and these should be taken into account when selecting species and cultivars for the planting of Camellia stands for oil production.

One of Santoni's glass plate multi-cameras was used, with focal length of 178 mm and with a flight height of 4000–4500 m a.s.l., which resulted in an approximate scale of 1:11,500 for the central photograph and 1:16,000 to 1:18,000 for the low-oblique APs. The surveyors oriented themselves with maps of Ethiopia at 1:400,000 scale, compiled in 1934. The flights present a dense \{AP\} coverage of Northern Ethiopia, where they were acquired in the context of upcoming battles with the Ethiopian army. Several flights preceded the later advance of the Italian army southwards to the capital Addis Ababa. Further flights took place in central Ethiopia for civilian purposes. As of 1936, the \{APs\} were used to prepare topographic maps at 1:100,000 and 1:50,000 scales. To re-process the imagery using novel techniques, procedures using digital image-based modelling have been developed. The 1935-1941 \{APs\} together with those of 1958–1964, 1994 and recent high-resolution satellite imagery are currently being used in spatio-temporal analysis, including change studies of land cover, land management and geomorphology in Ethiopia over a time span of 80 years.

This is also true for the utilization of public lands, including forest reserves in the northern uplands that are often settled by ethnic minorities. There are, however, instances of change in land policies and regulations and in the way decisions and plans are made. Doi Mae Salong (DMS) in Northern Thailand, where there is a trend towards land use for conservation purposes, is a case in point. This paper aims to explore decision-making by farmers in \{DMS\} in the context of changing land regulations and policies from the 1950s to the present. The Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, together with a historical perspective and with narratives on land management through time, were applied by using in-depth interviews of key informants and group farmers’ discussions as tools. The time period under investigation was divided into three periods of change: The first period, before the year 1960, was an era of security concern. In contrast, the second period, from 1961 to 1996, was an era of emerging conservation priorities. Finally, the third period, from 1997 to the present, is an era of lessons learned from the conservation era. Land use decision outcomes reveal that the decision-making processes of farmers are influenced both by the hierarchical decisions of higher authorities and by horizontal linkages among multiple stakeholders. However, while farmers participate readily in forest conservation activities, they do not play an active role in the process of changing policies. "

In agriculture, estimates of \{ET\} are frequently used to monitor droughts, schedule irrigation, and assess crop water productivity over large areas. Currently, in situ measurements of \{ET\} are difficult to scale up for regional applications, so remote sensing technology has been increasingly used to estimate crop ET. Ratio-based vegetation indices retrieved from optical remote sensing, like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index, and Enhanced Vegetation Index are critical components of these models, particularly for the partitioning of \{ET\} into transpiration and soil evaporation. These indices have their limitations, however, and can induce large model bias and error. In this study, micrometeorological and spectroradiometric data collected over two growing seasons in cotton, maize, and rice fields in the Central Valley of California were used to identify spectral wavelengths from 428 to 2295 nm that produced the highest correlation to and lowest error with ET, transpiration, and soil evaporation. The analysis was performed with hyperspectral narrowbands (HNBs) at 10 nm intervals and multispectral broadbands (MSBBs) commonly retrieved by Earth observation platforms. The study revealed that (1) \{HNB\} indices consistently explained more variability in \{ET\} (ΔR2 = 0.12), transpiration (ΔR2 = 0.17), and soil evaporation (ΔR2 = 0.14) than \{MSBB\} indices; (2) the relationship between transpiration using the ratio-based index most commonly used for \{ET\} modeling, NDVI, was strong (R2 = 0.51), but the hyperspectral equivalent was superior (R2 = 0.68); and (3) soil evaporation was not estimated well using ratio-based indices from the literature (highest \{R2\} = 0.37), but could be after further evaluation, using ratio-based indices centered on 743 and 953 nm (R2 = 0.72) or 428 and 1518 nm (R2 = 0.69).

Herbicide applications controlling the undergrowth may increase erosion potential and carbon export by decreasing plant and litter cover. Quantitative evaluation of the erodibility of rubber systems and the impact of herbicides has not been studied. This study aimed at assessing the impact of herbicide application on soil loss and the induced carbon export in a rubber plantation. Runoff, sediment yield, and total organic carbon (TOC) content in sediments were measured under natural rainfall for one year in a 12-year old rubber plantation subjected to three different herbicide treatments: i) standard application twice per year practiced by the majority of farmers (Hs); (ii) no application to maintain a high understory plant cover (H −); and (iii) bimonthly application (adopted by some farmers) in order to largely avoid understory plant cover (H +). The infiltration rate under different treatments was measured with a rainfall simulator. Monthly measurements of fine root density using soil coring, surface cover, and understory plant cover making photography were carried out. The highest soil and \{TOC\} in sediment losses (425 g m− 2, 15 g C m− 2 respectively) were observed under H + treatment, while under H − treatment they were strongly reduced (50 g m− 2 and 2 g C m− 2 respectively). Compared to Hs, H + increased soil and sediment \{TOC\} loss by 34 and 52%, while H − reduced soil and \{TOC\} loss, both by 82%. Notably, H − presented high conservation efficiency, reducing sediment yields by 86% for highly erosive rainfall events. The cover and management (C) factor and support practice factor (P) are essential components of the common Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) model. We combined the C and P factors into a single value (CP) and, for the first time, derived estimations of annual \{CP\} values for a rubber plantation (0.005–0.04) using our data. The dynamic change of the \{CP\} factor of plantations during the rainy season was quantified by relating relative soil loss to changes in understory plant cover (PC), which can be expressed as \{CP\} = 0.04e− 0.028PC (R2 = 0.88, P &lt; 0.0001). Understory plant cover as affected by herbicide application was thus a key factor controlling the soil loss of established rubber systems. This suggests options to improve the soil conservation and biodiversity through reduced herbicide management. "

With the increasing shifts in evaluation purposes from judging program worth to understanding how programs work, the evaluator’s role is changing to that of facilitating stakeholders in a learning process. This involves clarifying purposes and choices, as well as unearthing critical assumptions. In such a role, evaluators become major tool-users and begin to innovate with small refinements or produce completely new tools to fit a specific challenge or context. We interrogate the form and function of 12 tools used by evaluators when working with complex evaluands and complex contexts. The form is described in terms of traditional qualitative techniques and particular characteristics of the elements, use and presentation of each tool. Then the function of each tool is analyzed with respect to articulating assumptions and affecting the agency of evaluators and stakeholders in complex contexts. "

Excessive browsing by animals, branch lopping and pod harvesting, have critically reduced the natural regeneration in some areas which exposes it to challenges due to dependence upon natural regeneration. The objective of this research was to evaluate response of Faidherbia albida provenances from eastern (Taveta Wangingombe) and southern Africa (Lupaso, Kuiseb Manapools) to different watering regimes to aid in selection of provenances for domestication. The observed difference in growth was analyzed to determine whether they are genetic or environmentally induced. Genotype  ×  interaction were significant at ( p ≤ 0.001, p ≤ 0.05) in seedling height, diameter and leaf numbers. Seedling height (r=0.94 p=0.001) recorded the highest correlation coefficient among all the growth variables analyzed. The growth variation was greater for seedling height than that of diameter and leaf numbers (h 2 =0.97). Hierarchical cluster analysis grouped the provenances into three clusters with cluster iii consisting of Taveta, Kuiseb and Lupaso while cluster ii and i composed of Wangingombe and Manapools respectively. Manapools recorded the highest genetic distance from Taveta, Kuiseb and Lupaso at 84.55 units. Wangingombe and Manapools are closely related genetically at a distance of 7.32. The maximum inter-cluster distance between cluster i and iii indicated wider genetic diversity between the provenances in these clusters and selection should be from this clusters for hybridization program to achieve novel breeds.

At the same time, demographic changes in rural areas due to changes in reproduction patterns and the emigration of younger population segments have affected land-use strategies. We identified proximate causes and underlying drivers that influence the decisions of farm households to plant trees on former cropland with Bayesian networks (BNs). \{BNs\} allow the incorporation of causal relationships in data analysis and can combine qualitative stakeholder knowledge with quantitative data. We defined the structure of the network with expert knowledge and in-depth discussions with land users. The network was calibrated and validated with data from a survey of 509 rural households in two upland areas of Yunnan Province in Southwest China. The results substantiate the influence of land endowments, labor availability and forest policies for switching from cropland to tree planting. State forest policies have constituted the main underlying driver to the forest transition in the past, but private afforestation activities increasingly dominate the expansion of tree cover. Farmers plant trees on private incentives mainly to cash in on the improved economic opportunities provided by tree crops, but tree planting also constitutes an important strategy to adjust to growing labor scarcities.

The goal of this research was to assess the extent to which farmers have incorporated their observations of native species and ecological processes into farm management practices in a hillside agroforestry system of western Honduras. The system incorporates slash-and-mulch of native vegetation (rather than slash-and-burn cultivation, which was widely practiced in the area before 1990), and the retention of trees within cropping fields. Information on farmer knowledge was elicited primarily through semi-structured interviews with 20 farmers. Farmers interviewed distinguish several local soil types on the basis of soil texture, colour, structure and stone content, with each soil type having varying suitability for the major crops grown in the district (maize, beans, sorghum and pasture). The most highly valued tree species are those that fulfil multiple economic and agricultural functions, including having a positive influence on soil quality through decomposition, nutrient cycling, and provision of soil cover. In particular, species with small, fine leaves that gave dappled shade (rather than solid shade) and decomposed rapidly were preferred. Farmers named 16 commonly recognised, distinct soil macrofauna taxa. The most detailed knowledge on the relationship between soil fauna and soil quality was held on taxa considered to have either beneficial or harmful effects on farming activities, such as earthworms and beetle larvae. Farmers had complex understanding of the influence of fire on soils, vegetation, crop yield and soil biota over various lengths of time, which may have been gained through a combination of first-hand experience, interaction with agricultural extension workers, and information gained from other farmers. It is likely that local ecological knowledge of the effect of different species on soil quality, the interactions among species, and the role of vegetation in maintaining agricultural productivity and landscape integrity, is an important component of the adoption and success of the agroforestry system.

When seedlings were raised at Zomba, there were significant differences in germination capacity and height, root collar diameter and biomass production at six months of age.

The system performance analysis methods of [The ‘dark side’ of intercropping: manipulation of soil resources. In: Sinoquet, H., Cruz, P.

Environ. 80 (2000) 87] were used as well as mechanistic research into availability, uptake and balances of below ground resources. The Calliandra–maize system performed worse than sole maize (I=−66%, according to Ong’s method) Calliandra affected the less limiting resource nitrogen (N) positively, but the negative effect of Calliandra on P-availability, the main limitation of the environment outweighed the positive or fertility effect, according to Kho’s performance analysis method. However, after P application, when the main limiting resource for maize in our environment shifted to N, the Calliandra had still only a marginal positive effect on maize yields (insignificant 5% increase of alley-cropping compared to sole maize). This was explained by a negative total N balance in the soil of −30 kg ha−1, and a negative inorganic N balance in the soil of −277 kg ha−1 over the seven seasons. The difference between total and inorganic N balance was due to a mineralisation of only 20% of the N in all the Calliandra mulch applied over the seven seasons. Net negative nutrient balances also explain the general trend of decreasing yields of 40–90% over the seven seasons. We conclude that the combination of Ong’s simple method, Kho’s resource-base explanation and further investigation of long-term supply and availability of the resources that are the main limitation(s) of an environment can give an understanding needed to create productive and sustainable alley-cropping systems.

We studied the effect of P application on growth, nutrient uptake and dry matter partitioning in young trees of Calliandra calothyrsus, Cedrela serrulata, Eucalyptus grandis, Grevillea robusta, Markhamia lutea, Senna spectabilis, and Sesbania sesban on a P-deficient soil (Kandiudalfic Eutrudox, bicarbonate-EDTA extractable P = 1 mg kg−1) in western Kenya. The trees were grown at two P levels (control and 500 kg added P ha−1) at 1 m2 spacing in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Leaf K concentrations were in the low range for all species (5–9 mg g−1) and K deficiency may have limited responses to P. Averaged over species, P addition increased aboveground shoot dry matter by a factor of 2.6 at 62 and 124 days, but the response decreased to 1.3 at 325 days. The increases at 62 days were large in sesbania (5.4) and eucalyptus (3.2) but small in calliandra (1.4) and markhamia (1.1). Relative response to P was more strongly correlated with shoot growth rate per unit root length among species than with shoot growth rate alone. Calliandra, which had high early growth rate but low response to added P, had an exceptionally high root length (6.0 km m−2) compared with the other species (0.3–2.1 km m−2). P addition increased N and P content but decreased final shoot K content in sesbania and calliandra, and had little effect on K content in the other species. The high-yielding species (eucalyptus, sesbania and calliandra) accumulated more than 30 g N and 2 g P m−2 in shoots in 325 days of growth. The proportion of total shoot N in wood (branch + stem) was in a higher range (67–75%) in the shrubby species (sesbania, calliandra, senna) than in the upperstorey tree species (38–43%). Slow early shoot growth relative to total root length, and high specific root length (root length per unit root mass) are proposed as criteria for the selection of species and provenances that are well adapted to P deficient soils.

Uapaca kirkiana is reported from most countries within the Zambezian centre of endemism and adjacent transitional phytochoria. The species has been recorded growing in Angola, Burundi, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Within the natural range, occurrence is related to a unimodal rainfall regime with an annual range of 500–1400 mm occurring over a 4–5 month period followed by a long dry season lasting 5–7 months. The mean day time temperature range is 18–29°C in the hot season and 12–24°C in winter. Typically Uapaca kirkiana grows in well-drained escarpments at altitudes of 500–2000 m, with infertile sand or gravelly soils of acidic reaction. As a miombo species, it occurs in mixed communities of Brachystegia-Julbernardia woodland as dominant or co-dominant species, often gregarious, forming dense groves, commonly referred to as Uapaca woodlands. Throughout the range, listings of associated woody species frequently include Albizia, Anisophyllea, Brachystegia, Burkea, Isoberlinia, Uulbernardia, Monotes, Parinari, Protea, Pericopis, Pterocarpus, Ochna and other Uapaca spp. Attention is drawn to various relationships with mycorrhizae and animals (including man) and their significance in conservation and management options. Definitive studies aimed at generating relevant data to aid husbandry action are outlined. Suggestions for positive management prescriptions and domestication initiatives are made. "

Then, holding the current irrigation supplies, we adopted Bayesian formula to estimate magnitude of the future water availability and the associated probability of crops yields being decreased to rainfall-deficiency under climate conditions in 2030s (2020–2040) based on the RegCM3 climate model output driven by \{IPCC\} \{SRES\} \{A1B\} scenario. Results reveal that future drought stress would overwhelm the irrigation capacity of current supplies in northern and western China, while drought remains at baseline climate levels in the central, eastern and southern regions.

We examine how economic incentives vary across the three scenarios and how payments for \{CO2\} sequestration and offsets affect incentives. We find that \{SFM\} is risky for forest managers and is highly sensitive to revenues from initial thinning; that carbon revenues can lower some of the risks and improve the economics of SFM; but that carbon revenues are effective in incentivizing management changes only if yield response to thinning is moderately high. Energy production from stem wood is too low value to compete with timber, even with revenues from \{CO2\} offsets. However, conversion of existing forests into short rotation species for timber rather than energy is more profitable than any scenario considered here, highlighting the need for regulatory innovations to balance incentives for timber production with conservation goals. The results underscore the importance of improved public sector regulatory, planning, extension, and analysis capacity, as an enabling force for effective climate policies in China’s forestry sector.

Analyses combine downscaled rainfall forecasts, crop yield simulation, stochastic enterprise budgeting and identification of profit-maximizing fertilizer N rates and stand densities. October–February rainfall predictions were downscaled from a GCM, run with both observed and forecast sea surface temperature boundary conditions – representing upper and lower bounds of predictability – and stochastically disaggregated into daily crop model inputs. Simulated interactive effects of rainfall, N supply and stand density on yield and profit are consistent with literature. Perfect foreknowledge of daily weather for the growing season would be worth an estimated 15–30% of the average gross value of production and 24–69% of average gross margin, depending on location and on whether household labor is included in cost calculations. \{GCM\} predictions based on observed sea surface temperatures increased average gross margins 24% at Katumani and 9% at Makindu when labor cost was included. At the lead time used, forecasts using forecast sea surface temperatures are not skillful and showed near-zero value. Forecast value was much more sensitive to grain price than to input costs. Stochastic dominance analysis shows that farmers at any level of risk aversion would prefer the forecast-based management strategy over management optimized for climatology under the study’s assumptions, despite high probability (25% at Katumani, 34% at Makindu) of lower returns in individual years. Results contribute to knowledge of seasonal forecast value in a relatively high-risk, high-predictability context; utility and value of forecasts derived from a GCM; and risk implications of smallholder farmers responding to forecasts.

This paper presents evidence of increased yields and improved water productivity using conservation farming in semi-arid and dry sub-humid locations in Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia. Results are based on on-farm farmer and research managed experiments during the period 1999–2003. Grain yield of maize (Zea mays L.) and tef (Eragrostis Tef (Zucc)) from conventional (inversion) tillage are compared with \{CF\} with and without fertilizer. Rain water productivity (WPrain) is assessed for the locations, treatments and seasons. Results indicate significantly higher yields (p &lt; 0.05) for CF+ fertilizer treatments over conventional treatments in most locations, increasing from 1.2 to 2 t ha−1 with 20–120% for maize. For tef in Ethiopian locations, the yield gains nearly doubled from 0.5–0.7 to 1.1 t ha−1 for “best bet” CF+ fertilizer. \{WPrain\} improved for CF+ fertilizer treatments with \{WP\} gains of 4500–6500 m3 rainwater per t maize grain yield in the lower yield range from 0 to 2.5 t ha−1. This is explained by the large current unproductive water losses in the on-farm water balance. There was a tendency of improved \{WPrain\} in drier locations, which can be explained by the water harvesting effect obtained in the \{CF\} treatments. The experiences from East and Southern Africa presented in this paper indicate that for smallholder farmers in savannah agro-ecosystems, conservation farming first and foremost constitutes a water harvesting strategy. It is thus a non-inversion tillage strategy for in situ moisture conservation, rather than solely aimed at minimum tillage with mulch cover. Challenges for the future adoption of \{CF\} in sub-Saharan Africa include how to improve farmer awareness of \{CF\} benefits, and how to efficiently incorporate green manure/cover crops and manage weeds.

However, the definitions of satoyama are multiple and its typical forms have changed over time. This paper reviews the satoyama concept, with special reference to its evolving environmental and social significance, and its implications for sustainability of human–natural systems. The satoyama concept is characterized by multi-functionality, in which social and economic dimensions rather than ecological dimensions, dominate. Considering that the usage and management priorities of satoyama have been shaped by the evolving needs of the times, the contemporary needs of society should be accounted for in their continued management. Today satoyama have the potential to supply important ecosystem services, including the preservation of important cultural heritage, biodiversity conservation, and education. However, recognition and parameterization of potential trade-offs between these services is necessary and will require diverse site-specific strategies for sustaining satoyamas that foster new relevance, economic options and innovative management. As a socio-ecological construct, the quality and maintenance of satoyama systems will depend on the existence of adequate ecological knowledge to support the management decisions fitted to respond to current social needs. For many satoyama systems, such knowledge is inadequate. Ultimately, there is hope that the satoyama concept can be replicated elsewhere, so that land management can be tailored to the needs and capacities of the ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.

We base our analysis on a unique integrated qualitative and quantitative dataset composed of household surveys and village focus group studies carried out across a wide range of environments and agricultural systems. We identify human population growth, commercialization of the economy, and natural resource use policies, in addition to weather, as key drivers of change. We compare the agricultural and livelihood systems of male and female respondents, as well as their productive resources, organization and access to services. Women have less access than men to common property resources, as well as to cash to obtain goods or services. Women control less land than men, the land they control is often of poorer quality, and their tenure is insecure. Women engage in mutual insurance and risk-sharing networks, and benefit from non-agricultural services provided by social support institutions external to the village. Formally registered, public and private external organizations that foster agriculture and livestock production have tremendous anti-women biases, and tend to provide support primarily to men. Policies and strategies are needed to eliminate those prejudices so that men and women increase their resilience and manage well their changing environments. "

Annual and seasonal variation in litterfall have been investigated in various habitats, however, seasonality in nutrient supply is less well documented. We studied litterfall over two years and seasonal litter nutrient input over one year across a tropical disturbance gradient from mature forest to monoculture tea plantation. Total litter production in the mature forests and regenerating forests was not significantly different. However, tea plantations had significantly lower litter production. Total litterfall in forest habitats showed a clear seasonal pattern with a peak during the dry season (Mar.–May), as has been reported for other tropical seasonal forests. Contrary to expectations, there was no significant difference in litter nutrient concentrations across the disturbance gradient, although there was a substantial change in plant species composition. Litter nutrient concentrations also did not vary significantly across seasons, again contrary to our expectations. Thus, nutrient input was driven solely by the seasonal litterfall pattern. Our results suggest that at a landscape scale turnover in species composition linked to anthropogenic disturbance may not always lead to changes in litter quality, presumably because a similar spectra of leaf types may exist across communities. Seasonal litterfall patterns, which have been more commonly studied, may prove a reasonable proxy for nutrient input in forests. "

However, the availability of such data is very scarce. Cost-effective tools to measure soil properties for large areas (e.g., Europe) are required. Soil spectroscopy has shown to be a fast, cost-effective, environmental-friendly, nondestructive, reproducible, and repeatable analytical technique. The main aim of this paper is to describe the state of the art of soil spectroscopy as well as its potential to facilitating soil monitoring. The factors constraining the application of soil spectroscopy as an alternative to traditional laboratory analyses, together with the limits of the technique, are addressed. The paper also highlights that the widespread use of spectroscopy to monitor the status of the soil should be encouraged by (1) the creation of a standard for the collection of laboratory soil spectra, to promote the sharing of spectral libraries, and (2) the scanning of existing soil archives, reducing the need for costly sampling campaigns. Finally, routine soil analysis using soil spectroscopy would be beneficial for the end users by a reduction in analytical costs, and an increased comparability of results between laboratories. This ambitious project will materialize only through (1) the establishment of local and regional partnerships among existent institutions able to generate the necessary technical competence, and (2) the support of international organizations. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of United Nations and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission are well placed to promote the use of laboratory and field spectrometers for monitoring the state of soils.

The local government hopes to use eco-compensation mechanisms to promote forest restoration without forcing smallholders to forego profits. Based on a landscape productivity model for two management systems and given a range of prices, we assessed the feasibility of this concept by constructing a spatially explicit map of net present value (NPV) of rubber plantations. We found that roughly 7% of existing plantations generally had negative NPV, therefore opportunity costs would be negligible. But to restore forest in buffer zones along roads and rivers as recommended by the state government, more substantial opportunity costs were observed because these areas have high \{NPV\} values. Additionally, plantations situated above 900 m elevation or on slopes &gt; 24° were not profitable and a conversion ban should be enforced. Opportunity costs and plant species biodiversity are positively correlated, so any policy to protect species-rich areas must take this relationship into consideration. Eco-compensation schemes can feasibly promote forest restoration on marginal lands and spatially-explicit mapping of \{NPV\} can provide monetary targets to adequately recover opportunity costs for smallholders.

In this study, we conducted two field trials and a greenhouse trial to assess the influence of soil allelopathy, allelochemical volatilization, and foliage litter decomposition on seed germination and seedling growth of three native (Acmena acuminatissima, Cryptocarya concinna and Pterospermum lanceaefolium) and one introduced (Albizia lebbeck) tree species in a Eucalyptus urophylla and Pinus elliottii plantation. In order to avoid confounding factors relating to management strategies and environmental influences, only one plantation of each species was used for experimentation. In the allelopathy experiment, the root length of the three native species was significantly inhibited in the E. urophylla plantation compared with that in the P. elliottii plantation. In the volatilization experiments, the seedling survival rate of the three native species was greater in the E. urophylla plantation, but significant differences were found for A. acuminatissima and C. concinna. Root length and dry weight of P. lanceaefolium increased significantly in the E. urophylla plantation, in the foliage litter decomposition experiments. There was no significant difference between the two plantations for A. lebbeck, except that the seedling survival rate was greater in the E. urophylla plantation in the foliage litter decomposition experiment. We concluded that allelopathy in the E. urophylla plantation was selective, which inhibited the growth of the native tree species but had no significant influence on the introduced A. lebbeck species. Allelopathy from volatilization and foliage litter decomposition contributed little to the inhibitory effects. We suggest that the introduced nitrogen-fixing species, A. lebbeck could be a potential choice for the establishment of mixed stands with Eucalyptus. "

It remains unclear to what extent these strategies are generalizable or vary across regions. In this study we ask about three potential key factors influencing farming households’ ability to adapt: access to weather information, household and agricultural production-related assets, and participation in local social institutions. We use a 12-country data set from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia to explore the links between these three potential drivers of agricultural change and the likelihood that farmers made farm-associated changes, such as adopting improved crop varieties, increasing fertilizer use, investing in improved land management practices, and changing the timing of agricultural activities. We find evidence that access to weather information, assets, and participation in social institutions are associated with households that have reported making farming changes in recent years, although these results vary across countries and types of practices. Understanding these drivers and outcomes of farm-associated changes across different socio-economic and environmental conditions is critical for ongoing dialogues for climate-resilient strategies and policies for increasing the adaptive capacity of smallholders under climate change.

Accurate morphological identification of the species that cause these diseases has been difficult. In this study, we determined the phylogenetic relationships and species boundaries of Diaporthe longicolla, Diaporthe phaseolorum, Diaporthe sojae and closely related taxa. Species boundaries for this complex were determined based on combined phylogenetic analysis of five gene regions: partial sequences of calmodulin (CAL), beta-tubulin (TUB), histone-3 (HIS), translation elongation factor 1-α (EF1-α), and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that this large complex of taxa is comprised of soybean pathogens as well as species associated with herbaceous field crops and weeds. Diaporthe arctii, Diaporthe batatas, D. phaseolorum and D. sojae are epitypified. The seed decay pathogen D. longicolla was determined to be distinct from D. sojae. D. phaseolorum, originally associated with stem and leaf blight of Lima bean, was not found to be associated with soybean. A new species, Diaporthe ueckerae on Cucumis melo, is introduced with description and illustrations. "

In the Beijing region this has led to livestock densities of nearly 11 livestock units (LU) per hectare, resulting in over-fertilization of soils and pollution of the aquatic and atmospheric environments. A soil screening investigation including five main cropping systems was carried out in the Shunyi and Huairou Districts of Beijing from 2009 to 2011. Soils (calcaric Eutric Cambisols) were sampled on 26 farmers’ field plots to a depth of 200 cm and analysed for soil organic carbon (SOC), hot water-soluble carbon (Chws), total and plant-available macronutrients, pH (H2O) and CaCO3. Fertilization practice was obtained via farmers’ interviews. The status of major potential pollutants in animal husbandry (veterinary antibiotics and growth-promoting heavy metals and arsenic) reaching the field plots via manure application was investigated. Most of the investigated soils were over-supplied with nutrients. High amounts of farmyard manure (FYM) averaging 45 ± 69 t \{DM\} ha−1 y−1 were applied to most of the observed field plots in 2008, with mean total pure nutrient amounts of 967 ± 1297 kg nitrogen (N), 379 ± 535 kg phosphorus (P) and 751 ± 889 kg potassium (K) ha−1 y−1 (n = 19). Additional nutrient applications with mineral fertilizers amounted to 276 ± 122 kg N, 37 ± 62 kg P and 21 ± 26 kg K ha−1 y−1 (n = 16). Comparing current (2009) soil nutrient contents in 0–20 cm with data from the Second Chinese National Soil Survey of 1981, significant increases in \{SOC\} (from 0.71% to 0.95%), total N (from 0.08% to 0.13%) and available P (from 7.3 mg kg−1 to 60 mg kg−1) were observed. Sulfonamide antibiotics were found in topsoils and subsoils, whereas tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones mainly remained in the topsoil. The “natural background value” for Cu and Zn, based on the Chinese environmental quality standard was exceeded in topsoil samples on four and three sites, respectively. Crop-specific fertilizer recommendations were derived and options for different manure processing and transport technologies are discussed. An evaluation of the risks associated with veterinary antibiotics, heavy metals and arsenic is given. "

These migrant workers have limited access to subsidies and the local collective forest due to the household registration system in China called hukou. To assess how these policy-based restrictions on access affect wood consumption and local communities, a case study was conducted in Manlin village, Xishuangbanna, undertaking a household and weight survey with local and immigrant households. The results show no significant difference in firewood consumption between the subpopulations, despite predominantly more local than immigrant households have access to subsidised alternative energy sources. On the other hand, limited access to the collective forest is found to influence the choice of housing materials and living standards in immigrant households as they cannot access timber or afford brick houses. This paper highlights rural issues connected to the hukou system and suggests that rural energy and resource policies should take the growing population of immigrant workers into consideration in future to expand the reach of the polices to the de facto and not only de jure rural population and thus optimise policy efficiency.

It has long been suspected that the Kamala tree (Mallotus philippinensis) can serve as an indicator of the distribution for Asian elephants during the dry season in northwestern India. However, there is little direct evidence in support of this speculation, especially at a large landscape scale. Here, we predicted the distribution of Kamala trees in the Shivalik landscape of northwestern India based on topographic and bioclimatic variables, as well as satellite-derived vegetation indices and forest canopy height data using a presence-only ecological niche model. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and true skill statistic (TSS) to validate the model. We then examined the relationship between the occurrence probability of Kamala trees and the presence of Asian elephants with data collected during dry seasons between 2010 and 2014 using logistic regression models. Our results showed that the probability of occurrence of Kamala trees was predicted with good accuracy (AUC = 0.88 and \{TSS\} = 0.51). The logistic regression models showed that the presence of Asian elephants can be adequately predicted by the occurrence probability of Kamala trees. This result suggests that the distribution of Kamala trees is a good indicator of the presence of Asian elephants during the dry season in the Shivalik landscape. These findings may have major implications for the conservation of Asian elephants, especially in designing wildlife corridors and mitigating human-elephant conflicts. "

These wood decay fungi are known as freshwater lignicolous fungi and are usually studied by collecting submerged woody litter, followed by incubation in a moist chamber. This review explains what are freshwater lignicolous fungi, their decay mechanisms, roles and physiological attributes. Asian/Australasian lignicolous freshwater fungi have been relatively well-surveyed and enable an account of their distribution along a latitudinal transect. Unlike freshwater leaf-dwelling fungi their diversity in water bodies is greater towards the Equator which suggests they are important for decaying submerged wood in the tropics. Riparian vegetation, disturbances such as pollution, streams drying and study methods, may all affect the diversity of freshwater lignicolous fungi, however, the overall trend is a higher diversity in the tropics and subtropics. Climate changes together with increasing deposition of woody debris from human activities, and alteration of environmental factors (such as water pollution, and dam building) will impact freshwater lignicolous fungi. Changing diversity, structure and activities of freshwater fungal communities can be expected, which will significantly impact on aquatic ecosystems, particularly on nutrient and carbon cycles. There is a great opportunity to monitor changes in freshwater fungi communities along latitudinal (north to south) and habitat gradients (from human disturbed to natural habitats), and study ecological thresholds and consequences of such changes, particularly its feedback on nutrient and carbon cycles in freshwater systems.

A selection of 665 value estimates was used for the analysis. Acknowledging the uncertainties and contextual nature of any valuation, the analysis shows that the total value of ecosystem services is considerable and ranges between 490 int$/year for the total bundle of ecosystem services that can potentially be provided by an ‘average’ hectare of open oceans to almost 350,000 int$/year for the potential services of an ‘average’ hectare of coral reefs. More importantly, our results show that most of this value is outside the market and best considered as non-tradable public benefits. The continued over-exploitation of ecosystems thus comes at the expense of the livelihood of the poor and future generations. Given that many of the positive externalities of ecosystems are lost or strongly reduced after land use conversion better accounting for the public goods and services provided by ecosystems is crucial to improve decision making and institutions for biodiversity conservation and sustainable ecosystem management.

Simultaneous exudation of these compounds could increase both P solubility, by releasing bound Po, and Po mineralisation by increasing the rate of hydrolytic cleavage. The objectives of this work were to identify and quantify the P active root exudates released into the rhizosphere of agroforestry species compared to maize. Agroforestry species and maize were grown in a rhizopot system and thin soil slices were analysed for phosphatase activity using a fluorescent enzyme assay based on methylumbelliferone-phosphate (MUB-phosphate) and organic acid concentration by methylation and GCMS. Tithonia (137 μM) and Tephrosia (108 μM) had higher concentrations of citric acid in the rhizosphere than maize (96 μM). However, subsequent analysis of the citric acid chromatograph peak with a mass spectrum detector showed that peaks were actually attributable to a fatty acid. Therefore, there was no evidence for enhanced organic acid concentration in the rhizosphere. In contrast, phosphatase activity was greatly enhanced in the rhizosphere of all agroforestry species. Tithonia (29.64 nmol \{MUB\} min−1 g−1 soil) and Crotalaria (36.08 nmol \{MUB\} min−1 g−1 soil) had greater activity at 0–1 mm from their root than did maize (15.75 nmol \{MUB\} min−1 g−1 soil). Agroforestry species enhanced the activity of acid phosphatase, while maize enhanced the activity of alkaline phosphatase. Acid phosphatase activity increased exponentially with increasing proximity to the root mat of the agroforestry species. This suggests that agroforestry species are actively increasing rhizosphere phosphatase activity either directly by secretion or indirectly by stimulation of microbial activity and/or depletion of Pi. Overall, agroforestry species enhanced phosphatase activity in their rhizosphere. However, this does not necessarily lead to increased Po mineralisation unless there is a concurrent increase in the solubility of Po forms. "

A questionnaire was used to survey 120 households to obtain information on the performance of their enterprises over 6 years (1998–2003). The information was mainly based on recollection as few farmers kept detailed records. Actual monitoring and measurements of yield and inputs was done in the farmers’ enterprises over 2 years during 2002/2003 and 2003/2004 production seasons. The analysis was done for four categories of rainwater harvesting systems differentiated by the size of catchments from which water is collected and the intensity of concentration and/or storage of the collected rainwater. These categories are: micro-catchments, macro-catchments, macro-catchments linked to road drainage and micro or macro-catchments with a storage pond. Results show that rainwater harvesting for production of paddy rice paid most with returns to labor of more than 12 US$ per person-day invested. These benefits are very high due to the fact that without rainwater harvesting it is not possible to produce paddy in the study area and rainfed sorghum crop realizes a return to labor of only US$ 3.7 per person-day during above-average seasons. For the rainwater harvesting systems, those designed to collect water from macro-catchments linked to road drainage, performed best during both categories of seasons. The results also show that contrary to expectations, improving rainwater harvesting systems by adding a storage pond may not lead to increased productivity. Another finding that goes against the widely held belief is that rainwater harvesting results in more benefits during the above-average seasons compared to below-average seasons. It is therefore, concluded that there is a potential for combining rainwater harvesting with improved drainage of roads. The construction of rural roads in semi-arid areas can beneficially be integrated with efforts to increase water availability for agricultural needs. "

The samples were selected from the National Soil Survey Center archives in Lincoln, NE, USA, with only one sample per pedon and a weighted random sampling to maximize compositional diversity. Applying visible and near-infrared (VNIR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) to air-dry soil (&lt; 2 mm) with auxiliary predictors including sand content or pH, we obtained validation root mean squared deviation (RMSD) estimates of 54 g kg− 1 for clay, 7.9 g kg− 1 for soil organic C (SOC), 5.6 g kg− 1 for inorganic C (IC), 8.9 g kg− 1 for dithionate–citrate extractable Fe (FEd), and 5.5 cmolc kg− 1 for cation exchange capacity (CEC) with \{NH4\} at pH = 7. For all of these properties, boosted regression trees (BRT) outperformed \{PLS\} regression, suggesting that this might be a preferred method for VNIR-DRS soil characterization. Using BRT, we were also able to predict ordinal clay mineralogy levels for montmorillonite and kaolinite, with 88% and 96%, respectively, falling within one ordinal unit of reference X-ray diffraction (XRD) values (0–5 on ordinal scale). Given the amount of information obtained in this study with ∼4 × 103 samples, we anticipate that calibrations sufficient for many applications might be obtained with large but obtainable soil-spectral libraries (perhaps 104–105 samples). The use of auxiliary predictors (potentially from complementary sensors), supplemental local calibration samples and theoretical spectroscopy all have the potential to improve predictions. Our findings suggest that \{VNIR\} soil characterization has the potential to replace or augment standard soil characterization techniques where rapid and inexpensive analysis is required. "

A 7-year-old grass fallow (Grass-F) was also included. Gliricidia prunings were incorporated at each time of tree pruning in the gliricidia-maize. The amount of organic C recycled varied from 0.8 to 4.8 Mg C ha−1 in gliricidia-maize and from 0.4 to 1.0 Mg C ha−1 in sole-maize. In sole-maize, net decreases of soil carbon of 6 Mg C ha−1 at \{MZ12\} and 7 Mg C ha−1 at \{MZ21\} in the topsoil (0–20 cm) relative to the initial soil C were observed. After 10 years of continuous application of tree prunings C was sequestered in the topsoil (0–20 cm) in gliricidia-maize was 1.6 times more than in sole-maize. A total of 123–149 Mg C ha−1 were sequestered in the soil (0–200 cm depth), through root turnover and pruning application in the gliricidia-maize system. Carbon dioxide evolution varied from 10 to 28 kg ha−1 day−1 in sole-maize and 23 to 83 kg ha−1 day−1 in gliricidia-maize.

Dry matter degradation constants were estimated from non-linear regression. Concentrations of crude protein, neutral detergent fibre and insoluble proanthocyanidins varied widely among seasons. Classification of the \{MPTS\} based on a (soluble fraction), b (rumen degradable fraction), c (rate of degradation)) and \{PD\} (potential degradation) varied among BC, \{WS\} and \{WG\} within season. Using \{PD\} as an index of forage quality, the \{MPTS\} were classified into high, medium and low groups. The b and \{PD\} in \{BC\} during the dry season were significantly higher than in \{WS\} and WG. The results suggested the existence of intraspecies and interspecies variation in rumen degradation characteristics of \{DM\} of the \{MPTS\} in BC, \{WS\} and WG. The \{PD\} in \{BC\} was highly correlated to \{WS\} and \{WG\} in the wet seasons. Thus, rumen degradation could be useful in the initial screening of \{MPTS\} for further nutritional studies. "

Some of the actors directly responsible for forest conversion fell trees to meet food security needs and alleviate poverty—issues of urgent interest to them and also to national policymakers. This multiplicity of groups with differing (often conflicting) interests in the multifarious goods and services produced by tropical forests complicates the search for alternative agricultural activities for forest margins since these alternatives must satisfy such divergent objectives. This paper sets out a conceptual framework for comparing the impacts of different land use systems and agricultural practices at the margins of tropical rainforests in terms of the concerns and objectives of two key interest groups: small-scale farmers seeking livelihoods at the forest margins and the `international' interests in the global public goods and services supplied by tropical rainforests. This framework should be useful to a third key group, the national and regional policymakers who must consider these and other policy objectives and then decide on courses of action. The paper identifies data needs and analytical methods capable of supplying an empirical base for this conceptual framework, based on quantifiable indicators. It then presents preliminary results of the application of this conceptual framework in Indonesia and Brazil in association with a global, collaborative, multidisciplinary research program. Even using preliminary order-of-magnitude estimates (to be replaced by more precise measurements as they become available), this conceptual framework presents results in ways that allow researchers and policymakers to select clear `best bets' for development, when they exist, and to assess tradeoffs and options for complementary policy action and research efforts, when they do not.

Weevils fed with the resistant hybrids produced low numbers of \{F1\} generation weevils, had a high median developmental time and a low percentage of grain damage and grain weight loss. An increasing number of \{F1\} generation resulted in an increasing grain damage and grain weight loss. We found an inverse relationship between the susceptibility index and percent mortality.

The gains were estimated on farmer acceptance and combination of agronomic and quality-related traits, from three breeding programmes on tortillero sorghum for low-input cropping systems in northern Nicaragua. In each programme, three selection modes were compared: selection by the farmers on-farm (FoF), by the breeder on-station (BoS), and by the breeder on-farm (BoF). Our results showed that the lines produced by FoF selection were more praised by the farming community, compared to BoS and BoF selection. Comparative advantage of FoF selection was to develop higher proportion of lines with an adequate balance between agronomic traits, and with better quality traits related to grain appearance and plant type. A composite selection index, ISFA, was computed for each line as a combination of agronomic performance in the target environment, and ex post farmer appraisal. Based on this index, FoF selection proved again to be more efficient than BoS and BoF selection. We propose that such a selection index be used in participatory breeding programmes to improve their efficiency. "

Using single-node leafy cuttings, three experiments were investigated in Cameroon: (i) Three propagation media (sawdust and 50:50 mixture of sand and sawdust). Initially, rooting was best in the mixed medium, but subsequently, cuttings set in the sawdust rooted better than those in sand and the mixture of sand/sawdust. However, there was no significant (P&gt;0.05) treatment effect on rooting percentage or on the mean number of roots per cutting. (ii) Three types of auxin at 50 μg per cutting (IAA, indole-3-acetic acid; IBA, indole-3-butyric acid and NAA, 1-naphthalene acetic acid) dissolved in 10 μl of alcohol. The control treatment received 10 μl of alcohol only. Significant differences in rooting percentage occurred after 3–4 weeks between the auxin-treated cuttings and the control.

Rotational woodlots in Tanzania appear to help farmers generate substantial income while at the same time conserving forest area. In the rotational woodlot system, farmers intercrop food crops with leguminous trees during the first 2–3 years, leave the trees to grow, harvest the trees in the 5th year, and replant food crops. Of three species planted in an on-farm trial involving 60 farmers, Acacia crassicarpa (A. Cunn. ex Benth.) performed best, attaining a height 96% higher and a root collar diameter 76% higher, than the second ranked species, Acacia jurifera (Benth.). In spite of higher costs and a longer payoff period, the crassicarpa woodlot achieved returns to land 6.3 times greater, and returns to labor 2.0 times greater, than the maize (Zea mays L.)-fallow system. Farmers use fuelwood to cure tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and they greatly appreciate substituting relatively abundant land and slack season labor for scarce cash required for purchasing fuelwood that is harvested in the forest. Adoption of rotational woodlots in Tabora District alone can conserve 8675 ha forest per year, or 0.8% of total wooded area in the district. Farmers’ interest is high and 87% of those involved in the trial have expanded their area under woodlots. Research and development projects can benefit individual farmers and society by helping them to make the transition from depleting forest resources to planting trees on their own farms. "

Conversely, old irrigated pastures (Digitaria decumbens, Pangola grass) on these soils maintained organic matter content, biological activity, soil porosity and aggregate stability. A research programme was set out in 1991 in the south-eastern part of Martinique in order to study the respective roles of grass roots and earthworms in the restoration of the properties of a degraded Vertisol. Plots with and without plants, with and without earthworms were tested and physical properties were followed during 4 years and compared with properties existing under market crops and old pastures. The restoration of physical properties was more rapid and more important in treatments with plants than in treatments without plants. Plants played a dominant role through rhizosphere effects and possible carbon rhizodeposition. The effect of earthworms was less important. Earthworms particularly increased the stability of aggregates of 200–500 μm size, and decreased clay dispersion. "

Average plot level species richness (11 species) was not significantly different amongst the three land use types. However at the landscape level the species–area curve for rubber agroforests (also called jungle rubber) had a significantly higher slope parameter than the curve for rubber plantations, indicating higher beta diversity in jungle rubber as compared to rubber plantations. Plot level species richness is thus not fully indicative of the (relative) richness of a land use type at the landscape scale because scaling relations differ between land use types. Terrestrial fern species can serve as indicators of disturbance or forest quality as many species show clear habitat differentiation with regard to light conditions and/or humidity. To assess forest habitat quality in rubber production systems as compared to primary forest, terrestrial pteridophyte species were grouped according to their ecological requirements into ‘forest species’ and ‘non-forest species’. Species–area curves based on ‘forest species’ alone show that the understorey environment of jungle rubber supports intermediate numbers of ‘forest species’ and is much more forest-like than that of rubber plantations, but less than primary forest. Species richness alone, without a priori ecological knowledge of the species involved, did not provide this information. Jungle rubber systems can play a role in conservation of part of the primary rain forest species, especially in areas where the primary forest has already disappeared. In places where primary forest is gone, jungle rubber can conserve part of the primary forest species, but large areas of jungle rubber are needed. In places where primary forest is still present, priority should be given to conservation of remaining primary forest patches. "

Few tropical watershed studies have lasted long enough to facilitate a credible analysis of the long-term effects of land use change on the environmental services provided by watersheds. This paper examines the driving forces and patterns of historical land use change in two long-term watershed studies in Kenya and Sri Lanka and their hydrological impacts. The upper Ewaso Ng’iro north basin is located to the north and west of Mt. Kenya, and has experienced dramatic changes in both land ownership and land use due to rapid population growth of 7–8% per annum. The upper Nilwala basin is located in the south of Sri Lanka and the area has undergone serious deforestation over the last 50 years, for agricultural land uses mainly for tea and home gardens. The loss of watershed functions associated with the impacts of land use change and their socio-economic dimensions are discussed, along with lessons that can be drawn from these studies. These case studies confirm the importance of long-term monitoring of the interaction between land use changes and catchment health. Moreover, the involvement of all stakeholders is crucial for problem identification through to the research and the search for any viable ecological, social and economical solutions. A holistic approach involving relevant disciplines in watershed studies is vital. The paper concludes that use of models that integrate both biophysical and socio-economic data should be encouraged to derive decision support tools for farmers and managers alike who are faced with resolving conflicts and other issues related to limited land and water resources.

The purpose of this experiment was to quantify the C and N flows returned within and transported out of plots and crop yields of different cropping systems. Cassava-based systems were not stable and yields declined over time. Intercropping cassava with rice increased cassava fresh tuber weight by 5–48% compared to the monocrop-ping system. The hedgerow intercropping gave lower maize, rice, groundnut and cowpea yields than could be obtained in a crop rotation with legume cover crops. Maize grain yields in the 80–20 rice/maize mixture were about 0.4 Mg ha−1 in the rice — groundnut rotation and about half as much when intercropped with cassava or hedgerows. Rice yields intercropped with cassava or with hedgerows were about 1 Mg ha−1 less in year 2 and 3 than those grown in rotation with groundnut. The rice yield in the first cropping season was only about 1 Mg ha−1, but in the second and third year yields in the rice — legume rotation increased to around 2 and around 3 Mg ha−1, respectively. This increase occurred despite a decline in soil organic matter content. The cassava-based systems removed much more C (7 Mg ha−1 yr-1) than the other systems, while less was returned (about 0.5–2 Mg ha−1) to the soil. In the hedgerow intercropping system about 2.5 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 was returned to the plot as biomass pruning and crop residues and about 1.5 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 was removed from the plot as yield. In the cover crop rotation 2.6 Mg ha−1 yr−1 of C was returned to the plot as crop residues plus Mucuna (only the 2nd year) and Cowpea biomass, and about 1.1 Mg ha−1 yr−1 was removed from the plot. The hedgerow intercropping systems gave an N surplus of about 15–50 kg ha−1 yr−1 returned to the soil; while the balance was 10–20 kg ha−1 yr−1 for the cover crop rotation systems and the cassava-based systems showed a negative N budget of about 60 kg ha−1 yr−1.

Average yearly tree pruning dry matter and total N yields of the two hedgerow systems were not significantly different although seasonal differences occurred. Gliricidia obtained a larger (average 51%) proportion of its N from \{N2\} fixation than Flemingia (average 25%) the effect being consistent over the two years. Seasonal variation in the % N derived from \{N2\} fixation was associated with changes in soil mineral N availability. The amount of \{N2\} fixed was not significantly different between the two N fixing trees (26 vs. 35 kg N ha−1 yr−1 respectively). This was due to the higher total N yield of Flemingia compared to Gliricidia compensating for the smaller proportion of N derived from \{N2\} fixation. The amount of tree soil N uptake was similar for the two hedgerow systems suggesting that the higher proportion of N derived from \{N2\} fixation in Gliricidia was probably due to competition for soil mineral N by the associated non-fixing Peltophorum. Rapid temporal and spatial decline in plant available 15N occurred suggesting that matching of fixing and non-fixing reference plants is important. Compared with estimates of \{N2\} fixation obtained by the natural abundance method the 15N dilution method overestimated \{N2\} fixation by the tree legumes (an average of up to 18%), however the difference between the two fixing legume trees was maintained. N balance estimates suggested that \{N2\} fixation inputs of alley trees were sufficient to sustain moderate crop yields but for higher food crop yields, \{N2\} fixing leguminous crops would have to be included to balance N off-take.

The objective of this study was to evaluate tillage-induced soil translocation on an Oxisol with 25% and 36% slopes in Claveria, Philippines for three tillage systems: contour moldboard plowing (CMP), moldboard plowing up and downslope (UMP), and contour ridge tillage (CRT). Small rocks 3–4 cm in “diameter” were used as soil movement detection units (SMDU). The \{SMDUs\} were placed at 10 cm intervals in a narrow 5-cm-deep trench near the upper boundary of each plot, the position of each rock recorded, and the trench backfilled. Five tillage operations used to produce one corn crop were performed during a one month period: two moldboard plowing operations for land preparation (except for CRT), one moldboard plowing for corn planting, and two inter-culture (inter-row cultivation) operations. After these operations, over 95% of the \{SMDU\} were recovered manually and their exact locations recorded. Mean annual soil flux for the 25% slope was 365 and 306 kg m−1 y−1 for \{UMP\} and CMP, respectively. For the 36% slope, comparable values were 481 and 478 kg m−1 y−1. Estimated tillage erosion rates for the 25% slope were 456 and 382 Mg ha−1 y−1 for \{UMP\} and CMP, respectively, and increased to 601 and 598 Mg ha−1 y−1, respectively, for the 36% slope. The mean displacement distance, mean annual soil flux, and mean annual tillage-induced soil loss for both slopes were reduced by approximately 70% using \{CRT\} compared to \{CMP\} and UMP. "

These microorganisms were taken from the rumens of bush duiker, eland, impala, Grant's gazelle, hartebeest, Thompson's gazelle, Ethiopian goat, Kenyan goat, an Ethiopian sheep adapted to Acacia angustissima ingestion and from the hindgut of zebra. Dried A. angustissima leaves, 3 g/L \{ADAB\} or 3 g/L \{DABA\} were incubated with medium containing rumen or hindgut fluid. Degradation was measured using ammonia and volatile fatty acid production and substrate disappearance as indices. Individual microbial species were isolated from samples showing substrate degradation. Incubation of A. angustissima leaf with rumen fluids from the bush duiker and from a sheep slowly adapted to A. angustissima produced more gas (32.27 mL/100 g \{DM\} ± 1.15; 31.25 mL/100 g \{DM\} ± 2.17) than with fluid from other animals. Early substrate degradation was observed with samples incubated with bush duiker rumen fluid. The most total volatile fatty acids were produced by samples incubated with rumen fluid from Grant's gazelle, followed by impala and bush duiker (79.67 ± 4.35 μmol/mL, 78.21 ± 11.3 and 68.80 ± 4.49 μmol/mL, respectively).

Rumen fluid taken from an impala degraded more \{ADAB\} than the other sources, leaving only 4.17 μM residual ADAB. Rumen fluid from the hartebeest was completely ineffective and left all of the \{ADAB\} substrate undegraded. The adapted sheep rumen fluid degraded 0.980, the Grant's gazelle rumen fluid 0.922 and the impala rumen fluid only 0.101 of the ADAB. Eight ADAB-tolerant bacterial strains were isolated. Individually, these isolates were not able to substantially degrade ADAB. However, a mixture of all eight ADAB-tolerant bacterial isolates degraded 0.827 of the ADAB. Most DABA-tolerant bacterial strains were not able to degrade DABA. Only isolates from an adapted sheep, from a Kenyan goat and a Thomson's gazelle degraded \{DABA\} to a significant extent (0.283, 0.202 and 0.169, respectively).

Ninety-five per cent mortality of P. truncatus was observed after 1 week and 100% mortality after 2 weeks in maize treated with the highest dose of conidia with ash (0.2 g/g). Mortality of P. truncatus in all ash with conidia treatments was significantly higher than untreated controls over a 4-week period, except the lowest dose of conidia at week 4. The three highest concentrations of conidia per gram of ash resulted in significantly (1% level) higher mortality of P. truncatus than ash alone. In an experiment to investigate the possible synergy of ash and conidia, there were no significant differences in mortality of P. truncatus between treatments with the same concentration of conidia regardless of whether the conidia were mixed with ash or applied alone. Larval populations of P. truncatus were observed in all treatments without ash, but only one larva was observed in one replicate of a treatment containing ash suggesting that ash has an important effect in preventing the establishment of a second generation of insects.

An inventory of the vegetation was carried out during the rainy season using radial transects from the village centre, outwards, in addition to surveys with local communities. The results showed that tree diversity is enhanced in sites with interventions, and soil rehabilitation techniques and farmer-managed tree natural regeneration favor the rehabilitation and development of trees. The number of resprouts/seedlings varied with site, soil type and intervention. The number of harvestable trees depended on factors like caring, monitoring of cutting, types of intervention and ecological zone. Harvestable volume is a function of high regeneration rate, number of harvestable individual trees and site. Vegetation is improving in all the sites and local communities using tree products for their various needs. This study contributed to setting up a reference database for these sites. "

The hedgerows were planted on the contour, 4 m apart and 0.25 m between plants. Maize and cowpea were planted in sequence. The control plot sustained an average annual water loss over 3 y of 31 mm runoff and soil loss of 19 t ha−1. The best treatment, hedgerows with mulch, reduced losses to 13% and 2% of the control. Hedgerows without mulch reduced losses respectively to 23% and 7%, while mulch without hedgerows reduced losses to 41% and 17%. Soil loss was considerably influenced by one single storm in April 1990 due to the nature of that storm and to the susceptibility of the soil to erosion at that particular time. Differences in crop yield between treatments were small. The hedgerow treatments depressed cowpea yield slightly in less than normal rainy seasons but improved cowpea yields in wet seasons. "

We combined agent-based modeling and experimental role playing games to compare land-use preferences and decisions between men and women in a landscape dominated by rubber agroforests in Sumatra, Indonesia. Ecosystem service delivery can be influenced by gender specific land-use preferences, especially in areas under conservation agreements. The research methods were designed to examine gender aspects of three ‘bounds’ of human nature (bounded rationality, bounded willpower and bounded self-interests) in relation to land-use decisions. Rice fields (mostly owned and inherited by females) provide part of local staple food needs in the study area, whereas rubber agroforests provide income in addition to resources for local use and rubber and oil palm monocultures are fully market oriented. In both the model and game exercises, men preferred the status quo rice production in combination with agroforest land uses, but women preferred the conversion of agroforest to more financially profitable monoculture systems, with increased carbon emissions as side effect. Although both genders exhibited similar preferences for ecosystem service provision, regulatory ecosystem services (i.e., climate and water regulation) were reduced by women’s landuse choices. Thus, ecosystem service tradeoffs are potentially greater in women-dominated landscapes under these circumstances. Furthermore, gender-specific limitations and socio-cultural contexts (i.e., matrilineal societies) may influence the flow of ecosystem services as well as landscape patterns. "

During the dry season the steady infiltration rate under the hedgerows was 135 mm h−1 while on the alleys in between it was 41–49 mm h−1 and on the control plot 39–48 mm h−1. Corresponding values for the wet season were 69 mm h−1 for the hedge and 8–11 mm h−1 for the alley. Removal of the hedge plants revealed that much of the increase is due to significantly more macropores in the topsoil beneath the hedgerow than in the topsoil beneath the alley. Differences in pore size distribution in the subsoil were small and not significant. Total increase in average infiltration rate of the hedgerow barrier system in the dry season is 30% and in the wet season is 94% as compared to the alley.

A major constraint for crop production is the amount of rainfall and its intra and inter-annual variability. We evaluated the effects of planting date on the yield of different varieties of four major crops (maize, millet, sorghum and cotton) over three contrasting growing seasons in 2009–2011 (with 842 mm, 1248 mm and 685 mm of rainfall respectively) with the aim of identifying climate adaptation options in the Sudano-Sahelian region. Three planting dates (early, medium, and late) and three varieties of long, medium, and short duration of each crop were compared. For fertilized cereal crops, maize out yielded millet and sorghum by respectively 57% and 45% across the three seasons. Analysis of 40 years of weather data indicates that this finding holds for the longer time periods than the length of this trial. Late planting resulted in significant yield decreases for maize, sorghum and cotton, but not for millet. However, a short duration variety of millet was better adapted for late planting. When the rainy season starts late, sorghum planting can be delayed from the beginning of June to early July without substantial reductions in grain yield. Cotton yield at early planting was 28% larger than yield at medium planting and late planting gave the lowest yield with all three varieties. For all four crops the largest stover yields were obtained with early planting and the longer planting was delayed, the less stover was produced. There was an interaction between planting date and variety for millet and sorghum, while for maize and cotton the best planting date was more affected by the weather conditions. The findings of this study can support simple adaptation decisions: priority should be given to planting cotton early; maize is the best option if fertilizer is available; planting of maize and sorghum can be delayed by up to a month without strong yield penalties; and millet should be planted last.

High levels of genetic diversity within species (PPB = 96.9%, I = 0.4914, h = 0.3261), while accordingly low levels within-population diversity (PPB = 65.8%, I = 0.3333, h = 0.2206) were detected.

The Mantel test demonstrated that there was no significant correlation between pair-wise population PhiPT matrix and geographic distance matrix.

A growing number of studies have demonstrated the potential for improving fertilizer use efficiency in China, but it is not clear how to achieve these efficiency improvements on a larger scale. The empirical foundation for fertilizer policy in China is still weak, particularly in inland provinces. This paper examines fertilizer use patterns in Yunnan Province, an inland and ecologically important province in Southwest China, drawing on two household surveys. We find that fertilizer application rates in the survey areas are highly heterogeneous, among crops, households, and regions. Managing this diversity poses the largest challenge to fertilizer policy in Yunnan and, by extension, in China. None of the factors that we examine in this study are robust predictors of fertilizer intensity (kg ha−1) in the survey regions, though in one survey there is a strong inverse relationship between farm size and fertilizer intensity. The lack of clearer signals in the survey data, a consequence of heterogeneity in cropping patterns, agroecosystems, and local economies, underscores the importance of locally tailored approaches to fertilizer regulation in China, and of a strong, service-oriented agricultural extension system oriented around sustainable agriculture.

Species recognition in the genus has been uncertain due to the lack of molecular data from ex-type cultures as well as overlapping morphological characteristics. In this study, we revise the genus Bipolaris based on \{DNA\} sequence data derived from living cultures of fresh isolates, available ex-type cultures from worldwide collections and observation of type and additional specimens. Combined analyses of ITS, \{GPDH\} and \{TEF\} gene sequences were used to reconstruct the molecular phylogeny of the genus Bipolaris for species with living cultures. The \{GPDH\} gene is determined to be the best single marker for species of Bipolaris. Generic boundaries between Bipolaris and Curvularia are revised and presented in an updated combined \{ITS\} and \{GPDH\} phylogenetic tree. We accept 47 species in the genus Bipolaris and clarify the taxonomy, host associations, geographic distributions and species’ synonymies. Modern descriptions and illustrations are provided for 38 species in the genus with notes provided for the other taxa when recent descriptions are available. Bipolaris cynodontis, B. oryzae, B. victoriae, B. yamadae and B. zeicola are epi- or neotypified and a lectotype is designated for B. stenospila. Excluded and doubtful species are listed with notes on taxonomy and phylogeny.

Therefore, a thoughtful and contemplative understanding and assessment of the structural and functional features of these proteases would markedly assist the development of biogenic pesticides. Computational molecular biology is a new facile alternative approach to the tedious experimental molecular biology; therefore, by using bioinformatics tools, we isolated and characterized an insect \{CDP\} gene from Beauveria bassiana 70 s.l. genomic DNA. The \{CDP\} gene (1240 bp with GeneBank accession no. KT804651.1) consisted of three introns and four \{CDS\} exons, and shared 74–100% sequence identity to the reference \{CDP\} genes. Its phylogenetic tree results showed a unique evolution pattern, and the predicted amino acid peptide (PAAP) consisted of 344 amino acid residues with pI, molecular weight, instability index, grand average hydropathicity value and aliphatic index of 7.2, 35.4 kDa, 24.45, −0.149, and 76.63, respectively. The gene possessed 74–89% amino acid sequence similarity to the 12 reference strains. Three motifs (Peptidase_S8 subtilase family) were detected in the PAAP, and the computed 3D structure possessed 79.09% structural identity to alkaline serine proteases. The \{PAAP\} had four (three serine proteases and one Pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylase) conserved domains, a disulfide bridge, two calcium binding sites, \{MY\} domain, and three predicted active sites in the serine family domains. These results will set the groundwork for further exploitation of proteases and understanding the mechanism of disease caused by cuticle-degrading-serine-proteases from entomopathogenic fungi. "

Each landscape was described for land use, rural livelihoods and attitudes of social actors toward biodiversity and intensification of agriculture. Principal components analysis of 40 indicators of natural, human, social, financial and physical capital for the eight landscapes showed a loss of biodiversity associated with high-input agricultural intensification. High levels of natural capital (e.g. indicators of wildland biodiversity conservation and agrobiodiversity for human needs) were positively associated with indicators of human capital, including knowledge of the flora and fauna and knowledge sharing among farmers. Three social-ecological domains were identified across the eight landscapes (Tropical Agriculture-Forest Matrix, Tropical Degrading Agroecosystem, and Temperate High-Input Commodity Agriculture) using hierarchical clustering of the indicator values. Each domain shared a set of interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture and ecological intensification that could also increase food security in the impoverished landscapes. Implementation of interventions differed greatly among the landscapes, e.g. financial capital for new farming practices in the Intensive Agriculture domain vs. developing market value chains in the other domains. This exploratory study suggests that indicators of knowledge systems should receive greater emphasis in the monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and that inventories of assets at the landscape level can inform adaptive management of agrobiodiversity-based interventions.

Four bioclimatic zones and 9 strata were identified, overlaid with protected areas, and associated with on-going landuse change, i.e. a rapid increase in rubber plantation from 8% to 22% of total area between 2002 and 2010. Significant changes in the areal extent and distribution of all zones and strata are projected, with an averaged mean annual temperature increase ranging from 1.6 °C to 2.4 °C. By 2050, there are significant geographical shifts in all identified strata, with an average upward shift of 309 m of elevation for all strata. On average, more than 75% of Xishuangbanna is predicted to shift to a different zone, with 96% shifting to a different stratum. The area conducive to rubber plantations, currently limited by climatic conditions, expands to nearly 75% of the total area. Climatic change potentially removes the bioclimatic barriers to further expansion of rubber plantations within the area and increases pressure on remaining biodiversity both within and outside of protected areas. The analysis provides the basis for understanding potential impacts of changing bioclimatic conditions on managed and unmanaged ecosystems and landuse change trends, within the context of ongoing rapid change and agricultural expansion in the area. Current efforts to conserve forests, biodiversity and traditional landuse systems require an improved understanding of both the projected climatic changes and the responses of biodiversity and traditional agricultural systems to changing conditions.

In the present study, weathering rates (kg ha−1 yr−1) for base cations were estimated using cation budgets in a replicated (n = 4) experimental Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) plantation situated on a nutrient-poor glacial till in south-west Sweden and aged 25–39 years during the study period. Weathering rates (central values) were 2.4, 1.4, 0.3 and 2.3 kg ha−1 yr−1 for Ca, Mg, K and Na, respectively. However, weathering was a minor flux in the overall cycling of these cations in the ecosystem, and the confidence intervals of the weathering estimates had amplitudes that generally were greater than the central values. The overall uncertainties were divided into (i) regular standard errors of the mean, expressing spatial variability, sampling errors and random method-related errors in data from measurements replicated over the experimental plots (‘Type A’ uncertainties), and (ii) estimated standard uncertainties accounting for systematic errors of methods, and of uncertainties in variables, functions and factors not replicated over the plots (‘Type B’ uncertainties). For Ca and K, bioaccumulation dominated the overall uncertainty. Most (&gt;90 %) of this uncertainty, in turn, was of Type A (between-plot variability in measured stem diameters and cation concentrations); the remainder resulted from Type B uncertainties in allometric functions etc. Hence, regular standard errors over plots yielded a correct level of uncertainty of weathering estimates for these ions at the studied site. For Mg and Na, however, deposition and leaching were large terms in the cation budget. Whereas the uncertainty in deposition was mostly taken into account by plot-wise replicated measurements of throughfall (Type A uncertainty), Type B uncertainties were crucial to the estimates of leaching. Due to the fact that uncertainties accumulate when terms are added and subtracted in a cation budget, it is difficult to predict the sustainability of the pools of exchangeable cations from estimated weathering rates; it may be better to measure them directly in the soil. However, in the studied ecosystem these had a rapid turnover (mean residence time, 1–4 years), and underwent abrupt fluctuations over only a few years. A study performed during a limited time may therefore suffer from considerable temporal uncertainties, if the results are to be generalised for a longer period. "

abstract = "Abstract Over the last 200 years, genetic resources of forest trees have been increasingly transferred, within and outside of species’ native distribution ranges, for forestry and for research and development (R&amp;D). Transferred germplasm has been deployed to grow trees for numerous purposes, ranging from the production of wood and non-wood products to the provision of ecosystem services such as the restoration of forests for biodiversity conservation. The oldest form of R&amp;D, provenance trials, revealed early on that seed origin has a major influence on the performance of planted trees. International provenance trials have been essential for selecting seed sources for reforestation and for improving tree germplasm through breeding. Many tree breeding programmes were initiated in the 1950s, but as one round of testing and selection typically takes decades, the most advanced of them are only in their third cycle. Recent advances in forest genomics have increased the understanding of the genetic basis of different traits, but it is unlikely that molecular marker-assisted approaches will quickly replace traditional tree breeding methods. Furthermore, provenance trials and progeny tests are still needed to complement new research approaches. Currently, seed of boreal and temperate trees for reforestation purposes are largely obtained from improved sources. The situation is similar for fast growing tropical and subtropical trees grown in plantations, but in the case of tropical hardwoods and many agroforestry trees, only limited tested or improved seed sources are available. Transfers of tree germplasm involve some risks of spreading pests and diseases, of introducing invasive tree species and of polluting the genetic make-up of already present tree populations. Many of these risks have been underestimated in the past, but they are now better understood and managed. Relatively few tree species used for forestry have become invasive, and the risk of spreading pests and diseases while transferring seed is considerably lower than when moving live plants. The implementation of the Nagoya Protocol on access to genetic resources and benefit sharing (ABS) may significantly change current transfer practices in the forestry sector by increasing transaction costs and the time needed to lawfully obtain forest genetic resources for R&amp;D purposes. Many countries are likely to struggle to establish a well-functioning \{ABS\} regulatory system, slowing down the process of obtaining the necessary documentation for exchange. This is unfortunate, as climate change, outbreaks of pests and diseases, and continual pressure to support productivity, increase the need for transferring tree germplasm and accelerating R&amp;D. "

This conversion has expanded into forests previously protected by the community and onto marginal sites at high-elevation. Market-based ecosystem payments, especially carbon financing, are potential tools to prevent further forest loss in China. Here, we compare rubber net present value (NPV), carbon sequestration, and seed-plant species diversity for Xishuangbanna given three land-use scenarios: Business-As-Usual (BAU), Economic Oriented Scenario (EOS) and Conservation Oriented Scenario (COS) using a previously published spatial map of rubber profitability. The \{EOS\} achieved the greatest rubber profit but caused substantial reductions in natural forest area, biodiversity and carbon stocks. The \{EOS\} also requires substantial immigration of workers into a remote and ecologically important region with little social infrastructure for basic security, food security, health-care and education, causing frequently ignored costs. As expected, the \{COS\} will maintain the highest levels of natural forest area, sequester 57% more carbon, and 71% more biodiversity than EOS. Given the conservation value of the carbon stores and rich biodiversity residing in Xishuangbanna's natural forests, reducing rubber \{NPV\} only marginally would probably cost less than attempting to recover these resources. We recommend that rubber plantations be limited to established, productive lowland areas whilst protecting intact high-elevation forest and reforesting low-productivity plantations. These actions will enhance carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. Management policies focused solely on profits, like the \{EOS\} scenario, will fail to sustain the entire range of natural resources and ecosystem services. The prices in the carbon market would have to be considerably larger than they are currently to compete with the profitability of rubber. "

This indicates the need for detailed studies of spatiotemporal variability in C cycling for semi-arid ecosystems. We have synthesized data on the land-atmosphere exchange of \{CO2\} measured with the eddy covariance technique from the six existing sites across the Sahel, one of the largest semi-arid regions in the world. The overall aim of the study is to analyse and quantify the spatiotemporal variability in these fluxes and to analyse to which degree spatiotemporal variation can be explained by hydrological, climatic, edaphic and vegetation variables. All ecosystems were C sinks (average ± total error −162 ± 48 g C m−2 y−1), but were smaller when strongly impacted by anthropogenic influences. Spatial and inter-annual variability in the C flux processes indicated a strong resilience to dry conditions, and were correlated with phenological metrics. Gross primary productivity (GPP) was the most important flux process affecting the sink strength, and diurnal variability in \{GPP\} was regulated by incoming radiation, whereas seasonal dynamics was closely coupled with phenology, and soil water content. Diurnal variability in ecosystem respiration was regulated by GPP, whereas seasonal variability was strongly coupled to phenology and GPP. A budget for the entire Sahel indicated a strong C sink mitigating the global anthropogenic C emissions. Global circulation models project an increase in temperature, whereas rainfall is projected to decrease for western Sahel and increase for the eastern part, indicating that the C sink will possibly decrease and increase for the western and eastern Sahel, respectively.

In addition to having unparalleled bee diversity, China has more than eight million managed bee colonies, and it is the world's major honey producer. Yet, pollinators in China, especially bumble bees (Bombus spp.) and honey bees (Apis spp.), are likely at risk. Massive pollinator declines in various countries have rightly grabbed the attention of beekeepers, scientists, policymakers, and the general public, but research has almost exclusively focused on the U.S. and Europe, while countries with significantly higher pollination resources (such as China) have received far less attention. This perspective piece questions and highlights the risks to wild and managed pollinators in China and critical research gaps. We show that there may be a “pollination gap” in China for crops dependent on insect pollination and we examine the potential causes. Specifically, we assess the risks associated with land-use intensification, pesticide poisoning, climate change, invasive species, and other factors affecting the survival of bee pollinators in Asia. If true, the effects of declining pollinator populations in China would be felt globally, and with so much at stake, this problem merits careful consideration in the development of agriculture, economic, and conservation policies.

We comment on the usefulness of this framework, and its applicability to a wide range of geographic contexts. We then present a four step model to assist managers in applying the framework to specific co-management problems. The model suggests a cascade approach to defining key evaluations questions at a systems, network, individual and synthesis level.

This paper investigates spatial variation in willingness to accept (WTA) payments made by the Wildlife Conservation Lease Program in the Athi-Kaputiei plains of Kenya. The program, designed as an incentive to keep land open for wildlife and livestock, offers land owners 10 US$ per ha per year, irrespective of location. We model the relation between \{WTA\} and distances to roads, towns and rivers, annual precipitation and slope and display the predicted spatial variation in WTA. The results reveal significant spatial variation in willingness to accept payments for availing land for conservation, with higher \{WTA\} concentrated away from roads and also in the Southeast of the plains. The results further suggest that wildlife movement will be blocked due to low \{WTA\} in the proximity of towns and tarmacked roads. We conclude that an effective strategy to keep the land open for migratory wildlife should consider spatial variation in \{WTA\} payment for land lease. It is suggested to consider stratifying the lease rates geographically to reflect the underlying spatial variation in WTA. "

A considerable part of soil carbon is protected from microbial attack by a range of physical and chemical mechanisms and is not sensitive to landuse change. We analyzed the soils data base for Sumatra (Indonesia) developed by the Center for Soil and Agroclimate Research (CSAR) to estimate effects of landuse on soil C content. Sumatra has a considerable diversity of soils ranging from those of recent origin in the highlands, to older sedimentary and heavily leached soils in the pedimont peneplain and large areas of wetland soils along the coast. Peat soils (Histosols) and other wetland soils (Aquic and Fluvic suborders) contain the greatest soil C reserves, followed by young volcanic soils (Andisols). Agricultural use of these soils can have a disproportionately large effect on C release to the atmosphere. On the major part of the upland soils the difference in (top) soil C content between natural forest and agricultural land is in the range 0.5–1.0% C, equivalent to a change in total C stock of 10–20 Mg ha−1. These results agree with data collected in S. Sumatra in the 1930s. Corg of forest soils is related to soil pH, and is lowest in the pH range 5.0–6.0. Wetland conditions, lower pH, higher altititude (lower temperature) and higher clay and silt content all contributed to higher soil C contents in a multiple regression analysis of the whole data set. Existing models and data sets are insufficient to predict changes in soil C contents under various landuse practices. Carbon isotope studies, and especially the δ13C method may be used to study the effects of landuse change, especially when the vegetation was changed from one dominated by \{C3\} plants (most forest species) to one dominated by grasses and crops with a \{C4\} photosynthetic pathway. Results from Brazil documented a gradual decline of organic matter originating from the forest system and its partial replacement by organic matter derived from inputs of sugarcane during the first fifty years of cultivation. Forest conversion to well managed grasslands may lead to an increased soil C storage, after an initial decline. The consequences of erosion on losses of soil C depend on the scale at which these losses are considered, because of sedimentation processes. When net erosion losses are not expressed per unit area, but per length scale to the power l.6, erosion losses appear to be largely independent of scale. The `fractal dimension of erosion’ (on average around 1.6) probably is a landscape characteristic and estimates of its value are needed for extrapolation. Better understanding of soil C deposition sites is needed to evaluate overall erosion effects and test whether or not erosion can contribute to net C sequestration. "

This study seeks to clarify the role of spatial patterns of post-burn dead biomass (necromass) in soil run-off and redeposition and their combined effect on spatial patterns in soil pH and resin-extractable P. The study is carried out on a post-productive rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) agroforest in Sumatra, Indonesia. Soils are classified as Dystric Fluvisols. After slash-and-burn of vegetation, the field was planted with rubber seedlings and rice (Oryza sativa). For comparison the adjacent rubber agroforest site was sampled. Soil run-off is expressed here as the quantity of downward moving soil that passed the specific location of a flow trap. Existing physical soil run-off barriers and crop performance were scored. Despite serious soil run-off from the steeper upper slopes little soil was actually lost because of the slope form of the field, presence of natural soil run-off barriers, and the planted crop. Spatial variability of soil pH decreased at the expense of small-scale, within-strata, variability mainly because of the patchy distribution of soil run-off barriers. Soil run-off, aggravated by slash-and-burn, did not result in development of a clear soil fertility gradient down slope. In areas of high soil run-off potential, clear burns should be avoided because soil run-off barriers like remnants of slash-and-burn and surface litter maintain the soil and its fertility. "

The turnover rates of these easily measurable fractions were determined by assessing their 13C isotope signatures in a chronose-quence under surgane after rainforest conversion. The net monthly decomposition rates of light (L), intermediate (I) and heavy (H) fractions of macro-organic matter (150 μm – 2 mm size) under sugarcane cultivated for 2–10 years following forest removal ranged from 0.0162 and 0.0154 month−1 for forest-derived L and I fractions to 0.0118 month−1 for H fractions, while for unfractionated forest soil organic matter it was 0.0068 month−1. The soil carbon of the \{CENTURY\} model was reconstructed and the ‘slow’ (SOM2) pool was divided into L, I, H and R fractions, where the R (resistant) fraction represents the 50–150 μm size fraction. The modified \{CENTURY\} model simulated the dynamics of L, I and H fractions as well as total organic carbon (C%) under sugarcane with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.90, 0.95 and 0.98, respectively. Without further adjustments the model was applied to woodlots of Gliricidia sepium and Peltophorum dasyrrachis. The model accounted for 60% of the variation in measured light (L) fraction in the 0–5 cm layer under Gliricidia and Peltophorum, but only for 40% of the variation in the I and H fraction data. Results thus show some progress in linking \{SOM\} models to measurable soil organic matter fractions, but are not yet satisfactory for the heavier fractions, more strongly associated with mineral particles. Experimental data for these fractions show a considerable spatial variability, possibly linked to activity of soil fauna, not covered by the model. "

It contributes to the debate on the alleged effectiveness of such economic incentives to actually change decisions among land users. Building on the standard \{PES\} theory of change, one would assume that farmers respond to payments and change their land use decisions accordingly for the delivery of environmental services. However, at the project level the impacts of economic incentives depend on how the signal is transmitted to decision-makers. An extensive household survey was undertaken among 270 participating farmers in order to investigate these assumptions. Results indicate that farmers join the scheme for intrinsic motivations rather than because of economic incentives. Besides, the scheme does not target farmers whose decisions could be changed for the sake of service provision. Finally, farmer group leaders display disproportionate power of decision while individual farmers have a low level of understanding of the \{PES\} programme. As a consequence, land use patterns might not depend on the economic incentive only; rather they are likely to be determined by the local social context, traditions and economic dependency on forests. This in turn casts some doubts on the strong (yet contested) economic assumptions that underlie the emergence of \{PES\} schemes and on their modus operandi in developing countries. "

The effects of long-term (19 years) tropical pasture (GP) and market-gardening (MG) on the distribution of carbon (C) and monosaccharides (MS) (individual carbohydrate monomers) across water-stable aggregates were investigated on a Vertisol (clayey, smectitic, Leptic Hapludert) of Martinique (French West Indies). Our objective was to distinguish whether the carbohydrate components identified, important stabilizing agents for aggregation, were altered after a change in land use. Surface (0–10 cm) soil samples were collected in \{GP\} and \{MG\} plots, and separated by wet-sieving into four aggregate classes (secondary organomineral separates) prior to analyses of C and monosaccharides. Concurrently, various parts of Digitaria decumbens, the vegetation dominating pasture, were analyzed for monosaccharides. The highest losses of C upon cultivation were observed in the larger aggregates 200–2000 μm where about 41% were in the form of particulate organic matter (POM) and the remaining mainly in the form of an organo-clay 0–5 μm fraction. Cultivation also affected the proportion of soil C present as carbohydrates in the aggregates. All the aggregates of the pasture soil were significantly richer in monosaccharides than those in the cultivated soil, the aggregates 200–2000 μm accounting for most of the soil carbohydrates. Whatever the separates considered in the pasture soil, glucose was the dominant sugar monomer, followed by xylose or mannose. The 0–5 and 5–20 μm aggregates containing more mannose than xylose—a sugar essentially of plant origin—displayed a microbial character. We concluded on a microbial storage of organic matter in aggregates &lt;20 μm. In addition, it appeared that xylose which was highly depleted within macroaggregates after cultivation might be responsible for the management-induced changes in aggregate stability. This sugar, mainly associated with the 0–20 μm fraction, probably originated from plant exudates. "

Specifically, we looked at a top-down model (macro-aggregates form around organic matter particles and micro-aggregates form within the macro-aggregates) and a bottom-up model (micro-aggregates form independently and are incorporated into macro-aggregates) of soil aggregate formation. Soil samples were collected from experiments on improved tree fallows using different species and two tillage treatments; water-stable aggregates were extracted and sorted into three size classes: macro-aggregates (&gt; 212 μm), meso-aggregates (53–212 μm) and micro-aggregates (20–53 μm). Organic matter characterization of each fraction was based on 13C isotope abundance, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and the abundance of polysaccharides. Improved fallows increased soil C by 0.28 and 0.26 kg m­2 in the top 20 cm of the soil profile in Luero and Teso, respectively. Tillage altered the distribution of aggregates among size classes. Changes in the δ13C signature in each fraction indicated that more of the new carbon was found in the macro-aggregates (35–70%) and meso-aggregates (18–49%) in Luero and less (9–17%) was found in the micro-aggregates. In Teso, about 40–80% of the new aggregate C was found in the meso-aggregates, 14–45% was found in the micro-aggregates and only 4–26% was found in the macro-aggregates. The meso-aggregates and macro-aggregates to a lesser extent, in both sites, were enriched in carboxylic-C and aromatic-C, indicating the importance of \{OM\} decomposition and plant-derived C in the stabilization of larger aggregates, supporting the top-down model of aggregate formation. Microbially derived polysaccharides play a leading role in the formation of stable micro-aggregates and carboxylic-C promotes stabilization through surface occlusion. This bottom-up process is essential to promote long-term carbon sequestration in soils. Additionally, the micro-aggregates at both sites were enriched in polysaccharides and had elevated ratios of galactose + mannose:arabinose + xylose than the other aggregate fractions, indicating the importance of microbial processes in the formation of stable micro-aggregates and supporting the bottom-up model.

The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) has commonly been applied for spatial erosion risk assessment in the tropics, but has rarely been validated using ground observations of soil degradation. As with any empirical model, application in new regions requires calibration before results are used for decision support. We evaluated \{USLE\} effectiveness for predicting erosion in a small watershed in western Kenya based on 420 georeferenced ground observations of ordinal erosion class (three categories) systematically collected from throughout the basin. Relativized model factors were parameterized using standard remote assessment methods based on interpolated spatial data layers. Inference of degradation status at cultivated sites was estimated by calibration to near infrared diffuse reflectance spectra obtained from sampled soils; diagnostic models based on spectra produced validation accuracies of 78% for three categories. Association between \{USLE\} predicted risk and observed erosion, estimated using mixed effects logistic regression to control for within-site variability, correctly classified only 38% of sites into three degradation classes and model sensitivity for delineating regions of severe degradation was only 28%. Graphical modeling was used to identify those \{USLE\} risk factors that were conditionally associated with observed degradation, and an ordinal logistic regression model, employing only these factors was developed. This alternative model, which allowed statistical flexibility in estimating effect direction and strength, correctly predicted ordinal degradation class at 54% of field sites, with 55% sensitivity for the severe degradation class. This result suggests a critical need for efficient ground-based sampling schemes to be used in conjunction with flexible statistical models based on \{USLE\} factors for future investments in erosion risk assessment in the tropics.

With the purpose to search for solutions to these problems, agroforestry systems with a leguminous shrub Tephrosia candida (Roxb.) D.C. were experimentally tested on-farm in an upland rice (Oryza sativa L.) system on sloping land in northern Vietnam during the period 1996–1999. The upland rice-based systems tested were: (1) fallow crop rotation, including natural fallow (NaFa) and Tephrosia fallow (TepFa); (2) continuous cropping, including monocropping (Mono), Tephrosia hedgerow intercropping (TepAl), and Tephrosia mulch transfer (TepMu). In this paper, findings concerning net returns per labour day and the response of farmers to the test systems are presented. The Tephrosia systems (TepFa, TepAl, and TepMu) and the existing systems (NaFa and Mono) were evaluated using both experimental measurements and participatory rural appraisal (PRA) techniques. In the different treatments over a 4-year rotation, 386–778 labour days ha−1 were used, while 2612–4924 kg ha−1 upland rice grain and 939–9601 kg ha−1 fuel wood were harvested. The upland rice grain harvested was enough to feed 8.7–16.4 persons ha−1.

The returns per unit labour were 3.7–6.7 kg rice or US$ 0.8–1.44 labour per day. Farmer criteria concerning management, labour input and soil conservation were well in accordance with the findings on labour input, crop yields and net returns. The Tephrosia systems seemed not to be rational alternatives for situations where the natural fallow systems are still viable. However, the Tephrosia fallow and the Tephrosia mulch transfer systems could increase crop yield per hectare at acceptable rates of return to labour. "

While efforts to internalize the external costs of soil erosion in monetary units are available in the literature, we offer an alternative approach based on emergy synthesis, which enumerates the value of soil based on the environmental work required to produce it rather than based on surveys or derived pricing techniques. Emergy synthesis integrates all flows within a system of coupled economic and environmental work in common biophysical units (embodied solar energy or solar emjoules—sej), facilitating direct comparisons between natural and financial capital. Insight into long-term sustainability of human economic production and its basis in natural capital stocks is achieved via a suite of emergy-based indices. Our objective was to provide context for the magnitude of soil erosion losses within the larger resource basis of the Kenyan economy at three scales. Our results suggest that erosion losses at the national scale (4.5E21 sej/yr) are equal in magnitude to national electricity production or agricultural exports (equivalent to $ 390 million annually or 3.8% of GDP). This significant hidden, long-term cost is magnified in the selected district economies. In particular, in Nyando district (a densely populated rural district in western Kenya) we estimate that soil erosion represents over 14% of total emergy flows. The soil intensity of agriculture (SIA = agricultural yield/soil loss, both in emergy units) of Nyando (2.25) illustrates a severely marginalized agricultural sector in comparison with the nation as a whole (SIA = 7.56) or other nations (SIAUSA = 81.9, \{SIABrazil\} = 15.6). Soil loss measurements across land uses typical in western Kenya allowed emergy evaluation of differential costs and benefits; soil loss represented between 12 and 62% of total emergy use (subsistence agriculture \{SIA\} = 8.13, communal rangeland \{SIA\} = 1.62). By quantifying the ecological costs of soil erosion in units directly comparable with flows in other sectors of the economic system, we provide a baseline measure of sustainability against which appropriate investment (i.e., scaled to problem magnitude, targeted to hot-spots) in soil conservation may be evaluated.

An 11 year old field experiment, gliricidia–maize simultaneous intercropping, with and without a small application of inorganic fertilizer was studied to increase our understanding of the long-term effects of continuous applications of gliricidia prunings on maize yield and soil chemical properties. The main objectives were to assess: (1) the yield of gliricidia prunings under intensive pruning management, (2) the effect of continuous applications of gliricidia prunings and fertilizer on maize yield and soil properties. During 11 years of intensive pruning, gliricidia trees maintained high levels of leafy biomass production (4–5 Mg \{DM\} ha−1). Application of gliricidia prunings increased maize yield three-fold over sole maize cropping without any soil amendments (3.8 and 1.1 Mg ha−1, respectively). Maize yield declined with time under sole maize cropping system in both treatments with and without inorganic N fertilizer. Application of inorganic fertilizer (46 kg N ha−1) in agroforestry systems increased maize yield by 29% (P = 0.002). Application of inorganic P did not significantly increase maize yield implying that the native P in the topsoil and P recycled through gliricidia prunings application was enough to support maize growth. The trees took up “native” soil nutrients (P, Ca, Mg and K) from the depth and pumped these to the surface soil. A net soil nutrient decrease in the gliricidia–maize simultaneous intercropping system was observed due to increased nutrient export. "

The trees ranged between 4.0 and 8.0 m in height and formed part of an agroforestry experiment in semi-arid Kenya where rapid fluctuations in canopy cover rendered allometric approaches inappropriate for determining leaf area. The first method used unmodified theory for determining leaf area in continuous canopies which has proved suitable for isolated bushes. In the second method, path lengths through the canopy were calculated from simple measurements of canopy dimensions and the importance of subsidiary assumptions concerning leaf angle distribution was tested. Leaf angle distribution, which is required for canopy simulation models, was also determined using both direct and indirect approaches and the effect of using assumed leaf angle distributions when calculating leaf area was assessed. The canopy analyser proved unsuitable for measuring leaf angle distributions in isolated canopies, and it was necessary to make direct canopy measurements for this instrument to be used for smaller canopies. It was also shown that, even when path lengths are measured, calibration may be necessary to avoid bias; uncalibrated leaf area density values were, on average, underestimated by 16% for M. volkensii and overestimated by 8% for C. megalocarpus with respect to destructively determined values.

However, there is lack of knowledge to inform the necessary strategies and actions for achieving this goal. A study was conducted to assess water utilization and productivity in one of the rice irrigation schemes in the Upper Ruaha River Basin in Tanzania. The water balance approach was applied to determine the components of water use and crop productivity. Rainfall analysis was done for trends and variability in relation to the on-set, cessation and their likely contribution during the rice-growing season using data of ten years from the meteorological station in the study area. The gross water use for growing rice was 2300 mm/ha, of which 28% was used for wetting up the fields during land preparation. With an average effective rainfall of 500 mm, irrigation requirement was estimated to be 1800 mm and productivity of irrigation water was less than 0.3 kg/m3. The findings from this study show that productivity of water can be improved relatively easily up to 9% from the current levels if the transplanting season coincides with rainfall between the last decades of December and January, the period with sufficient and uniformly distributed rainfall. This conjunctive use of water leads to shorter season lengths and savings of water that can then be considered for allocation to other intra or intersectoral uses. "

Here, we analyze the changes associated with direct and indirect use of freshwater and land for meat and milk production in three production systems in Kenya between the 1980s and 2000s. We use two resource use indicators, the water footprint (m3/year) and land footprint (ha), to assess changes in freshwater and land use for cattle, goats, sheep and camels in arid, semi-arid and humid production systems. We estimate actual water and land use using Kenya-wide data for yields, feed composition and feed conversion efficiencies. Our results show that the amounts of freshwater and land resources used for production are determined mainly by production volumes and feed conversion efficiencies. Total water and land footprints of milk production increased for goats, sheep and camels but decreased by half for cattle in arid and semi-arid production systems, in correspondence with similar changes in the total numbers of each livestock species. Green water and grazing land footprints dominated in all production systems due to the predominance of indirect use of water to support forage production. The per unit meat footprint for cattle increased significantly between the 1980s and 2000s in all production systems, due to adverse trends in feed conversion efficiency, while changes in the water and land footprints of other animal products were small, due to modest changes in all influencing factors. In contrast, national average footprints per unit of beef and milk show a modest decrease due to a relative shift of production to the more resource-efficient humid production system. Given the potential increase in demand for livestock products and limited freshwater and land availability, feed conversion efficiencies should be improved by rehabilitating degraded rangelands, adopting improved breeds and using appropriate feed composition.

The agroforestry systems were established on unmanaged pastures near the La Selva Biological Station in 1989 and 1990. The original forest had been removed on most of these areas at least 25 years earlier. Tree components of the agroforestry systems were the tropical hardwoods Vochysia ferruginea (Botarrama), V. guatemalensis (Chancho), Stryphnodendron microstachyum (Vainello) and Hieronyma alchorneoides (Pilón). The soil properties studied included physical (soil bulk density; 0–10 cm), chemical [pH, exchangeable bases, extractable P, soil organic C (SOC) and total soil N; 0–50 cm] and biological parameters (mineralizable C and N and microbial biomass C and N; 0–15 cm). Soils were sampled in August 1995. Lower exchangeable bases and soil pH were noted in agroforestry treatments as compared to pastures. Extractable P was higher in the surface 25 cm of agroforestry plots. Total soil N, soil organic C and soil C : N ratios were not influenced by agroforestry systems. Higher mineralizable C levels were observed in pasture surface soils, but no differences in mineralizable N in soils under pasture and agroforestry systems were observed. Soil microbial biomass C and N and specific respiratory activity were not significantly different in pastures and agroforestry systems. Agroforestry systems did not appear to improve soils in this study compared to pasture. "

Microbial substrate use in soils from the field experiment was compared in incubation experiments. Higher levels of soil organic matter and microbial biomass in the maize–crotalaria rotation were connected with higher total amounts of phospholipid fatty acids and an increase in the relative abundances of indicators for fungi and gram-negative bacteria. P fertilization changed the community profile only within the continuous maize treatment. The decomposition of glucose, cellulose and three plant residues (all added at 2.5 g C kg−1 soil) proceeded faster in soil from the maize–crotalaria rotation, but differences were mostly transient. Microbial P and N uptake within one week increased with the water-soluble carbon content of added plant residues. More P and N were taken up by the greater microbial biomass in soil from the maize–crotalaria rotation than from continuous maize. Re-mineralization of nutrients during the decline of the microbial biomass increased also with the initial biological activity of the soil, but occurred only for a high quality plant residue within the half year incubation period. Compared to the effect of crop rotation, P fertilization had a minor effect on microbial community composition and substrate use. "

Also, unwashed and washed ripe fruit were exposed to direct sunlight to mimic the conditions at roadside markets where the fruit are commonly sold, and then compared with fruit kept under shade. Incising green fruit accelerated skin darkening and loss of yellowness and greenness as indicated by decreases in chroma L* and b* values, and increasing a* values, respectively. Decreases in skin brightness and yellowness also occurred in the incised brown skinned fruit, but their greenness did not change significantly over time. Severity of darkening increased with increasing level of damage on the skin. Peeling and slicing of both green and brown skinned fruit resulted in loss of flesh brightness, and yellowness and greenness over time. Exposing ripe fruit to direct sunlight after harvest resulted in more skin darkening compared with keeping the fruit under shade. No significant differences in skin darkening were found between unwashed and washed fruit.

The results of the inorganic-N measurements were consistent with the previous study, showing elevated NO3− deep in the soil profile of the nests. However, neither net mineralization nor net nitrification were significantly greater at depth in the mineral soil of the nests compared to soil that was not influenced by nests (P=0.05), although variability was higher in the nest soil.

Since all systems improve conservation of nutrients and most give extra marketable produce, they were expected to increase farm profitability. On upland farms in Lampung, South Sumatra, both inter- and secondary crops were found to improve yields compared with cassava monocropping and thus the income derived from growing cassava or rice with maize. These increases were equivalent to between 70 and 440 \{US\} dollars per hectare. An economic analysis of the lowland rice-producing systems in North East Thailand suggested that with the exception of growing cowpea, the use of pre-rice cover crops was not profitable despite a substantial increase in rice yield, because the additional labour cost more than the additional income was worth. A benefit of leguminous crops, however, can be the extra marketable product. Groundnut in Indonesia and cowpea in Thailand gave an attractive extra US$ 400–1150 total income increase per hectare per year (i.e. extra yield of the main food crop plus extra marketable produce from the secondary crop) even after the additional costs were deducted. Hedgerow intercropping gave smaller profit margins of about US$ 90. Although both hedgerow intercropping and secondary cropping represent a considerable investment of labour by farmers, this investment may be more feasible than paying for fertilizer on credit. On balance the most attractive option tested was the use of a leguminous secondary crop, e.g. groundnut or multipurpose cowpea, within the food crop cycle. "

At that moment a thick haze caused by land-clearing related fires in Kalimantan and Sumatra, Indonesia, blanketed large parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, the Philippines and Thailand. These fires, aggravated by the El Niño weather pattern and described as the worst in Southeast Asian history, renewed a long-term debate on slash-and-burn (S&amp;B) as a method of land clearing. Acceptable alternatives to S&amp;B should address both the problems and the benefits of the use of fire. In depth knowledge and a clear diagnosis of the problems that rise with S&amp;B and its alternatives are needed. A social/economic/agronomic survey was therefore conducted among 37 small-scale rubber producers in Sepunggur, Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia. Our objectives were to: (1) characterize S&amp;B techniques; (2) characterize farmers' perspectives on land clearing methods related to agronomic/economic factors (soil fertility, plant growth, production); and (3) evaluate alternatives to S&amp;B that would be acceptable to individual farmers at present and in the near future. Small rubber producers (average farm size ≈5 ha) were selected because rubber gardens are the major land use type in this area, small producers are the main contributors, and most of the forest that is presently converted for agricultural use is being planted with rubber seedings. Farmers generally start slashing in March and burn in the month of August. Burning takes place in two steps: broadcast burn followed by pile-and-burn. The five advantages of using fire as mentioned by the farmers were: (1) burning creates space (51%); (2) ash acts as a fertilizer (23%); (3) burning improves soil structure enabling faster establishment of seedlings (15%); (4) burning reduces weed/tree competition (5%); and (5) burning reduces the occurrence of pests/diseases (3%). Alternatives to S&amp;B should be economically acceptable. Mulching does not provide an alternative to any of the benefits of burning. Slash-and-remove-wood addresses only the first advantage and requires a tremendous effort in labor. If forced to accept either alternative, farmers expect a reduction in income due to difficulties in establishing new rubber gardens, reductions in yield, and an increase in labor costs. At present, small quantities of wood with economic value are sold on the local market. Slash-sell-and-burn is an alternative that could maintain the advantages of using fire while supplying the farmer with extra income and the initiative to remove and not burn the trees. Even though forest is rapidly being converted to rubber gardens, land clearing will remain in practice to rejuvenate the old rubber gardens or to convert them to other land use systems. By selling rubberwood, farmers could cover costs of land clearing and earn enough to cover some of the costs of buying higher-yielding clones for rubber planting. This alternative has benefits similar to using fire and could significantly reduce pollution problems, but a change in local trade regulations and taxes is required for its successful adoption. "

A modified WaNuLCAS model was then used to infer the amount of water redistribued based on ψs values. Tree transpiration rate was also estimated from sap velocity using thermal dissipative probes (TDP) and sapwood area, and the contribution of hydraulically redistributed water in tree transpiration was determined. The results revealed on average that 46% of the psychrometer readings under karité and 33% under néré showed the occurrence of \{HR\} for the two years. Soil under néré displayed significantly lower fluctuations of ψs (0.16 MPa) compared to soil under karité (0.21 MPa). The results of this study indicated that the existence of \{HR\} leads to a higher ψs in the plant rhizosphere and hence is important for soil water dynamics and plant nutrition by making more accessible the soluble elements. The simulation showed that the amount of water redistributed would be approximately 73.0 L and 247.1 L per tree per day in 2005 for karité and néré, and would represent respectively 60% and 53% of the amount transpired a day. Even though the model has certainly overestimated the volume of water hydraulically redistributed by the two species, this water may play a key role in maintaining fine root viability and ensuring the well adaptation of these species to the dry areas. Therefore, knowledge of the extent of such transfers and of the seasonal patterns is required and is of paramount importance in parkland systems both for trees and associated crops. "

This uniform resistance is met by the continuing evolution of new races of pests and pathogens that are able to overcome resistance genes introduced by modern breeding, creating the phenomenon of boom and bust cycles. One of the few assets available to small-scale farmers in developing countries to reduce pests and diseases damage is their local crop varietal diversity, together with the knowledge to manage and deploy this diversity appropriately. Local crop varietal diversity of banana and plantain (Musa spp.) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) was measured at the community and household levels within farmers’ fields in four agro-ecological areas of Uganda. Resistance of traditional and modern varieties of P. vulgaris to anthracnose, angular leaf spot, and bean fly and of traditional and modern varieties of Musa spp. to black sigatoka, banana weevils and nematodes was assessed from participatory diagnostics of farmer knowledge and cross-site on-farm and on-station trials. By performing cross-site on-farm experiments, it was possible to identify traditional varieties with higher resistance to pest and diseases when grown outside their home sites. Increased diversity of crop varieties, measured by number of varieties (richness) and their evenness of distribution, corresponded to a decrease in the average damage levels across sites and to a reduction of variance of disease damage. In sites with higher disease incidence, households with higher levels of diversity in their production systems had less damage to their standing crop in the field compared to sites with lower disease incidence. The results support what might be expected of a risk-minimizing strategy for use of diversity to reduce pest and disease damage. "

Of the 261 households that participated in the \{CV\} survey, these proportions were 23, 37 and 40%, respectively, indicating differentiation among the population and an overall preference for labour contribution. A comparison of predicted versus actual contribution of labour indicated that only 56% of households that said they would contribute actually contributed; 3% of households that said they would not contribute actually contributed. Major factors affecting contingent contributions of labour in discrete choice models were identified as well as those to account for in any successful scheme for actual labour contribution. These factors include the age of household head, offtake of cattle, involvement in secondary activities, membership in rural organizations, current expenditure on drug therapy, and cash-on-hand. The results also indicate that full cost-recovery of the investment in targets—about US$8000—could not be achieved in the short run with the proposed contribution of US$0.90–1.00 per month per household.

However, information about their impact on soil is scanty and investigations focusing exclusively on baseline data on C. odorata fallows in humid savannahs are still lacking. This study was designed to assess changes in soil physical, chemical and biological properties after the establishment of C. odorata fallows in humid savannahs of Ivory Coast. Sampling sites were selected such that a portion of C. odorata fallow was located next to the shrub savannah, the most common natural ecosystem in the area. Results revealed a rise of soil organic carbon (+ 27.9%), total nitrogen (+ 36.7%), total phosphorus (+ 56.8%), extractable calcium (+ 68.3) and magnesium (+ 140.3%) in the first 10 cm of soil beneath the C. odorata fallow relative to the savannah. Furthermore, the fallow was associated with high N-mineral pool as N-NO3− and N-NH4+ content increased at + 72.5% and + 71.5%, respectively. The infiltration capacity of water under C. odorata-based fallow was markedly high and soil macroinvertebrates, mainly earthworms, showed significant increases in density and biomass. The large quantity of good quality standing biomass produced by C. odorata is likely the main factor controlling the improvement of soil quality. The results suggest that there are merits for the integration of C. odorata fallow in a cropping system for sustainable food production in the buffer zone of Lamto Reserve. This can also help to reduce pressure on forest islands. "

The results show high fluoride concentrations and fluorosis hotspots were found to be predominately located in the lowlands of central Yuanmou County. Spatial distribution of high fluoride levels was found to be primarily determined by geology, arid climate, and topography. Both dental and skeletal fluorosis had dramatically decreased due to a program of low-fluoride drinking water supply supported by local governments. The prevalence of dental fluorosis in children had dropped from 43.26% in 1984 to 21.97% in 2006, and the number of skeletal fluorosis cases had decreased from 327 in 1984 to 148 in 2006, respectively.

The Sumberjaya area in Sumatra, Indonesia is representative for conflicts and evictions arising from this perception. The purpose of this study as part of a Negotiation Support System approach was to assess sediment yield both at plot and catchment scale and to relate it to a variety of possible clarifying factors i.e. land use, geology, soil and topography. Sediment yield at catchment scale per unit area, was found to be 3–10 times higher than soil loss measured in erosion plots. A stepwise regression showed that the dominant factors explaining sediment yield differences at catchment scale in this volcanic landscape were a particular lithology (Old Andesites) and slope angle followed by the silt fraction of the top soil. In lithologically sensitive areas soil loss at the plot scale under monoculture coffee gardens decreases over time from on average 7–11 Mg ha− 1 yr− 1 to 4–6 Mg ha− 1 yr− 1, mainly because of the development of surface litter layers as filters and top soil compaction in the areas without litter, but remains higher than under shade coffee systems or forest. The runoff coefficient under monoculture coffee remains on average significantly higher (10–15%) than under forest (4%) or under shade coffee systems (4–7%). In lithologically stable areas soil loss remained below 1.8 Mg ha− 1 yr− 1 and the runoff coefficient below 2.5% under all land use types, even bare soil plots or monoculture coffee gardens. Less than 20% of the catchment area produces almost 60% of the sediment yield. The reduction of negative off-site effects on e.g. the life time of a storage reservoir would benefit greatly from an improved assessment of the lithologies in volcanic landscapes and the consideration of potential sediment source and sink areas. In lithologically sensitive areas, a shift from sun to shade coffee systems may result in reducing surface runoff and soil loss, although water erosion at the plot scale is not the main contributor to sediment yield at the catchment scale. The quantification of land use effects on dominant erosive processes such as river bank and river bed erosion, landslides and the concentrated flow erosion on footpaths and roads can contribute to more targeted efforts and relevant incentives to reduce (or live with) sediment load of the rivers.

In this paper, we assess hydrologic regimes of the Mae Chaem River with landuse change. Three plausible future forest-to-crop expansion scenarios and a scenario of crop-to-forest reversal were developed based on the landcover transition from 1989 to 2000, with emphasis on influences of elevation bands and irrigation diversion. Basin hydrologic responses were simulated using the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM). Meteorological data from six weather stations inside and adjacent to the Mae Chaem watershed during the period 1993–2000 were the climate inputs. Computed stream flow was compared to observed discharge at Ban Mae Mu gauge on Mae Mu river, Ban Mae Suk gauge on Mae Suk river, and at Kaeng Ob Luang, located downstream from the district town in Mae Chaem. With current assumptions, expansion of highland crop fields led to slightly higher regulated annual and wet-season water yields compared to similar expansion in the lowland–midland zone. Actual downstream water availability was sensitive to irrigation diversion. This modeling approach can be a useful tool for water allocation for small watersheds undergoing rapid commercialization, because it alerts land managers to the potential range of water supply in wet and dry seasons, and provides information on spatial distribution of basin hydrologic components.

The lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the production and use of ethanol are estimated at 29 gCO2eq per \{MJ\} of ethanol produced which is a 67% reduction in comparison to gasoline emissions. Net Energy Value (NEV) and Net Renewable Energy Value (NREV) are −7 MJ/l and 17.7 MJ/l, while the energy yield ratio (ER) is 6.1. Economic allocation is chosen for dividing environmental burdens and resource consumption between sugar (i.e. main product) and molasses (i.e. co-product used for fuel production). Sensitivity analysis of various parameters is performed. The emissions and energy values are highly sensitive to sugarcane yield, ethanol yield, and the price of molasses. The use of sugarcane biomass residues (bagasse/trash) for efficient cogeneration, and different waste management options for the treatment of spent wash (effluent of distilleries) are also explored. Surplus bioelectricity generation in the efficient cogeneration plant, biogas recovery from wastewater treatment plant, and their use for fossil fuel substitution can help improve energy and environmental gains. The study also compares important results with other relevant international studies and discusses issues related to land use change (LUC) impact. "

The objective of this study is to investigate the changes of plasma proteome on 21 d before expected calving and 1 d after calving from dairy cows using an integrated proteomic approach consisting of minor abundance protein enrichment by ProteoMiner beads, protein labeling by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification, and protein identification by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Nineteen proteins were changed around the time of calving. These proteins were associated with response to stress, including acute-phase response and defense response, based on the proteins annotation. In particular, three up-regulated proteins after calving including factor V, α2-antiplasmin and prothrombin were assigned into the complement and coagulation pathway. These results may provide new information in elucidating host response to lactation and parturition stress, and inflammatory-like conditions at the protein level. Differential proteins may serve as potential markers to regulate the lactation and parturition stress in periparturient dairy cows. "

Understanding which farming options will give the highest return on investment in light of climate change is critical information for decision-making. While there is continued investment in testing adaptation options using on-farm experiments, simulation models remain important tools for ‘ex-ante’ assessments of the impacts of proposed climate-smart agricultural technologies (CSA). This study used the Ruminant model and the Trade-offs Analysis model for Multi-Dimensional Impact Assessment (TOA-MD) to assess how improved livestock management options affect the three pillars of CSA: increased productivity, improved food security, and reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our sample was stratified into: 1) households with local cow breeds (n = 28); 2) households with improved dairy cow breeds (n = 70); and 3) households without dairy cows (n = 66). Results showed that the predicted adoption rates for improved livestock feeding among households with improved dairy cows (stratum 2) were likely to be higher compared to households with only local cows (stratum 1). Both households with local cows and those with improved cows had increased income and food security. However, overall poverty reduction was only modest for households with local cows. Expected methane emissions intensity declined with adoption of improved livestock feeding strategies both in stratum 1 and stratum 2, and greater impacts were observed when households in stratum 2 received an additional improved cow breed. Providing a cow to households that were not keeping cows showed substantial economic gains. Additional research is, however, needed to understand why those farms currently do not have cows, which may determine if the predicted adoption rates are feasible. "

There are currently 332 recognized cetartiodactyl species, which are classified into 132 genera and 22 families. Most phylogenetic studies have focused on deep relationships, and no comprehensive time-calibrated tree for the group has been published yet. In this study, 128 new complete mitochondrial genomes of Cetartiodactyla were sequenced and aligned with those extracted from nucleotide databases. Our alignment includes 14,902 unambiguously aligned nucleotide characters for 210 taxa, representing 183 species, 107 genera, and all cetartiodactyl families. Our mtDNA data produced a statistically robust tree, which is largely consistent with previous classifications. However, a few taxa were found to be para- or polyphyletic, including the family Balaenopteridae, as well as several genera and species. Accordingly, we propose several taxonomic changes in order to render the classification compatible with our molecular phylogeny. In some cases, the results can be interpreted as possible taxonomic misidentification or evidence for mtDNA introgression. The existence of three new cryptic species of Ruminantia should therefore be confirmed by further analyses using nuclear data. We estimate divergence times using Bayesian relaxed molecular clock models. The deepest nodes appeared very sensitive to prior assumptions leading to unreliable estimates, primarily because of the misleading effects of rate heterogeneity, saturation and divergent outgroups. In addition, we detected that Whippomorpha contains slow-evolving taxa, such as large whales and hippos, as well as fast-evolving taxa, such as river dolphins. Our results nevertheless indicate that the evolutionary history of cetartiodactyls was punctuated by four main phases of rapid radiation during the Cenozoic era: the sudden occurrence of the three extant lineages within Cetartiodactyla (Cetruminantia, Suina and Tylopoda); the basal diversification of Cetacea during the Early Oligocene; and two radiations that involve Cetacea and Pecora, one at the Oligocene/Miocene boundary and the other in the Middle Miocene. In addition, we show that the high species diversity now observed in the families Bovidae and Cervidae accumulated mainly during the Late Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene. "

Over time, tree populations have become adapted to their habitats including the local ecological disturbances they face. As the planet enters a phase of human-induced climate change of unprecedented speed and magnitude, however, previously locally-adapted populations are rendered less suitable for new conditions, and ‘natural’ biotic and abiotic disturbances are taken outside their historic distribution, frequency and intensity ranges. Tree populations rely on phenotypic plasticity to survive in extant locations, on genetic adaptation to modify their local phenotypic optimum or on migration to new suitable environmental conditions. The rate of required change, however, may outpace the ability to respond, and tree species and populations may become locally extinct after specific, but as yet unknown and unquantified, tipping points are reached. Here, we review the importance of forest genetic resources as a source of evolutionary potential for adaptation to changes in climate and other ecological factors. We particularly consider climate-related responses in the context of linkages to disturbances such as pests, diseases and fire, and associated feedback loops. The importance of management strategies to conserve evolutionary potential is emphasised and recommendations for policy-makers are provided. "

The findings indicate that \{MTS\} takes into consideration most of the activities of an adaptation strategy, is a profitable venture (BCR &gt; 1) and has a high potential to reduce vulnerability due to short-term food production and long-term plantation establishment.

China introduced an insurance scheme to mitigate human–elephant conflict in Xishuangbanna Dai autonomous prefecture in Yunnan Province, where elephants cause damage to rubber plantations. However, recent experience has suggested that the present insurance system exhibits poor performance related to funding shortfalls, undervaluing of plantations and insufficient payouts, and by limiting community involvement. To address these shortcomings we conducted attitude surveys with farmers, and developed an actuarial (risk-based) insurance model for rubber loss that incorporated spatially-explicit risk of depredation and net present value of rubber at damage, in order to calculate fair payouts at village and town levels for the year 2011. Farmers were largely dissatisfied with the current insurance system, and their level of satisfaction was associated with the compensation ratio (percentage of lost rubber reimbursed by insurance). The illustrative results based on 2011 rubber loss data revealed high variability in risk and therefore payouts (and further, premiums) and that fair insurance payouts would be approximately five times the current levels. To improve compensation and support long-term program sustainability, we considered an insurance cost-sharing mechanism that incorporated shared payments from government, rubber farmers, and Chinese tourists. We found that multiple stakeholders were willing to pay for elephant conservation, which could make significant contributions to insurance premiums over the long term. Importantly, this proposed insurance model could be broadly applicable to livestock and long-lived cash crop compensation systems. "

The results reflect the production practices of the region, suggesting that important traits in developing breed improvement programs should include disease resistance, fitness for traction and reproductive performance. Beef and milk production are less important traits. The study shows the potential usefulness of conjoint analysis for quantifying preferences in less developed countries for livestock and for the wide variety of other multiple-attribute goods. One implication is that conjoint analysis provides a quantitative methodology that helps make diverse livelihood strategies more operational. Distinguishing differences in preferences between groups of respondents in connection with specific agro-ecological zones and production systems can be used to promote conservation-through-use of breeds at risk of extinction.

Relations between and soil properties (particle-size distribution, soil depth) and C contents were studied. Furthermore, geostatistical analyses of C contents were realised in order to characterise the C storage in soil at plot scale. The increase of C contents from 1992 (Y0) to 1997 (Y5) was 5 g C (kg soil)−1 in the topsoil (0–10 cm) and 2.5 g C kg soil−1, or 7.5 Mg C ha−1, in the 0–30-cm layer. The intensity of organic C storage had a spatial pattern, although the C/N ratio remained homogeneous across the plot. However, there was no correlation between the C increase and the particle-size distribution or the depth of the soil. In the topsoil, the local variability of the C contents increased with time until 1995 and then there was a gradually spreading of this local variability. Plant-cover distribution and physical structure of vertisol could explain the evolution of spatial structure of the soil C content. "

Following a review of the watershed management literature, and brief program and methodological overviews, the paper explores in detail the concepts of “participation” and “integration” in watershed management. Conceptual and methodological dimensions of the terms are discussed in the context of a watershed implementation process, clarifying how “watershed issues” are defined by local users, how “stakeholders” are defined with respect to those issues, and how participation and integration may be operationalized in practice. Data are selectively chosen from different pilot sites to illustrate how concepts underlying watershed management have been refined, and methods improved. It is clear that “participation” in problem diagnosis and program implementation must move beyond community-level fora to socially-disaggregated processes and explicit management of trade-offs to diverse groups. Secondly, integration does not come about through implementation of parallel interventions, but rather through an explicit analysis of potential trade-offs and synergies of interventions to diverse system components, and strategies to define and reach systems-level goals. Each approach requires attention to ways to optimize returns to diverse social groups and system components while minimizing negative spin-offs. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications for agricultural research and development in the eastern African region. "

An on-farm experiment was established in 1996 in northern Viet Nam to examine the contribution of the leguminous bush Tephrosia candida (Roxb.) D.C. as a fallow or hedgerow species and as a mulch producer to improve nutrient cycling and prevent nutrient losses by erosion. The systems tested were upland rice monocropping (Mono), natural fallow (NaFa), fallow of Tephrosia (TepFa), hedgerow intercropping with upland rice (Oryza sativa L.) and internal mulching using pruned Tephrosia biomass (TepAl), and upland rice with external mulching using Tephrosia biomass (TepMu). Over two cropping seasons, from April 1996 to April 1998, nutrients recycled and inputs and exports were recorded, as well as changes in C-, N- and P-pools, and in pH in the 0–5 cm topsoil layer. The Tephrosia systems (TepFa, TepAl, TepMu) prevented nutrient losses by erosion effectively. Compared to the NaFa system, the TepFa system accumulated 34% more N in the above-ground plant parts and increased topsoil N by 20%, probably due to N-fixation. There was a trend that the less labile P-pools (NaOH-P) were reallocated into the more labile P-pools (Bicarb-P) in the soil of the TepFa system. Burning released significant amounts of the inorganic P-pools in both the NaFa and TepFa systems and this effect seemed to be more pronounced in the TepFa than in the NaFa. Organic input to crop export ratios for N and P were &gt;1 in the TepAl and TepMu treatments. This was due to a sufficient quantity and quality of the Tephrosia mulching material. However, moderately labile NaOH-extractable organic P seemed to be depleted in the topsoil due to high P uptake in the TepMu treatment. Thus, nutrient cycling and nutrient balances were improved under the Tephrosia systems. But for long-term P sustainability, there is a belief that a combined use of mulching and mineral P fertiliser is needed. "

In particular, an abundant literature shows that earthworms, through their burrowing and feeding activities, influence particle size distribution, organic matter content, organic matter location, soil aggregation, aggregate stability and tensile strength, soil roughness, and water infiltration. All those properties greatly influence soil erodibility and soil erosion. Nevertheless, there are few quantitative studies of the influence of earthworms on soil erosion. In some cases, earthworms are said to increase soil losses while other studies emphasize their control on structural stability inducing a reduction in soil erosion. This paper analyses the effects of endogeic earthworms on soil erosion, using recently published data collected in the humid tropics. Endogeics comprise two separate functional groups regarding their effects on soil physical properties, i.e. “compacting” and “decompacting” species whose effects on soil erosion may differ substantially. The effects of these earthworms on soil erodibility and erosion in the tropics ultimately depend on soil types and on the organic matter content in soils. In kaolinitic soils, irrespective of clay content, endogeics greatly influence aggregation, aggregate stability, total porosity and pore size distribution; whereas in smectitic soils (such as vertisols), earthworms have a smaller effect on soil erodibility than soil organic matter and cations. Some options for managing earthworms and organic matter in order to limit soil erosion are also discussed in this paper. "

This study aimed to quantify the medium-term impact of tillage (conventional and reduced) and crop residue management (retention and removal) on soil and crop performance in a maize–soybean rotation. A replicated field trial was started in sub-humid Western Kenya in 2003, and measurements were taken from 2005 to 2008. Conventional tillage negatively affected soil aggregate stability when compared to reduced tillage, as indicated by lower mean weight diameter values upon wet sieving at 0–15 cm (PT &lt; 0.001). This suggests increased susceptibility to slaking and soil erosion. Tillage and residue management alone did not affect soil C contents after 11 cropping seasons, but when residue was incorporated by tillage, soil C was higher at 15–30 cm (PT*R = 0.037). Lack of treatment effects on the C content of different aggregate fractions indicated that reduced tillage and/or residue retention did not increase physical C protection. The weak residue effect on aggregate stability and soil C may be attributed to insufficient residue retention. Soybean grain yields tended to be suppressed under reduced tillage without residue retention, especially in wet seasons (PT*R = 0.070). Consequently, future research should establish, for different climatic zones and soil types, the critical minimum residue retention levels for soil conservation and crop productivity. "

As intensification occurs, the regulation of functions through soil biodiversity is progressively replaced by regulation through chemical and mechanical inputs. However, the causal relationships between (l) composition, diversity and abundance of soil organisms and (2) sustained soil fertility are unclear. Furthermore, in tropical agricultural systems undergoing intensification, large numbers of farmers have limited access to inputs, and therefore the maintenance and enhancement of soil biodiversity may be particularly relevant to such farmers. In this paper we propose a number of hypotheses which could be tested to explore the relationships between agricultural intensification, biodiversity in tropical soils and ecosystem functions. We also provide a conceptual framework within which such hypotheses can be tested. "

Land-use and climatic changes have greatly modified the conditions of Sudanian and Sahelian hydrology, impacting the regime and discharge of the main rivers. Human pressure on the environment (significant increase in crops and disappearance of natural bushes and landscapes, for example) has led to severe soil crusting and desertification throughout Sahelian regions. Despite recent increases in rainfall, the drought has not ended, resulting in two different hydrological evolutions. In the Sudanian areas, stream flows have been reduced, sometimes as much as twice the rainfall reduction rate. In the Sahelian regions, runoff coefficients have increased to such a degree that discharges are increasing, in spite of the reduced rainfall. The main goal of this paper is to synthesize the recent advances in the Sahelian and Sudano-Sahelian West African hydrology. The other objectives are two fold: First, to discuss the “Sahelian Paradox” (the increase in runoff in most of the Sahel during the drought, at least during the 1968–1995 period, as described in the 1980s) and paradox of groundwater highlighted in the square degree of Niamey (the rise in water table levels in some endorheic areas during the same drought, evidenced in the 1990s), and second, to attempt to define the application of their respective geographical areas. The land-use changes act as a general factor of hydrological evolution of soils and basins, while some spatial factors explain the great variability in the response to environmental evolution, such as endorheism, geological context, latitudinal climate gradient, and local hydrodynamic behaviour of environment. This paper is literature-based, and incorporates current research advances in the field, as well as a prospective focused on resources and socio-economic impacts. "

Reliable indicators of farm performance are needed in order to model these links, and to therefore be able to design interventions which meet the differing needs of specific user groups. However, the lack of standardization of performance indicators has led to a wide array of tools and ad-hoc indicators which limit our ability to compare across studies and to draw general conclusions on relationships and trade-offs whereby performance indicators are shaped by farm management and the wider social-environmental context. \{RHoMIS\} is a household survey tool designed to rapidly characterise a series of standardised indicators across the spectrum of agricultural production and market integration, nutrition, food security, poverty and \{GHG\} emissions. The survey tool takes 40–60 min to administer per household using a digital implementation platform. This is linked to a set of automated analysis procedures that enable immediate cross-site bench-marking and intra-site characterisation. We trialled the survey in two contrasting agro-ecosystems, in Lushoto district of Tanzania (n = 150) and in the Trifinio border region of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras (n = 285). The tool rapidly characterised variability between farming systems at landscape scales in both locations identifying key differences across the population of farm households that would be critical for targeting \{CSA\} interventions. Our results suggest that at both sites the climate smartness of different farm strategies is clearly determined by an interaction between the characteristics of the farm household and the farm strategy. In general strategies that enabled production intensification contributed more towards the goals of climate smart agriculture on smaller farms, whereas increased market orientation was more successful on larger farms. On small farms off-farm income needs to be in place before interventions can be promoted successfully, whereas on the larger farms a choice is made between investing labour in off-farm incomes, or investing that labour into the farm, resulting in a negative association between off-farm labour and intensification, market orientation and crop diversity on the larger farms, which is in complete opposition to the associations found for the smaller farms. The balance of indicators selected gave an adequate snap shot picture of the two sites, and allowed us to appraise the ‘CSA-ness’ of different existing farm strategies, within the context of other major development objectives.

Higher short-term yields from increasing surfaces under cultivation in this farming system have contributed to the country being ranked as top cocoa producer in the world. However the negative consequences including biodiversity loss, soil fertility depletion and soil quality degradation associated with this system, have incredibly received so less attention that the type and magnitude of such agro-ecological consequences within the current context of climate change are worth investigating. The present study was undertaken in the former cocoa belt of Central-Western Côte d’Ivoire, precisely in the Oumé Department. The main objective was to assess the impact of forest conversion to full-sun cocoa plantations on above and below-ground biodiversity along with soil quality by measuring chemical, physical and biological parameters along a chronosequence of different ages (5, 10 and 20 years). The results are summarized as follows: (i) the conversion of semi-deciduous forests to cocoa plantations resulted in plant diversity and species richness loss due to the disappearance of a huge number of native species while earthworm abundance and species richness increased due to the appearance of species adapted to degraded lands, (ii) soil quality was severely impaired by cocoa farming with the worse scenario being found under the 10-year-old cocoa plantations, where SOC, total N, \{CEC\} contributed mostly to soil quality degradation. The contribution of these findings to devise options for sustainable tree-based cocoa farming is discussed. "

Since its detection in Spain in 2006, the pest is continuing to expand its geographical range, including the recent detection in several Sub-Saharan African countries. The present study proposed a model based on cellular automata to predict year-to-year the risk of the invasion and spread of T. absoluta across Africa. Using, land vegetation cover, temperature, relative humidity and yield of tomato production as key driving factors, we were able to mimic the spreading behavior of the pest, and to understand the role that each of these factors play in the process of propagation of invasion. Simulations by inferring the pest’s natural ability to fly long distance revealed that T. absoluta could reach South of Africa ten years after being detected in Spain (Europe). Findings also reveal that relative humidity and the presence of T. absoluta host plants are important factors for improving the accuracy of the prediction. The study aims to inform stakeholders in plant health, plant quarantine, and pest management on the risks that T. absoluta may cause at local, regional and event global scales. It is suggested that adequate measures should be put in place to stop, control and contain the process used by this pest to expand its range. "

The study comprised 14 non-commercialized hybrids (seven pairs of near-isogenic Bt and non-Bt hybrids) and four non-Bt commercial hybrids. Each plant was artificially infested twice with 10 first instar larvae. In CFT, plants were infested with C. partellus 14 and 24 days after planting; in BGH, plants were infested with B. fusca 21 and 31 days after planting. In CFT, the seven Bt hybrids significantly differed from their non-Bt counterparts for leaf damage, number of exit holes, percent tunnel length, and grain yield. When averaged over three seasons, Bt-hybrids gave the highest grain yield (9.7 t ha−1), followed by non-Bt hybrids (6.9 t ha−1) and commercial checks (6 t ha−1). Bt-hybrids had the least number of exit holes and percent tunnel length in all the seasons as compared to the non-Bt hybrids and commercial checks. In \{BGH\} trials, Bt-hybrids consistently suffered less leaf damage than their non-Bt near isolines. The study demonstrated that \{MON810\} was effective in controlling B. fusca and C. partellus. Bt-maize, therefore, has great potential to reduce the risk of maize grain losses in Africa due to stem borers, and will enable the smallholder farmers to produce high-quality grain with increased yield, reduced insecticide inputs, and improved food security.

Unprecedented pressures on soil from degradation and urbanization are threatening agro-ecological balances and food security. It is important that we learn more about soil to sustainably manage and preserve it for future generations. To this end, we developed and analyzed a global soil visible–near infrared (vis–NIR) spectral library. It is currently the largest and most diverse database of its kind. We show that the information encoded in the spectra can describe soil composition and be associated to land cover and its global geographic distribution, which acts as a surrogate for global climate variability. We also show the usefulness of the global spectra for predicting soil attributes such as soil organic and inorganic carbon, clay, silt, sand and iron contents, cation exchange capacity, and pH. Using wavelets to treat the spectra, which were recorded in different laboratories using different spectrometers and methods, helped to improve the spectroscopic modelling. We found that modelling a diverse set of spectra with a machine learning algorithm can find the local relationships in the data to produce accurate predictions of soil properties. The spectroscopic models that we derived are parsimonious and robust, and using them we derived a harmonized global soil attribute dataset, which might serve to facilitate research on soil at the global scale. This spectroscopic approach should help to deal with the shortage of data on soil to better understand it and to meet the growing demand for information to assess and monitor soil at scales ranging from regional to global. New contributions to the library are encouraged so that this work and our collaboration might progress to develop a dynamic and easily updatable database with better global coverage. We hope that this work will reinvigorate our community's discussion towards larger, more coordinated collaborations. We also hope that use of the database will deepen our understanding of soil so that we might sustainably manage it and extend the research outcomes of the soil, earth and environmental sciences towards applications that we have not yet dreamed of.

A remote sensing-amenable hierarchical classification scheme that accommodates natural and semi-natural systems was conceptualized, and the natural vegetation was classified into forests, scrub/shrub lands and grasslands on the basis of extent of vegetation cover. We discuss the distribution and potential utility of the vegetation type map in a broad range of ecological, climatic and conservation applications from global, national and local perspectives. We used 15,565 ground control points to assess the accuracy of products available globally (i.e., GlobCover, Holdridge’s life zone map and potential natural vegetation (PNV) maps). Hence we recommend that the map prepared herein be used widely. This vegetation type map is the most comprehensive one developed for India so far.

Six conifer symbionts are described as new to science: Lactarius atrii, L. aurantionitidus, L. dombangensis, L. flavigalactus, L. lachungensis, and L. sikkimensis. Species delimitation is assessed based on the concordance between morphological characteristics and an \{ITS\} phylogeny. Infrageneric relationships were studied using a phylogeny constructed from concatenated ITS-rpb2 data using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference. Results show that species in this subgenus do not cluster together according to their geographic origin. Intercontinental sister relationships between Europe/Asia/North America are common but actual conspecificity is rare. This result suggests that allopatric speciation has played an important role within this subgenus. Only few morphological characteristics tend to be phylogenetically informative, with the most important being presence or absence of true cystidia and the pileipellis structure. Two datasets were generated in order to estimate the age of L. subg. Russularia. The results suggest the origin of L. subg. Russularia to be in the Mid Miocene period. "

The lake has a number of peculiar features: it has a near constant water level, no permanent surface inlets and outlets, it is vertically well-mixed, with homogeneous distribution of temperature and chemical composition, and it is characterised by near neutral to slightly acid Na–Cl waters of comparatively high salinity and high P–CO2. Based on the different chemical signature of surface and ground waters (low-Cl type) from lake waters, mass balance methods have been applied to investigate lake dynamics. Water enters the lake mainly by precipitation and groundwater inflow, and leaves by groundwater outflow and evaporation. A large groundwater outflow of 2.4 m yr−1 has been estimated. The high salinity, Na–Cl signature of Lake Ngozi waters, together with 3He/4He ratios measured on dissolved gases (between 7 and 8.3 Ra) and high-PCO2 values estimated all along the water vertical column indicate the inflow of deep-seated fluids, likely magmatic in origin, into the lake. The existence of a hydrothermal system possibly at 250 °C in the root of the volcanic edifice is also hypothesised on the basis of solute geothermometry. Despite the current lack of vertical stratification, the lake is suspected to act as condenser for \{CO2\} and other gases of deep magmatic origin, and should be then further monitored for the risk of limnic eruptions as well as for environmental and climatic concerns.

abstract = "Abstract In agroforestry systems (AFS), quantifying the competition for light is a prerequisite toward understanding the impact of shade trees on the productivity of the under-crop. Models for homogeneous canopies and shade/full-sun approaches do not address the intra-plot heterogeneity, typical of AFS. For the first time, MAESTRA, a 3D light absorption model, was fully parameterized in a heterogeneous 2-canopy layers AFS. We quantified competition for photosynthetic photon flux density (Q) between shade trees (Erythrina poepiggiana) and coffee (Coffea arabica), with a spatial resolution from the plant to the plot (2.7 ha) and a temporal resolution from half-hour to one full year. The predicted transmittance through the 2-canopy layers was verified against field measurements. The goodness of fit (R2 &gt; 0.75, \{RRMSE\} &lt; 26%) was comparable to the predictions from 10 other studies using 3D light models and mostly verified in one-layered systems (mean \{R2\} = 0.89 and mean \{RRMSE\} = 17%). Maps of absorbed Q showed that despite their low density in the plot (5.2 trees ha−1), the tall Erythrina trees reduced Q available for the coffee layer by 14% annually. Annual pruning of the oldest unproductive coffee resprouts maintained a large horizontal heterogeneity in coffee LAI, with direct impact on the Q absorption map. This management practice had a strong impact on seasonal variations of absorbed Q by the coffee canopy. We proposed also a simple approach to estimate Q absorbed yearly by the coffee plants in \{AFS\} of variable tree density, requiring only few measurements in the field. An extrapolation indicated that the amount of Q absorbed by the coffee canopy would display a negative exponential relationship (k = −0.34) when increasing shade tree density (from nil to 29 trees ha−1). The estimated k was similar to the shade tree extinction coefficient of diffuse radiation measured with a plant canopy analyzer. We showed that the presence of shade trees tends to reverse the diurnal time course of the fraction of Qa when compared to a plantation in the open. Overall, \{MAESTRA\} proved to successfully unlock the question of intra-plot heterogeneity for light absorption and to provide defensible light budgets as a continuous and mapped covariable, a crucial step for many field experimentations.

A broader survey of 130 households was used to gather information about cropping patterns, and access to off-farm employment and educational opportunities. The aim was to provide a description of the livestock production system in the Northern Areas and investigate the effect of agro-ecological zone and proximity to transport infrastructure on small-holder practices, especially those relating to livestock management. Two transects were selected for study differing in the quality of their transport infrastructure; the Karakoram Highway transect was defined by the Karakoram Highway, a major transport link through the study region, while the Gilgit–Ghizer Region transect lay along a side valley with a more limited transport infrastructure. One village from each of the three main agro-ecological zones within the region was selected in each transport infrastructure transect. Results showed that average landholding size was 1.6 ha of which around 60% was cultivated. Overall herd size did not differ significantly by zone or transect but there were more animals derived from cross-breeding with exotic breeds in the Karakoram Highway transect. The amount of fodder stored for livestock was higher in the Karakoram Highway transect than in the Gilgit–Ghizer Region transect. There was more selling of livestock in the Gilgit–Ghizer Region transect and the use of draught animals was also more prevalent in the Gilgit–Ghizer Region. The household questionnaire indicated that cash cropping, off-farm employment and degree of formal education were all higher in the Karakoram Highway transect, providing indirect evidence for a household economy less reliant on traditional livestock keeping for income. In conclusion, the survey results reveal a traditional small-holder system with heavy reliance on livestock. Householders in the lower altitude zones and those close to transport infrastructure appear to rely less heavily on livestock for income but have fodder resources which are more appropriate for their complement of livestock.

We establish a set of economic and institutional preconditions for \{PES\} to become a feasible and cost-effective conservation mechanism. We proceed with a macro-scale spatial analysis and overlay of opportunity costs, deforestation patterns, carbon services, and land tenure, in order to assess where these conditions hold. We then screen how the benefits of potential \{PES\} schemes might be distributed across different socioeconomic groups of service providers in different land tenure categories. Our economic–quantitative analysis, though sensitive to documented assumptions, suggests that under current carbon prices the economic preconditions are in place to pay for avoided deforestation in over half of threatened forests over the next decade. Unfortunately, the same optimism does not apply to institutional preconditions. Land grabbing, insecure tenure, overlapping claims, and lacking information on private tenure constitute real medium-term impediments to PES. If payments were to accrue to current landholders regardless of current tenure insecurities, large landowners who account for about 80% of all deforestation would reap the highest benefits, though per-capita benefits other tenure categories are also high. Schemes that closely align payments with opportunity costs are preferable for cost-effectiveness, and not necessarily more inequitable in outcomes. Essentially, \{PES\} systems cannot substitute command-and-control measures: the former depend on the latter for basic governance systems to secure effective rights of exclusion, which land stewards essentially need in order to become reliable service providers.

However, little is known about its effects on aggregation, an important indicator of soil quality and functioning. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of Eucalyptus wood biochar (B, pyrolyzed at 550 °C, at 0 or 2.5 t ha−1), green manure (T, from Tithonia diversifolia at 0, 2.5 or 5.0 t ha−1) and mineral nitrogen (U, urea, at 0, or 120 kg N ha−1) on soil respiration, aggregate size distribution and \{SOC\} in these aggregate size fractions in a 2-year field experiment on a low-fertility Ultisol in western Kenya under conventional hand-hoe tillage. Air-dry 2-mm sieved soils were divided into four fractions by wet sieving: Large Macro-aggregates (LM; &gt;1000 μm); Small Macro-aggregates (SM, 250–1000 μm); Micro-aggregates (M, 250–53 μm) and Silt + Clay (S + C, &lt; 53 μm). We found that biochar alone did not affect a mean weight diameter (MWD) but combined application with either T. diversifolia (BT) or urea (BU) increased \{MWD\} by 34 ± 5.2 μm (8%) and 55 ± 5.4 μm (13%), respectively, compared to the control (P = 0.023; n = 36). The B + T + U combination increased the proportion of the \{LM\} and \{SM\} by 7.0 ± 0.8%, but reduced the S + C fraction by 5.2 ± 0.23%. \{SOC\} was 30%, 25% and 23% in S + C, M and LM/SM fractions, and increased by 9.6 ± 1.0, 5.7 ± 0.8, 6.3 ± 1.1 and 4.2 ± 0.9 g kg−1 for LM, SM, M and S + C, respectively. \{MWD\} was not related to either soil respiration or soil moisture but decreased with higher \{SOC\} (R2 = 0.37, P = 0.014, n = 26) and increased with greater biomass production (R2 = 0.11, P = 0.045, n = 33). Our data suggest that within the timeframe of the study, biochar is stored predominantly as free particulate \{OC\} in the silt and clay fraction and promoted a movement of native \{SOC\} from larger-size aggregates to the smaller-sized fraction in the short-term (2 years).

In a large (660 ha) coffee agroforestry farm, we calibrated the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), calculated on a High Resolution (HR) satellite image and ground-truth LAI, providing a 2-layer (shade trees and coffee) \{LAI\} calibration with \{LAI\} 2000 and a new technique based on the cumulative distribution of \{LAI\} along transects. The effective and apparent clumping of coffee leaves were computed (0.76 and 0.89, respectively). We also calibrated the relationship between the derived HR-LAI farm map and \{NDVI\} from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in order to re-construct \{LAI\} time-series (2001–2011). Coffee LAI, as derived from \{MODIS\} after substracting the contribution of shade tree \{LAI\} varied seasonally between 2.4 and 4.4 m2 m−2, with a maximum by the end of wet season (peak of harvest), steep decline during the drier-cooler season, minimum after annual coffee pruning, recovery during the next rainy season and pause during the grain filling period. \{MODIS\} also detected significant inter-annual variations in \{LAI\} originating from annual pruning, or plot renovation followed by a progressive \{LAI\} recovery during up to 4 years. We related the coffee-LAI time-series with farm registries to examine the impacts of management on \{LAI\} and on selected ecosystem services, namely yield and hydrological services. Nitrogen fertilization was adjusted annually by the farmer and appeared as the best yield predictor (R2 = 0.53). Combining N-fertilization with \{LAI\} from 6 significant months of the year, the prediction was improved (R2 = 0.74), confirming \{LAI\} as an important co-predictor of yield. We ended up with a yield prediction model including also the percentage of pruned resprouts (R2 = 0.79), with potential uses for regional yield mapping or reconstruction of historical yield time-series. The impacts of varying \{LAI\} (from nil to double actual values) on hydrological services were simulated. \{LAI\} affected the partitioning between green water (evapotranspiration) and blue water (infiltration, aquifer recharge, streamflow), thus the water provisioning. We discussed how \{LAI\} was influenced by natural factors (phenology, interaction between vegetative and reproductive components, climate) and by management (pruning, renovation).We confirmed \{LAI\} as a powerful scalable indicator for several key ecosystem services.
