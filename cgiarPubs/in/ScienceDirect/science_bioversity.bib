Recent research has provided data to confirm the micronutrient superiority of some lesser-known cultivars and wild varieties over other, more extensively utilized cultivars. Sweet potato cultivars have been shown to differ in their carotenoid content by two orders of magnitude or more; protein content of rice varieties can range from 5 to 13%; provitamin-A carotenoid content of bananas can be less than 1 mcg/100 g for some cultivars to as high as 8500 mcg/100 g for other cultivars. Intake of one variety rather than another can be the difference between micronutrient deficiency and micronutrient adequacy. These data are important for the sectors of health, agriculture, trade and the environment. The importance of nutrition is now recognized by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. At the request of the CBD, \{FAO\} is leading the “Cross-cutting initiative on biodiversity for food and nutrition,” in collaboration with Bioversity International, and developing or improving compositional databases will form a significant part of the initiative. Once the data are prepared and compiled, they can be used in practically every domain of nutrition: nutrition education, community nutrition, nutrition interventions, food emergencies, nutritional labelling, food consumption surveys, to name but a few. These data should be “mainstreamed” into national and regional food composition databases giving recognition and importance to cultivars, varieties and breeds as foods in their own right. "

All cultivars showed significantly higher provitamin A carotenoid levels than popular local cultivars of the same genomic group and type. Cultivars’ retinol activity equivalent (RAE) values when ripe ranged from 106 to 713 μg/100 g fw, indicating that 100 g of ripe ‘Lahi’, ‘Apantu’, ‘Bira’, ‘To’o’, ‘Sepi’ and ‘HungTu’ fruit contain enough provitamin A carotenoids to meet &gt;100% of the dietary reference intakes (DRIs) of a child under 5 years of age, and between 15% and 102% for a woman of reproductive age.

This paper explores how the theory of collective action can provide a more synthetic understanding of how market chains operate, and the changes that could permit a more equitable distribution of benefits. The case studies illustrate the need for improved trust, mutual understanding of each actor’s involvement, and an agreed process of collective action with a high level of community participation. The cases differ in their degree of collective action, the level of market organization and the ways in which handling, processing, and innovative marketing add value to the agrobiodiversity products.

Crops need to adapt to higher temperatures, water stress and pest incidence. Genetic improvement and the evaluation of cultivars in field conditions allow for the development of more tolerant varieties with traits that are better suited to adapt to climate change. In tropical regions there is a higher diversity of climate patterns and management practices which affects the evaluation of varieties [3] in field testing. The interaction of genotype by environment is the biggest challenge that plant breeders face [3] and with high costs associated with releasing a new cultivar only a limited number are released. To identify climate smart varieties materials need to be tested in the conditions in which the crops will be grown. A broad genetic base is needed to select strong varieties which are able to adapt to drought, biotic stress and salinity. It is only possible to evaluate varieties in a large number of possible environments. Using a crowdsourcing approach to crop improvement we are identifying climate smart varieties while at the same time speeding up the processes of variety development [4]. We asked a large group of farmers to test and evaluate different varieties. We combined farmers’ and morphological evaluation data of a set of 20 varieties of cowpea and sorghum to research the performance of varieties in dissimilar climatic conditions. Data on current crop diversity allows us to compare local varieties with landraces from other areas. Results specify the variation between trials in different sites in terms of performance and environmental adaption potential. We are able to identify varieties that display a diversity of traits that enhance resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses and considering farmer-preferred/market traits. "

Plantains have juvenile, mid-vegetative and floral phases leading up to flowering (bunch emergence). We examined whether the juvenile phase showed a cool temperature response, whether the mid-vegetative phase was sensitive to photoperiod and how these phases were related to growth of lateral shoots (suckers) up to flowering. We examined published data of an experiment of five plantain cultivars grown at four altitudes, and therefore temperatures (1000 m, 24 °C to 2200 m, 16 °C) within 1° latitude of the equator in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Four of the five cultivars showed a cool temperature response in the juvenile phase. Plants grown in cool temperatures (16 °C) ended the juvenile phase after producing 7 leaves. In warmer climates (24 °C) 15 leaves were produced before the juvenile phase ended. All five cultivars demonstrated a high capacity to respond to photoperiod in the mid-vegetative phase. There were detectable differences in capacity of the cultivars to respond to photoperiod, Ps. ‘Vuhindi’ had the least capacity (Ps = 90) and ‘Musilongo’ and ‘Vuhembe’ the greatest (Ps = 145). Across altitudes, suckers began to appear above ground at just after the end of the juvenile phase and there was a strong positive linear correlation (r2 = 0.97) between the calculated phyllochron (10–27 days) and the proportion of lateral buds that grew into suckers. With a phyllochron of 10 days about 10% of the lateral buds present on the plant produced lateral shoots up to flowering. At 27 days, from 40% to 80% of the lateral buds produced suckers depending on the cultivar. The responses of the juvenile phase to low temperature and the mid-vegetative phase to photoperiod in Musa spp. opens the opportunity to alter plant development and produce cultivars better suited to the climates where they are currently grown and to extend this range.

To contribute towards filling this gap, this study focuses on gender dynamics in Burkina Faso's centre-west region to examine how gendered knowledge and preferences affect the management and conservation of shea parklands. In-depth interviews and free-listing exercises with Gurunsi and Moose women and men from Léo, Lan and Prata reveal that despite a strongly gendered division of labour, women and men hold overlapping areas of knowledge about shea uses, yields and shea nut characteristics. Further, men and women farmers detailed the same management practices and factors guiding the selection and conservation of shea trees in cultivated fields. Similar fidelity levels (FLs) calculated from women's and men's responses show that top-cited uses, preferences and practices correspond across gender groups. This congruence is partly due to participants' personal experiences with the species, but also to knowledge sharing between the spouses that guides decision-making. Findings illustrate that the widely held assumption that men decide in matters of tree management overlooks the important contributions women may make to the process. The shea case suggests that intra-household knowledge sharing and collaboration may hold greater significance for achieving resilient resource management strategies than has been described in previous works on African agroforestry.

Conservation of the genetic diversity of timber species also enhances the conservation value of production forests and contributes to landscape connectivity. Tropical forests are commonly managed under selection logging regimes with minimum diameter cutting limits. These typically result in systematic removal of the largest and often the most fecund trees. Very little guidance is available to forest managers on the measures needed to maintain viable populations of timber species in production forests. We reviewed current knowledge regarding the impacts of logging on genetic processes in tropical Asian tree species to find foundations for developing practical guidelines for managing these impacts and to identify research needs. The review focuses on mixed dipterocarp forests, where the canopy layer is dominated by trees of the Dipterocarpaceae family, one of the most globally important timber families. We examined the impacts of practices including logging intensity, minimum diameter cutting limits and spatial patterns of tree removal with regards to biological parameters such as effective breeding units, size at reproductive maturity, fine-scale spatial genetic structure and the importance of general flowering in producing diverse seed. Research conducted to date shows that because of characteristics such as naturally low population densities, limited pollen dispersal and fine-scale spatial genetic structure, many tree species in mixed dipterocarp forests are sensitive to reductions in the density of reproductive conspecifics; in most cases tree extraction resulted in increased inbreeding. Although genetic research in these forests is still limited, enough knowledge exists to initiate the development of practical management guidelines e.g. on minimum population densities as a precondition for logging or documentation of sources of propagation material used in enrichment planting. Future research should focus on studying species characteristics which can indicate vulnerability to genetic erosion and the prevalence of these characteristics among species in mixed dipterocarp forests, to identify species or species groups which may require specific measures to maintain genetically viable populations in logged forests and in the larger landscape. Such characteristics may include large size at reproductive maturity or slow increase in fecundity with size, fine-scale spatial genetic structure, low population densities, limited pollen dispersal, or high juvenile mortality.

This uniform resistance is met by the continuing evolution of new races of pests and pathogens that are able to overcome resistance genes introduced by modern breeding, creating the phenomenon of boom and bust cycles. One of the few assets available to small-scale farmers in developing countries to reduce pests and diseases damage is their local crop varietal diversity, together with the knowledge to manage and deploy this diversity appropriately. Local crop varietal diversity of banana and plantain (Musa spp.) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) was measured at the community and household levels within farmers’ fields in four agro-ecological areas of Uganda. Resistance of traditional and modern varieties of P. vulgaris to anthracnose, angular leaf spot, and bean fly and of traditional and modern varieties of Musa spp. to black sigatoka, banana weevils and nematodes was assessed from participatory diagnostics of farmer knowledge and cross-site on-farm and on-station trials. By performing cross-site on-farm experiments, it was possible to identify traditional varieties with higher resistance to pest and diseases when grown outside their home sites. Increased diversity of crop varieties, measured by number of varieties (richness) and their evenness of distribution, corresponded to a decrease in the average damage levels across sites and to a reduction of variance of disease damage. In sites with higher disease incidence, households with higher levels of diversity in their production systems had less damage to their standing crop in the field compared to sites with lower disease incidence. The results support what might be expected of a risk-minimizing strategy for use of diversity to reduce pest and disease damage. "

Under this highly dynamic context, sound conservation planning is needed and one component of effectively prioritising conservation interventions is through the assessment of threats to natural ecosystems. Here we present a continent-wide and spatially explicit threats assessment to natural ecosystems. A conceptual framework is presented which quantifies threat as a function of both the magnitude of the impacts of specific damaging human activities, and the variable response of different ecosystems to those impacts. The framework is then applied on seven different threat layers (accessibility, conversion to agriculture, fires, grazing pressure, infrastructure, oil and gas, recent conversion) to map out and spatially quantify the level of threat expected over the coming 2–5 year period. An aggregate threat layer is calculated, and the threats to major habitat types are evaluated. Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas and Shrublands and Flooded Grasslands and Savannas are found to be under the greatest threat (0.36 and 0.35 aggregate threat respectively), both threatened most by fires (0.96), the former by accessibility (0.72) and the latter by grazing pressure (0.62). Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests are the least threatened of all ecosystems (0.13), closely followed by Montane Grasslands and Shrublands (0.14). Overall, accessibility is shown to be a major issue across much of the continent, and fires are a significant threat in some identified regions. The results are being used by The Nature Conservancy to target conservation efforts in the region, and also to drive policies for threat abatement. Furthermore, the conceptual framework and methodology is applicable to any region and presents a useful means of prioritising conservation interventions across broad geographic regions. "

This has important implications for germplasm transfer within and between areas, for example in reforestation or restoration activities. Genetic zones are defined as genetically more or less homogeneous regions within which propagation material can be transferred with relative certainty not to cause changes at the genetic structure level. The main goal of this study was to define genetic zones for Nothofagus nervosa and Nothofagus obliqua within their Argentinean natural distribution range. A total of 823 individuals belonging to 24 populations (14 of N. nervosa and 10 of N. obliqua, μ = 34 ± 5) were genotyped by means of seven nuclear microsatellite markers. The geographic clustering encountered through the application of a Bayesian approach was analyzed in combination with additional information on diversity parameters, chloroplast \{DNA\} and isozymes. For assembling the maps showing the distribution of clusters, we averaged cluster membership values of trees in each grid cell. To visualize geographical patterns in nSRR richness and the distribution of different clusters of both species, we carried out grid-based spatial analyses using 30 s grid cells (∼1 km at the equator) as the unit of analyses. We distinguished five genetic zones for N. nervosa and three for N. obliqua, consistent with the management history of the species, and displaying a certain level of geographic congruence. Higher allelic richness values were found in the surroundings of areas identified as potential glacial refugia, which suggest that the distribution pattern of allelic richness is closely associated with the glacial history of the species within the region. We expect this information to constitute a valuable tool for the identification of seed transfer zones, and to guide recruitment and plantation activities in the context of domestication programs of both species in Argentina. For assisted migration programs under progressive climate change the identification of these zones together with knowledge concerning hotspots at genetic diversity level should constitute an input for planning the activities.

abstract = "Daphnia magna is an important model organism for ecology, evolutionary biology and ecotoxicology. One of the main advantages of using Daphnia in research lies in its mode of reproduction. The life cycle of Daphnia is characterized by an alternation of sexual and asexual reproduction, called cyclic parthenogenesis, which enables researchers to work with clonal lines and provides an unlimited amount of genetically identical individuals for experimentation. This way of reproduction is used in case of a fast population increase during the favorable conditions of spring and summer. When females sense stimuli of detrimental conditions they start to produce males and switch to sexual reproduction. Fertilized eggs are deposited in an ephippium and which in turn is deposited in the water to form an egg bank, where they stay viable for a long period of time. The dormant eggs are able to cope with severe freezing temperatures and drought. It is even possible to freeze them in liquid nitrogen without the use of cryoprotectants and revive them without significant loss of viability; however this is not possible for the asexual eggs. To date, maintenance of those clonal lines can only be achieved through continuous culturing. This is a labor intensive process and it is not without risk of losing important lines because of contamination or disease. Cryopreservation could provide us with a welcome alternative to safely store genetically well characterized lines. In this study, we tested important steps towards developing a cryopreservation protocol for the asexual eggs of D. magna. Based on similar work with the tropical nematode Radophilis similis and related literature, a set up was designed to establish a vitrification protocol comprising four steps. Before the actual freezing, eggs must be prepared to resist the freezing procedure by reducing their water content as much as possible and for these steps we evaluated mortality and other parameters associated with survival. In the first experiment the eggs were loaded with the penetrating cryoprotectant glycerol. We used glycerol because previous studies have shown that the amount of glycerol significantly differs between sexual and asexual eggs of D. magna. After exposure to 10% glycerol for 30 min 54% of the eggs survived and besides this resulted in a 20% volume reduction and a glycerol uptake of 4.30 μg/ml. Next, a vitrification solution was developed consisting of a mixture of the cryoprotectants glycerol, ethylene glycol and trehalose. Trehalose was selected since we found that sexual eggs, which are highly resistant to various stressors, contain significantly higher levels of this compound and secondly it is known that sugars can have beneficial effects on the properties of EG-based solutions. The vitrification capacities of the solutions were tested by screening presence/absence of ice crystal during rapid freezing and thawing. Subsequently, the toxicity of the vitrifying solutions at 0 °C towards asexual eggs of the water flea was tested. The vitrifying mixture with the lowest possible solute concentration and the lowest toxicity consists of 20% glycerol, 25% ethylene glycol and 0.5M trehalose. Cryoprotection is followed by ultra-rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing. For this the method of droplet vitrification is applied. Source of funding: \{IWT\} Vlaanderen.

This study evaluated the firewood yield and the profitability of a traditional Daniellia oliveri short-rotation coppice on fallow lands in central Benin. Two weed management options were considered: (1) the weedy option, usually practiced by locals, which experienced grass competition and bushfires, and (2) the weed-free option, which consisted in periodic removal of grasses and other species. Destructive measurements and allometric equations were used to estimate biomass yield in 12 plots over 42 months. A cost-benefit analysis model based on the net present value and the benefit-cost ratio was used to compare the profitability of the two management options. Biomass accumulation rate averaged 1.08 ± 0.20 tonnes of dry matter ha−1 year−1 (t DM ha−1 year−1) in weedy conditions. Weed removal improved 3.5 times this rate in weed-free plots (3.83 ± 0.47 t DM ha−1 year−1). After 42 months, total biomass reached 3.67 ± 0.65 t DM ha−1 in weedy plots and 11.63 ± 0.76 t DM ha−1 in weed-free plots. Most of the biomass (≥88%) was marketable in local markets. Coppice exploitation was profitable after 24 months for both management options. Weed removal improved the profits three times. A sensitivity analysis showed that both options were still profitable with up to 25% increase of labour and transport costs, 25% decrease of biomass price and 12% increase of the discount rate. "

Relative to other taxa studied, only 5% of the articles published on coffee and biodiversity pertain to mammals. We surveyed non-volant mammals, with an emphasis on small mammals, in 3 coffee-forest landscapes in Costa Rica with a particular focus on forest, shade coffee, and sun coffee habitats. Each of the 3 sites contained a 500- × 500-m trap grid that was sampled in 4 sessions, totaling 46 sampling nights per site. This novel approach allowed us to compare mammal abundance and richness on both a plot level and meso-landscape scale (radius 25, 50, 100, 150, 200 m). We made 976 captures (501 individuals) and detected 17 small and medium mammal species during the seven-month study period. The abundance and richness of small non-volant mammals found in the shade coffee was not significantly different that of forest habitats embedded and adjacent to coffee. Both forest and shade coffee had significantly more species and higher abundances than sun coffee habitats. Within habitats, at the plot level, higher amounts of canopy cover and lower strata vegetation (i.e., weeds, grasses, plants, and understory shrubs from 5 cm–1 m tall) significantly increased small mammal abundance and richness. Within coffee habitats (sun and shade), greater amounts of canopy cover were significantly associated with higher small mammal abundance and richness. At the meso-landscape scale, small mammal density and richness significantly decreased with increasing proportion of sun coffee within the landscape and increased as the amount of shade coffee increased. Furthermore, small mammals thrived in areas adjacent to forest patches and as the proportion of forested areas within the landscape increased. Our study indicates that while there is no substitute for native forest, shade coffee provides habitat for small non-volant mammals, particularly in comparison to sun coffee. Based on our findings, we recommend including shade trees, maintaining high amounts of canopy cover, and retaining lower strata vegetation (5 cm–1 m) within coffee farms. We also recommend preserving or reestablishing forested areas embedded within the coffee landscape to enhance small mammal diversity. Shade coffee shows promise as a conservation strategy to promote wildlife conservation and protect mammalian biodiversity. "

However, the survival of some of these wild plant species could be threatened because of climate change. We used current and projected future climate data for ∼2055, and a climate envelope species distribution model to predict the impact of climate change on the wild relatives of peanut (Arachis), potato (Solanum) and cowpea (Vigna). We considered three migrational scenarios for modeling the range shifts (unlimited, limited, and no migration). Climate change strongly affected all taxa, with an estimated 16–22% (depending on migration scenario) of these species predicted to go extinct and most species losing over 50% of their range size. Moreover, for many species, the suitable areas become highly fragmented. Arachis were the most affected group, with 24–31 (depending on the migration scenario) of 51 species projected to go extinct and their distribution area on average reduced by 85–94%, depending on the migration scenario, over the next 50 years. The number of patches was predicted to decrease by 19% under the no migration scenario or increase by 4% assuming unlimited migration. Patch size decreased by 55–60%. For Solanum, 7 (no migration) to 13 (unlimited migration) of 108 species were predicted to go extinct, and their range sizes were reduced by approximately 38–69%. The number of patches was predicted to decrease by 34% (no migration) or increase 7% (unlimited migration) and patch size decreased by 20 (unlimited migration) to 37% (no migration). In terms of species extinction, Vigna was the least affected of the three groups, losing no species (unlimited migration) to 2 species (no migration) of the 48 species in the genus. The mean range size was predicted to decrease by 65% (no migration) or increase 8% (unlimited migration), with 8–41 of the 48 species losing more than 50% of their current geographic range. The number of Vigna patches increased by 12–115%, but the size of those patches shrunk by 51–59%. Our results suggest that there is an urgent need to identify and effectively conserve crop wild relatives that are at risk from climate change. While increased habitat conservation will be important to conserve most species, those that are predicted to undergo strong range size reductions should be a priority for collection and inclusion in genebanks.

Using a case study approach and assuming limited conservation resources, this approach is applied to calculate the maximum diversity which can be conserved based on a clustering of cacao species (Theobroma cacao L.). A conservation budget allocation model applied across a set of ten clusters and nine subclusters of cacao, together with the use of alternative diversity and risk measures, allowed for an evaluation of a range of potential conservation outcomes. Alternative risk measures generally resulted in the allocation of conservation funds to the same priority clusters of cacao (Criollo and Curaray). However, the use of the number of locally common alleles as an alternative to the original Weitzman diversity measure produced a markedly different result, prioritising the Purús cluster in Western Amazonia. The Curaray cluster was highly prioritised under both diversity measures, indicating its distinctiveness relative to both the Criollo and Purús clusters. We conclude that the Weitzman approach can indeed allow diversity comparisons to be made between the outcomes of different \{PGR\} conservation strategies, although subjective decisions regarding the choice of diversity and risk measures remain.

abstract = "Abstract Many species of timber trees in Cameroon are exploited by logging companies for timber and by forest-dependent communities for non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Quantitative analyses were conducted within and near forest concessions in Cameroon to determine the density of multiple use tree species that provide both timber for industry and foods consumed by local populations (fruit and oil or edible caterpillars), and how this has been affected by logging. Individuals of the three species (Moabi, Baillonella toxisperma; Sapelli, Entandrophragma cylindricum; and Tali, Erythrophleum suaveolens), including their stumps, were identified and measured on 5 ha (100 m × 500 m) sample plots around 4 villages and in 2 concessions. Around each village 21 sample plots, stratified by distance, were laid out along three transects extending 10 km towards the concession, each oriented 45° from the other. In concessions, 20 plots were established within the 2012 cutting unit after timber harvesting, using a stratified random system. Moabi trees occurred at the lowest densities: around villages, 22.8 ± 3.3/100 ha of precommercial individuals and 5.0 ± 1.4/100 ha of individuals of harvestable size (⩾80 cm dbh); on concessions, 7.5 ± 2.4 precommercial trees/100 ha, and 0–2.0 ± 1.4/100 ha harvestable individuals. Densities of Sapelli trees were not significantly different between villages and concessions, averaging 32.6 ± 3.8/100 ha and 37.5 ± 5.5/100 ha, respectively, for precommercial sizes and 9.5 ± 2.2/100 ha and 6 ± 1.6/100 ha, respectively, for harvestable trees (⩾100 cm dbh). Pre-commercial Tali trees occurred at lower densities (3.8 ± 0.9/100 ha) around villages, as compared to 11.5 ± 3.1/100 ha on concessions. Harvestable Tali trees (⩾60 cm dbh) occurred at the same densities around villages and on concessions (56.0 ± 7.2/100 ha). Half, or more, of commercial-sized trees of caterpillar-hosting species were left standing after harvest on concessions (89–94% of Tali; 50–79% of Sapelli), reflecting constraints due to timber quality, market demand and inaccessibility. No harvestable Moabi trees were logged from the 2012 cutting areas, reflecting agreements between communities and concessionaires to leave them for fruit and oil, but densities were so low it will be important that villagers conserve those around their villages. Stumps of all three species were found around villages, revealing that mechanisms for negotiation are also needed among villagers with interests in either timber or non-timber resources obtained from the same tree species.

abstract = "Abstract The annual harvest of banana and plantain (Musa spp.) is approximately 145 million tons worldwide. About 85% of this global production comes from small plots and kitchen or backyard gardens from the developing world, and only 15% goes to the export trade. Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana are the ancestors of several hundreds of parthenocarpic Musa diploid and polyploid cultivars, which show multiple origins through inter- and intra-specific hybridizations from these two wild diploid species. Generating hybrids combining host plant resistance to pathogens and pests, short growth cycles and height, high fruit yield, parthenocarpy, and desired quality from the cultivars remains a challenge for Musa crossbreeding, which started about one century ago in Trinidad. The success of Musa crossbreeding depends on the production of true hybrid seeds in a crop known for its high levels of female sterility, particularly among polyploid cultivars. All banana export cultivars grown today are, however, selections from somatic mutants of the group Cavendish and have a very narrow genetic base, while smallholders in sub-Saharan Africa, tropical Asia and Latin America use some bred-hybrids (mostly cooking types). Musa improvement goals need to shift to address emerging threats because of the changing climate. Innovative cell and molecular biology tools have the potential to enhance the pace and efficiency of genetic improvement in Musa. Micro-propagation has been successful for high throughput of clean planting materials while in vitro seed germination assists in obtaining seedlings after inter-specific and across ploidy hybridization. Flow cytometry protocols are used for checking ploidy among genebank accessions and breeding materials. \{DNA\} markers, the genetic maps based on them, and the recent sequencing of the banana genome offer means for gaining more insights in the genetics of the crops and to identifying genes that could lead to accelerating Musa betterment. Likewise, \{DNA\} fingerprinting has been useful to characterize Musa diversity. Genetic engineering provides a complementary tool to Musa breeders who can introduce today transgenes that may confer resistance to bacteria, fungi and nematodes, or enhance pro-vitamin A fruit content. In spite of recent advances, the genetic improvement of Musa depends on a few crossbreeding programs (based in Brazil, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Guadeloupe, Honduras, India, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda) or a handful of genetic engineering endeavors (Australia, Belgium, India, Kenya, Malaysia and Uganda). Development investors (namely international aid and philanthropy) should therefore increase their funding to genetically enhance this crop that ranks among the 10-top staple foods of the developing world.

About 67% of red meat is produced in the arid and semi-arid lands under pastoral production system. With demand for meat products rapidly increasing, improved meat marketing may raise the ability of livestock keepers to meet financial obligations and generally improve livelihoods. The meat consumption behaviour by consumers will contribute to the development of livestock sector in general and small ruminant in particular. Yet the information on consumer demand for small ruminants is not well quantified. One contributing factor is lack of data and information on marketing of small ruminants and their products. This causes failure in appreciating the importance of these animals in contributing to the development of livestock sector. This article aims to contribute to filling this information gap by collecting and analysing data related to the consumption of small ruminant meat. Specifically, this article explores the factors that influence demand for small ruminant meat. A structured questionnaire was used to elicit information on consumer demand. A transect line method was used to sample 103 households. Both descriptive and econometrics analysis were used to examine factors that influence demand for small ruminant meat. The survey revealed that about 55% of the households preferred to consume small ruminants’ meat over beef. The Tobit model revealed small ruminant price, district location of household, household monthly income spent on food, purchase cost of small ruminant meat as a proportion of income and perception of small ruminant meat as quality to be factors influencing the probability of consumer demand for the meat. The article recommends dissemination of these findings as important since knowledge of existing and potential demand would assist both scientists and extension workers to educate and encourage producers to produce what is needed in the market. Thus, this would enhance producer access and bargaining power in the market, leading to increased incomes and improved livelihoods of the people. "

With the climate change scenario it has emerged as a viable crop option for fragile agro-ecosystems, where successful cultivation of major crop species is apparently not difficult. However, grass pea seeds are known to have a neurotoxin known as β-N-oxalyl-l-α, β-diaminopropionic acid (β-ODAP). Its overconsumption as a staple food in an unbalanced diet for an extended period of 3–4 months can cause spastic paraparesis of the legs in human beings. Therefore, β-ODAP needs to be reduced through genetic means to a safe level for human consumption. Unfortunately, a paucity of efforts towards development of genetic and genomic resources for this species has hampered the progress in breeding low \{ODAP\} varieties in the past. Some progress has been made in recent years for collection, conservation, characterization, evaluation and utilization of Lathyrus genetic resources at the national and international levels, resulting in large ex situ collections in various gene banks of the world. These resources need to be systematically characterized and evaluated for genetic improvement through conventional and contemporary approaches. In spite of a large number of wild relatives with useful traits, no significant efforts have been made for alien gene transfer in grass pea. This chapter reviews the present status of genetic and genomic resources of Lathyrus and their use in current breeding programmes. "

We went beyond the level of simply ‘identifying’ the proteins of interest during osmotic stress experiments in an allopolyploid crop (in casu banana) and focus on an important stress family: the cytoplasmic HSP70s. \{HSP70s\} were already identified earlier in proteomics studies as an important player during stress but an insight into the different family members and their polymorphisms was lacking. One particular spot within a whole spot trail drew our attention: its abundance was significantly higher after osmotic stress. What distinguishes this spot from its brother and sister spots? To understand what was special about that particular spot, we characterized the whole spot family in roots and meristem cultures. Using an 2D-DIGE LC–MS/MS approach we were able to measure a proteotypic peptide for each paralog. From our data it is clear that the different paralogs have evolved over time and do not necessarily behave the same when subjected to a stress treatment. The presumable paralog that particularly reacted to the osmotic stress in roots and meristems is located on chromosome 2 and the promoter region contains a unique \{ABRE\} element. Biological significance To our knowledge, this is the first time that a proteomics approach has led to the exploration of a protein family at the paralog and allelic variant level in a crop. Moreover we identified a specific osmotic responsive cytoplasmic \{HSP70\} isoform, the \{HSP70\} paralog 2, at the protein level. We have shown that the availability of genomic resources as well as the technique used for proteomics analysis are crucial in being able to go beyond the ‘usual suspects’. "

Xvm was limited to the inoculated and the immediate follower leaves and its population in a 50 mg tissue dropped from 3.06 × 107 cfu at 18 days to 0 cfu by 150 days after inoculation (DAI). In susceptible banana, it instead increased from 3.41 × 108 to 1.08 × 1011 cfu by 21 \{DAI\} culminating in plant death. Expression of MbNBS, MdNPR1 and \{PR3\} sharply declined during the first 6 h, recovering in the later stages though this did not stop later wilt symptoms developed in resistant and susceptible plants.

The paper presents results from an empirical case study carried out in the Borana lowlands of Ethiopia and Kenya. Conservation costs in the form of local livestock-keeper opportunity costs incurred from keeping the breed targeted for conservation rather than an alternative breed were measured. A contingent valuation, involving 370 households each completing an iterative bidding game, was applied. Respondents stated their willingness to accept compensation for conserving traditional Borana cattle instead of keeping other cattle breeds. The data was analysed using a Tobit model and we conclude that the costs of a community-based conservation programme split between Ethiopia and Kenya, based on a safe minimum herd size, would require €25,400 per year in terms of direct support payments and management and monitoring costs.

The predominant species of the pathogen, Phytophthora palmivora, causes pod losses of 10–15% but the more aggressive Phytophthora megakarya present in the eastern part of the country causes losses of 40–60%. The latter species is expected to continue its spread to the main cocoa belt in Côte d’Ivoire over the next decade. Since 2000, the Centre National de Recherche Agronomique has been selecting new cocoa cultivars with direct involvement of farmers. More than 250 farmers were visited and their knowledge is being used to collect accessions with high yield potential, with low pest (mirids) infestation or with low Ppr incidence. Farmers were capable of identifying mother trees with low Ppr incidence only in regions with high disease pressure (Abengourou and Aboisso). Open-pollinated seedling progenies obtained from 226 promising trees in farmers’ fields were screened for resistance to Ppr by inoculating leaf discs from nursery plants with spores of a P. palmivora isolate. Three clones (SCA6, \{PA150\} and NA79) and three recommended hybrids were used as control cultivars. The results of the leaf disc test confirmed the known variation of resistance of the control cultivars. The relative level of resistance of the farm accessions varied mainly between moderately resistant and susceptible, but several accessions could be considered as resistant, in relation to the control cultivars. The major part of the 15% most resistant farm accessions came from the Abengourou and Aboisso regions in the eastern part of the country. Progenies from mother trees that farmers had selected as showing low Ppr incidence in their fields also appeared to be more resistant in the leaf disc test. This suggests that the resistance identified to P. palmivora in the leaf disc test may be efficient in the field in areas infected with P. megakarya. It is recommended that the genetic diversity identified through participatory selection of promising mother trees in farmers’ fields be further exploited in breeding to obtain new hybrid or clonal cocoa cultivars with low incidence of Ppr, good yield and low mirid damage.

Molecular markers (SSR) were used to assay levels of genetic diversity to test if adoption of modern varieties in the place of landraces had changed genetic diversity. The modern varieties were found to contain diverse alleles with a high proportion from the local parent variety, Chhomrong Dhan. We found a high level of allelic richness in the landraces, and although seven had been dropped in favour of the modern varieties, other diverse landraces were still being cultivated by farmers in the study villages on up to 40% of the rice area. Genetic diversity may be maintained even when landraces are displaced by modern varieties.

Our analysis is based on socio-economic survey data collected from 536 households in the Zoundwéogo and Cascades provinces of Burkina Faso, as well as qualitative interview data collected from 74 shea butter producers in the province of Sissili. The factors affecting the selection of shea butter production as a livelihood activity as well as the economic success of this activity are analysed using a Heckman selection model. Moreover, we study the effect of locality of residence, defined as place of residence along the rural–urban continuum, on shea butter processing and income. We demonstrate that, among members of a shea butter producer Union, women living in urban areas produce significantly larger quantities of shea butter for sale to the Union and earn superior revenues from these sales than their rural counterparts. We relate these urban–rural discrepancies to the physical and socio-economic conditions that characterise life in different localities and propose policy recommendations based on our findings. "

In many shifting cultivation systems, farmers are taking advantage of restorative forest fallow periods to plant commercially-oriented orchards to increase output. While there is an economic benefit to this intensification pathway, we ask: what are the trade-offs in ecosystem services with planting low diversity orchards? We compare the capacity of native forest fallows vs. planted umarí orchards (Poraquieba sericea) to provide critical regulating services (soil fertility regeneration, woody biomass accumulation), provisioning services (commercial fruit production, timber, charcoal, wild fruits and handicraft materials production), and tree biodiversity in lowland forests of Peru. In addition, we estimate their potential contribution to farmer livelihoods to better understand the economic incentives behind orchard planting. Orchards were found to provide similar or higher levels of both regulating and provisioning services than forest fallows, apart from harvestable timber. Although biodiversity was lower under orchards, tree diversity and composition recovered fully in subsequent fallow rotations. Potential revenues from orchard planting were greater than from fallows, however they were small compared to median incomes suggesting that the motivation to plant orchards is income diversification. Together these results highlight that orchard fallows may be an ecologically and economically viable pathway for intensification. "

We analyze data from two pilot payment for ecosystem service (PES) schemes focused on the conservation of agricultural biodiversity in the Bolivian and Peruvian Andes. Contracts were assigned to farming groups who could choose between different types of in-kind payments with varying degrees of divisibility between group members. Our main results indicate that: (1) stronger general patterns of collective action are positively related to the level of cooperation in group-bid making; (2) where collective action is robust, collective payments seem to provide stronger conservation incentives than individual payments; (3) collective payments could mitigate some potential rent-seeking behavior; (4) selecting bid offers based on both a ‘cooperation’ criterion and conservation land area offered does not overly compromise the cost-effectiveness of PES; and (5) group-level contracts may create strong incentives for contract compliance. Hence, combining farmer group-level contracts with collective in-kind payments can enhance the cost-effectiveness of conservation tenders, while generating co-benefits in terms of increased interaction and social capital among group members.

We consider the case of finger millet, which plays an important role in the food security of Nepalese poor and marginalized farmers. Despite such importance, production and consumption are decreasing as a result of, inter alia, the expanding availability of more profitable crops, a lack of awareness regarding its nutritional qualities by urban consumers and limited R&amp;D dedicated to this crop. Nevertheless, the potential to improve the ability of farmers to capture the values related to the positive environmental and nutritional externalities associated with the production and consumption of local landraces, suggests that the conservation through use of such genetic resources can support the achievement of development goals. We analyse both the demand and supply side of a potential niche market for local finger millets. Using a choice experiment we find that urban consumers have a willingness to pay a premium price sufficient to compensate producers' conservation opportunity costs. We also identify a range of challenges for such an intervention to be considered effective from both an economic and ecological perspective. "

Palynological research into past human influences on forests is reassessed. The evidence suggests that crops were first introduced into the country at about 1000 BCE, farming communities practicing slash and burn agriculture started to significantly influence the floristic composition of forests during the 1st millennium \{BCE\} and there was a major episode of forest reduction at about 1000 CE related to socio-economic change. Bananas were probably introduced in the early centuries CE. The colonial era from 1894 saw the introduction of new concepts of land ownership and the establishment of forest reserves and agricultural stations. Forests and banana diversity are currently under threat, Uganda having a very high rate of deforestation and endemic banana varieties proving susceptible to introduced pests and diseases. It is suggested that, under these circumstances, conservationists take an opportunistic approach to field engagement, making use of favourable local conditions as they arise. Partnerships should be sought with elements of society concerned with sustainable use, provision of ecosystem services and cultural survival to widen the social base of plant conservation. International organisations involved in conservation of plant genetic resources and wild plant species should collaborate with one another to develop the conceptual basis of plant conservation, to make it more relevant to countries like Uganda.

Because of the complexity there is not one conclusive definition of drought. Therefore it is challenging to identify the right parameter and stress intensity for drought tolerance evaluation. This paper contributes to tackle this challenge by exploring the effect of water deficit on transpiration efficiency (TE). In total, six triploid banana (Musa spp.) cultivars were characterized during well-watered and two different water deficit conditions. We developed a concept to evaluate both \{TE\} and growth, since selection for high \{TE\} is often associated with slow growth. \{TE\} increased for all cultivars when stressed and a clear genotypic variation in \{TE\} during water deficit could be discerned. ‘Kayinja’ (ABB) and ‘Sukali Ndizi’ (AAB) were ranked as the most efficient cultivars and the East African highland cultivar ‘Mpologoma’ (AAA) exhibited the least transpiration efficient phenotype. Selection for high \{TE\} did not lead to selection of slow growers during well-watered and mild stress conditions. High \{TE\} varieties are thus projected to bring forth good yield under well-watered and water deficit conditions. "

Adoption is strongly linked to soil type, market access, and the education level of the head of household. \{FMNR\} raises household income and increases crop diversity, household migration rates, and the density and diversity of trees on farmland. It is estimated that \{FMNR\} raises the annual gross income of the region by between 17 and 21 million \{USD\} and has contributed an additional 900,000 to 1,000,000 trees to the local environment.

Bolivia is a centre of wild relative diversity for several crops, among them potato, which is an important staple worldwide and the principal food crop in this country. Despite their relevance for plant breeding, limited knowledge exists about their in situ conservation status. We used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and distribution modelling with the software Maxent to better understand geographic patterns of endemic wild potato diversity in Bolivia. In combination with threat layers, we assessed the conservation status of all endemic species, 21 in total. We prioritised areas for in situ conservation by using complementary reserve selection and excluded 25% of the most-threatened collection sites because costs to implement conservation measures at those locations may be too high compared to other areas. Some 70% (15 of 21 species) has a preliminary vulnerable status or worse according to \{IUCN\} red list distribution criteria. Our results show that four of these species would require special conservation attention because they were only observed in &lt;15 locations and are highly threatened by human accessibility, fires and livestock pressure. Although highest species richness occurs in south-central Bolivia, in the departments Santa Cruz and Chuquisaca, the first priority area for in situ conservation according to our reserve selection exercise is central Bolivia, Cochabamba; this area is less threatened than the potato wild relatives’ hotspot in south-central Bolivia. Only seven of the 21 species were observed in protected areas. To improve coverage of potato wild relatives’ distribution by protected areas, we recommend starting inventories in parks and reserves with high modelled diversity. Finally, to improve ex situ conservation, we targeted areas for germplasm collection of species with &lt;5 accessions conserved in genebanks. "

The bioaccessibility of all-trans β-carotene ranged from 10% to 32%, depending on the food recipes, and was modified, particularly when pVACs-rich ingredients (palm oil/amaranth) were added. Efficiency of micellarization of all-trans β-carotene was similar to that of all-trans α-carotene and depended on the cultivar (Musilongo, plantain type, 16%; Vulambya, East African cooking type, 28%), while that of the 13-cis isomer was higher (21–33.5%).

In particular, we look at the potential benefits of crop genetic diversity in enhancing agroecosystem functioning and the provision of services, both directly and indirectly. Increasing crop genetic diversity has shown to be useful in pest and disease management, and has the potential to enhance pollination services and soil processes in specific situations. By contributing to the long-term stability of agroecosystems and helping to provide continuous biomass cover, crop genetic diversity also aids the ecosystem to sequester carbon, and helps in preventing soil erosion.

Use of crop genetic diversity could be an appropriate option to improve production by using highly mycotrophic genotypes. This study assessed \{AM\} fungal root colonization of 18 banana genotypes across 6 locations in East Africa (Rwanda, Burundi, Kenya, \{DR\} Congo, Uganda and Tanzania). Soil and root sampling was carried out on each genotype. Data were collected on root colonization frequency and intensity, soil pH, cation exchange capacity and mineral nutrients.

Two, to explicitly enhance both timber and \{NTFP\} values through targeted management interventions. Three, to explicitly assess biophysical, social, regulatory and institutional aspects so that combined benefits are maximized. Interventions for enhancing the compatibility of timber and \{NTFP\} extraction must be scaled in relation to the size of the area being managed, applied timber harvesting intensities, and the dynamics of multi-actor, forest partnerships (e.g., between the private sector and local communities). In addition, training and education issues may have to be re-crafted with multiple-use management approaches inserted into tropical forestry curricula. "

We investigated the influence of planting density on nutrient mass fractions and nutrient imbalance indices in bananas under small-scale, low-input systems using the compositional nutrient diagnosis (CND) approach. Boundary line functions were developed to identify yield limiting factors and quantify their contribution to the yield gap. Soil, plant, yield and water data were collected in plant density experiments conducted in three contrasting agro-ecological sites of Rwanda (i.e. Kibungo low rainfall with medium soil fertility, Rubona high rainfall but low soil fertility and Ruhengeri high rainfall with high soil fertility). Effects of site × cultivar and site × density on bunch yield were significant (p &lt; 0.05). Annual yields (t ha−1 yr−1) ranged from 6.1 to 9.2 at Kibungo, 9.5 to 21.5 at Rubona and 7.0 to 25.0 at Ruhengeri. Similar trends were registered for the above ground dry matter yield. \{CND\} indices showed that K, Mg and P were the most deficient elements in areas with low inherent soil fertility (Kibungo and Rubona). The yield gap analysis also confirmed that K was the most limiting factor, contributing to a predicted yield gap of 55.3% at Kibungo while P and Mg collectively contributed to a 35% yield gap at Rubona. An increase in plant density resulted in an increase in average yield gap from 45.6 to 70.2% at Kibungo, whilst the average yield gap decreased significantly with increases in plant density from 47.5 to 30.2% at Rubona and 76.6 to 53.7% at Ruhengeri. The study confirmed that soil fertility is a more limiting factor than water, but both \{CND\} norms and boundary line analysis showed that predicted yield gaps seem to be higher for plant density than soil fertility. Therefore, plant density management is an entry point to optimize yield of East African highland bananas. "

Their production generally declines over time due to poor farm management and declining soil fertility. Farmers believe that among the bunch mass maintaining factors, plant density management offers some prospect. They often decrease banana mat (i.e. a single mother plant with interconnected suckers) density in an effort to increase bunch size, but the effectiveness and profitability of this practice has not been studied. In addition, not much research has been executed on the influence of climatic and edaphic factors on variations in on-farm plant density. An on-farm survey was conducted in contrasting agro-ecological sites of Rwanda (Ruhengeri, Rusizi, Karongi, Butare, Ruhango, Kibungo and Bugesera) to determine existing densities and their relationship to bunch mass. A plant density assessment method was used that measures the average distance of five mats to their respective nearest four mats to calculate average mat spacing. Plant density positively correlated with surplus/deficit water supply (i.e. difference between rainfall and water demand by bananas) (r2 = 0.62), with highest plant densities (&gt;1500 mats ha−1) found in high rainfall areas (&gt;1200 mm yr−1) with water surplus (218–508 mm yr−1) and lowest plant densities (1000–1400 mats ha−1) found in lower rainfall areas (1000–1200 mm yr−1) with water deficit (from −223 to −119 mm yr−1). Heaviest bunches (18.1–20.8 kg fresh mass plant−1) were found at lowest plant densities and medium sized bunches (14.7–15.5 kg) at highest plant densities. Lower soil and banana leaf nutrient contents (especially N, K, Ca and Mg) were observed on weathered soils (Acrisols) and were associated with smaller bunch mass in comparison to fertile soils (Andosols, Nitisols). Farmers tended to reduce mat densities (i) if they wanted to intercrop bearing in mind site characteristics, and (ii) to increase bunch mass to adapt to market preferences. The plant densities generally recommended by extension bodies (3 m × 3 m or 2 m × 3 m; i.e. 1111 and 1666 mats ha−1, respectively) are seldom practiced by farmers, nor do they seem to be very appropriate, as higher densities seem productive in areas with high rainfall and relatively good soil fertility.

The accumulation of osmo-active compounds, which can be induced by drought and cold stress, is therefore important. In the present study, three-week old shoots from in vitro plantlets of the cultivated potato Solanum tuberosum and its frost-resistant relative Solanum commersonii were submitted to osmotic stress (by using sucrose) and chilling (6 °C). After 14 days of exposure, shoot tips were sampled in order to gain an insight into changes of the proteome and soluble sugars. Also, the effect of these treatments on growth performance behaviour and on the success of cryopreservation was evaluated. Identified proteins that changed in abundance due to stress were associated with stress response. Additionally, carbohydrate analyses in both species, after exposure to chilling, also indicated species-related differences; this observation could point towards a better-adapted physiological state of the donor plants of S. commersonii prior to the cryoprocedure and therefore a better recovery of the meristems. Biological significance To our knowledge, this is the first study in which cryopreservation experiments are combined with the observation of the responses to abiotic stress exposure involving the potato species S. commersonii and S. tuberosum. These two species are known to have a different cold-acclimation behaviour, which seems to be closely related to their tolerance towards cryopreservation. Furthermore, common and differential responses to abiotic stresses were observed in the two species indicating that some pathways could be crucial not only in the plant's response to stress but also in tolerance towards cryopreservation.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the impact of climate change on the persistence of the natural populations of these species at their actual locations in order to take appropriate conservation measurements. A common approach to assess the impact of climate change on species natural distributions is climate envelope modeling (CEM). \{CEMs\} suggest significant impacts of climate change on the natural distribution of the two pine species, but their predictions contain considerable uncertainty related to the adaptive ability of tree populations to withstand future climate conditions. We assessed the adaptive ability of the two pine species based on the evaluations of provenance trials and used the results of these field trials to validate \{CEM\} impact assessment studies on provenance collection sites in the wild. The two pine species performed well in a wide range of climates, including conditions that were recorded by \{CEM\} as unsuitable for natural pine occurrence. The climate conditions where the two pine species naturally occur are predicted to become in the future more similar to the present climate of some areas where they are successfully established in field trials. These findings suggest that these pine species are in their natural habitat better adapted to climate change than \{CEM\} predicts. For the most vulnerable species, P. tecunumanii, human disturbances such as fragmentation from urbanization and conversion to agriculture that are occurring today are more urgent threats requiring action compared to the threat from climate change.

Data on the regulations governing the chain and its impacts were collected from literature, 12 small and medium enterprises trading an \{NTFP\} known as okok (Gnetum spp.) from the production forests to the port of export in Cameroon, and workshops. Laws were bureaucratically, arbitrarily and weakly implemented and enforced. Of 18,368 financial transactions recorded, 81% were bribes, comprising 34% of trader's costs. Corruption in the permit system further creates high transaction costs, negative environmental impacts due to illegal and over-exploitation, and reduces government revenues. The regulatory framework does not promote an enabling business environment. Improvements in governance are imperative if the economic impact upon the livelihoods of thousands of people in the chain is to be maintained and enhanced to ensure sustainable trade. Recommendations to improve the sector in Cameroon include revisions in the regulatory framework and its implementation to increase transparency and counter corruption. "

Three different types of sensors were used, a leaf porometer to measure leaf stomatal conductance, a thermal infrared camera to measure the canopy temperature and a meteorological sensor to measure weather variables. Stomatal conductance of water stressed pear was significantly lower than in the control group 9 days after stress began. This decrease in stomatal conductance reduced transpiration, reducing evaporative cooling that increased canopy temperature. Using thermal infrared imaging with wavelengths between 7.5 and13 μm, the first significant difference was measured 18 days after stress began. A second order derivative described the average rate of change of the difference between the stress treatment and control group. The average rate of change for stomatal conductance was 0.06 (mmol m−2 s−1) and for canopy temperature was −0.04 (°C) with respect to days. Thermal infrared remote sensing and data analysis presented in this study demonstrated that the differences in canopy temperatures between the water stress and control treatment due to stomata regulation can be validated.

Those trying to save threatened livestock breeds within a tight conservation budget face similar questions. In this paper we assess how different types of Borana cattle, a culturally significant breed in East Africa, might be prioritized for conservation. By applying a cost-effectiveness analysis on the basis of Weitzman's approach we conclude that the highest priority should be given to the Ethiopian Borana type (EB) in Ethiopia. Noah, however, would also have been concerned about the problems of inbreeding and effective population size. To overcome this problem we suggest that, rather than loading just two animals, he should have loaded on board 1000 female and 100 male animals as a safe minimum. The minimum cost of conserving 1100 animals of the \{EB\} type with the participation of Ethiopian communities is calculated to be €7700 per year, mostly in the form of compensation payments to meet the opportunity costs of livestock-keepers that arise when maintaining the EB.

Though nutrition is critical to human health, it has yet to be systematically integrated into assessments of agricultural and food systems. Using three complementary diversity metrics, we find strong associations between nutritional diversity of national food supplies and key human health outcomes, while controlling for socio-economic factors. For low-income countries the diversity of agricultural goods produced by a country is a strong predictor for food supply diversity; for middle- and high-income countries national income and trade are better predictors. Our results highlight the importance of diversity in national food systems for human health. We provide metrics for agricultural and food security policies to consider nutritional diversity. "

In the arid areas of southern Narok, farmers' main constraints were drought and disease. Farmers in Nakuru district, situated in the fertile highlands of the Rift Valley, were also affected by disease but also lacked markets and capital. Although 83% of the farmers had regular contact with extension services that provided advice on new technologies and livestock production innovations, only about half of the respondents implemented the proposed changes. Many of those who did change (38%) improved pasture/nutrition/manure management and relatively few (16%) improved their animal breeding practices. Results of a multinomial logit model revealed that, apart from the significant differences between the two districts, the nature of the advice and the expected outcomes had the strongest influence on the probability of successfully implementing changes to livestock production. The results further suggest that adoption of new technologies is limited by lack of knowledge, inadequate support and a failure to target local needs and conditions and empower livestock keepers. "

The reviews presented in this special edition of Forest Ecology and Management on forest genetic resources complement the first ever synthesis of the State of the World’s Forest Genetic Resources (SOW-FGR) that has just been published by the Food and Agriculture Organization. In this editorial, we present some of the key findings of the SOW-FGR and introduce the seven reviews presented in this special edition on: (1) tree genetic resources and livelihoods; (2) the benefits and dangers of international germplasm transfers; (3) genetic indicators for monitoring threats to populations and the effectiveness of ameliorative actions; (4) the genetic impacts of timber management practices; (5) genetic considerations in forest ecosystem restoration projects using native trees; (6) genetic-level responses to climate change; and (7) ex situ conservation approaches and their integration with in situ methods. Recommendations for action arising from the SOW-FGR, which are captured in the first Global Plan of Action for the Conservation, Sustainable Use and Development of Forest Genetic Resources, and the above articles are discussed. These include: increasing the awareness of the importance of and threats to forest genetic resources and the mainstreaming of genetic considerations into forest management and restoration; establishing common garden provenance trials to support restoration and climate change initiatives that extend to currently little-researched tree species; streamlining processes for germplasm exchange internationally for research and development; and the intelligent use of modern molecular marker methods as genetic indicators in management and for improvement purposes.

In this model, the general edit distance problem under a non-constrained weight scheme, is NP-hard. Recently, a hierarchy of arc-annotated sequence alignment problems that highlights less general, but tractable, problems was introduced. We refine this hierarchy of alignment problems and extend the class of tractable alignment problems. Up to date, the alignment problem we solve is the most general one that is known to be tractable in the considered edit distance model and under arbitrary weight schemes. This algorithm is efficient, as its asymptotic time and space complexities are the same as the complexities of the best previously published algorithm. "

Interest in restoration of ecosystems is increasingly translated into strong political commitment to large-scale tree planting projects. Along with this new impetus and the enormous scale of planned projects come both opportunities and risks: opportunities to significantly increase the use of native species, and risks of failure associated with the use of inadequate or mismatched reproductive material, which though it may provide forest cover in the short term, will not likely establish a self-sustaining ecosystem. The value of using native tree species in ecosystem restoration is receiving growing recognition both among restoration practitioners and policy makers. However, insufficient attention has been given to genetic variation within and among native tree species, their life histories and the consequences of their interactions with each other and with their environment. Also restoration practitioners have often neglected to build in safeguards against the anticipated effects of anthropogenic climate change. Measurement of restoration success has tended to be assessments of hectares covered or seedling survival in a short timeframe, neither of which is an indicator of ecosystem establishment in the long term. In this article, we review current practices in ecosystem restoration using native tree species, with a particular focus on genetic considerations. Our discussion is organised across three themes: (i) species selection and the sourcing of forest reproductive material; (ii) increasing resilience by fostering natural selection, ecological connectivity and species associations; and (iii) measuring the success of restoration activities. We present a number of practical recommendations for researchers, policymakers and restoration practitioners to increase the potential for successful interventions. We recommend the development and adoption of decision-support tools for: (i) collecting and propagating germplasm in a way that ensures a broad genetic base of restored tree populations, including planning the sourcing of propagation material of desired species well before the intended planting time; (ii) matching species and provenances to restoration sites based on current and future site conditions, predicted or known patterns of variation in adaptive traits and availability of seed sources; and (iii) landscape-level planning in restoration projects.

Before experimental disturbances, the floristic composition, dominance and diversity of the forest vegetation had been determined. In 1997, after treatments were applied, a second survey characterized early secondary vegetation at one year. A third survey was conducted in 2001. The 1996 vegetation composition revealed no significant differences among the six treatment plots. In 1997, floristic composition on the six treatment plots showed differences in dominance and diversity: the post-treatment vegetation on the slash/fell treatment was clearly distinct from that on the other two treatments. In 2001, differences among the plots had decreased considerably. Comparisons among seral stages revealed that one-year-old secondary vegetation differed from the pre-disturbance original vegetation, while five-year-old vegetation was similar to the original in its diversity, floristic composition and dominance. Felling alone favors species with a high resprouting capacity. The frequency of species with resprouting capacity was lower on slash/fell/burn treatments and lowest on machine-cleared plots. Results indicate that the effect of disturbance tends to decline over time and that complete clearing of small areas is effective as a silvicultural treatment to favor regeneration of valuable timber species and sustain diversity.

Landraces are the bedrock of maize production in Mexico. We consider how maize farmers may respond to climate change and the effects of those responses on crop diversity. In this paper, we argue that the promotion of the transgenic adaptation strategy is problematic for biological and social reasons. Smallholder livelihoods in southern Mexico could suffer a disproportionate negative impact if transgenic technology is privileged as a response to climate change. Agroecological and evolutionary approaches to addressing the effects of climate change on smallholder agriculture provides an alternative adaptive strategy. "

In two sites in the Bolivian and Peruvian Andes farming groups bid for payments for the conservation of traditional crop varieties. We assess different payment rules relating to how to allocate payments among groups subject to a fixed conservation budget. The discriminatory, uniform and conditional payment rules tested in these case studies incorporate alternative principles of fairness, while resulting in varying conservation and distributional outcomes. The latter are measured in terms of the distributional equality of payments among farmers and groups, and the distributional effects of payments on different types of groups. Findings indicate that conservation and distributional outcomes are highly sensitive to the payment rule chosen and vary across study sites. There may be contexts where cost-effectiveness does not need to be traded-off against fairness. Yet given the number of competing fairness considerations, achieving \{PES\} outcomes that are perceived as fair is very challenging. "

abstract = "Abstract Conservation agriculture (CA) changes soil properties and processes compared to conventional agriculture. These changes can, in turn, affect the delivery of ecosystem services, including climate regulation through carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions, and regulation and provision of water through soil physical, chemical and biological properties. Conservation agriculture can also affect the underlying biodiversity that supports many ecosystem services. In this overview, we summarize the current status of the science, the gaps in understanding, and highlight some research priorities for ecosystem services in conservational agriculture. The review is based on global literature but also addresses the potential and limitations of conservation agriculture for low productivity, smallholder farming systems, particularly in Sub Saharan Africa and South Asia. There is clear evidence that topsoil organic matter increases with conservation agriculture and with it other soil properties and processes that reduce erosion and runoff and increase water quality. The impacts on other ecosystem services are less clear. Only about half the 100+ studies comparing soil carbon sequestration with no-till and conventional tillage indicated increased sequestration with no till; this is despite continued claims that conservation agriculture sequesters soil carbon. The same can be said for other ecosystem services. Some studies report higher greenhouse gas emissions (nitrous oxide and methane) with conservation agriculture compared to conventional, while others find lower emissions. Soil moisture retention can be higher with conservation agriculture, resulting in higher and more stable yields during dry seasons but the amounts of residues and soil organic matter levels required to attain higher soil moisture content is not known. Biodiversity is higher in \{CA\} compared to conventional practices. In general, this higher diversity can be related to increased ecosystem services such as pest control or pollination but strong evidence of cause and effect or good estimates of magnitude of impact are few and these effects are not consistent. The delivery of ecosystem services with conservation agriculture will vary with the climate, soils and crop rotations but there is insufficient information to support a predictive understanding of where conservation agriculture results in better delivery of ecosystem services compared to conventional practices. Establishing a set of strategically located experimental sites that compare \{CA\} with conventional agriculture on a range of soil-climate types would facilitate establishing a predictive understanding of the relative controls of different factors (soil, climate, and management) on \{ES\} outcomes, and ultimately in assessing the feasibility of \{CA\} or \{CA\} practices in different sites and socioeconomic situations. The feasibility of conservation agriculture for recuperating degraded soils and increasing crop yields on low productivity, smallholder farming systems in the tropics and subtropics is discussed. It is clear that the biggest obstacle to improving soils and other \{ES\} through conservation agriculture in these situations is the lack of residues produced and the competition for alternate, higher value use of residues. This limitation, as well as others, point to a phased approach to promoting conservation agriculture in these regions and careful consideration of the feasibility of conservation agriculture based on evidence in different agroecological and socioeconomic conditions.

The He was 0.643 and 0.222 for \{SSRs\} and AFLPs, respectively.

These observations may relate to the considerable historical gene flow measured (3.71 and 4.47 for \{SSRs\} and AFLPs, respectively).

Most respondents (85%) support breed conservation, their stated willingness-to-pay easily justifying \{EU\} support. The high landscape maintenance, existence and future option values of both breeds (around 80% of their TEVs) suggest that incentives mechanisms are indeed needed in order to allow farmers to capture some of these public good values and hence motivate them to undertake conservation-related activities. The positive direct use values of both breeds (around 20% of their TEVs) imply that niche product markets aimed at enhancing the private good values associated with conservation could also form elements of a conservation and use strategy for these breeds.

This study assessed the knowledge and perceptions towards the nutritional and health promoting properties of forest foods among forest dependent communities. The relationship between knowledge, perceptions and socio-demographic attributes on consumption of forest foods was also determined. A total of 279 females in charge of decision making with respect to food preparation were randomly selected from 12 villages in southern and eastern Cameroon and interviewed using researcher administered questionnaires. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors affecting consumption of forest foods. Baillonella toxisperma (98%) and Irvingia gabonesis (81%) were the most known nutrient rich forest foods by the respondents. About 31% of the respondents were aware of the nutritional value and health benefits of forest foods. About 10%–61% of the respondents expressed positive attitudes to questions related with health benefits of specific forest foods. Consumption of forest foods was found to be higher among polygamous families and also positively related to length of stay in the forest area and age of respondent with consumption of forest foods. Education had an inverse relationship with use of forest foods. Knowledge and positive attitude towards the nutritional value of forest foods were also found to positively influence consumption of forest foods. Since knowledge was found to influence attitude and consumption, there is need to invest in awareness campaigns to strengthen the current knowledge levels among the study population. This should positively influence the attitudes and perceptions towards increased consumption of forest foods. "

The model identifies combinations of trees, which provide multiple ecosystem services from pastures, improving their productivity and contribution to farmer livelihoods. We demonstrate how the identification of portfolios of multifunctional trees can satisfy a profile of desired ecosystem services prioritized by the farmer. Diagnostics using Bayesian inference starts with an identification of farmer needs and ‘works backwards’ to identify a silvopastoral system structure.

Reliable indicators of farm performance are needed in order to model these links, and to therefore be able to design interventions which meet the differing needs of specific user groups. However, the lack of standardization of performance indicators has led to a wide array of tools and ad-hoc indicators which limit our ability to compare across studies and to draw general conclusions on relationships and trade-offs whereby performance indicators are shaped by farm management and the wider social-environmental context. \{RHoMIS\} is a household survey tool designed to rapidly characterise a series of standardised indicators across the spectrum of agricultural production and market integration, nutrition, food security, poverty and \{GHG\} emissions. The survey tool takes 40–60 min to administer per household using a digital implementation platform. This is linked to a set of automated analysis procedures that enable immediate cross-site bench-marking and intra-site characterisation. We trialled the survey in two contrasting agro-ecosystems, in Lushoto district of Tanzania (n = 150) and in the Trifinio border region of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras (n = 285). The tool rapidly characterised variability between farming systems at landscape scales in both locations identifying key differences across the population of farm households that would be critical for targeting \{CSA\} interventions. Our results suggest that at both sites the climate smartness of different farm strategies is clearly determined by an interaction between the characteristics of the farm household and the farm strategy. In general strategies that enabled production intensification contributed more towards the goals of climate smart agriculture on smaller farms, whereas increased market orientation was more successful on larger farms. On small farms off-farm income needs to be in place before interventions can be promoted successfully, whereas on the larger farms a choice is made between investing labour in off-farm incomes, or investing that labour into the farm, resulting in a negative association between off-farm labour and intensification, market orientation and crop diversity on the larger farms, which is in complete opposition to the associations found for the smaller farms. The balance of indicators selected gave an adequate snap shot picture of the two sites, and allowed us to appraise the ‘CSA-ness’ of different existing farm strategies, within the context of other major development objectives.

Such approaches have been attempted in many parts of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) but to date there has been no systematic assessment of their characteristics, outcomes, and limitations. To fill this gap, we surveyed participants and managers in integrated landscape initiatives throughout the \{LAC\} region to characterize these initiatives’ contexts, motivations and objectives, stakeholders and participants, activities and investments, outcomes, and major successes and shortcomings. Results from 104 initiatives in 21 countries indicate that integrated landscape management is being applied across the region to address a variety of challenges in diverse contexts, and that use of this approach is expanding. Initiatives reported investing across four key “domains” of landscape multi-functionality: agricultural production, ecosystem conservation, human livelihoods, and institutional planning and coordination. Initiatives reported positive outcomes across all four domains, but particularly with respect to institutional planning and coordination. Initiatives with larger numbers of objectives, investments, and participating stakeholder groups all reported significantly higher numbers of positive outcomes, suggesting significant value in the core precepts of the integrated landscape management approach. Key challenges identified by survey respondents—including the long time horizon required to achieve results at scale, unsupportive policy frameworks, and difficulty in engaging the private sector and other important stakeholders—offer insights for improving the future effectiveness of integrated landscape initiatives.

On-station field experiments were conducted in three contrasting agro-ecological sites of Rwanda (Kibungo low rainfall with medium soil fertility, Rubona high rainfall with low soil fertility and Ruhengeri high rainfall with high soil fertility) to explore germplasm × environment interactions. Five different plant densities (plants ha−1): 1428, 2500, 3333, 4444 and 5000 and two cooking (“Ingaju”, “Injagi”) and one beer (“Intuntu”) cultivars were investigated. The effect of plant density on plant performance (growth and yield) over two cropping cycles in low input systems was determined. The effects of site × cultivar and site × density interactions on yield traits were significant (p &lt; 0.05). Annual yield increased with increasing plant density but strongly depended on agro-ecological site (from 6.1 to 9.2 t ha−1 yr−1 at Kibungo, 9.5 to 21.5 t ha−1 yr−1 at Rubona and 7.0 to 25.0 t ha−1 yr−1 at Ruhengeri). Yields of beer cultivars increased with density, but those of cooking cultivars decreased. Maximum yields were attained at 4444 plants ha−1 at Kibungo and Rubona whilst yields increased linearly beyond this level at Ruhengeri. Crop cycle duration was prolonged with increasing plant density. Relationships between bunch yield, the total above ground dry matter yields and soil chemical properties suggest that nutrient deficiencies were larger at Kibungo (e.g. K) and Rubona (e.g. K, P, Ca and Mg) compared with Ruhengeri, where yield correlated significantly with leaf area index (LAI). \{LAI\} increases up to 4, where 95% of solar radiation was intercepted by the crop canopy, indicating that increasing the \{LAI\} above 4 would have little effect on production. Evaporation was much greater at lower rainfall areas (e.g. Kibungo) and accompanied by negative annual water deficit (−135 mm yr−1) than at high rainfall areas (e.g. Ruhengeri) with positive water surplus (382 mm yr−1). Growing degree days from planting to bunch harvest were higher at Kibungo (3675 °C days) but much less at the Ruhengeri cooler site (1729 °C days), implying temperature is not restrictive at Ruhengeri. This study showed that the optimal density for bananas depends on water availability, soil fertility and cultivar, which serves as an entry point to maximize yield potential for the East African smallholder farmers rather than using a uniform blanket recommended density. We suggest that agronomic optimal plant density is lower (&lt;4444 plants ha−1) in low rainfall (&lt;1000 mm yr−1) and less fertile areas but seem to be higher (&gt;5000 plants ha−1) in areas with high fertility which receive high rainfall (&gt;1300 mm yr−1).

Rice, the dominant crop in the region, is the least land efficient for providing iron and most sensitive to rainfall variability. Sorghum and maize provide high nutritional yields while small millet is most resilient to climate variability. Price incentives are strong for rice. No single crop is superior for all objectives in this region. Instead, understanding which crops, or combinations of crops, are most suitable requires identifying household-, community-, and region-specific priorities coupled with empirical analysis that considers multiple objectives.

Cropping systems which could contribute to soil fertility replenishment, pest and disease suppression and climate change mitigation might improve banana yields and contribute to uplifting the livelihoods of millions of people in the region. In this context, a survey was conducted over two seasons in banana-based subsistence farming systems in Rwanda, Burundi, north-western Tanzania (Kagera and Kigoma regions) and eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (South Kivu province), to investigate the distribution and incidence of banana Fusarium wilt as related to cropping systems, edapho-climatic and socio-economic factors. Banana Fusarium wilt incidence was found generally high in the region, 54.1% of all farms had disease incidence higher than 40%, with Tanzania having the highest number of farms with high disease incidence (63.6%). Statistical analysis (chi-squared test of association) and \{GIS\} mapping, by layering Fusarium wilt incidence over selected predictor maps, showed that disease incidence was lower in farms growing cultivar mixtures (p &lt; 0.01) and at higher altitudes (&gt;1600masl) (p &lt; 0.05), and a significant association of Fusarium wilt and farm age was observed whereby disease incidence was highest in farms aged between 10 and 30 years (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, this study reports for the first time the occurrence of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense race 2 in Rwanda and Burundi, and suggests that strategies for banana Fusarium wilt management in east and central Africa should include raising farmers’ awareness on pathogen spread mechanisms and enhancing their access to disease-free planting materials.

Bituminaria breeding programs aim to develop and conserve hybrids with desirable traits such as high forage quality, tolerance to biotic or abiotic stresses, and high contents of furanocoumarins. In this work we present a cryopreservation study of different B. bituminosa accessions: two varieties and eight intervarietal hybrids resulting from crosses between the three botanical varieties: var. bituminosa, var. crassiuscula, and var. albomarginata. No previous work on cryopreservation of Bituminaria species has been reported. We applied the ultra-fast cooling method, using droplet vitrification on aluminum foil strips. First, we investigated the \{PVS2\} toxicity and cryopreservation damage in two genotypes, comparing three \{PVS2\} treatments and two culture media. An incubation of 30 min in \{PVS2\} resulted in regeneration rates after cryopreservation higher than 80%. The \{MS\} medium was selected for optimal meristem outgrowth, in order to avoid the prominent callus formation that was observed in the presence of BAP. These conditions were subsequently used to cryopreserve eight other genotypes. The results were highly variable; 45 days after cryopreservation, survival ranged between 22% and 98% while regeneration ranged between 0% and 96%, depending on the accession. A significant and positive correlation was observed between survival and regeneration. At 90 days post culture plantlets could be recovered from cryopreserved explants of all genotypes. This study shows that the droplet vitrification method is promising for the cryopreservation of eight of the 10 genotypes assayed and the method can thus be applied to develop a cryobank of B. bituminosa.

These factors are often not characterized in tropical tree species, yet they constitute basic information that must be considered to implement sustainable management practices. In particular, as logging implies a reduction of the density of congeneric mates, the connectivity through pollination between individuals has to be well characterized (selfing versus outcrossing rates, distances between mates). We conducted a genetic-based analysis (using 10 nuclear microsatellites) to determine the mating system and gene flow characteristics of an emblematic timber tree species from lowland rain forests of the Congo Basin, Baillonella toxisperma (Sapotaceae). The species, which is frequently exploited for its wood and for a number of non-timber forest products, naturally occurs at low densities (ca. 0.01–0.1 individuals/ha). It is supposedly an entomophilous species whose seeds are probably dispersed by mammals. We have shown that the species presents a mixed-mating system (about 20–40% of selfing depending on analysis method). However, the comparison of inbreeding parameters among cohorts suggests that inbred individuals die between seedling and mature tree stages. The mean pollen dispersal distance was relatively low for such a low-density population species (estimated to be 690 or 777 m depending on analysis method) and, together with a low mean number of pollen donors (NEP = 2.76), it suggests a pattern of nearest-neighbour mating where allo-pollen could be a limiting factor. However, B. toxisperma presents a relatively weak genetic structure (Sp statistic = 0.0095) indicative of long gene dispersal distance (σg = 3–5 km according to the assumed effective population density). Overall, this would indicate that gene flow occurs mainly by extensive seed dispersal in this species. These results suggest that mammals and local populations involved in the dispersal of the species play a key role by lowering biparental inbreeding effects. Sustainable population management might require assisted regeneration using unrelated planting material. "

To monitor this trend, international policy processes have created a wealth of indicators over the last two decades. However, genetic diversity indicators are regrettably absent from comprehensive bio-monitoring schemes. Here, we provide a review and an assessment of the different attempts made to provide such indicators for tree genetic diversity from the global level down to the level of the management unit. So far, no generally accepted indicators have been provided as international standards, nor tested for their possible use in practice. We suggest that indicators for monitoring genetic diversity and dynamics should be based on ecological and demographic surrogates of adaptive diversity as well as genetic markers capable of identifying genetic erosion and gene flow. A comparison of past and present genecological distributions (patterns of genetic variation of key adaptive traits in the ecological space) of selected species is a realistic way of assessing the trend of intra-specific variation, and thus provides a state indicator of tree genetic diversity also able to reflect possible pressures threatening genetic diversity. Revealing benefits of genetic diversity related to ecosystem services is complex, but current trends in plantation performance offer the possibility of an indicator of benefit. Response indicators are generally much easier to define, because recognition and even quantification of, e.g., research, education, breeding, conservation, and regulation actions and programs are relatively straightforward. Only state indicators can reveal genetic patterns and processes, which are fundamental for maintaining genetic diversity. Indirect indicators of pressure, benefit, or response should therefore not be used independently of state indicators. A coherent set of indicators covering diversity–productivity–knowledge–management based on the genecological approach is proposed for application on appropriate groups of tree species in the wild and in cultivation worldwide. These indicators realistically reflect the state, trends and potentials of the world’s tree genetic resources to support sustainable growth. The state of the genetic diversity will be based on trends in population distributions and diversity patterns for selected species. The productivity of the genetic resource of trees in current use will reflect the possible potential of mobilizing the resource further. Trends in knowledge will underpin the potential capacity for development of the resource and current management of the genetic resource itself will reveal how well we are actually doing and where improvements are required.

Design Initially 4 and then 12 interviews were conducted with 4 different age groups. Setting Eight rural villages in Guasaganda, central Ecuador, were studied in 2011–2012. Participants A total of 75 people (22 children, 18 adolescents, 20 adults, and 15 elders). Main Outcome Measures Benefits, severity, susceptibility, barriers, cues to action, and self-efficacy of eating traditional foods. Analysis Qualitative content analysis was completed using \{NVivo\} software. Initial analysis was inductive, followed by a content analysis directed by the Health Belief Model. Coding was completed independently by 2 researchers and kappa statistics (κ ≥ 0.65) were used to evaluate agreement. Results Healthy perceptions toward traditional foods existed and differed by age. Local young people ate traditional foods for their health benefits and good taste; adults cultivated traditional foods that had an economic benefit. Traditional knowledge used for consumption and cultivation of traditional foods was present but needs to be disseminated. Conclusions and Implications Nutrition education in schools is needed that supports traditional knowledge in younger groups and prevents dietary changes toward unhealthy eating. Increased production of traditional food is needed to address current economic realities. "

The spatial scale ranged from a few metres to ∼200 km. Wild cardoon appears to be genetically fragmented, with significant genetic divergence at various scales, indicating that gene flow is insufficient to counterbalance the effects of genetic drift or founder effects. Divergence between populations was higher for chloroplast (40%) than for nuclear markers (15%), suggesting that gene flow via seed was lower than via pollen. Two main genetic groups were detected; these correlated with differences in flowering time, capitula size, glossiness, and anthocyanin pigmentation. A complex population structure of wild cardoon emerged over small spatial scales, likely resulting from the interplay between gene dispersal, colonisation history and selective forces. Indeed, Sardinia appears to be a ‘hybrid zone’ of different gene pools. The island has unique diverse germplasm that has originated from hybridisation among different gene pools. The sampling of seeds from a few plants but from many sites is suggested as the best strategy to harvest the genetic diversity of wild cardoon. "

Hence, the objective of this study was to set up and to interpret a hyperspectral time series for a mature and healthy citrus orchard in the Western Cape province of South Africa considering these effects. Based on the remotely sensed data, biophysical parameters at the canopy level were derived and related to known observed physiological and phenological changes at the leaf level and to orchard management. Fractions of mature fruit, flowers, and sunburnt leaves were considered, and indices related to canopy structure chlorophyll content and canopy water status were calculated. Results revealed small cover fractions of mature fruit, flowers and sunburnt leaves of respectively 2.1%, 3.1% and 7.0%, but the high spectral contrast between flowers and leaves allowed a successful classification of flowering intensity. Furthermore, it was shown that canopy level time series of vegetation indices were sensitive to changes in solar elevation and soil reflectance which could be reduced by applying an empirical soil line correction for the most affected indices. Most trends in vegetation indices at the canopy level could be explained by a combination of changes at the leaf level (chlorophyll, carotenoids, dry matter), changes in canopy structure (leaf area index and leaf angle distribution) and changes in cover fractions of vegetative flushes, flowers and sunburnt leaves. The transformed chlorophyll absorption ratio index over the optimised soil adjusted vegetation index (MCARI/OSAVI) was best related to leaf level trends in chlorophyll content. Seasonal changes in the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) were linked to inverse changes in the carotenoid-to-chlorophyll ratio. Canopy structure indices (the modified triangular vegetation index or \{MTVI2\} and the standardized leaf area index determining index or sLAIDI) were sensitive to changes in leaf area index, average leaf angle as well to management interactions (pruning and harvest). Canopy water status was highly impacted during the spring flush due to expanding leaves that concealed trends in the underlying mature leaves. Seasonal trends in soil and weeds reflectance were related to changes in volumetric soil water content and to the earlier and reduced growth period of non-irrigated weeds. "

Multilayer perceptrons and Self-Organizing Maps were used as computational models in the identification and visualization of the most important variables for modeling the production of Andean blackberry. Artificial neural networks were trained with information from 20 sites in Colombia where the Andean blackberry is cultivated. Multilayer perceptrons predicted with a reasonable degree of accuracy the production response of the crop. The soil depth, the average temperature, external drainage, and the accumulated precipitation of the first month before harvest were critical determinants of productivity. A proxy variable of location was used to describe overall differences in management between farmers groups. The use of this proxy indicated that, even under essentially similar environmental conditions, large differences in production could be assigned to management effects. The information obtained can be used to determine sites that are suitable for Andean blackberry production, and to transfer of management practices from sites of high productivity to sites with similar environmental conditions which currently have lower levels of productivity.

abstract = "Abstract Over the last 200 years, genetic resources of forest trees have been increasingly transferred, within and outside of species’ native distribution ranges, for forestry and for research and development (R&amp;D). Transferred germplasm has been deployed to grow trees for numerous purposes, ranging from the production of wood and non-wood products to the provision of ecosystem services such as the restoration of forests for biodiversity conservation. The oldest form of R&amp;D, provenance trials, revealed early on that seed origin has a major influence on the performance of planted trees. International provenance trials have been essential for selecting seed sources for reforestation and for improving tree germplasm through breeding. Many tree breeding programmes were initiated in the 1950s, but as one round of testing and selection typically takes decades, the most advanced of them are only in their third cycle. Recent advances in forest genomics have increased the understanding of the genetic basis of different traits, but it is unlikely that molecular marker-assisted approaches will quickly replace traditional tree breeding methods. Furthermore, provenance trials and progeny tests are still needed to complement new research approaches. Currently, seed of boreal and temperate trees for reforestation purposes are largely obtained from improved sources. The situation is similar for fast growing tropical and subtropical trees grown in plantations, but in the case of tropical hardwoods and many agroforestry trees, only limited tested or improved seed sources are available. Transfers of tree germplasm involve some risks of spreading pests and diseases, of introducing invasive tree species and of polluting the genetic make-up of already present tree populations. Many of these risks have been underestimated in the past, but they are now better understood and managed. Relatively few tree species used for forestry have become invasive, and the risk of spreading pests and diseases while transferring seed is considerably lower than when moving live plants. The implementation of the Nagoya Protocol on access to genetic resources and benefit sharing (ABS) may significantly change current transfer practices in the forestry sector by increasing transaction costs and the time needed to lawfully obtain forest genetic resources for R&amp;D purposes. Many countries are likely to struggle to establish a well-functioning \{ABS\} regulatory system, slowing down the process of obtaining the necessary documentation for exchange. This is unfortunate, as climate change, outbreaks of pests and diseases, and continual pressure to support productivity, increase the need for transferring tree germplasm and accelerating R&amp;D. "

The effect of two preculture treatments (sucrose pretreatment medium or cold-culturing during two weeks) on donor plants of four potato species (Solanum commersonii, S. juzepcukii, S. ajanhuiri, and Solanum tuberosum) was studied. Post-cryopreservation meristem growth and plant recovery were influenced by the treatments, but the effect on the regeneration was strongly genotype-dependent. The highest post-rewarming plant recovery percentage was obtained using meristems dissected from donor plants of S. commersonii cultured on sucrose pretreatment medium or cold-cultured. Both preculture conditions also enhanced plant recovery in S. juzepcukii compared to control cultures. Cold preculture, however, proved to be undesirable for S. tuberosum whereas sucrose pretreatment had a positive impact on the plant regeneration of this species. The determination of changes in the concentration of soluble sugars revealed sugar accumulation, especially of sucrose and the raffinose family of oligosaccharides (RFOs), which can be linked to tolerance towards the cryopreservation. Additionally, a study of the proteome of the donor plantlets after the pretreatments by 2D-fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) was carried out to identify differentially abundant proteins. Carbon metabolism-related proteins, together with stress-response and oxidative-homeostasis related proteins were the main class of proteins that changed in abundance after the pretreatments. Our results suggest that oxidative homeostasis-related proteins and sugars may be associated with the improved tolerance to cryopreservation and the ability to cold acclimate by S. commersonii in contrast to the other genotypes. The increased accumulation of sucrose and \{RFOs\} play a fundamental role in the response to stress in potato and may help to acquire tolerance to cryopreservation. "

Different bioactive constituents derived from bark extracts from 20 tree populations sampled throughout the species’ natural range in Africa were studied by means of GC–MSD. The average concentration [mg/kg w/w] in increasing order was: lauric acid (18), myristic acid (22), n-docosanol (25), ferulic acid (49), β-sitostenone (198), β-sitosterol (490), and ursolic acid (743). The concentrations of many bark constituents were significantly correlated and concentration of n-docosanol was highly significantly correlated with all other analytes. Estimates of variance components revealed the highest variation among populations for ursolic acid (66%) and the lowest for β-sitosterol (20%). In general, environmental parameters recorded (temperature, precipitation, altitude) for the samples sites were not correlated with the concentration of most constituents; however, concentration of ferulic acid was significantly correlated with annual precipitation. Because the concentration of compounds in bark extracts may be affected by tree size, the diameter of sampled plants at 1.3 m tree height (as proxy of age) was recorded. The only relationship with tree diameter was a negative correlation with ursolic acid. Under the assumption that genetically less variable populations have less variable concentrations of bark compounds, correlations between variation parameters of the concentration and the respective genetic composition based on chloroplast and nuclear \{DNA\} markers were assessed. Only variation of β-sitosterol concentration was significantly correlated with haplotypic diversity. The fixation index (FIS) was positively correlated with the variation in concentration of ferulic acid. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) indicated a weak geographic pattern. Mantel tests, however, revealed associations between the geographic patterns of bioactive constituents and the phylogenetic relationship among the populations sampled. This suggests an independent evolution of bark metabolism within different phylogeographical lineages, and the molecular phylogeographic pattern is partly reflected in the variation in concentration of bark constituents. The results have important implications for the design of strategies for the sustainable use and conservation of this important African tree species. "

Farms, where a large number of crops (species or landraces) is grown, are known to contribute a large part of the locally available diversity of both rare and common crops but the role of farms with low diversity remains little understood: do they grow only common varieties—following a nestedness pattern typical of mutualistic networks in ecology—or do ‘crop–poor’ farmers also grow rare varieties? This question is pivotal in ongoing efforts to assess the local-scale contribution of small farms to global agrobiodiversity. We develop new network-based approaches to characterize the distribution of local crop diversity (species and infra-species) at the village level and to validate these approaches using meta-datasets from 10 countries. Our results highlight the sources of heterogeneity in crop diversity at the village level. We often identify two or more groups of farms based on their different levels of diversity. In some datasets, ‘crop–poor’ farms significantly contribute to the local crop diversity. Generally, we find that the distribution of crop diversity is more heterogeneous at the species than at the infra-species level. This analysis reveals the absence of a general pattern of crop diversity distribution, suggesting strong dependence on local agro-ecological and socio-cultural contexts. These different patterns of crop diversity distribution reflect an heterogeneity in farmers’ self-organized action in cultivating and maintaining local crop diversity, which ensures the adaptability of agroecosystems to global change.

Value depends on managing both the diversity of tree species present in landscapes and the genetic variation within these species. The benefits from trees and their genetic resources are, however, often not well quantified because trade is frequently outside formal markets, there is a multiplicity of species and ways in which trees are used and managed, and genetic diversity within species is frequently not given proper consideration. We review here what is known about the value of trees to rural communities through considering three production categories: non-timber products harvested from trees in natural and managed forests and woodlands; the various products and services obtained from a wide range of trees planted and/or retained in smallholders’ agroforestry systems; and the commercial products harvested from cultivated tree commodity crops. Where possible, we focus on the role of intra-specific genetic variation in providing support to livelihoods, and for each of the three production categories we also consider wider conservation and sustainability issues, including the linkages between categories in terms of management. Challenges to ‘conventional wisdom’ on tree resource use, value and management – such as in the posited links between commercialisation, cultivation and conservation – are highlighted, and constraints and opportunities to maintain and enhance value are described.

Over time, tree populations have become adapted to their habitats including the local ecological disturbances they face. As the planet enters a phase of human-induced climate change of unprecedented speed and magnitude, however, previously locally-adapted populations are rendered less suitable for new conditions, and ‘natural’ biotic and abiotic disturbances are taken outside their historic distribution, frequency and intensity ranges. Tree populations rely on phenotypic plasticity to survive in extant locations, on genetic adaptation to modify their local phenotypic optimum or on migration to new suitable environmental conditions. The rate of required change, however, may outpace the ability to respond, and tree species and populations may become locally extinct after specific, but as yet unknown and unquantified, tipping points are reached. Here, we review the importance of forest genetic resources as a source of evolutionary potential for adaptation to changes in climate and other ecological factors. We particularly consider climate-related responses in the context of linkages to disturbances such as pests, diseases and fire, and associated feedback loops. The importance of management strategies to conserve evolutionary potential is emphasised and recommendations for policy-makers are provided. "

abstract = "Abstract A vibrant, resilient and productive agricultural sector is fundamental to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Bringing about such a transformation requires optimizing a range of agronomic, environmental and socioeconomic outcomes from agricultural systems – from crop yields, to biodiversity, to human nutrition. However, these outcomes are not independent of each other – they interact in both positive and negative ways, creating the potential for synergies and trade-offs. Consequently, transforming the agricultural sector for the age of sustainable development requires tracking these interactions, assessing if objectives are being achieved and allowing for adaptive management within the diverse agricultural systems that make up global agriculture. This paper reviews the field of agricultural trade-off analysis, which has emerged to better understand these interactions – from field to farm, region to continent. Taking a “cradle-to-grave” approach, we distill agricultural trade-off analysis into four steps: 1) characterizing the decision setting and identifying the context-specific indicators needed to assess agricultural sustainability, 2) selecting the methods for generating indicator values across different scales, 3) deciding on the means of evaluating and communicating the trade-off options with stakeholders and decision-makers, and 4) improving uptake of trade-off analysis outputs by decision-makers. Given the breadth of the Sustainable Development Goals and the importance of agriculture to many of them, we assess notions of human well-being beyond income or direct health concerns (e.g. related to gender, equality, nutrition), as well as diverse environmental indicators ranging from soil health to biodiversity to climate forcing. Looking forward, areas of future work include integrating the four steps into a single modeling platform and connecting tools across scales and disciplines to facilitate trade-off analysis. Likewise, enhancing the policy relevance of agricultural trade-off analysis requires improving scientist-stakeholder engagement in the research process. Only then can this field proactively address trade-off issues that are integral to sustainably intensifying local and global agriculture – a critical step toward successfully implementing the Sustainable Development Goals.

abstract = "This paper provides a review of theoretical and practical aspects related to genetic management of forest trees. The implementation of international commitments on forest genetic diversity has been slow and partly neglected. Conservation of forest genetic diversity is still riddled with problems, and complexities of national legal and administrative structures. Europe is an example of a complex region where the distribution ranges of tree species extend across large geographical areas with profound environmental differences, and include many countries. Conservation of forest genetic diversity in Europe has been hampered by a lack of common understanding on the management requirements for genetic conservation units of forest trees. The challenge resides in integrating scientific knowledge on conservation genetics into management of tree populations so that recommendations are feasible to implement across different countries. Here, we present pan-European minimum requirements for dynamic conservation units of forest genetic diversity. The units are natural or man-made tree populations which are managed for maintaining evolutionary processes and adaptive potential across generations. Each unit should have a designated status and a management plan, and one or more tree species recognized as target species for genetic conservation. The minimum sizes of the units are set at 500, 50 or 15 reproducing individuals depending on tree species and conservation objectives. Furthermore, silvicultural interventions should be allowed to enhance genetic processes, as needed, and field inventories carried out to monitor regeneration and the population size. These minimum requirements are now used by 36 countries to improve management of forest genetic diversity. "

The role of farmer seed networks is less well understood and yet is central to debates on current issues ranging from seed sovereignty and rights for farmers to \{GMOs\} and the conservation of crop germplasm. In this paper we identify four common misconceptions regarding the nature and importance of farmer seed networks today. (1) Farmer seed networks are inefficient for seed dissemination. (2) Farmer seed networks are closed, conservative systems. (3) Farmer seed networks provide ready, egalitarian access to seed. (4) Farmer seed networks are destined to weaken and disappear. We challenge these misconceptions by drawing upon recent research findings and the authors’ collective field experience in studying farmer seed systems in Africa, Europe, Latin America and Oceania. Priorities for future research are suggested that would advance our understanding of seed networks and better inform agricultural and food policy. "

Samples from 31 populations in 8 islands were genotyped using 8 newly developed nuclear microsatellite markers. From the amplified loci, 81% were polymorphic across all populations and the species showed a relatively high total genetic diversity (HT = 0.7). Several populations were close to Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium while others presented positive \{FIS\} values (0.02–0.2). The largest proportion of genetic variation (98%) occurred within populations and the level of differentiation between populations, was generally low, although 27% of the population pairwise comparisons showed relatively high differentiation values (0.25 ≤ \{RST\} ≤ 0.65). Relatively high levels of gene flow were also found among most populations. Using the Bayesian clustering method implemented in \{STRUCTURE\} we found a particular genetic pattern in Corvo samples, and also similarities between Santa Maria, São Miguel and Flores populations. Considerable levels of genetic admixture within P. azorica populations might have resulted from: (i) fruit dispersal by native birds; and/or (ii) human mediated dispersal between islands. Our results revealed the existence of some genetically depauperate populations needing specific conservation measures, and indicate that arbitrary translocation of individuals between islands should be avoided.

A large literature review (&gt;1000 references) showed that in Latin America \{ES\} supply and links to policy have been the most frequently assessed. Overall, emphasis has been placed on a few services, namely carbon and water. Payments for ecosystem services have received considerable attention in the region, though with strong differences across nations and with important limitations in their application. The future of the ecosystem service paradigm in Latin America will largely depend on its capacity to demonstrate effectiveness in meeting both conservation and development goals. "

Rainfall interception, transpiration, runoff and soil water content were monitored during 3 years. Runoff was lower in \{AFS\} than \{MC\} (5.4 and 8.4% of total rainfall, respectively) and a higher water infiltration was observed under AFS. Still, the higher combined rainfall interception + transpiration of coffee and shade trees in \{AFS\} resulted in a lower drainage than in MC. No coffee water stress was recorded either in \{AFS\} or \{MC\} as relative extractable soil water remained above 20% during the dry seasons. Time course of soil water content showed enhanced access to soil water between 100 and 200 cm depth in AFS. This suggests complementarity for soil water between coffee and shade trees. The model \{HYDRUS\} 1D predicted that drainage at 200 cm depth accounted for a large fraction of annual rainfall (68% for \{MC\} and 62% for AFS). Climatic scenario simulations showed (1) a potential competition for water between coffee and shade trees when the dry season was extended by 4–6 weeks compared to actual, and (2) a severe reduction in annual drainage, but without competition for water when rainfall was reduced down to 40% of the actual.
