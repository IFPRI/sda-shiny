abstract = "It is widely believed that price policies have contributed to low rates of productivity growth in agriculture, but there has been little progress to date in work on the relationship between price distortions and agricultural productivity or agricultural research. Given the importance of technological change in agriculture, it is important to know whether price policies impede investments in R&amp;D and productivity growth. In this article, a theoretical analysis indicates that the effects of commodity price policies on incentives of government and industry to invest in agricultural research are ambiguous. While the results suggest a general tendency of policies that protect producers to encourage greater research investments, the opposite result cannot be ruled out. A statistical model using international, cross-sectional, time-series data shows that agricultural research investments are significantly correlated, but negatively, with rates of producer protection. The implication is that some factor other than price policy is responsible for both the low rates of public-sector investments in agricultural research worldwide, and the low rates of productivity growth in less-developed countries. Research administrators in more- and less-developed countries alike typically consider a multiplicity of goals when setting research priorities and research budgets. Therefore, an alternative explanation of low agricultural productivity and underinvestment in agricultural research may be that public-sector research policy has been misguided. "

abstract = "Three toposequences representing different stages in the degradation process were studied for the Sudanian Savanna zone of Burkina Faso. Morphological, chemical and mineralogical soil data are presented for the major toposequence land types easily recognized in the landscape. Owing to their low initial fertility, most soils of uplands and upper and mid-slopes are prone to rapid degradation when cultivation is intensified and fallow periods are shortened due to growing populations and the presence of growing animal herds. Once the permanent vegetation has been removed, these soils tend to develop dense surface crusts which reduce moisture infiltration, thereby increasing runoff and erosion as well as the risks of drought. By contrast, the soils of the lower slopes are more fertile and their moisture availability is more assured. The lowland soils are generally the most fertile but may suffer from occasional waterlogging. The local agriculture will often permanently occupy the lower slopes and lowland fields, whereas the higher fields will be in fallow systems. The cropping systems vary simultaneously among different land types. Based on the soil studies and crop adaptation patterns to toposequence land types, certain modifications to the present cropping systems and cultural practices are proposed to developed more stable and sustainable production systems for upland areas in particular.

To date, agricultural research evaluation has been dominated by economic impact assessment frameworks and methods. Designed as research studies, impact assessments have often served accountability and public awareness purposes. However, they have been of less use to further the understanding of how policies, programs and technologies may or may not contribute to agricultural innovation. There is an increasing awareness that appropriately designed and executed evaluations—going beyond traditional economic impact assessment—can contribute substantially to institutional learning and performance improvement.

Any particular impact assessment falls along a continuum between academic research at one extreme and utilization-focused evaluation at the other. We argue that impact assessment studies may enjoy greater use by decision makers if they are managed as evaluations conducted towards the utilization-focused end of the continuum. Several factors that influence the use of evaluations are discussed. These include the type of potential use and intended users; the nature of decision-making; factors over and above information that affect how decisions are made; and the various decision levels where evaluations may be used. Direct, indirect and symbolic uses of evaluations are also discussed. Six trends within the professional evaluation community that tend to enhance the use of evaluation are described. Finally, we offer some practical suggestions for enhancing the usefulness and use of impact assessments and other evaluations within the agricultural research and development community. "

The results suggest a bias toward mechanical and against biological technology regardless of factor endowments.

Therefore, strengthening these \{NARS\} should start by reinforcing their thematic and commodity research programme, which necessarily involves the introduction of a systems perspective along with some on-farm activities. This approach would not require extensive institutional reorganization and would be far less costly than the creation of independent systems research units. Based on a detailed study of the Rwanda \{NARS\} in relation to agricultural development, it was concluded that both donors and \{NARS\} leaders should be more concerned about the integration of projects into the national institutional framework, starting from the design phase. Also the sustainability and continuity of the research activities in terms of operating cost and local manpower following project termination should be emphasised. As a result the overall national research programme would not become biased towards short-term production objectives such as for annual food crops; but would also address more complex and vital long-term issues, like land degradation and the sustainability of local and improved technologies, which would require integration between disciplinary activities of technical, biological and social scientists. To achieve these aims it is necessary that the scientists share a similar systems perspective which can be reinforced through participative methods that effectively link the research with the knowledge and needs of farmers and extension personnel.

The study found that the past process of adoption and diffusion was significantly influenced by the characteristics mentioned above. Considering the speed to completed adoption, the influence of relative investment was smaller while relative complexity and relative risk showed significance. The strong influence of relative complexity and relative risk of the technologies on the adoption can be explained by the characteristics of farmers and the farming circumstances. Meru farmers are poorly educated and face shortage of labor making them hesitant to adopt complex technologies. Moreover, the risk of production is high leading farmers to adopt new technologies that reduce risk relative to the traditional technologies. Knowing this, planners in research and extension should advise the development of risk-reducing technologies with a low complexity as compared to the technologies that should be replaced. "

Using a case study from Meru District in Kenya, it is shown that relative investment, relative risk and relative complexity significantly influenced the speed and ceiling of adoption of dairy technologies in the past. These empirical results are used to predict the speed and ceiling of adoption of potential new dairy technologies to be developed by the Dairy Cattle Research Programme (DCRP) of the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI). The approach is theoretically sound and based on empirical evidence.
