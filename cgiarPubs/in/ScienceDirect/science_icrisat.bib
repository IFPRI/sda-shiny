The objective of this research was to identify cultivars suitable for irrigated cropping during the cool post-rainy season. Four hundred and thirtytwo lines representing breeding and local germplasm lines from Niger were tested for field emergence, flowering and podding in the coolest time of the year. A selected set of lines was evaluated for yield and other characteristics. Seedling emergence began 8 days after sowing and seedlings emerged over a 7-day period. Seventy-four percent of the local germplasm lines recorded 76–100% emergence as compared to 4% of the breeding lines. The growth of seedlings was very slow. The time to maturity was not well related to the maturity during the normal cropping season. Cooler temperatures prolonged time to maturity. All lines flowered but some did not set pods. The highest pod set was recorded in the early-maturity group. Grain yield and related attributes declined sharply when sowing was done in January as compared with the November sowing. The differences observed among selected cultivars and sowing dates were mainly due to variation in crop growth rate. "

Based on surveys conducted in groundnut-growing zones of Niger in West Africa, utilities of selected socioeconomic and technical interventions to farmers were derived through application of conjoint and ordered probit analyses. Across all regional and gender subgroups of respondents, groundnut farmers attach significant importance to access to credit and reliable markets for pods. The introduction of new and more productive varieties per se would not significantly contribute to utilities of farmers at the present time. This possibly implies that until market and credit constraints are alleviated, farmers have lower utility for more productive varieties. Regional diversities were observed in the significance of utilities groundnut farmers can gain from the availability of local small-scale groundnut oil processing plant, fertilizer and changes to traditional rules governing access to land. There is no evidence of genderbased diversity in utilities and, therefore, prioritization of the interventions on the basis of observed utilities will benefit both gender components. "

In one set of experiments seven cultivars were sown at three rates of phosphorus (P) fertilizer (0, 8 and 16 kg P ha−1). In another set, five cultivars were sown on two dates relative to sowing of millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R.Br.). All experiments involved factorial combinations of management and cultivar treatments, and were conducted in 1988 and 1989 at two sites in western Niger. Seed yield, shoot dry matter, vegetative (Dv) and reproductive (Dr) durations were determined and crop growth rate (C) and partitioning (p) to seed estimated. Application of P increased seed yield by increasing C. As sowing was delayed from 1 to 3 weeks after the millet was sown, there was a reduction in seed yield due to decreases in C, Dv and Dr. Variation in cultivar performance across years was mainly a function of C and partitioning. In both experiments the C of the landrace Sadore Local was greater than that of other cultivars, although the partitioning to seed of this cultivar was unstable due to variable control of insect pest damage. It is concluded that the primary causes of G × E interactions were differential canopy development and insect damage effects. Therefore in the development of cowpea cultivars for intercropping with millet, emphasis should focus on light capture capabilities. Improved yields would then seem possible with most cultivars, providing insect damage is controlled. "

Seeds of some lines harvested at 10 days after pollination germinated, but the highest percentage germination was observed at 35 days in all lines. The maximum mean seedling vigor occurred at 35 days and coincided with the maximum dry weight of the seeds. Germplasm collectors can collect germinable seeds much earlier than the time of accumulation of maximum dry matter.

Crop yield parameters, including grain and biomass yield, leaf area index, crop cover, and plant height were measured. Results indicate significant benefits to annual crop yield (maize, sorghum) from improved water supply due to mulching with farmyard manure or and rice straw, and due to rotation with prior-perennial crops. Grain yields were 16 to 59% higher in mulched treatments compared to unmulched treatments, with similar increases for fodder yields. Annual crop yields after 4 years of perennials were 14 to 81% higher than unmulched treatments, except for low fertility maize grown after buffel grass. The interaction with chemical fertility was less clear than for water supply. The results have implications for soil management throughout the semi-arid tropics. "

Significant effects (P ≤ 0.05) of cropping system and cultivars were observed for cowpea grain yield. Cultivar × cropping system interaction was significant only for fodder yield. Intercropping reduced cowpea yields significantly but the degree of reduction varied among cultivars. Early-maturing erect cultivars exhibited greater yield reduction than the indeterminate spreading types and had the least effect on millet yields. Indeterminate spreading cultivars produced greater grain and fodder yield than erect types and caused the greatest millet yield reduction. The relationship between the yield of cowpea cultivars and millet when intercropped was negative. Linear correlations between yield of cowpea in sole and intercrop were positive and significant (P &lt; 0.01) with r values ranging from 0.45 to 0.91. However, a small proportion of the greatest and least-yielding cowpea cultivars in intercropping would have been selected and rejected, respectively, on the basis of sole-crop grain-yield. It was concluded that selection of cowpea cultivars for intercropping with millet based on their grain yield in sole crop may have limited success. Selection based on fodder yield favoured late-maturing cultivars. Selection of cowpea cultivars for intercropping should be based on their intercropped performance, paying special attention to other agronomic factors. An appropriate cowpea cultivar for intercropping with millet would be the one that is less competitive with millet and yields both grain and fodder. "

Interspatial total factor productivity comparisons indicate that the new cropping systems were more profitable than the traditional cropping system. However, the determination of the sustainability of the tested systems was constrained by lack of appropriate time series data to cope with environmental instability in the Sahel and changes in resource stocks. In designing new cropping system technologies for areas prone to degradation, a multidisciplinary research strategy is needed to identify and measure resource stock changes that affect productivity. It is also imperative to use crops and systems models, particularly in unstable climatic environments, to generate adequate time series data for the measurement of sustainability. Finally, cropping systems evaluated should include both packages and components. This will permit the formulation of recommendations that fit resources or preferences of different farmers. "

Species composition and physical structure of the herbaceous layer as well as woody plant population were recorded at all sites together with data on soils and natural resource management. Herbage yield was measured whereas foliage yield and wood mass were calculated using allometry equation calibrated for each species. `Brousse tigrée' is characterized by the regularly alternating bare-soil stripes with dense linear thickets arranged perpendicularly to the slope. There was no clear superiority in total plant production of `brousse tigrée' when compared to neighbouring site with diffuse vegetation. However, the pattern of `brousse tigrée' tended to favour woody plant yield to the detriment of herbage yield. The number of herbaceous species recorded per site (22–26) was slightly above Sahelian vegetation average despite low number of species per 1-m2 quadrat (6–9), bare soil excluded. This species richness reflects the diversity in edaphic niches resulting from the redistribution and local concentration of water resources and shade. The high spatial heterogeneity and species richness of the herbaceous layer in `brousse tigrée' did not attenuate the interannual variation in herbage yield despite low yields. Except for the herb layer, little evidence was found of grazing influence on the vegetation structure and yield a few hundred metres away from livestock concentration points. On the other hand, the clearing of thickets for cropping led to severe soil erosion which threaten the resilience of `brousse tigrée'. These observations and the well-defined climatic, soiland topographic situations under which the `brousse tigrée' occurs invalidate the hypothesis of an anthropic origin of that vegetationpattern. "

The enhanced crop growth under its canopy (the ‘albida effect’) has been attributed to increased soil fertility in the canopy zone, improved microclimate, particularly in relation to plant/soil water relations, and the fact that the tree sheds its leaves in the rainy season, which reduces shade and allows the crops to grow. The present studies demonstrate that shade-induced reduction of soil temperatures, particularly at the time of crop establishment, contributes to the better growth under these trees. Greater use of shade to reduce soil temperature to the benefit of crops is proposed. Vertical shade barriers were used to vary the soil surface temperature by varying the time that the soil was exposed to direct sunlight. Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), sown in this range of environments, germinated and grew best in a partially shaded environment, but failed in fully exposed conditions; growth was inversely related to mean soil surface temperatures during seedling establishment. In a separate, concurrent study, at the beginning of the Sabelian rainy season, a nearly leafless tree canopy intercepted about half of the incoming radiation, which resulted in a decrease of up to 10°C in the maximum soil temperature at 2cm depth (depending on position relative to the tree and time relative to rain) during the seedling establishment phase.

Technologies must be effective within farmer resource constraints, increase food production, reduce risk and enhance the soil fertility. Results from on-farm participatory research were used to quantify the effects of agronomic practices on soil resources. Agricultural productivity is primarily nitrogen (N) limited throughout Malawi, and sub-humid Zimbabwe. Tightening economic constraints faced by farmers in the region have reduced inorganic fertilizer inputs and necessitate increased reliance on biologically-fixed N and N cycling. Three components of organic matter technology were evaluated: (1) the effects of residue quality; (2) the role of deep rooting systems; and (3) tradeoffs between legumes grown for grain versus soil regeneration. Perennial systems investigated include improved fallows, intercropping, and biomass transfer. Annual systems include intercrops and rotations of cereals with legumes. The most promising non-food legumes were Tephrosia and Sesbania. Interestingly, high quality residues of perennial legumes were most effective at supplying N in the short to medium term, whereas low quality residues immobilised N. Low quality residues were problematic for smallholder farmers who need immediately available N. Challenges to adoption of perennial system technologies include establishment costs, resource competition and delayed benefits. Farmer adoption of annual grain legumes is promoted by the simultaneous production of food; however, those species which have a high N harvest index add little to no net N to the soil. Species that combine some grain yield with high root and leaf biomass, thus a low N harvest offer a useful compromise of meeting farmer food security concerns and improving soil fertility. Promising genotypes include Arachis, Cajanus, Dolichos and Mucuna spp. On-farm N budgets indicate that legumes with high quality residues and deep root systems are effective ways at improving nutrient cycling. Areas of future research priority for smallholder farms in southern Africa were identified, including technologies which combine inorganic and organic fertilizer and improve legume growth and establishment on degraded soils.

While temperature influences development throughout the life cycle of plants, photoperiod influences the vegetative stage (from seedling emergence to panicle initiation). In order to simulate plant development, it is essential to know when sorghum plants first become sensitive to photoperiod, and how long that photoperiod sensitivity persists. Ten cultivars with different levels of photoperiod sensitivity were grown in pots under natural climatic conditions both in short days (SD: 8 h day−1) and long days (LD: 17 h d−1). Plants were transferred at different times after seedling emergence from \{SD\} to \{LD\} and vice versa. The time to panicle initiation (PI) for each transfer treatment was determined. In cultivars that remained continuously in SD, the time to \{PI\} varied from 16 to 27 d, whereas, in continuous \{LD\} it varied from 22 to 37 d. The cultivars started reacting to photoperiod 4–9 d after seedling emergence. After sensing photoperiod stimuli, inductive effects among cultivars persisted for 4–14 d in SD, and for 15–33 d in \{LD\} depending on their intrinsic photoperiod sensitivity. The sensitivity ended 2–5 d before panicle initiation. This interval, between completion of the photoperiod-inductive phase and the actual observation of \{PI\} under the microscope, represents the time required for the photoperiod-inductive stimulus to promote sufficient cell division and growth at the shoot apex for the morphological change to become visible as a shiny globular structure. We conclude that photoperiod sensitivity in these sorghum cultivars ends shortly before or at the \{PI\} stage. Our results support the assumptions followed in several crop simulation models that sorghum remains photoperiod-sensitive until the completion of the vegetative stage. "

It discusses the mineralization process that is basic to soil nitrogen availability to wetland rice. The mineralizable N pool in soils plays a dominant role in N nutrition of wetland rice. Studies using 15N-labeled fertilizers show that approximately one-half to two-thirds of the total N utilized by a rice crop, even in well-fertilized rice paddies, comes from the soil-mineralizable N pool. Numerous biological and chemical laboratory methods have been proposed for predicting soil N availability to various crops, including rice. Mineralization of organic nitrogen, which does not proceed past ammonium production in wetland rice soils, is the most important biological process that is involved in the availability of soil N to rice grown under submerged conditions. The chapter discusses simple equations describing the relationships between the amounts of NH4+–N released under waterlogged conditions and environmental factors such as temperature and other soil characteristics. These relationships have been formulated from studies with diverse soils from a particular region and are limited in that they have not been widely tested. "

The four treatments compared were: (1) control (crop residue removed and no fertilizer applied), (2) crop residue alone, (3) 30 kg N+13 kg P ha−1 (fertilizer) alone and (4) crop residue+fertilizer. Use of crop residue+fertilizer increased grain yield fourfold over the control; use of fertilizer doubled millet yield relative to the control and crop residues resulted in 1.2 times more yield than the control. Crop residues significantly improved nutrient-use efficiency of the applied fertilizer. Sustainability yield index (SYI), a measure of an upward trend in yield over time, was greatest in crop residue+fertilizer plots as are soil organic carbon, available P and pH.

The runoff and sediment flow behavior recorded on the small agricultural watersheds indicated the need for an integrated digital runoff and soil loss monitoring unit (IDRSMU) to achieve higher accuracy and cost effectiveness. The design, development and testing of an \{IDRSMU\} to measure both the runoff and soil loss from small agricultural watersheds is presented. Under the field conditions its accuracy and efficiency for monitoring soil loss from small agricultural watersheds was observed good. Use of this integrated unit, makes the estimation of soil loss easy, rapid and accurate. The designed unit does smart runoff sampling by linking the runoff sampling intervals to the sediment load. This significantly reduces number of samples that needs to be collected, thereby reducing the operational cost, without compromising with the accuracy in estimating soil loss from small agricultural watersheds.

Two water treatments, irrigated and drought-stress, were created by applying water five or three times during each of the growing seasons. Observed responses were compared with the simulated data using the sorghum simulation model SORGF. Neither observed nor simulated durations of growth stages were affected by drought-stress. Comparisons between observed and simulated duration of growth stages showed that the model simulated phenological development with good accuracy. Drought-stress coefficient calculations were based on the availability of water in the soil profile; simulated drought-stress coefficients agreed well with observed values. Observed and simulated grain yields of \{CSH\} 8 were higher than those of M 35-1 under both the irrigated and drought-stressed conditions. The correlation coefficients between observed and simulated total dry matter and grain yield data pooled over two water treatments, two cultivars, and two seasons were respectively 0.80 and 0.92.

Analysis of the 2-year pooled data showed that across seasons both total dry matter and seed yields were more strongly correlated with normalized \{ET\} (R2=0.92, P &lt; 0.01 for TDM, and R2=0.82, P &lt; 0.01 for seed yield), defined as ratio of actual \{ET\} to saturation vapour pressure deficit of air, than with actual \{ET\} (R2=0.56, P &lt; 0.01 for TDM, and R2=0.40, P &lt; 0.01 for seed yield). Partitioning of total normalized \{ET\} observed during the season into normalized \{ET\} observed during two or three growth phases of chickpea and regressing seed yield against them did not improve the predictability of models. It is concluded from this study that both total dry matter production and seed yield responses of chickpea to water management can be predicted if the normalized \{ET\} during the season is known. "

This study analysed 82 published \{SSR\} markers for finger millet across 10 diverse accessions to compile an informative set for genetic characterisation. Extensive optimization compared single samples with bulked leaf or bulked \{DNA\} samples for capturing within accession genetic diversity. The markers were evaluated to determine (1) how efficiently they amplified target loci during high-throughput genotyping with a generic \{PCR\} protocol, (2) ease of scoring \{PCR\} products and (3) polymorphism and ability to discern genetic diversity within the tested finger millet germplasm. Results Across 88 samples, the 52 markers that worked well amplified 274 alleles, ranging from 2 to 14 per locus with a mean of 4.89. Major allele frequency ranged from 0.18 to 0.93 with a mean of 0.57. Polymorphic Information Content (PIC) ranged from 0.13 to 0.88 with a mean of 0.5 and availability varied between 64 and 100% with a mean of 92.8%. Heterozygosity ranged from 0 to 1.0, with a mean of 0.26. Discussion Five individual samples from an accession captured the largest number of alleles per locus compared to the four different bulked sampling strategies but this difference was not significant.

Stovers were investigated for nitrogen (N), neutral (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF), acid detergent lignin (ADL), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) and ME. Quality traits were investigated using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) applied to whole and ground maize grain and to ground stover. Application of \{NIRS\} to whole maize grain was unsuccessful but CP, fat and \{ME\} contents in ground maize grain were well predicted with \{R2\} = 0.81, 0.83 and 0.94, respectively, and predictions of lysine and tryptophan were acceptable (R2 = 0.70). Maize stover quality traits were generally well predicted by \{NIRS\} (R2 = 0.81–0.96). Genotype and environment effect was significant on the quality traits of grain, whereas G × E effect was not significant. Trade-offs between grain and stover quality traits were generally absent or weak and inconsistent but several grain quality traits were incompatible. Thus grain \{CP\} was negatively correlated with grain yield. Lysine and tryptophan were consistently significantly negatively correlated with CP. Line and cultivars-dependent variation in grain and stover quality traits were high enough to be of nutritional significance to monogastrics and ruminants. "

Most stover fodder quality traits were highly significantly different among the lines except ADF. These differences were substantial among best and worst lines for the traits, with stover N varying threefold and NDF, \{ADF\} and \{IVOMD\} by more than 10 percentage units. Among the agronomic traits, significant positive associations were observed among grain and stover yield. Grain yield was significantly negatively associated with DtA50 and Anthesis to silking interval (AtS) and positively with PH. Stover yield was significantly negatively associated with DtA50 and positively with PH. Desirable stover quality traits N, \{IVOMD\} and \{ME\} were significantly negatively associated with grain yield (R2 = 0.25–0.28) while undesirable quality traits NDF, \{ADF\} and \{ADL\} were significantly positively associated with grain yield (R2 = 0.04–0.23). Stover yields were largely unrelated fodder quality traits except for a significant negative association with \{NDF\} and \{ADF\} (R2 = 0.04 to 0.08). \{GWAS\} analysis carried out using \{GBS\} (genotyping by sequencing) and a 55K \{SNPs\} genotypic dataset revealed several regions of significant association for N, \{ADF\} and IVOMD, each explaining from 3 to 9% of phenotypic variance for these fodder quality traits. \{SYN7725\} from the 55K chip on chromosome 4 explained the largest proportion of phenotypic variance (∼9%) for \{ADF\} and had a robust minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.35. A specific genomic region on chromosome 3 (132.7–149.2 Mb) was found to be significantly associated with all the three forage quality traits, with the largest effect on IVOMD. This region merits attention for further validation and marker-assisted introgressions. A cellulose-related candidate gene, Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (xth1, GRMZM2G119783) was also identified closer to the peak on chr.10 (∼76.9 Mb) for ADF, which has been previously demonstrated to have a significant role in fiber elongation in cotton.

Data were recorded on various agronomic traits including yields. At harvest the stover was analyzed for a range of fodder quality traits. On the basis of high stover in vitro digestibility (IVOMD) (a trait chosen because it correlated well with pricing in fodder trading of another coarse stover, namely sorghum) and high grain yield, the top ranking 10 inbred lines were selected and crossed in all possible combinations (excluding reciprocals) using diallel mating design in the rainy season of 2010. A total of 26 crosses along with four commercial hybrid checks were selected and planted in two replicates for evaluation during the dry season of 2010.

Differences among genotypes in yield under stress during flowering and grain-filling were partitioned into differences in yield potential, drought escape, and drought tolerance; the drought response accounted for more than 40% of the observed yield differences. Phenotypic traits related to yield under stress were divided into those reflecting drought escape and those reflecting drought tolerance. Drought tolerance was found to be primarily expressed in traits relating to the ability to maintain grain numbers under stress (grain number per panicle and per unit area, and grain yield per panicle). Drought escape, in contrast, was expressed in terms of greater grain biomass and higher harvest index. However, the field data also indicated that considerable progress in yield under stress should be possible by selection for earlier flowering and improved yield potential alone. "

Grain growth parameters of more than 70 millet lines were assessed under well-watered and postflowering drought-stress conditions in two field trials at the \{ICRISAT\} Sahelian Center, Sadoré, Niger. All the grain growth parameters based on thermal time varied more than two-fold between lines in both moisture environments. Single grain mass of the lines ranged from 4.3–10.9 mg under well-watered conditions and 3.4–9.4 mg under drought stress. When averaged across trials, 51% of the accounted variance of final grain mass could be explained by differences in the grain growth rate under well-watered conditions, while differences in the duration of the linear grain growth phase accounted for 37% of the variation in final grain mass. Drought stress reduced the linear grain growth phase and, as a consequence, reduced final grain mass by up to 25%. Lines with long grain filling periods under well-watered conditions had larger reductions in the grain filling period and in final grain mass under stress. In general, there was little effect of drought stress on the grain growth rate. However, because of the negative correlation of grain growth rate and linear grain growth phase, lines with higher grain growth rates in well-watered conditions had smaller reductions in grain filling period under stress. Grain growth rate accounted with 38% for the major part of the variation in grain mass under stress conditions. Grain growth parameters in well-watered and drought-stress conditions were unrelated to drought tolerance as expressed by a drought response index, and were indicators of neither susceptibility nor tolerance to stress. However final grain mass was highly correlated to yield under stress. A feasible risk-reducing strategy in the likelihood of postflowering stress is to select pearl millet lines for drought escape with a high grain growth rate combined with a relatively short grain filling period.

Sixteen representative isolates of the \{MGs\} and the \{PGs\} were further evaluated for virulence and aggressiveness on the differential lines and were classified into five distinct groups using the centroid method of cluster analysis.

Field experiments were conducted to study the influence of water-deficits on phenology, growth and dry-matter allocation in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L., cv. \{JG\} 74). The crop was subjected to increasing intensities of water deficits during both vegetative and reproductive phases by applying gradient irrigations. Durations of emergence to flowering (e-fl), flowering to beginning of pod-fill (fl-bpf), and beginning of pod-fill to physiological maturity (bpf- PM) were inversely correlated with normalized evapotranspiration-deficit (Et-deficit) experienced by the crop during a growth period. In terms of thermal time (base temperature=8°C, ceiling temperature = 30°C), the durations of e-fl, fl-bpf, and bpf-pm phases decreased by 4.5, 3.1, and 3.8°Cd for each mm kPa−1 of normalized Et-deficit, respectively. Water-deficits prior to flowering decreased canopy development, light interception, and dry-matter production to the maximum extent compared with stress after flowering. Water-deficit prior to pod-initiation did not influence the allocation of dry-matter between leaves and branches, but water-deficit during the reproductive phase increased allocation to the reproductive organs. Normalized Et-deficit of 1 mm kPa−1 increased allocation to the pods by 0.75% of the biomass produced after pod-initiation and to the seeds by 0.52% of the biomass produced after bpf. It is concluded from this study that we need to consider the influence of water stress on phenology, growth and dry-matter allocation in chickpea in addition to other environmental factors affecting these processes.

Stover fodder quality traits analyzed were nitrogen (N), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), acid detergent fiber (ADF), acid detergent lignin (ADL) and neutral detergent solubles (NDS = 100 − NDF) using a combination of conventional nutritional laboratory analysis with Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). Significant (P &lt; 0.0001) differences were found among lines for grain and stover yield and all stover fodder quality traits under both water treatments. Water treatment had greater effects on grain and stover yields, which decreased between 20 and 32% under water stress, than on stover fodder quality traits which varied at most by 8% between treatments. Year had the greatest effect (F-value) on all traits followed by water treatment and line. Trade-offs between stover quality traits and grain yields were largely absent in both backgrounds. Year and water treatment had larger effects on stover fodder quality traits than QTL's but QTL's were highly significant (P &lt; 0.0001) except for stover N in S-35 background. Significant interactions between QTL, water treatment and year were largely absent. The effect of \{QTL\} on selected stover fodder quality traits was background dependent. In S-35 one staygreen \{QTL\} (StgB) increased stover \{IVOMD\} and grain and stover yield while no concomitant trait improvement was observed in background R-16.

Sequence information of the reference genes were obtained from the closely related species and cloned from pearl millet using homology based cloning strategy. Further, expression stabilities were validated for their accurate expression in different tissues, genotypes and abiotic stress treatments using three statistical algorithms including geNorm, NormFinder and RefFinder. Analysis showed that while the expression of EF-1α and \{EIF4A\} was most stable in different plant tissues, \{MDH\} and \{EIF4A\} were stable under different abiotic stress conditions. Amongst the different genotypes of pearl millet tested, while \{UBC\} and \{MDH\} genes exhibited most stable expression, \{MDH\} and \{ACP\} showed greater stability in all samples set. Interestingly, the widely used reference genes \{S24\} and \{TUB\} were found to be least stable across all the tested samples. Pair-wise analysis showed that two reference genes were sufficient for proper normalization, except when analyzing the gene expression studies in all samples set. Results of this study can help in the selection of reference genes for quantitative real time \{PCR\} (qRT-PCR) normalization in pearl millet that will contribute towards more accurate and reliable quantification of transcripts in this important crop of the drylands.

In the present study, we identified and characterized Sorghum \{AQP\} genes using a genome-wide scale, including factors such as their relationship with other species, chromosome distribution, sequence analysis and expression levels. A total of 41 non-redundant \{AQP\} genes were identified and classified into four subfamilies (PIPs, TIPs, \{NIPs\} and SIPs). Analysis of physical distributions revealed that SbAQP genes are unevenly dispersed in the Sorghum genome. Topological analysis indicated that members of the SbAQP gene family have two to seven transmembrane domains, whereas \{PIPs\} have four to six transmembrane domains. SbAQP genes were disrupted by introns, with intron numbers varying from zero to four. In silico promoter analysis of SbAQP genes suggested that it has diverse functions associated with plant development and abiotic stress responsiveness. The transcript analysis of SbAQP genes in different tissues and under abiotic stress conditions revealed that \{AQPs\} may play an important role in growth and development during abiotic stress conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of the \{AQP\} gene family in S. bicolor. This study provides basic insights into the putative role of these genes under different environmental conditions. In summary, our genome-wide analysis of SbAQP genes provides a valuable resource for functional analysis aimed towards understanding their role in stress adaptation. "

Moreover, crops are commonly grown in intercrop combinations of which cereal/cowpea is the most widespread. The present series of experiments investigates the impact of cereal density and of a cowpea intercrop on the grain yields of maize, sorghum, pearl millet, and several introduced sorghum genotypes. In all the studies, a spreading and photosensitive local cowpea cultivar was used. In some seasons, even a low cowpea intercrop density of 5000 plants/ha could significantly reduce sorghum and maize yields on moisture-stressed soils, whilst with adequate soil moisture cereal yields were increased. The competitive effects of the cowpea intercrop, particularly on drought sensitive lands, were enhanced by increasing cowpea density, by lowering cereal density, by sorghum cultivars with relatively open leaf canopies (e.g., the local Guiniensis types) and by a relatively high phosphate status of the soil. Because of the unpredictability of rainfall during the growth season and large local variations in soil fertility, high densities of cowpea and cereal would increase yield variation between locations and between years which is not beneficial for subsistence farmers. However, because of its positive effects on upland soil protection, and on cereal yields on moist lower slopes, a low cowpea intercrop density in the range of 2500 to 10000 plants/ha should have positive and stabilizing effects on cereal production in the long-term.

Towards the North Sudanian zone these systems become less common, because of a shorter rainy season with a more abrupt start and end. However, previous work on the responses of maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and pearl millet (Pennisetum americanum) crops to the different toposequence land types indicated that crop mixtures of sorghum/millet for uplands and sorghum/maize for lowlands would be less prone to drought stress and waterlogging risks than would the respective sole crops. The present studies showed consistent intercropping advantages of at least 25% for sorghum/maize systems when both crops are sown at the same time. The relative advantages from this system were greatest for the uplands. Intercropping advantages were generally less for the sorghum/millet systems, and it proved essential to delay the millet sowing to prevent serious competition to the sorghum. Sorghum/millet intercropping provides a risk-reducing alternative to sole cropping, because sorghum plants lost during the common early droughts can be replaced by an early-maturing millet sown in July. However, because of the unpredictability of the early-season rainfall, sorghum/millet systems will be difficult to standardize; both the sowing date and the plant densities of the component crops may require adjustments each year in response to the starting date of the rains and the extent to which the sorghum has survived the early-season droughts.

Within this landscape a pattern of land types and soils, which is closely linked to the topography, can be distinguished. Thus low fertility drought sensitive soils (Alfisols) are found on uplands, whereas the more fertile soils of the lower slopes and lowlands (mainly Inceptisols) will be moist to wet. In response to these variations in land types and the unpredictable rainfall, which can cause both droughts and floods during the rainy season, the subsistence farmers have adopted distinct cropping patterns in order to minimize the risk of crop failure under the conditions of a low input agriculture. Consequently, cropping patterns which closely follow the toposequence have evolved, with millets grown on dry uplands and slopes, maize on moist lower slopes, sorghum on lower slopes, and rice on lowlands. The present study was conducted mainly in Upper Volta and provides a scientific basis for these cropping patterns by analysing the responses of three major cereal crops to land types and to sowing dates. Next, several high yielding, introduced, sorghum cultivars were tested to determine their adaptation to the local conditions and to formulate plant characteristics useful to plant breeders in selecting improved cultivars which would best meet the requirements of the local agriculture. It was concluded that to meet the large diversity in land types and rainfall conditions typical for the West African semiarid tropics, even an advanced type agriculture would require a range of technological options, in terms of improved varieties and cultural practices. Consequently, the likelihood that a single improved cultivar could replace the local cultivars is remote, as is the possibility of introducing a standard technological package. "

The effect of these treatments on tiller production, leaf-area production, dry-matter accumulation and grain-yield is described, and the relationship between radiation interception (Qi) during the phase from floral initiation to flowerng (GS2), and number of grains (yield potential) and grain-yield is examined. The treatments caused significant variation in tiller and leaf-area production, radiation interception and numbers of grains per unit area at maturity. Number of grains, which ranged from 37 to 71×103 m−2, was correlated (r2=0.83) with intercepted radiation during GS2. Thus at high plant population in the long ncrop-duration treatment, where leaf area was highest during GS2, number of grains was greatest. Grain-yield less strongly correlated (r2=0.63) with intercepted radiation during \{GS2\} because, in crops with many grains, grain-size was reduced. Possible reasons for reduced grain-size in crops with high yield-potential are discussed. "

The effect on yield and yield components of exposing pods of normal cultivars was investigated in field experiments at three locations in India: at Hyderabad and Hissar during the winter season, and in the Lahaul valley in the Himalayas during the summer season.

The line source (LS) sprinkler irrigation technique which produces a gradient of water deficit stress due to decreasing amount of water supply with increasing distance from the sprinkler line was used to study the relationships between applied water levels, time of inoculation and the degree of charcoal rot incidence. Grain yields were reduced in proportion to the deficit in water supply along the gradient, whereas the incidence of charcoal rot increased. Inoculation with the fungus increased the incidence of disease when natural incidence was low. Sorghum was more susceptible to disease during the later stages of grain filling than during the period immediately after flowering. The rows of plants farthest from the LS, which received the least irrigation, showed disease incidence earlier than those nearest, which were better watered. This was apparent for each of the three different, but highly correlated, parameters of disease spread: percentage of soft stalks; number of nodes crossed; and the length of fungal spread (cm).

One of these gardens is managed according to the same improved crop management package as in the AMG, this treatment is called Improved Management (IM). The other garden is managed according to common practices of vegetable producers in the area, this treatment is called the Farmer Practice (FP). Crop productivity, labor and water use were monitored for two vegetable species (okra and eggplants). The experiment was performed on-station in Niger on three adjacent 500 m2 plots in a sandy acid soil. It was found that improved crop management practices greatly enhance crop productivity over traditional methods at comparable production costs. The \{AMG\} gave higher crop yields and higher returns to investment than the treatments irrigated with watering cans. Labor accounts for up to 45% of the production cost in vegetable gardens irrigated by hand, where 80% of the producer time is spent on irrigation. The total labor requirement for the drip irrigated \{AMG\} was on average 1.1 man hours per day against 4.7 man hours per day for the Farmers Practice on a 500 m2 garden. Returns on labor are at least double for the \{AMG\} against the other treatments. The returns on land from eggplant were found to be US$ 1.7, 0.8 and 0.1 per m2 for the AMG, \{IM\} and \{FP\} respectively. The returns on water for the cultivation of eggplant are around US$ 2 per m3 in the AMG, against US$ 0.1 in the Farmers Practice.

Such information for Alfisols and Vertisols, the two major soils in the semi-arid tropics (SATs), is scanty especially from a long-term perspective. In this paper, we describe and discuss results from long-term (from 1976 to 2010) hydrological studies conducted on small agricultural watersheds on Vertisols and Alfisols at the \{ICRISAT\} Center, Patancheru, India. The hydrological behavior of soils are characterized in terms of runoff volume, peak runoff rate, number of runoff events, soil loss, sediment concentration and deep drainage loss under different rainfall, crop cover and soil moisture conditions to aid in developing effective soil and water management practices. We also provide details on the effects of annual and monthly rainfall on the hydrological behavior of these soils in different rainfall regions. The results show that Alfisols and Vertisols in the \{SATs\} have very contrasting hydrological behavior. Several findings emerging from our studies, are rather unexpected. For example, the sandy Alfisols with higher saturated hydrological conductivity generated higher runoff compared to the clayey Vertisols with extremely low saturated hydraulic conductivity. The undesirable early season runoff from Alfisols is higher than from Vertisols. The contribution of 1–2 big storms to annual runoff and soil loss was high on both soils. The contrasting hydrological behavior of these two soils is due to differences in soil characteristics such as crusting, sealing and low structural stability in Alfisols; and the presence of cracks during the early season and formation of micro-cracks during rainless periods in Vertisols. The results suggest that the information from the long-term hydrological studies is useful for determining appropriate soil and water management practices and strategies in different rainfall regions.

This paper presents measurements of soil, plant and total evaporation from millet crops grown during 1985, 1986 and 1987 at the \{ICRISAT\} Sahelian Center, Sadoré, Niger. Total evaporation was measured using an eddy correlation technique, transpiration using a porometer, and soil evaporation using micro-lysimeters. Soil evaporation was found to be a very important component of the crop water use, indicating that it requires explicit recognition in models of evaporation from millet. Transpiration appears to be more controlled by leaf area than stomatal conductance, which may make its prediction comparatively simple. Total evaporation, as measured by Hydra, generally agreed well with the sum of the independently measured soil and plant evaporation. However, there remains a discrepancy at high leaf area which is thought to be due to over-estimation of transpiration as a result of poor leaf area sampling in a very heterogeneous canopy. Data on total evaporation for three seasons 1985, 1986 and 1987 indicate that accurate prediction of evaporation from rainfed millet may not be achievable using the conventional crop coefficient approach. However, there is potential for developing a simple model which recognises soil and plant evaporation separately for a better prediction of both evaporation and crop yield. "

To explore the performance of pearl millet (Pennisetum typhoides S. and H., cv.

In each experiment, half of the crop was irrigated, while the other half received no water after panicle initiation. For irrigated millet, radiation use efficiency (RUE) did not vary significantly (P = 0.05) for the three experiments (1.7 g MJ−1). \{RUE\} of non-irrigated millet was significantly reduced (0.8 g MJ−1) only during the season with the highest temperature. Radiation interception as a function of thermal time was similar in the irrigated and non-irrigated treatments except in the season with the highest temperatures, when radiation interception was reduced about 25% in the non-irrigated relative to the irrigated treatment. Stem extension of non-irrigated millet did not decline relative to irrigated millet, despite the almost complete extraction of plant available water in the upper 30 cm of the soil, except during the season with the highest temperatures, when stem extension rates began to decline as soon as water was withheld. Under high air temperatures and saturation vapor pressure deficits, dry matter accumulation in both irrigated and non-irrigated millet during \{GS\} 2 could be reasonably predicted from \{RUE\} and radiation interception.

Of the six actinomycetes, CAI-13, CAI-85, CAI-93, CAI-140 and CAI-155 produced siderophores; CAI-13, CAI-93, CAI-155 and KAI-180 produced chitinase; CAI-13, CAI-140, CAI-155 and KAI-180 produced lipase; CAI-13, CAI-93, CAI-155 and KAI-180 produced protease; and CAI-13, CAI-85, CAI-140 and CAI-155 produced ß-1-3-glucanase whereas all the six actinomycetes produced cellulase, hydrocyanic acid and indole acetic acid (IAA). The actinomycetes were able to grow in NaCl concentrations of up to 8%, at pH values between 7 and 11, temperatures between 20 and 40 °C and compatible with fungicide bavistin at field application levels. In the rice field, the actinomycetes significantly enhanced tiller numbers, panicle numbers, filled grain numbers and weight, stover yield, grain yield, total dry matter, root length, volume and dry weight over the un-inoculated control. In the rhizosphere, the actinomycetes also significantly enhanced total nitrogen, available phosphorous, % organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen and dehydrogenase activity over the un-inoculated control. Sequences of 16S rDNA gene of the actinomycetes matched with different Streptomyces species in \{BLAST\} analysis. Of the six actinomycetes, CAI-85 and CAI-93 were found superior over other actinomycetes in terms of \{PGP\} properties, root development and crop productivity. qRT-PCR analysis on selected plant growth promoting genes of actinomycetes revealed the up-regulation of \{IAA\} genes only in CAI-85 and CAI-93.

The genetic base of the cultivated groundnut is very narrow as a result of the genetic bottleneck associated with recent polyploidization which makes it critical to determine the levels of genetic diversity within available germplasm collections prior to breeding. In groundnut, the use of \{SSRs\} for diversity assessment may offer the potential to reveal genetic variation within the genome of the cultivated species. An alternative bioinformatics, or in silico approach, to identifying \{SSRs\} suitable for application in cultivated groundnut is presented, as a low-cost alternative to wet lab \{SSR\} identification. All available nucleotide sequences from species within the aeschynomenoid/dalbergoid and genistoid clades of the Leguminosae family were searched for \{SSR\} motifs and primers designed from 109 unique SSRs. Representative accessions from six genera within the aeschynomenoid/dalbergoid and genistoid clades were selected for assessing SSR-transferability rates. In total, 60% of the total cross-genera transfer testing reactions gave prominent and reproducible amplicons, with 51 of the 109 \{SSRs\} amplifying in A. hypogaea. These 51 \{SSRs\} were further tested against 27 diverse Arachis accessions and 18 revealed polymorphism, demonstrating that the in silico approach to \{SSR\} identification and development is a valid strategy in lesser-studied crops.

Yield trade-offs between species are evaluated by plotting the normalised yields of the two competing crops on a graph. The resulting shape of the curve passing through the scatter of mean treatment-yield observations indicates the nature of the relationship between the crops: complementary, if the curve is convex; competitive, if concave, and independent or one where the competitive ability of both species is the same, if the estimated relationship is a straight line between the sole crop yields. A ‘global’ index of biological productivity is defined as the ratio of the area under the curve to the area under the straight line joining the sole crop yields. The procedure for the index's computation is described, the index estimated over a range of intercropping situations, and its implications for experimental research and extension are discussed. The proposed index is similar to the Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) in its interpretation but overcomes some of the weaknesses of the LER. "

Prediction of changes in geographical distribution and population dynamics of insect pests will be useful for adapting pest management strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on crop production. Pest outbreaks might occur more frequently, particularly during extended periods of drought, followed by heavy rainfall. Some of the components of pest management such as host-plant resistance, biopesticides, natural enemies, and synthetic chemicals will be rendered less effective as a result of the increase in temperatures and \{UV\} radiation, and decrease in relative humidity. The rate of insect multiplication might increase with an increase in \{CO2\} and temperature. Thus climate change might change the population dynamics of insect pests differently in different agro-ecosystem and ecological zones. Therefore, there is a need to take a concerted look at the likely effects of climate change on crop protection and devise appropriate measures to mitigate the effects of climate change on food security.

To compare the available alternate \{CMS\} systems for grain mold resistance, 72 hybrids were produced by crossing 36 A-lines (six \{CMS\} systems; A1, A2, A3, A4(M), A4(G), A4(VZM) each in six nuclear backgrounds) with two common restorers, and were evaluated during the 2006 and 2007 rainy seasons in grain mold nursery at ICRISAT. Data analyses indicated influence of cytoplasm on the responses of hybrids to grain mold infection as measured by panicle grain mold resistance (PGMR) score. The \{A1\} cytoplasm seemed to contribute to grain mold resistance followed by A4(VZM) and \{A2\} cytoplasms. The A4(M) cytoplasm had superior general combining ability (GCA) effects while the \{A1\} and A4(VZM) cytoplasm based hybrids had superior specific combining ability (SCA) effects on the \{PGMR\} score. Almost all hybrids had significant mid-parent heterosis. The \{A1\} cytoplasm is the best suited for the development of sorghum hybrids for the rainy season adaptation with grain mold resistance.

Flower/pod removal treatments comprised a control with no flower/pod removal, lower-plant flower and pod removal at full flowering and 18 days later (EL), allowing pods to develop only on the top-3 nodes of the main stem, and flower/pod removal 18 days after full flowering only (L). The \{EL\} and L treatments were applied to \{ICPL\} 87 and only the \{EL\} treatment to \{ICPL\} 151. Seed yield of the top-3 nodes was increased by the \{EL\} treatment for both cultivars under rainfed and irrigated conditions, but was not significantly affected by the L treatment. With flower/pod removal, increased yields of the top-3 nodes were due to increases in the pod density and/or the seed size, with little change in the number of seeds pod−1. Foliar fertilization of cultivar \{ICPL\} 87 with solutions containing N, P, K and S in similar proportions to those found in developing seeds at 20 and 40 kg N ha−1, had no significant effects on yield or yield components under either soil moisture condition. Factors within the plant during early reproductive growth appear to limit seed yield under both soil moisture conditions, and reproductive sink capacity and nutrient (N, P, K and S) supply, apparently, are not limiting. Such information on plant factors limiting yield under water stress conditions allows for a better understanding of drought resistance mechanism(s) for short-duration pigeonpea. "

abstract = "Grain growth in cereal crops is largely dependent on the availability of current photosynthates. Water deficits during flowering and grainfilling limit grain yield partly by reducing the availability of current assimilates. Drought response of breeders lines is often evaluated by screening material in drought prone environments or during the rain-free season by withholding irrigation during the desired treatment periods. The former approach is time consuming due to the erratic nature of drought patterns. In the latter approach, temperatures and daylength during the dry periods often affect crop growth and limits its use. It was therefore hypothesized that the plant photosynthetic source could be progressively destroyed in a controlled manner using a chemical desiccant or senescing agent to simulate water deficit effects. The effects of spraying the senescing agent potassium iodide (KI), at different stages before and after anthesis, on grain yield and yield components were compared with water deficit during grainfilling using four millet hybrids grown under field conditions in 1989 and 1991. The senescing agent \{KI\} reduced the chlorophyll content of the leaves more severely than did the water deficit treatment. Spraying with \{KI\} reduced grain yield, grain number and grain size. Effects of \{KI\} spraying at anthesis on grain yield and yield components were similar in both years and were similar to the effects of water deficits during grainfilling in 1989. Spraying with \{KI\} at the anthesis stage for each hybrid eliminated the confounding effects of phenology often encountered in water deficit treatment. We conclude that in pearl millet, spraying a senescing agent at anthesis is effective in simulating the reduction of current photosynthesis that occurs during posts anthesis water deficit and can be used as a screening method to evaluate genetic response to water deficit during grainfilling in the normal season.

Experiments were conducted on a Vertisol soil in peninsular India during the 1985/86 and 1986/87 postrainy seasons. Lines tested displayed a linear response of both aerial biomass and grain yield to moisture applied. Thus use of only two moisture levels, with and without irrigation, would be sufficient to compare moisture responses of chickpea in this environment. Genotypic responses were evaluated on the basis of slopes and intercepts of line-source data. Lines previously identified as drought resistant showed greatest resistance in the present study. Most test lines from breeders had relatively low drought resistance, as indicated by low intercept and intermediate to high slope. This is consistent with the test lines having been selected under different levels of supplementary irrigation in different generations. It is suggested that development of substantially improved drought resistance in this environment will require rigorous selection pressure under a given drought environment. A breeding program under natural receding soil moisture conditions in this environment is feasible because the pattern of receding soil moisture is, or can be made, similar across seasons, thus minimizing environmental variability in relation to genotypic variability.

Effects of short-term waterlogging (3 d) on shoot and root growth of short-duration pigeonpea grown on a Vertisol field were quantified, and the alleviation of waterlogging damage by top-dressing of nitrogen fertilizer was examined. Reduced leaf chlorophyll, increased senescence and abscission of lower leaves were observed within 3 d of the initiation of waterlogging. Root growth and symbiotic \{N2\} fixation were also severely impaired. Root distributions of waterlogged plants were shallower than those of the control during the subsequent recovery period because new adventitious roots were formed in the shallow rather than deep soil layer. Yield of waterlogged crops was significantly smaller than the control. Top-dressing of nitrogen at one day after the termination of waterlogging alleviated waterlogging damage either completely or partially. Leaf chlorophyll and shoot dry mass of waterlogged plants were 78 and 84% of the values in control plants immediately after waterlogging but recovered to 92 and 98% of the control values at the pod-filling stage with a top-dressing of 50 kg N ha−1. Nitrogen application promoted root growth in the shallow soil layers during the first 11 d after application, and in the deeper soil layers during the subsequent 16 d. Total nodule activity was significantly reduced by 100 kg N ha−1, but increased by 50 kg N ha−1 around one month after the top-dressing.

Leeke), and groundnut/pearl millet, were evaluated along with sole crops from 1979 to 1982, each year in nine different situations spread over different soil types and agronomic managements, with the objective of analysing the productivity and risk associated with these systems. Productivity of intercrops was closely related to the diversity of the crops involved. The two pigeonpea-based systems, with an interval of about 3 months between harvests of the crops, showed a large and consistent advantage over the respective sole crops. On the basis of land productivity, sorghum/pigeonpea averaged 49% and pigeonpea/groundnut 53% advantage over their respective sole-crop yields. In economic terms, these intercrops were also more profitable than the respective sole crops. The other two systems, with only 2–4 weeks' difference between harvests of the components, showed a much lower and less-consistent advantage. The groundnut/millet recorded 18% advantage and the sorghum/millet 7% over their respective sole crops. Risk was measured by calculating the probability of success or failure of intercrops in satisfying specified quantities of yields or income in comparison with an optimal shared sole system having some of both sole crops. Pigeonpea-based intercropping systems were less risky than shared (or optimal) sole crops over a wide range of expected yields or income. There was no advantage for the sorghum/millet intercropping compared with the shared sole crops at lower expectation, and for higher expectations sole sorghum should be preferred to the intercrop. Risk from groundnut/millet was less than from the shared sole system only in limited situations. Reduced risk of pigeonpea-based intercrops was associated with higher productivity and lower variability of combined intercrop yields or income. The methods employed in this study can be extended for risk evaluation in other intercropping and mixed systems. "

Moench] is most commonly associated with weakly parasitic root and stalk-rot fungi when the host plants are subjected to environmental stresses. The incidence of rots is generally more in high-grain-yield environments associated with high plant density or fertilizer application. The effects of time of occurrence and degree of moisture deficit stress (moisture stress) on grain and biomass yields, and the natural incidence of stalk-rots were studied. Stress during grain-filling had a greater effect on incidence of rots than stress at earlier stages. Grain-yield and disease incidence were differently affected by timing and severity of moisture stress. Stalk-rot incidence was most commonly and strongly associated with moisture stress at the terminal stage of growth. However, stress during panicle development induced changes in the sink size (grain number) or root-growth pattern, which in turn influenced both the timing and extent of stalk-rot incidence. The amount of biomass produced during the later part of the grain-filling period was positively correlated with lower disease susceptibility. The distribution index (i.e., the ratio of grain-yield to biomass produced after flowering) could be generally used to predict disease susceptibility. There were no simple correlations between biomass, grain-yield or yield components, and stalk-rot. Implications of these findings for sorghum production and for stalk-rot resistance screening are discussed. "

A linear relationship was observed between root dry weight and shoot dry weight at 35 days after sowing. The overall distribution of root length density and root dry weight among the \{RILs\} indicated that these traits are likely to be under polygenic control. The heritability of root dry weight was 0.27 and root length density was 0.23, compared to 0.49 for shoot dry weight at the same stage. The \{RILs\} exhibited a range of combinations of root size and seed yield, with a few \{RILs\} showing large root systems and high seed yield. However, there was no general correlation between seed yield and root size. High shoot biomass and harvest index contributed to high seed yield of the RILs.

Roots were sampled at 14-day intervals using a monolith method. Changes in \{LWR\} across genotypes, in general, were not significant as the genotypes had similar growth duration. With increasing age, root \{LWR\} declined gradually in the 0–10 cm depth and remained nearly unchanged in the 10–30 cm soil layer. It showed an apparent increasing trend at 30–135 cm soil depths, contrary to the observations made in other crops. Between the two seasons, root \{LWR\} was the lowest at all times and depths during the relatively wet 1992–1993 season. The changes in \{LWR\} with increasing soil depth exhibited lowest values at the soil surface with steep increases in the middle layers and a constant or declining pattern in deeper layers. There was a clear negative relationship between available soil moisture and \{LWR\} in the lower half of the rooting zone at all stages of crop growth in both years, a possible effect of oxygen deficiency caused by excessive soil water status.

Forty bulk populations and nine parental lines were evaluated in replicated trials in 1992 (F2), 1993 (F3) and 1994 (F4) at three contrasting locations in Niger. Physiological components of yield were estimated from final yield and biomass as well as data on flowering and maturity. Differences were observed among populations for pod yield and model components. The effects of locations were significant (P&lt;0.01) for C, p and \{DR\} in \{F2\} and \{F3\} but nonsignificant for yield and C in F4. Heritabilities were estimated by parent–offspring regression of \{F3\} on \{F2\} and \{F4\} on F3. Heritability estimates for C, p, \{DR\} and yield based on the F2:F3 regression were 0.10, 0.45, 0.10 and 0.16, respectively. Heritabilities based on F3:F4 regression were 0.20 for C, 0.46 for p, 0.14 for \{DR\} and 0.57 for yield.

This is caused by the lack of oxygen or anaerobiosis. Compared to aerobic soils, there is preferential accumulation of organic matter in submerged rice soils. This paper reviews the current literature to establish basis or bases for organic matter accumulation in wetland soils and sediments. The decomposition or destruction of organic materials is lessened and incomplete, and the humification of organic matter is decreased under flooded conditions. Consequently, the overall organic matter decomposition rates are slower in submerged soils than those in aerobic soils and this results in net accumulation of organic matter in soils or sites that remain flooded for several years. Also, high organic matter soils or Histosols are developed in permanently waterlogged sites or soils because the rate of organic matter destruction is slower than its accumulation. The balance between organic matter inputs and decomposition is the primary determinant of organic matter accumulation or depletion. Several hypotheses have been postulated to explain the accumulation of organic matter in submerged soils. They include the deleterious effects on microbial activity of reduction products produced such as hydrogen sulfide or volatile fatty acids and toxic concentrations of ammonia, aluminum, iron, and other cations in soil solution. The absence of electron acceptors such as iron oxides and hydroxides in submerged soils and sediments slows down organic matter oxidation and mineralization. Formation of recalcitrant complex organic molecules with organic matter fractions, e.g., through enrichment of organic matter with phenolics in intensified irrigated rice production system, may render them less available for microbial attack and utilization. Moreover, the net primary productivity of wetlands is higher than other ecosystems. There is need for further research to fully understand the mechanism(s) involved in the accumulation of organic matter in submerged soils as wetlands offer an excellent example of conservation and maintenance of organic matter and storage of organic C.

Here, we detail the oxidative damage, the antioxidant composition, and the osmoprotection achieved in transgenic plants of peanut overexpressing the AtDREB1A transgene, driven by a stress-inducible promoter (Atrd29A) when exposed to progressive water stress conditions. This study explored the biochemical mechanisms where (i) the antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APOX), and glutathione reductase (GR) accumulated in the transgenic plants at comparably higher levels than their untransformed counterparts under dry soil conditions, (ii) a significant increase in the proline levels in the transgenic plants was observed in dry soils, and (iii) a dramatic increase in the lipid peroxidation in the untransformed controls in drier soils. Most of the biochemical parameters related to the antioxidative machinery in the tested peanut transgenics were triggered by the overexpression of AtDREB1A that appeared to differ from the untransformed controls. The antioxidants showed a negative correlation with the fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW) thresholds, where the normalized transpiration rate (NTR) started decreasing in the tested plants. However, no significant relationship was observed between any of these biochemical indicators and the higher transpiration efficiency (TE) values found in the transgenic events. Our results show that changes in the antioxidative machinery in these transgenic peanut plants (overexpressing the AtDREB1A transcription factor) under water-limiting conditions played no causative role in improved TE.

This study analyses a long-term strategic experiment datasets from fifteen experiments (1981–1995) managed under different fertility levels at International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru and on-farm balanced nutrition management trials (2010–2012) in Karnataka, India to evaluate the pearl millet performance in contrasting seasons with improved agronomic management. Long-term climate variability and yield trends were analyzed using ICRISAT's weather datasets. On-farm data analysis revealed that majority of farmers’ field soils were deficient in organic carbon, available phosphorous, sulphur, zinc and boron at all the locations studied. Pearl millet grain yield and above ground dry matter was improved significantly with balanced nutrient application (NPK + S + Zn + B) in farmers’ field which were critically deficient in the soil nutrients. Even in comparatively drier years, application of balanced nutrient significantly increased grain yield and aboveground dry matter which provides resilience against drought through enhanced water productivity. Long-term experiments conducted in \{ICRISAT\} showed that nitrogen application increased grain yield and above ground dry matter in pearl millet however seasonal variability had a greater effect on yield than cultivars and applied N. Pearl millet yield was positively associated with August maximum temperature and negatively with seasonal precipitation. September precipitation &gt;125 mm which coincided with grain filling stage reduced grain yield. Benefit:cost analysis showed that balanced nutrient application of pearl millet is an economically sustainable option across the seasons. Pearl millet can be an important component of climate resilient agriculture in low production environments when managed with improved agronomic practices. "

Sweet sorghum is a \{C4\} crop valued for food, feed, fodder, fiber, and fuel. Its characteristics of rapid growth, higher biomass potential, wider adaptability to harsh agroclimatic conditions, along with its metal-absorbing property, are propelling the use of this novel feedstock in phytoremediation also. Currently, many developing countries are switching from the cultivation of traditional biofuel crops like sugarcane, corn, sugar beet, sweet potato, cassava, etc., to sweet sorghum in order to reduce gasoline imports/use. A wide range of plant growth-promoting (PGP) microbes such as Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, and Bacillus are reported not only to enhance the plant growth but also to alleviate the stress caused by \{HMs\} in plant. This chapter explores the possibilities of using sweet sorghum with \{PGP\} microbes as a phytoremediation tool to alleviate the \{HM\} stress and to enhance food-fodder-fuel security. "

Although, improved drought tolerance by \{NO\} is associated greatly with its ability to reduce stomatal opening and oxidative stress, it can immensely influence other physiological processes such as photosynthesis, proline accumulation and seed germination under water deficit. \{NO\} as a free radical can directly alter proteins, enzyme activities, gene transcription, and post-translational modifications that benefit functional recovery from drought. The present drought-mitigating strategies have focused on exogenous application of \{NO\} donors for exploring the associated physiological and molecular events, transgenic and mutant studies, but are inadequate. Considering the biphasic effects of NO, a cautious deployment is necessary along with a systematic approach for deciphering positively regulated responses to avoid any cytotoxic effects. Identification of \{NO\} target molecules and in-depth analysis of its effects under realistic field drought conditions should be an upmost priority. This detailed synthesis on the role of \{NO\} offers new insights on its functions, signaling, regulation, interactions and co-existence with different drought-related events providing future directions for exploiting this molecule towards improving drought tolerance in crop plants.

These crops, however, have a low productivity, mainly due to their exposure to several biotic and abiotic stresses in the marginal environments. Until 2005, these crops had limited genomics resources and molecular breeding was very challenging. During the last decade (2005–2015), \{ICRISAT\} led demand-driven innovations in genome science and translated the massive genome information in breeding. For instance, large-scale genomic resources including draft genome assemblies, comprehensive genetic and physical maps, thousands of \{SSR\} markers, millions of SNPs, several high-throughput as well as low cost marker genotyping platforms have been developed in these crops. After mapping several breeding related traits, several success stories of translational genomics have become available in these legumes. These include development of superior lines with enhanced drought tolerance in chickpea, enhanced and pyramided resistance to Fusarium wilt and Ascochyta blight in chickpea, enhanced resistance to leaf rust in groundnut, improved oil quality in groundnut and utilization of markers for assessing purity of hybrids/parental lines in pigeonpea. Some of these stories together with future prospects have been discussed. "

Direct seeding of rice is widely promoted in order to reduce labor demand during crop establishment stage, and to benefit poor farmers. To facilitate planning and to track farming practice changes, this study presents techniques to spatially distinguish between direct seeded and transplanted rice fields using multiple-sensor remote sensing imagery. The District of Raichur, a major region in northeast Karnataka, Central India, where irrigated rice is grown and direct seeded rice has been widely promoted since 2000, was selected as a case study. The extent of cropland was mapped using Landsat-8, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (modis) 16-day normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi) time-series data and the cultivation practice delineated using risat-1 data for the year 2014. Areas grown to rice were mapped based on the length of the growing period detected using spectral characteristics and intensive field observations. The high resolution imagery of Landsat-8 was useful to classify the rice growing areas. The accuracy of land-use/landcover (lulc) classes varied from 84 percent to 98 percent. The results clearly demonstrated the usefulness of multiple-sensor imagery from mod09q1, Landsat-8, and risat-1 in mapping the rice area and practices accurately, routinely, and consistently. The low cost of imagery backed by ground survey, as demonstrated in this paper, can also be used across rice growing countries to identify different rice systems. "

Soil fertility related degradation due to deficiencies of secondary and micronutrients mainly sulphur, boron and zinc in addition to macronutrients is mainly responsible for poor crop productivity, and along with poor hydraulic properties of Vertisols is responsible for about 2 million ha rainy season fallows. Soil health assessment of 11 districts in Madhya Pradesh, India has revealed that in most of the districts only few fields with adequate levels of sulphur, boron, zinc and phosphorus indicating their widespread low levels. Potassium was in general adequate. Farmers’ current blanket fertilization practices focused at macronutrients viz. nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium only, thus does not meet the variable soil fertility needs. Through participatory action research on soil test based fertilizer application, farmers realized benefits in crop productivity to the tune of 5 to 45% in the season of application and additional yield by 5 to 27% due to residual effects of S, B and Zn in succeeding three seasons. An economic assessment showed the balanced nutrition a profitable option in the 1st season itself. In current rainy fallow regions, the landform management as broadbed and furrow or conservation furrow along with balanced nutrition has shown that fallow lands in black soil regions in Madhya Pradesh can be successfully cultivated to grow soybean crop. In succeeding post-rainy season, the rainy season cultivated plots also yielded more as compared to adjoining plots having one crop only in post-rainy season. This study thus found that soil test based fertilization and landform management are the twin technologies for sustainable crop intensification in black soils of Central Indian region. "

The Ethiopian Government considers irrigated agriculture as a primary engine of economic growth and plans to increase the current level of irrigation infrastructure three-fold by the end of 2015. However, there has been concern regarding the performance and management of existing small-scale irrigation. Based on the assessment of 52 small-scale irrigation schemes, and three case study sites, we describe the challenges and interventions required to improve irrigation water management in Ethiopia. Though most schemes are operational, many do not operate at full capacity, due to design failures, excessive siltation, poor agronomic and water management practices, and weak local institutions. In addition to low returns, there is competition for irrigation water between upstream and downstream users, vegetable growers and cereal growers, and between farmers with large irrigable plots and those with small plots. Despite these challenges, our field assessment revealed that small scale irrigation increases crop yields, improves crop diversification, and reduces the risk of crop failure. We emphasize in this paper the need for incentives to improve productivity and minimize conflicts, while enhancing innovation capacity, developing scheme-specific intensification strategies, and promoting collective action. We also describe how benefits from water investments could be substantially increased by overcoming design constraints, strengthening water user associations, and protecting catchments. "

The present study analyzes the spatial variability of climate change impacts on groundnut yields in the Anantapur district of India and examines the relative contribution of adaptation strategies. For this purpose, a web based decision support tool that integrates crop simulation model and Geographical Information System (GIS) was developed to assist agronomic decision making and this tool can be scalable to any location and crop. The climate change projections of five global climate models (GCMs) relative to the 1980–2010 baseline for Anantapur district indicates an increase in rainfall activity to the tune of 10.6 to 25% during Mid-century period (2040–69) with \{RCP\} 8.5. The \{GCMs\} also predict warming exceeding 1.4 to 2.4 °C by 2069 in the study region. The spatial crop responses to the projected climate indicate a decrease in groundnut yields with four \{GCMs\} (MPI-ESM-MR, MIROC5, \{CCSM4\} and HadGEM2-ES) and a contrasting 6.3% increase with the GCM, GFDL-ESM2M. The simulation studies using CROPGRO-Peanut model reveals that groundnut yields can be increased on average by 1.0%, 5.0%, 14.4%, and 20.2%, by adopting adaptation options of heat tolerance, drought tolerant cultivars, supplemental irrigation and a combination of drought tolerance cultivar and supplemental irrigation respectively. The spatial patterns of relative benefits of adaptation options were geographically different and the greatest benefits can be achieved by adopting new cultivars having drought tolerance and with the application of one supplemental irrigation at 60 days after sowing.

abstract = "Evaporation from soil can be a major component of crop water balance and land surface energy balance. A number of different applications of the microlysimeter method to measure evaporation from soil have been used in recent studies. Microlysimeters were used extensively in three sandy soils for this study. Measurement of evaporation from microlysimeters with different dimensions and of different ages allows discussion of the sources of error inherent in the method. The evaporation recorded from microlysimeters of diameters 214 mm, 152 mm and 51 mm was not significantly different. A comparison of 100 mm and 200 mm deep microlysimeters showed that depth had no significant influence during the first 2 days after extraction from the soil profile. For periods beginning 2 or more days after rain, significant differences in evaporation owing to depth may not occur for up to 7 days. Soil cores extracted at different times showed significant differences in evaporation immediately following a rain event, and no significant differences 2 or more days thereafter. This period of significant difference was extended to about 4 days when the method was used within a crop (i.e. root extraction of water in the field significant). A protocol for use of microlysimeters is developed from these results. "

One of CA's key principles is the maintenance of soil cover often by retaining a proportion of crop residues on the field as mulch. Yet smallholder crop–livestock systems across Africa and Asia face trade-offs among various options for crop residue use. Knowledge of the potential trade-offs of leaving more residues as mulch is only partial and the objective of this research is to address some of these knowledge gaps by assessing the trade-offs in contrasting settings with mixed crop–livestock systems. The paper draws from village surveys in 12 sites in 9 different countries across Sub-Sahara Africa and South Asia. Sites were clustered into 3 groups along the combined population and livestock density gradients to assess current crop residue management practices and explore potential challenges to adopting mulching practices in different circumstances. Results show that although high-density sites face higher potential pressure on resources on an area basis, biomass production tends to be more substantial in these sites covering demands for livestock feed and allowing part of the residues to be used as mulch. In medium-density sites, although population and livestock densities are relatively lower, biomass is scarce and pressure on land and feed are high, increasing the pressure on crop residues and their opportunity cost as mulch. In low-density areas, population and livestock densities are relatively low and communal feed and fuel resources exist, resulting in lower potential pressure on residues on an area basis. Yet, biomass production is low and farmers largely rely on crop residues to feed livestock during the long dry season, implying substantial opportunity costs to their use as mulch. Despite its potential benefit for smallholder farmers across the density gradient, the introduction of CA-based mulching practices appears potentially easier in sites where biomass production is high enough to fulfil existing demands for feed and fuel. In sites with relatively high feed and fuel pressure, the eventual introduction of \{CA\} needs complementary research and development efforts to increase biomass production and/or develop alternative sources to alleviate the opportunity costs of leaving some crop residues as mulch.

The challenge is to increase production without damaging the natural resource base. Various technologies for integrated natural resource management (INRM) have been developed, but adoption has been poor, for various reasons—technical, socio-economic, and institutional. To date a great deal of past work has focused at the plot and farm level, with little farmer involvement in developing the research agenda. Work needs to be extrapolated to more sites, with greater farmer involvement in the research process, in order to answer the key question: ‘Under what conditions will rural households be encouraged to reinvest in their agroecosystems?’ Encouraging such investment involves several challenges: improving returns from such investments; creating market access for smallholder farmers; improving research–extension–farmer linkages; developing enabling policies on soil, water and biodiversity; integration of livestock–wildlife–crop systems; development of drought mitigation strategies; capacity building; better information flow; and a clearer gender perspective in research and training. A large body of successful \{INRM\} research is available from many countries in the West and in Latin America. Unfortunately much of this work is reaching sub-Saharan Africa only now, and its appropriateness to the needs of the African smallholder farmer requires verification. This paper shares some of the experiences of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), International Agricultural Research Centers (IARCs) in Africa, particularly the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT).

abstract = "Abstract Marker-assisted selection (MAS) is a method of selecting desirable individuals in a breeding program based on molecular markers with or without consideration of their trait values. This allows indirect selection of specific characteristics of a plant based on the encoding genomic region. The introduction of next-generation sequencing technology and the availability of inexpensive and high-throughput marker systems have made molecular breeding more attractive. Marker-assisted breeding strategies such as marker-assisted backcross breeding, marker-assisted recurrent selection, and genomic selection were known to be successful in crop improvement. Nonetheless, conventional breeding and \{MAS\} are not mutually exclusive, instead they complement each other in most of the breeding methods, and therefore, in true sense they constitute integrated breeding. Definition and Background: The objective of plant breeding is to identify and develop superior individual(s) with desirable traits by selection, hybridization, heterosis, or mutation. Until twentieth century, plant breeding was based on the phenotypic selection based on yield, plant architecture preference, quality traits, ease of cultivation, and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Over the years, plant breeding technologies, such as pedigree, backcrossing, recurrent selection, and progeny testing, made an impact on crop improvement. With the discovery of molecular markers during the late twentieth century, the scenario of plant breeding started changing gradually. The fact that desirable lines can be selected based on molecular markers linked to the traits, at the seedling stage in a short time period is an attractive option for plant breeders, who in general spend about 5–8 years for the varietal release. Molecular markers are used as a substitute/supplement for the phenotypic selection to alter or improve the traits for crop improvement. In the initial years, breeders were reluctant to use the markers in their routine breeding program because of the high cost associated with genotyping and nonavailability of the high-throughput genotyping platforms. Although several publications reported mapping loci for important traits since the first quantitative trait locus report in tomato in 1988, there are very few instances where marker information has been utilized in plant breeding in public sector. In fact, most of the agronomically important traits are complex and are governed by polygenes. Hence, there was a notion that there should be cautiously optimistic vision to use the molecular breeding approaches in crop improvement. "

The distance between outer rows of adjacent beds was 60 cm. Pigeonpea seed yield in the intercropping system responded to plant populations above the sole crop optimum of 40 000 plant/ha but the response for the combined yield of both crops was less because of decreasing sorghum yield. Maximum land equivalent ration and gross monetary returns were at 70 000 plants/ha for the \{SPS\} arrangement and at 40 000 plants/ha for the \{SPPS\} and \{PSSP\} arrangements. The greater number of pigeonpea rows in \{SPPS\} and \{PSSP\} produced more pigeonpea yield but less sorghum yield; this resulted in a net benefit for the \{SPPS\} arrangement though not for the \{PSSP\} arrangement. The sorghum intercrop reduced the total branch number in pigeonpea but had little effect on the number of pod-bearing branches. Intercropping also increased the harvest index of pigeonpea because the sorghum suppressed the early vegetative growth but was harvested before the reproductive phase. "

The dry matter yield advantages of intercropping compared with sole cropping ranged from 8 to 30% for the millet/groundnut systems, 0 to 19% for the sorghum/groundnut systems and 5 to 15% for the sorghum/millet system; moisture stress had no consistent effect on these dry matter advantages. For reproductive yields, all the intercropping systems showed some increase in relative advantages with increase in stress because of higher harvest indices in intercropping than in sole cropping. Largest advantages were 93% for \{SGG\} at \{S5\} moisture regime and 78% for \{MGG\} at \{S4\} moisture regime, both of these being significantly greater than advantages at S1. The level of stress giving peak advantages depended on crop combination and crop proportions. It is emphasised that all intercropping treatments were of ‘replacement’ type in which the plant population of each crop was only a proportion of that of its sole crop and total population was equivalent to that in either of the sole crops. It is suggested that if total populations in the intercrops are higher than in the sole crops then, under stress conditions, intercropping yields could well be less than sole crop yields because of increased competition for moisture.

Hence, an attempt was made to increase grain numbers by (1) increasing the length of vegetative period (to increase potential grain number per panicle and increase leaf area and light interception before flowering) by using a non-inductive long photoperiod during the early stages of crop growth, and (2) using a dwarfing gene to vary assimilate partitioning between panicle and stem prior to flowering. Extended day length delayed panicle initiation (PI) and flowering and increased leaf area index and assimilate production. Time to flowering was directly related to assimilate allocation to individual panicles, and to grain number per panicle. Delayed PI, however, reduced panicle numbers. Dwarf hybrids partitioned more assimilates to panicles and less to stems, which was also associated with more grains per panicle. The increase in grain number per panicle was offset by decrease in panicles per plant so that neither longer vegetative stage nor dwarfing gene caused in increase in grain yield. With increase in grain numbers per panicle in the dwarfs, grain density (grains cm−2 surface area of panicle) also increased resulting in the dwarf hybrids producing smaller grains and failing to benefit from the increased grain numbers per ear.

However, if they are harvested by ratooning or by picking the pods, the plants go on to produce a second flush of pods, which matures around March. In experiments conducted in four growing seasons at \{ICRISAT\} Center, second harvest yields were usually greater for non-ratooned than ratooned plants, and in experiments conducted on Vertisols they were greater for the plants ratooned high up in the plant than for those cut closer to the ground. Second harvest yields of non-ratooned plants without irrigation on Alfisols were on average 66% of the first harvest yields, but on Vertisols only 37%, in spite of the greater water-holding capacity of the latter. On Alfisols second harvest yields were approximately doubled by a single irrigation, but there was less response to irrigation on Vertisols. The poorer second harvest yields on Vertisols may have been due to the damaging effects of soil cracking on the root system of the plants. In non-ratooned plants from which the first and second flushes of pods were harvested together, yields were less than the total yield obtained from non-ratooned plants in two harvests, even though the yield loss, mainly due to pod shattering, was as little as 4% in one year. The taking of second harvests from pigeonpeas grown on Alfisols may have considerable potential as a method of obtaining additional yield for little extra cost. "

The wilt incidence in a continuous sole pigeonpea treatment was 64% in the year 1981 and 80–90% or more in the remaining three years. One-year breaks of sorghum and fallow produced substantial reductions in wilt incidence in the following pigeonpea crop. After two cycles of break crop followed by pigeonpea, wilt incidence was only 16% in the sorghum rotation and 31% in the fallow rotation. Averaged over these two cycles, pigeonpea seed yields were increased from only 93 kg/ha to 340 and 495 kg/ha after the sorghum and fallow breaks, respectively. A break with tobacco caused less reduction in wilt incidence than with other break crops, but pigeonpea yield was increased to 398 kg/ha. A one-year break of cotton or one year of a wilt-resistant line of pigeonpea delayed wilt development, but did not reduce final wilt incidence or significantly afftect yield. Wilt incidence increased again in the second successive pigeonpea crop ater a one-year sorghum break, although it was still significantly less than that in the continuous pigeonpea. After a two-year sorghum break, the effects lasted longer, the wilt incidence being only 24% in the second successive pigeonpea crop. Intercropping with sorghum produced a large reduction in wilt incidence in pigeonpea in the first year (down to 55%) and thereafter it stabilised at about 20–30%. Although intercropped pigeonpea yields were greater than the partial yields normally expected in intercropping, they were no higher than the sole crop yields. The reduced wilt incidence due to a sorghum intercrop was found to be consistent across 14 susceptible pigeonpea genotypes grown in another experiment, but did not occur with maize as the intercop.

During early growth in both irrigation treatments, the resistant lines had slower shoot and root growth rates, slower soil water-extraction rates, but higher root: shoot ratios than the susceptible lines, which may have been responsible for their higher leaf water-potentials in the stress treatment. Dry-matter production per unit of water transpired was also lower in the resistant lines. As drought became more severe, there was greater leaf death in the susceptible lines. In all lines, panicle initiation was delayed by mid-season drought stress, but once it did start, the length of the reproductive period was increased in the resistant lines but decreased in the susceptible. In both treatments, the resistant lines within each maturity group had higher grain-yield than the susceptible lines; in the stress treatment this was largely due to better grain-set and tillering.

abstract = "Growth and resource use data are presented for the sole crops and an intercrop of an 82-day millet and 105-day groundnut. The intercrop row arrangement was 1 millet: 3 groundnut and the within-row spacing of each crop was the same in sole crop and intercrop. In groundnut, yield/plant and yield components were similar in intercropping and sole cropping. In millet, on a per plant basis the dry matter accumulation, leaf area development and tiller production were all substantially greater in intercropping compared with sole cropping; final seed yield/plant was just over twice as high in intercropping, this being achieved by increases in heads/plant and seeds/head. Calculated on the basis of a Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) intercropping gave 28% more total dry matter (LER = 1.28) and 26% more reproductive yield (LER = 1.26) than growing the two crops separately; both these yield increases were statistically significant. There were even greater increases in the total leaf area index of the combined intercrop canopy (maximum \{LER\} = 1.39) but increases in the total root length of the combined rooting system were rather smaller (maximum \{LER\} = 1.18). The higher intercrop yield appeared to be achieved by an increased efficiency in converting light energy into dry matter and not by any increase in the amount of light energy intercepted. It is suggested that this increased efficiency may have been because the combined intercrop canopy resulted in light being more efficiently spread over a greater surface of leaf. Total water use was rather higher in intercropping and the total water use efficiency was improved because a greater proportion of the water was used by the crop rather than lost as evaporation from the soil surface. The \{LER\} values for total uptake of N, P and K in intercropping were 1.25, 1.28 and 1.26, respectively, indicating that the higher yield in intercropping was associated with a commensurately greater uptake of nutrients.

Using a non-nodulating groundnut genotype (Non-nod) or sorghum as controls for soil N uptake, the amounts of \{N2\} fixed by the nodulated groundnut genotypes were estimated to be 183–190 kg N/ha. Nitrogen fertilization increased harvest index and percentage N translocated to seeds in sorghum genotypes, but decreased harvest index and had variable effects on percentage N translocated to seed in groundnut genotypes. Leaf nitrate reductase activity (NRA) and nitrate content in the leaves of two sorghum genotypes, one nodulating, and ‘Non-nod’ groundnut genotypes were also compared. The concentration of nitrate was lower in sorghum than in groundnut leaves, but \{NRA\} was higher in sorghum. It is suggested that either \{NRA\} in the groundnut leaves has relatively lower affinity for the substrate (higher Km, the Michaelis-Menton constant) or higher nitrate is required for the induction of nitrate reductase in groundnut than in sorghum.

African parent-age occurs in nearly all of the advanced breeding products of the \{ICRISAT\} program.

Where water deficit was imposed earlier in crop growth and then relieved, the time of termination of stress from flowering determined the extent of grain yield loss. Water stress relieved at anthesis or early grain filling had little adverse effect on the grain yield because additional tillers produced panicles. This response by tillers was less evident and grain yields were more severely reduced when water stress was not relieved until after flowering. When stress was imposed late in crop growth and not relieved, the time of initiation of stress was directly related to the extent of loss in grain yield. Thus susceptibility to mid-season drought stress was related to the time stress was terminated and in late-season drought to the time stress was initiated. "

Experiments were conducted during three post-rainy seasons on a Vertisol (a typic pallustert) to study the effect of water deficits on radiation use, radiation use efficiency (RUE), transpiration and transpiration efficiency (TE) of chickpea. Different levels of soil water availability were created, either by having irrigated and non-irrigated plots or using a line source. Biomass production was linearly related to both cumulative intercepted solar radiation and transpiration in both well watered and water deficit treatments. Soil water availability did not affect \{RUE\} (total dry matter produced per unit of solar radiation interception) when at least 30% of extractable soil water (ESW) was present in the rooting zone, but below 30% ESW, \{RUE\} decreased linearly with the decrease in soil water content. \{RUE\} was also significantly correlated (R2 = 0.61, P &lt; 0.01) with the ratio of actual to potential transpiration (T/Tp) and it declined curvilinearly with the decrease in T/Tp. \{TE\} decreased with the increase in saturation deficit (SD) of air. Normalization of \{TE\} with \{SD\} gave a conservative value of 4.8 g kPa kg−1. To estimate biomass production of chickpea in different environments, we need to account for the effect of plant water deficits on \{RUE\} in a radiation-based model and the effect of \{SD\} on \{TE\} in a transpiration-based model.

These data were combined with measurements of leaf area index to calculate canopy conductance. Because of the low leaf area (maximum 1.3), canopy conductances were low and varied both diurnally and seasonally. Transpiration was calculated using the above canopy conductance values using the Penman-Monteith and Shuttleworth-Wallace models. In comparison to the Shuttleworth-Wallace model, it was found that the Penman-Monteith equation underestimated transpiration when the soil was dry and overestimated it when the soil was wet. These differences in transpiration arise because of the modification of the in-canopy vapour pressure deficit caused by heat and water vapour fluxes from the soil, a mechanism which is only present in the Shuttleworth-Wallace model.

The main objective was to quantify the changes in microclimate in intercrop and to relate these changes to the performance of the component crops in terms of growth and yield. Major changes in microclimate of intercrop were in the wind speed and the relative duration of leaf wetness. Reduction in wind speed just above the groundnut crop was dependent on the height of the pearl millet canopy. Wind speed was reduced by 50% at 35 days after sowing (DAS) in 1985 and by 70% at 60 \{DAS\} in 1987. Leaf wetness duration of the groundnut was increased by intercropping but this appeared to have little effect on defoliation. The effect of temperature on crop development was estimated by calculating thermal time. This showed that the intercropped groundnut developed 2.5–2.8 days earlier than sole groundnut. The effect of saturation deficit on crop growth was small. Intercropping increased the radiation use efficiency of groundnut by 21–35%. Yield loss from foliar diseases of groundnut was 37–40% in 1985, negligible in 1986 and 33–35% in 1987. However, intercropping appeared to have no significant effect on the severity of foliar disease in groundnut, largely because defoliation occurred after the pearl millet was harvested. Therefore the grain yield of intercrop sprayed with fungicide was similar to that of the unsprayed control. The land equivalent ratio of the intercrop ranged from 1.67 in 1985 to 0.94 in 1987. The discussion highlights differences between observations made during the rainy and post-rainy seasons. "

We tested an early onset of rains treatment (imposed with supplemental irrigations) with the natural onset of rains. In 1986, natural onset was early while in 1987 it was considerably late. In both the seasons, dry matter production of millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.) in the early onset of rains treatment reached 7 t ha−1 while late onset of rains resulted in only 3 t ha−1. Data on soil water profiles showed that at the time of the millet harvest in the early rains treatment, profile soil water is adequate to establish a second crop of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) for hay. This enables efficient exploitation of soil moisture. In addition, the combined water use of the two crops in the early rains treatment was much higher. Results of this study suggest that by tailoring management tactics to weather conditions, in years with early onset of rains it is possible to establish a second crop of cowpea for hay in the Sahelian zone where the farmers traditionally grow only millet. The implications of the suggested methodology for other climatic zones in West Africa and its limitations are discussed. "

Aflatoxin not only affects crop production but renders the produce unfit for consumption and harmful to human and livestock health, with stringent threshold limits of acceptability. In many crops, breeding for resistance is not a reliable option because of the limited availability of genotypes with durable resistance to Aspergillus. Understanding the fungal/crop/environment interactions involved in aflatoxin contamination is therefore essential in designing measures for its prevention and control. For a sustainable solution to aflatoxin contamination, research must be focused on identifying and improving knowledge of host–plant resistance factors to aflatoxin accumulation. Current advances in genetic transformation, proteomics, \{RNAi\} technology, and marker-assisted selection offer great potential in minimizing pre-harvest aflatoxin contamination in cultivated crop species. Moreover, developing effective phenotyping strategies for transgenic as well as precision breeding of resistance genes into commercial varieties is critical. While appropriate storage practices can generally minimize post-harvest aflatoxin contamination in crops, the use of biotechnology to interrupt the probability of pre-harvest infection and contamination has the potential to provide sustainable solution.

A measurement campaign was therefore carried out in 1997 to monitor windblown sediment fluxes using Big Spring Number Eight (BSNE) sand-traps in a conventionally managed cultivated field and bush fallow in western Niger. Sediment balances were derived from the measured windblown sediment mass fluxes. Results indicate that sediment fluxes in a cultivated field increased linearly over distances up to 76 m irrespective of wind speed and duration. Sediment deposition over distances up to 47 m in an adjacent bush fallow was well described by an exponential decay function with a near constant trapping efficiency coefficient of 0.11 m−1 for incoming sediment mass fluxes between 10 and 45 kg m−1. Soil mass balances up to −17.5 and +10.5 Mg ha−1 were measured in a single storm in the field and fallow, respectively. However, 89% of the sediment deposition observed in the fallow occurred within the first 20 m. The nutrient content of windblown sediment generally declined with distance into the field and increased with distance into the bush fallow. Because of the low nutrient content of the native soil, total nutrient losses remained very low (&lt;163 mg m−2 for any given nutrient). However, such losses were by no means negligible compared to the average nutrient uptake by a millet crop. The present measurements confirm that wind erosion can result in substantial soil losses in traditionally managed fields on the sandy soil of the Sahel. The bulk of sediment transport is, however, predominantly short range as the saltating material is efficiently trapped by the natural vegetation of fallow land. "

The resulting decorticated dry split cotyledons (dhal) and powder fractions were then analyzed for protein, sugar, starch, fiber, minerals, and amino acids. Protein, soluble sugar, and ash of dhal (scarified cotyledons) fraction decreased with increasing dehulling time, but starch content increased. Considerable amounts of calcium, iron, and zinc were removed by dehulling for 4 min. This time is assumed to be an equivalent of traditional dehulling in terms of quantitative losses of powder fraction. No notable differences were observed in the amino acids of dhal and powder fractions of cotyledons dehulled for different intervals. Albumin and glutelin fractions were considerably reduced due to dehulling, while the globulin fraction increased. It is concluded that the dehulling process (4 min) would incur considerable losses in protein, calcium, iron, and zinc, whereas it would not adversely affect the protein quality in terms of amino acids.

One of the central problems of groundnut production and processing is huge inefficiencies due to an uncertain production environment owing to rainfed cultivation, the low resource base of smallholder farmers and processors, and the low adoption rates of improved technology. This paper addresses critical issues that impair the groundnut sector’s international competitiveness and efficiency. The paper uses primary data collected from Indian farmers and processors of groundnuts to measure efficiency, and it suggests policies for reducing yield gaps and increasing efficiency. Specific policies suggested from the study are (a) the harnessing of improved varieties with attributes like drought tolerance, high oil content, high productivity for large-scale seed multiplication and distribution by public and private agencies; (b) viable village seed banks and seed networks through cycles of post-rainy season seed multiplication to meet the seed requirements in the rainy season and vice versa; (c) adoption of low-cost technologies to increase profitability and reduce risk; (d) oilseed clusters to facilitate scale and scope economies in processing units; and (e) capital subsidies to accelerate technological upgrading to shed inefficiency in the processing sector. The expected gains in efficiency in the production and processing of oilseeds are expected to result in producer and consumer gains which would justify the proposed incentives for seeds and for technological upgrading in the processing sector.

Other, sometimes more effective and efficient (and often more enjoyable and elegant) models are available. The historical, and seemingly unwarranted, escalation of organisational commitment to the provision of agricultural \{DSSs\} appears to have been based on a fundamental category mistake of confusing process models (for professional research) with model-based \{DSSs\} (intended as a guide to practical action). This escalation of commitment has had substantial implications for the design and implementation of both modelling and \{DSS\} projects, and has precluded the development of distinctive criteria for evaluating \{DSS\} success. Design issues for \{DSSs\} include: the need for an analytical phase in \{DSS\} development to deconstruct professional models; resolution, validation and appropriateness in relation to intended purpose, in order to avoid over-engineered solutions; its contribution to communication practice; and the role of professional responsibility.

This study was undertaken to assess farmers' perceptions and management practices with FYM, particularly in relation to the use of manufactured fertilizers. Survey results indicated that farmers perceive \{FYM\} to be a complement to fertilizer rather than a substitute. Partly in response to the limited availability of both fertilizer and FYM, farmers' principal management strategy has been to concentrate inputs on irrigated areas and important rainfed, income-generating crops. Combined applications of \{FYM\} and fertilizer has become an increasingly common practice. However, the largest proportion of cultivated area still receives little or no soil amendments. "

Biodiesel C replacement in the fossil fuel was 230 kg ha−1. Besides adding biomass to the soil, and C replacement in fossil fuel; the standing Jatropha rendered ecosystem service by fixing 5100–6100 kg ha−1 C as the aboveground plus belowground biomass.

Observations were also made in a fallow subjected to 9 years of intense and uncontrolled mixed grazing, and in a site that had been protected from grazing for 15 years. The topsoil was sampled (at depths of 0–2, 2–6, 6–14 and 14–30 cm) below shrub canopy in herbaceous vegetation and in bare soil patches within each of 20 paddocks for determination of pH, organic C, and total N and P concentrations. Soil bulk density was measured in a subset of soil profiles. The areal extent of different types of soil crusts and other soil surface features was assessed in one-half of the paddocks. Grazing resulted in a reduction (p&lt;0·01) and fragmentation of the area of crusted soils. However, this trend was partially compensated for by an increase of newly formed crusts. As a result, the soil infiltration index slightly increased with moderate grazing, but decreased at higher stocking rates. Compaction due to trampling was observed in the topsoil beneath the shrub canopy and also in vegetated patches, but only under intense grazing pressure. Soil bulk density was not affected by grazing except for an increase observed below 10 cm depth at the understorey of shrubs which is therefore unlikely due to trampling. When compared to the ungrazed control, pH, organic C and N concentrations, and to lesser extent P concentration, decreased after 4 years of grazing. Soil P and pH further decreased after 9 years of very high grazing pressure. However, neither N nor organic C decreased further. "

abstract = "Several grain and malt quality tests were applied to 22 sorghum cultivars, 17 with a white or yellow pericarp and five with brown grain. Significant differences between cultivars were found in all cases. The yellow- and white-grained sorghums showed a relationship between milling energy and both extract and grain nitrogen content, although significant correlations were not observed when all cultivars were analysed. The reduction in milling energy due to malting correlated significantly with the amount of nitrogen extracted, leading to a close relationship between soluble nitrogen ratio and malt milling energy, especially in white and yellow sorghums. All white- and yellow-grained cultivars, with high levels of extract, showed a higher grinding resistance for a given level of milling energy. This may derive from a greater degree of starch damage during milling, facilitating solubilisation of starch and partly overcoming problems associated with poor endosperm modification during malting and high gelatinisation temperature of unmodified starch granules.

This paper focuses on the eight countries of the West African Sahel and discusses the implication of the lack of a critical mass of indigenous scientists in national programmes for conducting adaptive research on existing technologies or generating new ones for the particular situations of the region. The problems associated with these programmes are presented in the light of the number and calibre of personnel in agricultural research, the place of agriculture in national development, and the impact of foreign technical assistance. Measures for improving the domestic capacity of national programmes especially as they relate to training, are discussed. Regionalisation and networking programmes are also suggested as possible alternatives. "

abstract = "Abstract Soil fertility is a major constraint to agricultural development in most of the Sahel, with P being the most limiting nutrient for millet production on acid sandy soils. To address this issue, microdose applications of P fertilizer have been widely advocated in recent years. However, little is known regarding the effect of farmer management practices and environmental factors on millet's yield response to this technique. For this purpose, 276 farmer demonstrations were setup across a 3-year period in the Fakara region, western Niger. Five strata were considered based on antecedent organic manure management (corralling or transported manure). At each demo site, conventional management was compared to basal microdose fertilizer application of \{DAP\} (2 g hill−1), \{NPK\} (6 g hill−1), or \{DAP\} (2 g hill−1) with urea (1 g hill−1) applied at tillering. Millet grain yields on control plots were low (84% &lt; 400 kg ha−1), reflecting the unfavorable environmental conditions of the area. On average, the application of DAP, \{NPK\} and \{DAP\} + urea increased grain yields by 43, 46 and 69 kg ha−1 (2001–2002). A positive response to microdose fertilization was observed for 92% of the sites where yields on control plots were &lt;100 kg ha−1 but only for 32% of the sites where yields on control plots were &gt;500 kg ha−1. In particular, the positive response to microdosing increased with later sowing given that late sowing tended to reduce yields on control plots. Higher rainfall during the early growing season favored a positive response to microdosing. On average over \{DAP\} and \{DAP\} + urea, 36% of the demonstrations had value-cost ratios (VCR) &lt; 1. However, for low yielding control plots (&lt;200 kg grain ha−1), 26% of the demonstrations had \{VCR\} &lt; 1, whereas for high yielding plots (&gt;400 kg grain ha−1), 55% had a \{VCR\} &lt; 1. Not accounting for labor, \{DAP\} and \{DAP\} + urea had similar economic returns. The use of \{NPK\} could not be recommended as the cost per unit P is 3 times higher than DAP. It appears that, for the Fakara study area, microdosing may best be targeted to areas with low expected yields. In particular, it may serve as a famine mitigation strategy in case of late sowing. Nevertheless, for poorly endowed areas such as the Fakara, the economic risk associated with microdosing (2 g \{DAP\} hill−1) appears higher than has hitherto been reported and widespread adoption may not be warranted without institutional support.

The simple assumption is that deeper and more profuse root systems could tap extra water from the soil profile and alleviate drought effects. However, after decades of research, success in breeding cultivars with improved root systems is lagging behind. Here, we attempt to analyze the possible reasons for this, and re-focus on what root traits might provide the most promising avenues for drought adaptation. We approach the root system from the angle of water extraction, using data from a lysimetric system that allows monitoring and comparing plant water use over the entire crop life cycle and yield, and analyze whether and how differences in water extraction lead to improved yield across different crops. The main message from that analysis is that water extraction during reproduction and grain filling is critical and comes from a number of traits that influence the rate at which plant use the available water before and during stress. Roots may have an effect on this, not from the traditionally thought density or depth, but rather from their hydraulic characteristics. Plants can indeed control water use by controlling leaf area development and this is a “long term” control. Plants also control water losses by controlling stomata opening under high vapor pressure deficit (VPD) conditions, in a transient manner. Both processes (leaf development and stomata opening) are mostly controlled by hydraulic processes. The role of roots in drought adaptation could be there, along with the soil, in setting an hydraulic environment that allow plants to use water in a way that allow maximizing water use for these critical stages.

The cause of this phenomenon in sorghum has long been questioned and is often attributed to the effects of low night temperatures during this period. Monthly sowings, from December to March, in greenhouse compartments with two contrasting night temperatures and under field conditions with contrasting soil conditions were conducted over two years near Bamako, Mali, with three contrasting sorghum varieties. Dates of panicle initiation, rates of leaf primordia initiation at the stem apex, and rates of leaf appearance were observed. In the greenhouse, colder night temperatures were found to have no effect on prolonging vegetative-phase duration when measured in thermal time and on plant development. Although a prolonged vegetative phase and prostrate forms were observed under field conditions, these were not observed in the greenhouse experiments despite having similar temperature conditions. Although the higher soil fertility of the potting soil increased the development rates slightly, and reduced the vegetative phase relative to natural soil conditions in the field, this difference between greenhouse and field growth remained when a comparison was made between plants grown in pots. Thus, it appears that the greenhouse glass had masked the \{UV\} component of sunlight, which would mediate the cue responsible for the delayed flowering and modified morphogenesis. This cue, which has strongly contrasting effects between October and November sowings, could be the daily changes in the sunrise and sunset hour that have negative values from November to July. "

In greenhouse screening, sorghum plants were spray-inoculated at the 6–8 leaf stage with a conidial suspension (4 × 105 conidial ml−1) of C. graminicola. Inoculated plants were incubated in a high humidity chamber (⩾ 90% RH) for 24 h at 25–28°C and relocated to a greenhouse at 25 ± 2°C. Anthracnose development was scored 7–8 days after inoculation. In the field-screening technique, in every fifth row, a highly anthracnose-susceptible sorghum line was sown as an infector row. Ten days later, test lines were sown between infector row plants were inoculated at the 6–8 leaf stage with either spore suspension or by dropping infected sorghum grains into the leaf whorl. High humidity was provided by frequent overhead sprinkler or furrow irrigation. Test lines were scored for anthracnose development at the hard-dough stage. Significant positive correlation (r = 0.88, P &lt; 0.001) was found for anthracnose severity between seedling screening in greenhouse and adult plant screening in the field. The field-screening technique was successfully transferred to several locations in Africa and India. Thirty lines were selected from more than 13 000 sorghum germplasm accessions and advanced breeding lines screened for anthracnose resistance, using the field-screening technique at Pantnagar (North India) between 1982 and 1991. They were evaluated in multilocational tests at hot spots in Burkina Faso, India, Nigeria, Zambia, and Zimbabwe for 1–10 years.

To be effective, this strategy must be integrated with the theory of indirect selection. Environments which group together should reflect commonality of genotypic discrimination and therefore give rise to similar selection among genotypes. Four strategies for classifying environments were compared. These were based on untransformed and three forms of transformed data (coded, standardised and rank). The comparison assessed how effectively the groups of environments formed by using each transformation maximised the opportunity for exploiting indirect selection between environments within the same group relative to environments in other groups. The objective in this study was to identify groups of international environments, used by \{CIMMYT\} in its international nursery program, which gave high indirect response to selection for grain yield in six Australian environments. Generally the four classification strategies identified subsets of international environments for which selection gave a greater indirect response than that for selection on average performance across all of the international environments (35% to 94% on average over all Australian environments). Environmental classifications based on the standardised and rank transformations were generally superior to those based on the untransformed and coded transformations (46% on average over all Australian environments). The magnitude of this advantage differed between the Australian environments but was substantial for the two environments which expressed the greatest opportunity for exploiting indirect selection. These results have obvious and large implications for the use of classification methodology to structure regional testing regimes for plant breeding programs. "

An association between leaf-rolling and degree of resistance based on this method of selection had previously been observed, prompting this study to identify the physiological contribution of characteristics at the leaf level to mid-season drought resistance. During the drought period, the resistant lines showed more leaf-rolling than the susceptible lines, reducing the effective area of the uppermost leaves by about 75%. Leaf-rolling in the resistant lines occurred over a very narrow range of leaf water-potentials (−2.0 to −2.2 MPa) compared to the susceptible lines. The strong correlation between the light-extinction coefficient k and leaf-rolling indicated that changes in k over the season were in part due to differing abilities of the lines to roll their leaves. However, expected differences in leaf temperature between lines due to radiation shedding were not found. Lines exhibiting leaf-rolling had higher leaf conductances, although transpiration rates per unit leaf area were similar. It is suggested that leaf-rolling may alter the leaf surface microclimate so that stomata may remain open and growth continue without associated high rates of water loss. "

Five diets consisting of Pennisetum glaucum (PG), Vigna unguiculata (VU), Acacia trachycarpa (AT), Guiera senegalensis (GS) and Combretum glutinosum leaves were fed to growing sheep. The total amount and proportion of nutrients voided in faeces and urine was highly influenced by the N and P contents of the feeds, and the lignin: neutral detergent fibre, lignin:N, and polyphenol:N ratios. Sheep fed \{VU\} leaves excreted significantly more total-N than sheep fed any of the browse leaves. Feeding browse caused a general shift from faecal-soluble N (microbial and endogenous N) to faecal-insoluble N (undigested plant N). Animals fed \{VU\} leaves voided large amounts of urine N which would be susceptible to large volatilisation losses. Sheep fed browse leaves voided less urine N, and therefore produced excreta less susceptible to volatile-N losses. The estimated 45–54 kg N and 5.1–7.8 kg P ha−1 released from the various faeces would provide an important contribution to the annual requirements of millet of 36 kg N and 6.1 kg P ha−1. Selecting feeds that not only satisfy the nutrient requirements of livestock but produce animal excreta less susceptible to losses may improve nutrient cycling in mixed farming systems of semi-arid West Africa.

Because of the seasonality of rainfed farming, weed control is often late and incomplete, resulting in considerable losses in crop yield. We examined the case of weed control in continuously cultivated pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (l.) R. Br.) on a sandy soil. During 3 years we evaluated the effects of pre-sowing ridging and combinations of hand and mechanical weeding powered by donkeys on: seasonal weed growth (separating within-row and between-row weeds), pearl millet yield, and labor requirements for weeding. Four weeding methods resulted in levels of weed control decreasing in the order: full field hand weeding (Wf); between-row weeding by animal traction plus additional within-row hand weeding (Wa + h); between-row weeding by animal traction (Wa); and no weeding (W0). Weeding method was the single most important factor that affected weed growth and, hence crop yields. Depending on the year, average weed dry matter at harvest ranged from 140 to 270 kg ha−1 for method Wf to 3000 to 3520 kg ha−1 for method W0. Correspondingly, the highest millet yields ranging from 279 to 1012 kg ha−1 were obtained with Wf with a total weeding labor requirement of 70.1 h ha−1. The Wa + h method required 51.8 h ha−1 and resulted in yields, depending on the year, that were 78 to 100% of the Wf method. The Wa method resulted in unchecked within-row weed growth that exceeded those in weedy check plots, and reduced crop yield to 28 to 34% of Wf. Finally, unchecked weeds reduced yield to 2 to 10% of Wf. Pre-sowing tillage reduced seasonal weed growth, increased crop yields, and was particularly effective in reducing the amount of crop weeds for the Wa weed control method. The continuous growing of millet did not change the amount of seasonal weed dry matter during the experiment. "

The soils were classified as: Hydrandept, Gibbsihumox, Eutrustox and Haplustoll and belonged, respectively, to the Honokaa, Halii, Wahiawa and Waialua soil series in Hawaii. Soils containing mostly hydrous Fe and Al oxides, thus colloids of the variable-charge type, retain ions through various types of adsorption mechanisms. As a result, certain interactions between cation adsorption and anion adsorption occur which affect the ion exchange processes and thereby the determination of the point of zero charge (PZC). In this study adsorbed phosphate increased the adsorption of cations and lowered the \{PZC\} and adsorbed Ca interfered with \{PZC\} determinations unless these were carried out with CaCl2 as supporting electrolyte. It is likely that this latter interference will have influenced the results of many earlier studies because of the very strong adsorption of Ca by oxidic colloids. In this study only part of the adsorbed Ca could be recovered from the two most highly weathered soils, by repeated extractions with NH4-acetate at pH 7. The results indicate that many soils of the tropics can be characterized effectively by their PZC's. One should be aware, however, of the effects of strongly adsorbed ions commonly present in these soils and thus use those supporting electrolytes for the \{PZC\} determinations which counteract these effects.

When plants were exposed to continuous wind or rain, most of the conidia were dispersed during the first few minutes, and the concentration of conidia then declined exponentially with time. From field observations on rain-free days, airborne concentrations of conidia tended to increase as the wind speed increased during the day and with a further increase in wind speed, concentrations decreased.

Grain yield in plots protected with 2–5 insecticide sprays (carbaryl at 500 g a.i./ha) between the half-anthesis and the dough stage was significantly higher than in untreated plots, with cost-benefit ratios &gt; 1. Plots that were not protected at half-anthesis and/or complete-anthesis, and at milk and dough stages, suffered a significant loss in yield. Bug damage spoiled the grain quality in terms of germination, 1000-grain mass, grain hardness and percentage floaters. Three to four sprays between complete-anthesis and the dough stage prevented a significant reduction in grain quality. Head bug density at half-anthesis, complete-anthesis, milk and dough stages was significantly and negatively associated with grain yield. Bug density at different stages explained 43–94% of the variance in yield. Direct effects of bug numbers at the milk stage and the indirect effects of head bug density at other stages through the milk stage contributed towards maximum reduction in yield. Maximum avoidable losses were recorded in cultivar \{ICSV\} 1 (88·6%), followed by \{CSH\} 1 (69·9%), and \{CSH\} 5 (53·9% in 1986 and 55·0% in 1987).

A review of earlier studies on nutrient balances was done to assess their relevance for researchers, policy makers, and farmers’ understanding, to manage soil fertility for sustainable crop productivity. An on-farm nutrient balance study during 1995/1996 and 1996/1997 was designed to understand nutrient balances resulting from farmers’ practices in semi-arid tropical regions of India. This diagnostic study targeted sorghum-based cropping systems and groundnut-based cropping systems in low rainfall areas of the Indian SAT. Selection of farmers for this study was done through a systematic survey and analyses of factors effecting farmers’ decision making for nutrient inputs. Intensive plot-specific nutrient input and output measurements were carried out on 53 farmers’ fields for sorghum-based systems and 45 farmers’ fields for groundnut-based system in this study. Topsoil mineral nitrogen (N) content observed in 2 years at the beginning of the crop season in two locations of Andhra Pradesh, India, was surprisingly high and exchangeable potassium (K) contents also indicated sufficient supply in most fields. Available phosphorus (P) in the majority of fields in both locations was around threshold levels, and just sufficient for most crops. The nutrient balance in sorghum-based systems indicates a moderate to higher negative balance of potassium leading to soil mining for potassium supply in these systems. Nitrogen and P balances were generally positive. Although the groundnut-based system accumulated 53% of its N requirements through BNF, negative balances of N and K were observed mainly due to low applications of these nutrients. Application of K along with options for improving \{BNF\} of groundnut are suggested. Better nodulating groundnut cultivars and efficient rhizobium strains need to be introduced. High positive balances were observed in the systems whenever commercial crops like castor and cotton were sown in the rotation. This indicates farmers’ preferences for applying excess quantities of \{FYM\} to commercially important crops even in dryland farming systems. The replenishment costs of mined nutrients annually in different cropping systems were calculated based on current market prices of inorganic fertilizers. "

Retardation of nitrification may result in less movement and transport of mineral nitrogen because of higher NH4/NO3 ratios in soils caused by retardation of nitrification. Keeping nitrogen in the ammonium form by retarding nitrification reduces movement of mineral nitrogen because ammonium is retained by soil particles and is thus less mobile. It is found that nitrapyrin inhibited nitrification of ammonium in a loamy sand soil and also reduced the amounts of nitrate leached in soil columns over 2–5 weeks. Nitrification inhibitors may effect mineralization of soil nitrogen in some situations. They can also influence immobilization of nitrogen because of persistence of ammonium, which is preferentially immobilized over nitrate by soil microorganism. Nitrification inhibitors can also influence mineralization of soil nitrogen. It is observed that nitrification inhibitors increase immobilization of N by increasing the persistence of NH4. Nitrification inhibitors also check \{NO2\} accumulation in soils and thus block fixation of \{NO2\} into organic matter. "

Two reagents, starch-iodine complex (SIC) and a mixed pH indicator, containing bromocresol purple and \{BTB\} (2:1) used earlier for the PNC-based ELISA, were compared with \{BTB\} for utilization in the PNC-based ELISA. \{SIC\} gave a slightly higher virus titre than \{BTB\} or the mixed pH indicator, but it often gave nonspecific reactions. Sodium or potassium salts of penicillin-G at 0.5 − 1.0 mg/ml and \{BTB\} at 0.2 mg/ml were found to be suitable as substrate-indicator mixture for PNC-based ELISA. The sensitivity of the \{PNC\} system was comparable to those of the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) systems in detecting MMV, PMV, and TSWV. The \{PNC\} conjugate could be used at a greater dilution than those of the \{ALP\} and \{HRP\} conjugates and the \{BTB\} substrate mixture was stable for at least 3 weeks at 4°C. Penicillin is readily available in developing countries, and at a substantially lower cost than p-nitrophenyl phosphate, the commonly used substrate for \{ALP\} in the plate ELISA.

Although differences in the areal shrinkage on the soil surface were rather small across the treatments, compaction and shading resulted in Type-1 cracking, and uncompacted and unshaded treatments produced Type-2 cracking. The equivalent diameter of \{ISUs\} was increased approximately twice by shading and three times by compaction. These differences may be attributed to: (1) structural changes during compaction; (2) structural adjustments during drying. A qualitative model of crack initiation, which explains the observed effects, has been proposed. These results have important applications in soil management. Type-1 cracking may improve infiltration and internal drainage and effective storage of water in subsurface layers. But for efficient seedling establishment. Type-2 cracking is preferred.

Soil test-based balanced nutrient application of deficient \{SBZn\} plus \{NP\} in fields in watersheds recorded 70 to 119% (2100 kg ha−1 in maize, 660 kg ha−1 in groundnut, 640 kg ha−1 in mungbean and 1070 kg ha−1 in sorghum) improvement in crop productivity along with additional returns varying from Rs 16,050/- to Rs 28,160/- ha−1 over the farmers’ practice (only NP). Landform management to alleviate waterlogging proved effective intervention to manage high clay Vertisols for higher soybean and groundnut productivity by 13 to 27% (340 to 350 kg ha−1 in soybean and 160 to 250 kg ha−1 in groundnut) over the farmers’ practice. However, the integrated approach of balanced nutrition and landform management plus improved cultivar was the best option in increasing sunflower productivity by 182% (1600 kg ha−1 in sunflower) over farmers’ management (control). Adoption of these soil-water-crop interventions in target watersheds abridged yield gaps by 12 to 96% in groundnut (160 to 1280 kg ha−1), 29 to 100% (240 to 1130 kg ha−1) in pigeonpea and 0 to 100% (0 to 1175 kg ha−1) in chickpea. The impact of watershed interventions was seen in farm-based activities like improved milk production and incomes. The watershed programs alleviated migration in the catchments by improving the five capitals viz. human, financial, social, physical and natural. "

Thus it is essential to match water supply and demand, particularly during grain-filling. Here we integrate Grime’s ecological strategies approach with traditional drought resistance/yield component frameworks describing plant responses to water deficit. We demonstrate that water use is a function of both short and longer term trade-offs between competing demands for carbon. Agricultural crop adaptation is based on escape. Rapid growth rates and high reproductive investment maximize yield, and stress is avoided through a closely regulated, climate-appropriate annual phenology. Crops have neither the resources nor morphological capacity to withstand long periods of intense water deficit. Thus, under terminal drought, yield potential is traded off against drought escape, such that drought postponing and/or tolerance traits which extend the growing season and/or divert source from reproductive sinks are maladaptive. However, these traits do play a supporting role against transient water deficits, allowing longer season cultivars to survive by mining water through deeper roots, or restricting transpiration. Recognizing these trade-offs made within escape-strategy limits will allow breeders to integrate complementary adaptive traits to transient and terminal water deficits. "

This paper reports of a study undertaken in Malawi to determine the occurrence and distribution of Aflatoxigenic Aspergilli in the soil and \{AFB1\} contamination in groundnuts. A total of 1397 groundnut samples collected from farm homesteads, local markets, warehouses and shops in 2008 and 2009 were analyzed for \{AFB1\} contamination using the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and A. Aspergilli population densities in 1053 soil samples collected from the same sites were estimated using serial dilutions plated on A. Aspergilli medium. Farmer socio-economic profile information was also collected to determine relationships to \{AFB1\} contamination. The results revealed 46% and 23% of the total samples, from 2008 to 2009, respectively, had \{AFB1\} contamination levels greater than 4 ppb, and those above 20 ppb were 21% for 2008 and 8% for 2009, respectively. Fitted smooth curve relationships show that there is a clear increase in the chance of groundnut contamination when the population density of A. Aspergilli in the soil increased beyond 3000 (log (cfu) &gt; 8). The measured level of A. Aspergilli in soil varied by location, as well as ecologies within location. Low-altitude ecologies, which were warmer and experienced low precipitation levels, had the highest densities of A. Aspergilli, whereas cooler high-altitude ecologies had the lowest density of these fungi. Similarly high \{AFB1\} contamination, was recorded across the country with 11–28% of all samples collected from the warm low to mid-altitude ecologies recording contamination ≥20 ppb and low contamination (2–10% of samples) in the mid to high altitude cool ecologies. From a crop management perspective, this study also suggests that both less experienced and older farmers were more likely to produce groundnuts contaminated with aflatoxin. These findings have implications in the design of intervention strategies to avoid short- and long-term human health effects from aflatoxin exposure. "

In recent work, the reference collection of groundnut had been assessed across seasons varying for drought intensity, i.e. two moderate temperature (rainy season) and two high temperature (dry season) experiments under well-watered (WW) and water stress (WS) conditions (Hamidou et al., 2012, 2013). Here aflatoxin concentration (AC) in seeds is measured in these trials, first for possibly identifying germplasm with low aflatoxin concentrations and second for investigating possible relationships between aflatoxin concentration and drought tolerance. Drought stress intensity increased aflatoxin concentration in seeds and higher aflatoxin contamination was observed under combined drought and high temperature conditions than under drought alone. No germplasm with lower \{AC\} than resistant check (55-437) were found. Aflatoxin contamination showed very high GxE interactions, which suggest that selection for resistance to aflatoxin contamination must be specific to environment. Across trials, using means for each environment, there was a clear positive relationship between the aflatoxin concentration and the grain yield reduction due to drought, indicating that a higher drought severity led to higher aflatoxin concentration. However, within trial, the same relationships applied to individual genotypes, or to cohorts of tolerant/sensitive genotypes, were not significant. The major conclusion of this work is that while drought intensity did increase the level of aflatoxin contamination, as expected and previously reported, there seemed to be no direct relationship between tolerance to drought and aflatoxin concentration, suggesting that the mechanisms of drought tolerance and aflatoxin contamination are likely not common.

Improvement of crop adaptation to drought is needed and this starts by having a thorough assessment of a large and representative set of germplasm. In this study, 247 lines belonging to the reference collection of groundnut were assessed under well-watered (WW) and intermittent water stress (WS) conditions in India and Niger for two years, following similar experimental protocols. The \{WS\} treatment reduced pod yield (31–46%), haulm yield (8–55%) and the harvest index (1–10%). Besides a strong treatment effect, yield differences within locations and years, were attributed to both genotypic and genotype-by-treatment interactions. Pod yield under \{WW\} and \{WS\} conditions were closely related in both years (Patancheru, r2 = 0.42 and r2 = 0.50; Sadore, r2 = 0.22 and r2 = 0.23). By contrast, within location and treatment, pod and haulm yields were affected predominantly by genotype-by-year (G × Y) effects, especially under WS. Within treatment across locations and years, pod and haulm yields were mostly ruled by genotypic effects, which allowed identifying a group of entries with contrasting pod yield across locations under WS. However, genotype and genotype by environment (GGE) biplot analyses distinguished India from Niger, suggesting that the selection remains environment-specific and also revealed dissimilarity between years in Niger. A close relationship was observed between yield and pod growth rate (r2 = 0.51), and partition (r2 = 0.33) under \{WS\} conditions, whereas no significant relationship was found between yield under \{WS\} and SCMR, or specific leaf area (SLA). These results showing a close interaction between the environmental conditions and the genotypic response to intermittent drought shows the necessity to carefully choose environments that truly represent target environments. This is an important result in the current breeding context of marker-assisted recurrent selection or genome-wide selection. This work opens also new ways for the breeding of drought tolerant groundnut, by bringing new highly contrasting lines currently used for crossing and deciphering drought adaptation traits to better understand G × E interactions, while it challenges the relevance of long-time used surrogates such as \{SCMR\} or SLA.

Using two automated rain-out shelters, six pigeonpea genotypes were grown under well-watered conditions throughout the growth period or under water deficits imposed from flowering until physiological maturity. Soil moisture content was monitored using neutron probes. Osmotic adjustment in leaves increased with the depletion of soil moisture and reached close to 0.5 \{MPa\} at physiological maturity. Genotypic variation in \{OA\} (ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 MPa) was significant. Total non-structural carbohydrates mobilized from stem for reproductive growth varied substantially among genotypes. Contribution of stem-reserves to the grain yield, however, was less than 5%. Below 30 cm depth, 60 to 80% of the plant extractable soil water was not utilized at physiological maturity in the drought treatment. Genotypic variation in leaf relative water content was correlated with \{OA\} (r2 = 0.66*, n = 6). Leaf \{OA\} was correlated with the amount of stem sucrose mobilized (r2 = 0.67*; n = 6). The relationship between \{OA\} and leaf area duration was significant (r2 = 0.94**; n = 5). Genotypic variation in leaf relative water content was correlated with crop growth rate (r2 = 0.74*; n = 6) and radiation-use efficiency (r2 = 0.84**; n = 6) under moisture deficits.

Studies were made on the effect of population on the distribution of plant dry weight, leaf area, grain yield and yield components throughout the season. The first effect of increasing population was evident at panicle initiation (&lt;6% final dry weight produced) where dry weight accumulation in the main axis was unaffected but that in the tillers was reduced. Subsequently, the increased plant population resulted in reductions of 77% in total weight per plant, 66% in leaf area per plant and 59% in tiller number per plant at 50% anthesis. The development of green leaf area per plant followed the same trend over the range of populations, so that leaf area index ranged with increasing population from 2.9 to 6.7 at 50% anthesis; severe leaf senescence occurred in the latter part of grain filling. As population increased, the development of tillers terminated earlier in the growth of the plant, resulting in a reduced tiller survival rate and therefore reduced productive head numbers per plant. Grain yield per plant declined owing to the reduced head numbers and also to lower seed numbers per head. Seed size remained largely unchanged. Population influenced plant yield chiefly through the highly responsive yield fraction of tillers, as the yield of the main axis was relatively stable. Grain yield ha−1 increased to a maximum at 150 000 plants ha−1, which was maintained through to 400 000 plants ha−1 due to the large degree of plasticity in productive tiller number per plant. "

Only stomata «downstream» of a girdled zone (relative to the direction of xylem flow) were affected by the treatment; there was no lateral or 《backward》 transmission of a closing stimulus. No immediate differences between control and girdled leaves could be detected in bulk leaf water potential or in abscisic acid content.

African countries display a patchwork of national policies and institutional frameworks to address these rising HMDs. This paper examines the heterogeneity that exists within Africa′s institutional arrangements for climate-related disaster risk management, and introduces a three-partite policy classification that ranks each country as one of three disaster management policy types: the ‘Unprepared Firefighters′ (whose response to disasters is late, delayed and ineffective), the ‘Prepared Firefighters′ (for the most part effective disaster responders) and the ‘Disaster Averters′ (who experienced a paradigm shift and moved focus away from the hazard itself towards a reduction of the underlying risk factors that cause disasters). Through extensive data mining, interviews and qualitative country assessments, we map where African countries lie on this spectrum of effective climate-related disaster risk management. We find that African countries lay at different levels on the spectrum of effective disaster risk management. Across Africa, countries display differential progress in achieving the Hyogo Framework for Action goals and great variation and heterogeneity exists from country to country, one that calls for a concomitant heterogeneity in aid programs and initiatives meant to support comprehensive disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation (DRR–CCA) in Africa. In closing, this paper suggests ways to support African countries′ efforts towards effective disaster risk management and planning. It offers a qualitative method to continually assess developing countries′ progress in achieving the Hyogo Framework for Action goals, one that straddles top-down country self-reporting and bottom-up civil society assessment.

It is a reality that drought results in sets of socio-economic impacts starting with crop-yield failure, unemployment, erosion of assets, income decrease, poor nutrition and decreasing risk absorptive capacity, thereby increasing the vulnerability of the community. This paper gives a brief of the existing approaches that focus on vulnerability and impact assessment aid to characterize and identify regions, sectors and communities which are at risk for drought currently and in the future. It also discusses the limitation, constraints and pre-requisites in these approaches and highlights the importance of micro-level information to have a more realistic understanding of impact and vulnerability through illustration, with reference to the recent study conducted by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT). This exercise will provide a guiding framework for devising action plans to improve adaptive capacity among vulnerable populations. "

Measurements of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation and dry-matter production for sorghum, grown in different row spacings and on different soil types, showed that improved management can enhance interception of radiation by the crop, thereby leading to higher production.

However carbon traders need assurances that contract levels of C are being achieved. Thus, methods are needed to monitor and verify soil C changes over time and space to determine whether target levels of C storage are being met. Because direct measurement over the large areas needed to sequester contract amounts of C in soil is not practical, other approaches are necessary. An integrated approach is described in which an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is used to assimilate in situ soil carbon measurements into a stochastic soil C model to estimate soil C changes over time and space. The approach takes into account errors in in situ measurements and uncertainties in the model to estimate mean and variance of soil C for each land unit within a larger land area. The approach requires initial estimates of soil C over space along with uncertainties in these estimates. Model predictions are made to estimate soil C for the next year, in situ soil C measurements update these predictions using maximum likelihood methods, and the spatial pattern of soil C mean, variance, and covariance thus evolve over time. This approach can also be used to provide yearly estimates of the changes in soil C over multiple fields, the variance in those estimates, and aggregate soil carbon mean and variance values each year. In this paper, the use of the EnKF is shown for an area in Ghana with 12 fields, comparing numbers of fields sampled each year and ways of selecting which fields to sample each year. The model predicts soil C changes over time using first order decomposition of existing soil C and addition of C from plant residues. The lowest intensity sampling method (sampling only 1/4 of the fields per year) resulted in the highest level of uncertainty in aggregate soil C estimate. Rotating sample fields each year improved the performance of the EnKF. These results demonstrated a quantifiable tradeoff between field sampling intensity and uncertainty in aggregate soil C estimates. The framework could be modified to use more complex biophysical models and to assimilate remote sensing data. "

Fertilizer N application rates of 112 kg ha−1 were generally sufficient to produce maximum yields, to attain the highest fertilizer N uptake efficiency and for the grain sorghum cultivars to achieve the highest percentage partitioning of N, P and K into grain. Quadratic relationships best described the relationship between fertilizer N application rate and the amounts of N, P and K taken up by grain and forage sorghum cultivars.

Stover removal adversely affected yields, nutrient uptake and partitioning during the last 2 study years. The interactive effects of sorghum genotype, fertilizer N and stover removal on yields and soil productivity need to be assessed over a longer term if stover removal is to be developed into an environmentally sound and sustainable production strategy.

Based on spore encumberance on nematode cuticle, Globodera rostochiensis, G. pallida, Heterodera glycines, H. trifolii, H. schachtii, and Rotylenchulus reniformis were hosts and H. carotae, H. galeopsidis, Meloidogyne arenaria, M. incognita, M. javanica, M. graminicola, M. oryzae, M. triticoryzae, M. sasseri, M. graminis, and M. naasi were non hosts. Spore attachment on the nematode body was random except on H. trifolii, where the spores selectively attached to the head region. Marked heterogeneity in spore size and level of spore attachment within populations of nematode species was observed. Variation in antigens present on the spore surface was confirmed by differential recognition of spores by monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and Western blot analysis. The parameters important in characterising species of Pasteuria are discussed in the light of the data reported. The results suggest that host range and spore morphometries are not adequate for the characterisation of species. "

Each of the five \{RNAs\} encodes a single protein on the negative-sense strand with an open reading frame (ORF) of 6885, 1947, 927, 1086, and 1422 nts, respectively. In order, from \{RNA1\} to RNA5, these \{ORFs\} encode the RNA-dependent \{RNA\} polymerase (p1, 267.9 kDa), a putative glycoprotein precursor (p2, 74.3 kDa), a putative nucleocapsid protein (p3, 34.6 kDa), a putative movement protein (p4, 40.8 kDa), while p5 (55 kDa) has an unknown function. All \{RNA\} segments of \{PPSMV\} showed the highest identity with orthologs of fig mosaic virus (FMV) and Rose rosette virus (RRV). In phylogenetic trees constructed with the amino acid sequences of p1, p2 and p3, \{PPSMV\} clustered consistently with other emaraviruses, close to clades comprising members of other genera of the family Bunyaviridae. Based on the molecular characteristics unveiled in this study and the morphological and epidemiological features similar to other emaraviruses, \{PPSMV\} seems to be the seventh species to join the list of emaraviruses known to date and accordingly, its classification in the genus Emaravirus seems now legitimate.

Information on the effects of global warming on pests and pathogens affecting agricultural crops is limited, though crop–pest models could offer means to predict changes in pest dynamics, and help design sound plant health management practices. Host-plant resistance should continue to receive high priority as global warming may favor emergence of new pest epidemics. There is increased risk, due to climate change, to food and feed contaminated by mycotoxin-producing fungi. Mycotoxin biosynthesis gene-specific microarray is being used to identify food-born fungi and associated mycotoxins, and investigate the influence of environmental parameters and their interactions for control of mycotoxin in food crops. Some crop wild relatives are threatened plant species and efforts should be made for their in situ conservation to ensure evolution of new variants, which may contribute to addressing new challenges to agricultural production. There should be more emphasis on germplasm enhancement to develop intermediate products with specific characteristics to support plant breeding. Abiotic stress response is routinely dissected to component physiological traits. Use of transgene(s) has led to the development of transgenic events, which could provide enhanced adaptation to abiotic stresses that are exacerbated by climate change. Global warming is also associated with declining nutritional quality of food crops. Micronutrient-dense cultivars have been released in selected areas of the developing world, while various nutritionally enhanced lines are in the release pipeline. The high-throughput phenomic platforms are allowing researchers to accurately measure plant growth and development, analyze nutritional traits, and assess response to stresses on large sets of individuals. Analogs for tomorrow’s agriculture offer a virtual natural laboratory to innovate and test technological options to develop climate resilience production systems. Increased use of agrobiodiversity is crucial to coping with adverse impacts of global warming on food and feed production and quality. No one solution will suffice to adapt to climate change and its variability. Suits of technological innovations, including climate-resilient crop cultivars, will be needed to feed 9 billion people who will be living in the Earth by the middle of the twenty-first century. "

Its accumulation from soil and its distribution throughout diverse plant tissues is mediated by transporter proteins. In plants, different transport systems are known to be involved in the uptake and release of K+ from the cells. Though most of the information about the putative K+ transporters and their phylogenetic relationships is available in Arabidopsis, it is not the best model for plants with agronomic applications. Recent completion of rice genome sequencing project offered the opportunity to make an inventory of all putative K+ transporter proteins. More than 5% of the rice genome appears to encode membrane transport proteins. Unfortunately, several hundreds of putative transporter proteins have not yet been assigned to any families or subfamilies or functions. Therefore, phylogenetic relationships of many K+ transporters in rice are analyzed since rice is considered as a model plant because of its high degree of co-linearity with other cereals. Phylogenetic analysis of all K+ transporters in rice revealed that they fall into five major branches. Phylogenetic trees of each family define the evolutionary relationships of the members to each other. In each family, closely related isoforms and separate subfamilies existed, indicating possible redundancies and specialized functions. The \{HAK\} family is represented by 26 genes and formed the tightest and most distinct branch in the phylogenetic tree. Around 14 genes with conserved P-loop were found in K+ channel family out of which 11 genes belong to 1P/6TM (Shaker-type), and three genes to the 2P/4TM (ORK-type). On searching rice genome, it was found that nine genes belonged to Trk family. In rice, K+/H+ antiporter family is represented by a single gene. Comparative analysis of rice K+ channels with that of Arabidopsis, wheat and maize revealed that while cereals are closely related, Arabidopsis appeared quite distant from rice. "

These include low rainfall with high spatial and temporal variability, and significant loss of soil water through evaporation. An experiment was established at Matopos Research Station, Zimbabwe, to determine the effect of mulching and minimum tillage on maize (Zea mays L.) yield and soil water content. The experiment was run for two years at two sites: clay (Matopos Research Station fields) and sand (Lucydale fields) soils, in a 7 × 3 factorial combination of mulch rates (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 10 t ha−1) and tillage methods (planting basins, ripper tine and conventional plough). Each treatment was replicated three times at each site in a split plot design. Maize residue was applied as mulch before tillage operations. Two maize varieties, a hybrid (SC 403) and an open pollinated variety (ZM 421), were planted. Maize yield and soil water content (0–30 and 30–60 cm depth) were measured under each treatment. On both soil types, neither mulching nor tillage method had a significant effect on maize grain yield. Tillage methods significantly influenced stover production with planting basins giving the highest stover yield (1.1 t ha−1) on sandy soil and conventional ploughing giving 3.6 t ha−1 on clay soil during the first season. The three tillage methods had no significant effect on seasonal soil water content, although planting basins collected more rainwater during the first half of the cropping period. Mulching improved soil water content in both soil types with maximum benefits observed at 4 t ha−1 of mulch. We conclude that, in the short term, minimum tillage on its own, or in combination with mulching, performs as well as the farmers’ traditional practices of overall ploughing. "

Besides preparing land for crop planting, these two technologies also help in collecting and using rainwater more efficiently in semi-arid areas. The basin tillage is being targeted for households with limited or no access to draught animals while ripping is meant for smallholder farmers with some draught animal power. Trials were established at four farms in Gwanda and Insiza in southern Zimbabwe to determine soil water contributions and runoff water losses from plots under four different tillage treatments. The tillage treatments were hand-dug planting basins, ripping, conventional spring and double ploughing using animal-drawn implements. The initial intention was to measure soil water changes and runoff losses from cropped plots under the four tillage practices. However, due to total crop failure, only soil water and runoff were measured from bare plots between December 2006 and April 2007. Runoff losses were highest under conventional ploughing. Planting basins retained most of the rainwater that fell during each rainfall event. The amount of rainfall received at each farm significantly influenced the volume of runoff water measured. Runoff water volume increased with increase in the amount of rainfall received at each farm. Soil water content was consistently higher under basin tillage than the other three tillage treatments. Significant differences in soil water content were observed across the farms according to soil types from sand to loamy sand. The basin tillage method gives a better control of water losses from the farmers’ fields. The planting basin tillage method has a greater potential for providing soil water to crops than ripper, double and single conventional ploughing practices. "

Data has been collected from a 77 m deep well drug within the study area covered by HAPEX-Sahel (Hydrological and Atmospheric Pilot Experiment), an international large-scale energy, water and carbon balance experiment carried out during the summer of 1992. During well construction samples were taken from the unsaturated zone at the following intervals: every 25 cm from 0–10 m, every 50 cm from 10–62.5 m, then every metre to the bottom of the well. Pore water was extracted from each sample either by centrifugation or elutriation and analysed for chloride; moisture contents of samples were obtained gravimetrically. These data have been used to produce depth profiles of pore water chloride concentration and moisture content throughout the unsaturated zone. From these profiles it has been possible to derive an estimate of historic direct recharge at the site. The chloride concentration of rainfall, which is required to make the estimate, was determined from the analysis of 123 rainfall samples collected from five \{EPSAT\} (vers une Estimation des Précipitation par Satellite au sahel) rain gauges in 1992. A mean recharge rate of 13 mm year−1 (range 10–19 mm) is estimated for the upper 70m of the profile, with a total residence time of 790 years (range 520–990 years). This is considered to be a representative estimate of the magnitude of direct recharge taking place below tiger bush areas. "

A. coimhatorensis, the predominant parasitoid during post-rainy season, preferred mid-late midge larvae for parasitization, while A. gala, which was predominant during the rainy season, preferred early-mid larval stages. Variations in the preference of A. coimbatorensis and A. gala for the developmental stage of their host larvae indicate good prospects for the biological control of sorghum midge populations. There were significant differences in parasitization level of midge by Aprostocetus spp. between resistant and susceptible sorghum genotypes, and season. Higher parasitization was observed on susceptible genotypes than on resistant ones during both post-rainy and rainy seasons. However, the level of parasitization was greater in post-rainy than in rainy seasons. There was also evidence of higher midge infestation in rainy than in post-rainy seasons. Susceptible genotypes attracted more parasitoids because of high levels of midge infestations. Low parasitoid density in midge resistant sorghum under glasshouse and field conditions was associated with low midge infestations in these genotypes. However, parasitoids were always associated with their host in spite of low midge densities in resistant genotypes. The present study revealed that the interaction between host plant resistance and parasitoids of sorghum midge would thus be synergistic and complementary and could result in successful integration of these two important pest management tactics.

This may have important implications for the planning and management of agroforestry in semi-arid regions such as the Sahel of West Africa. A method of distinguishing uptake of water by plants from different sources was used, therefore, at locations with contrasting water table levels, to determine whether Azadirachta indica A. Juss (neem) trees in windbreaks utilised water from the same depths as adjacent crops of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.). Comparisons of ratios of the stable isotopes of oxygen (18O/16O) in plant sap, groundwater and water in the unsaturated zone of the soil profile were made in the Majjia Valley, in south-central Niger, where groundwater was found at depths of 6–8 m, and at Sadoré in south-western Niger, where the water table was at a depth of 35 m. In the Majjia Valley, the trees obtained large portions of their water from surface layers of the soil only after rain, when water there was abundant. During dry periods, roots of the trees extracted groundwater or deep reserves of soil water, while the millet crop extracted water from closer to the top of the soil profile. In contrast, at Sadoré, both the trees and crop fulfilled their water requirements from the top 2–3 m of the soil throughout the year. Thus, utilisation of water by windbreak trees and crops is more complementary where groundwater is accessible to tree roots. Competition for water is likely reduced at such locations as a consequence, but may affect the productivity of windbreak systems where groundwater is inaccessible. To maximise the benefits of establishing windbreaks, therefore, it is important that planners recommend strategies for reducing competition for water between trees and crops at sites where groundwater cannot be reached by tree roots.

abstract = "To try to maintain soil fertility in the West African Sahel (WAS), research and development organisations promote the use of mineral fertilizers, especially phosphate (P), and an improved management of crop residues (CR). While researchers have achieved considerable increases in yield using broadcast mulch rates of 2000 kg \{CR\} ha−1, farmers traditionally apply \{CR\} only on selected microsites with low productivity. The economic analyses in this paper were based on the results of an on-station field experiment presented previously. The yields were analysed according to a set of hypothetical application methods, that is assuming that: (1) all fertilisers were broadcasted evenly, (2) all fertilisers were applied to poorly producing microsites only, and (3) all fertilisers were applied to good producing microsites only. Linear programming models were used to estimate the comparative advantages of traditional and innovative mulching techniques for typical farms in western Niger. The following scenarios were tested: (1) application of \{CR\} only to poorly producing microsites when the latter comprised 10%, 30% and 50% of the total farm land; (2) applying \{CR\} mulch to poorly and good producing microsites or broadcasting it with or without the addition of P fertilizers; and (3) the amount of \{CR\} available for mulching was compared between sites where there was or was not a market for buying and selling CR. The data came from an experiment conducted between 1991 and 1992 at the \{ICRISAT\} Sahelian Centre in Niger and from several household surveys used to characterise a typical farm in western Niger. The optimum solutions to the linear equations suggest that farmers' concentrated microsite techniques are more profitable than broadcast applications due to the higher productivity of the traditional techniques per unit of labour input. At a proportion of 10% poor microsites, it is not profitable to treat the poorly producing parts. However, as the proportion of the low fertility land increases the profitability of treating these areas increases. High relative costs of P fertilizer and low millet grain prices render P application beneficial only if applied to good producing microsites. In the short run, the farmers' mulching techniques are currently rational from an agronomic and economic viewpoint. Yet, as the proportion of low fertility land increases, traditional techniques need more \{CR\} which can only be assured by P inputs. A more favourable agricultural price policy may improve adoption of P fertilizers by Sahelian farmers. "

Core and mini-core collections have also been developed for the majority of grain legumes; they were further evaluated for different parameters. From these genetic resources, potential donors of desirable traits have been selected after evaluation and characterization and have been utilized in the genetic improvement of cultivars.

There has been a drastic reduction in area and production in India due to the lack of resistant varieties to manage the disease. Genetic improvement for mold resistance has been suggested as a sole criterion for reducing losses associated with grain mold and several morphological and biochemical traits have been employed to aid screening for resistance. However, there is always a bias with visual scoring systems to rate disease severity; thus, ergosterol and flavan-4-ols content within the grain was evaluated as selection criteria. Twenty-five hybrids were selected based on their visual rating for grain mold resistance and grain color from replicated trials at two locations in India during 2004 and 2005 rainy seasons and grouped into colored resistant, white resistant, colored susceptible and white susceptible. The field grade score (FGS) and threshed grade score (TGS) were strongly and positively correlated with ergosterol content and weakly and negatively correlated with flavan-4-ols. Though the resistant hybrids had higher concentration of flavan-4-ols in methanol and acidified methanol extract compared to the susceptible hybrids, the white grained hybrids had negligible amounts indicating flavan-4-ols concentration is not a suitable selection criterion especially in white grained hybrids. The ergosterol content was higher in susceptible hybrids (19.49 μg/g) compared to resistant hybrids (9.96 μg/g) and it was marginally less in red hybrids (14.0 μg/g) compared to white (17.2 μg/g) hybrids. The highly significant correlation of ergosterol content with germination percentage, \{FGS\} and \{TGS\} validates the use of this trait for identification of grain mold resistant genotypes provided there is no delay in the estimation. Also the significant heterosis obtained for this trait indicates the existence of dominance gene action and suggests that further exploitation of this trait would benefit the development of grain mold resistant hybrids.

Both these types are divergent geographically and broadly vary in their adaptation, nutrition, biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. In a field evaluation of large number of well-adapted \{F4\} progenies of both desi and kabuli had shown that the grain yields were lower in all the kabulis as a consequence of lesser total shoot biomass production and lesser harvest index. The vegetative duration of kabulis was shorter and the reproductive duration extensively longer explaining why the shoot biomass productivity is low. In another field trial with a subset of the minicore chickpea germplasm, the canopy temperature depression of the kabulis were observed to be relatively lower with a low variation among the accessions and also the grain yields were lower explaining the poor adaptation of kabulis to terminal drought under Patancheru. The anatomy of roots had shown that there were quick loss of cortical layers and the presence of greater number of wider xylem vessels in kabulis relative to desis and that the kabulis were equipped to use more water with less resistance to water flow. More desi × kabuli introgressions are suggested for improving the adaptability and yield stability of kabulis under peninsular Indian environments. "

Three sets of full diallel crosses were made, one set using five parents contrasting for both grain Fe and Zn concentrations; the second set using six parents contrasting only for Fe, and the third set with four parents contrasting only for Zn. The crosses and parents were evaluated in replicated trials for two years. The results indicated that both additive and non-additive gene action play a role in conditioning grain Fe and Zn concentration in sorghum. However, non-additive gene action is predominant in conditioning grain Fe; and additive gene action in conditioning grain Zn. Some of the crosses showed significant heterosis for grain Fe concentration without yield penalty and some crosses showed targeted grain Zn concentration (40 mg kg−1) coupled with higher grain yields. The results also showed that it is possible to improve grain Fe concentration through exploiting heterosis, but there would be little opportunity if any for improving grain Zn through heterosis breeding. To develop hybrids with high grain Fe and Zn concentration in sorghum both parents needs to be improved for these micronutrients. Combining higher grain Fe and Zn with high yield is feasible. "

Therefore, field experiments were conducted to compare different rice establishment methods under safe alternate wetting and drying (AWD) water management (irrigation when soil water tension increased to 10 kPa at a depth of 15 cm). Rice yield and grain quality were not affected by planting method (direct (wet or dry) seeding or transplanting) or tillage method (dry tillage or puddling) in both the wet and dry seasons, except for significantly lower yield of wet seeded rice in dry tilled soil due to poor establishment. Dry seeding and transplanting into dry tilled soil had significantly lower total irrigation input (by about 10%) than all other establishment methods. Puddling increased total irrigation input to both transplanted and wet seeded rice in comparison with dry tillage, mainly because of the large amount of water required for soil soaking/puddling. Irrigation input to direct (wet) seeded rice in puddled soil was much higher than for any other establishment method because of both the longer duration in the field and the water requirement for puddling, which resulted in low irrigation and input water productivity. There was no significant effect of establishment method on N use efficiency except for wet seeded rice (WSR) on dry tilled soil, primarily because of the low yield. The results show that with safe \{AWD\} water management on a highly permeable soil, avoiding puddling reduces irrigation input by about 10%, but that there is no further reduction in irrigation input by changing from transplanting to dry seeding, in contrast with the findings from less permeable soils. This, together with the poor establishment of wet seeded rice, in contrast with the findings of others, indicates the importance of taking soil and site characteristics into consideration in the selection of a crop establishment method. Further evaluation of crop establishment methods under a wider range of site conditions is needed to characterize establishment method in terms of yield, irrigation input and water productivity. "

The effects of a crop and of crop management on this water loss from the soil have been estimated in the past using combinations of field measurement and simple models, but there are inconsistencies in the conclusions reached. This paper presents data from water balance studies on millet crops in Niger during the 1991 and 1993 seasons. Evaporation from soil (Es) was measured under two contrasting cropping intensities in both years using the microlysimeter method. small seasonal reductions in Es from the higher intensity crop were recorded (12% and 16% in 1991 and 1993, respectively). significant reductions in daily Es were: (1) nearly all recorded within a limited period in the season when there were large differences in transpiring leaf area; (2) recorded for both high ( &gt; =2 mm day−1) and low ( &lt; 0.8 mm day−1) values of Es. These data indicate that soil drying by root water uptake contributed to the reduction of Es. Increased shading of the soil by the crop canopy does not result in a proportional reduction of Es. Two simple models for estimating \{ES\} beneath crops (Ritchie, 1972; Cooper et al., 1983) are compared with field data and an improvement to the Ritchie model is suggested. Two new parameters are introduced to estimate the relative importance of (1) the atmospheric vapour pressure deficit to potential evaporation and (2) root water uptake to soil drying. The brief description of environment and crop included in the new approach allows identification of the environments in which there is scope for substantial reduction in Es through crop management.

Using the experimental data of the 1984 and 1986 seasons, the model was calibrated for cultivar-specific parameters of cvs. Annigeri and \{JG\} 74 and also for soil parameters determining water balance of the root-zone. The model was validated against data from the 1985, 1987, 1992 and 1993 seasons. The model predicted flowering, pod initiation, beginning of seed growth and physiological maturity within ± 5 days of the observed values, except under extreme wet situations when the actual seed growth and physiological maturity of chickpea occurred later than the simulated dates. Leaf area index, total dry matter production (TDM) and its partitioning to various plant organs under irrigated and water-stressed conditions were also predicted satisfactorily by the model. Soil moisture changes in the rooting-zone of chickpea were also predicted accurately. Predicted \{TDM\} and seed yields of cvs. Annigeri and \{JG\} 74 at harvest were significantly correlated with the observed data (r2 = 0.89 and \{RMSE\} = 0.34 t/ha for TDM; r2 = 0.82 and \{RMSE\} = 0.14 t/ha for seed).

A more coordinated and efficient procedure for identifying useful lines for Australian breeding programs was evaluated by assessing the potential for exploiting correlated response to selection for grain yield between \{CIMMYT\} international and Australian evaluation trials. The genetic correlation, based on 40 common lines, between average line performance across 18 international and six Australian environments was high (0.813±0.049), indicating considerable potential for exploiting correlated response to selection for broad grain yield adaptation to the Australian environments for selection on broad adaptation in the international environments. The potential to select for specific grain yield adaptation to the individual Australian environments was investigated and individual international environments were identified which expressed a higher genetic correlation with the Australian environments than did average performance over all of the international environments. Therefore, opportunity exists for Australian wheat breeders to use the principles of indirect selection to select among advanced \{CIMMYT\} wheat lines on grain yield performance in international performance trials for both broad and specific grain yield adaptation to Australian environments prior to the introduction of this material to Australia. Since genotype by environment interaction for yield in the international trials is large and its causes are not well understood, selection for specific adaptation on the results from individual trials will require further investigation of the individual relationships.

The methodology can also be used to assess the opportunity for more efficient acquisition of new germplasm for a breeding program where common genotypes are evaluated in environments sampled by two breeding programs. However, the large number of environmental comparisons that is required complicates this process. To assist environmental comparison, the theory for indirect selection is related to classification methodology for grouping of environments in plant breeding experiments. To demonstrate the application of this methodology, classification was used to jointly group 18 international wheat evaluation environments conducted by the International Centre for Wheat and Maize Improvement (CIMMYT) as part of the 17th International Bread Wheat Screening Nursery (17th IBWSN) and six environments from a trial series conducted in Queensland, Australia using a set of 40 common genotypes. This process was used to identify a subset of international environments which improved indirect response for average grain yield performance in the Australian environments over that for selection on average grain yield performance over all 18 international environments. Similarly, classification was used to identify subsets of international environments which improved indirect response to selection in five of the six Australian environments. More efficient strategies for acquiring useful wheat germplasm for Australian wheat breeding programs from the \{CIMMYT\} program by extending this methodology are discussed. "

A large number of independently transformed plants (over 75) were successfully transplanted to the glasshouse. Integration of the transgenes and stable genetic transformants in the progeny were assessed by \{PCR\} amplification of 700-bp fragment of nptII and 585-bp of \{IPCVcp\} genes, and Southern blot hybridizations in the \{T1\} generation of transgenic plants. Analysis of 35 transgenic plants of \{T1\} generation from the progeny of a single transformation event suggested the segregation of a single copy insert in a 3:1 Mendelian ratio. On an average, 120–150 days were required between the initiation of explant transformation and transfer of rooted plants to the greenhouse. The cotyledon regeneration system proved to be an excellent vehicle for the production of a large number of independently transformed peanut plants. Shoot formation was rapid and prolific, and a large proportion of these shoots developed into fertile plants. The method reported here provides new opportunities for the crop improvement of peanut via genetic transformation. "

We also investigated the potential benefits of incorporating drought and heat tolerance traits in chickpea using the chickpea model and the virtual cultivars approach. As compared to the baseline climate, the climate change by 2050 (including CO2) increased the yield of chickpea by 17% both at Hisar and Indore, 18% at Zaloke, 25% at Debre Zeit and 18% at Kabete; whereas the yields decreased by 16% at Nandhyal and 7% at Ukiriguru. The yield benefit due to increased \{CO2\} by 2050 ranged from 7 to 20% across sites as compared to the yields under current atmospheric \{CO2\} concentration; while the changes in temperature and rainfall had either positive or negative impact on yield at the sites. Yield potential traits (maximum leaf photosynthesis rate, partitioning of daily growth to pods and seed-filling duration each increased by 10%) increased the yield of virtual cultivars up to 12%. Yield benefit due to drought tolerance across sites was up to 22% under both baseline and climate change scenarios. Heat tolerance increased the yield of chickpea up to 9% at Hisar and Indore under baseline climate, and up to 13% at Hisar, Indore, Nandhyal and Ukiriguru under climate change. At other sites (Zaloke, Debre Zeit and Kabete) the incorporation of heat tolerance under climate change had no beneficial effect on yield. Considering varied crop responses to each plant trait across sites, this study was useful in prioritizing the plant traits for location-specific breeding of chickpea cultivars for higher yields under climate change at the selected sites in South Asia and East Africa.

Therefore, we studied the influence of organic acids (oxalic acid and malic acid) present in the trichome exudates of chickpea on the biological activity and binding of Bt δ-endotoxin Cry1Ac to brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) of the pod borer, H. armigera. Oxalic and malic acids in combination at concentrations present in chickpea leaves did not influence the biological activity of Bt toxin Cry1Ac towards H. armigera larvae. Amounts of Cry1Ac protein in the midgut of insects reared on diets with organic acids were similar to those reared on artificial diet without the organic acids. However, very high concentrations of the organic acids reduced the amounts of Cry1Ac in the midgut of H. armigera larvae. Organic acids in the artificial diet also increased the excretion of Cry1Ac in the fecal matter. Organic acids reduced the amount of protein in the \{BBMV\} of insects reared on diets with Cry1Ac, possibly because of reduced size of the larvae. Oxalic and malic acids at concentrations present in chickpea leaves did not affect the biological activity of Cry1Ac, but it will be desirable to have high levels of expression of Cry1Ac toxin proteins in chickpea for effective control of the pod borer, H. armigera.

The fertilizers were applied once at 0–80 kg P ha−1 and their effects were followed in four consecutive clover crops. In the Minjingu phosphate rock experiment, clover \{DM\} yields without applied P were below 1 t \{DM\} ha−1 in all except the first of four consecutive crops. With P application, herbage yields reached as high as 14 t ha−1. Significant (P&lt;0.05) effects of P on clover \{DM\} and P uptake were observed at least up to crop 3. Over all the four crops, \{PR\} was 114%, \{PAPR25\} was 113% and \{PAPR50\} was 107% as effective as \{TSP\} in increasing clover herbage yields. The corresponding relative responses in P uptake were: 128, 121 and 112% for PR, \{PAPR25\} and PAPR50, respectively. The substitution rates in herbage yields were: 130% for PR, 128% for \{PAPR25\} and 114% for \{PAPR50\} while those for P uptake were 164% for PR, 146% for \{PAPR25\} and 125% for PAPR50. In the Chilembwe phosphate rock experiment, clover \{DM\} yields without applied P were below 1.3 t \{DM\} ha−1 in the five years of the study. With P application, herbage yields reached as high as 7 t ha−1. Significant effects of P on clover \{DM\} and P uptake were observed only in the first two crops. Over all the five crops, \{PR\} was 27%, \{PAPR25\} was 57% and \{PAPR50\} was 73% as effective as \{TSP\} in increasing clover herbage yields. The corresponding relative responses in P uptake were 18, 49 and 59% for PR, \{PAPR25\} and PAPR50, respectively. The substitution rates in herbage yields were 7% for PR, 32% for \{PAPR25\} and 53% for \{PAPR50\} while those for P uptake were 3% for PR, 24% for \{PAPR25\} and 35% for PAPR50. It was concluded that raw Minjingu phosphate rock is highly effective on clover in these Vertisols and partial acidulation is not necessary, but raw Chilembwe phosphate rock is ineffective and 50% partial acidulation is recommended.

This chapter reviews the current state of knowledge on effects of climate change factors on the growth and development of groundnut. This review identifies research gaps and suggests upgrades to groundnut models, such as the CROPGRO-Groundnut model, which is being used as a tool to assess impacts of climate change on groundnut crop. This review revealed that the direct and indirect effects of most climate change factors on plant growth and development processes are well understood and already incorporated in the CROPGRO-Groundnut model. Extreme events associated with climate change may sometimes cause water-logging, extreme soil water deficiency, or extreme humidity conditions, and these effects could be better addressed in the models.

Information on combining ability of diverse open-pollinated cultivars and gene pools is needed for efficient choice of breeding methods and parental materials to use in developing breeding programs to increase production. Twenty parental lines including 15 restorers and 5 male-sterile A-lines were mated. The 20 parents were sampled from elite germplasm available for cultivar development in the region. Combining ability studies were conducted on these parents along with their \{F1\} hybrids for grain yield, days to anthesis, plant height, inflorescence length, threshing percentage, and seed mass in 2 years and in two locations. Each location–year combination was considered as an environment. For each trait, general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) effects were estimated using the line–tester method of analysis. Highly significant \{GCA\} effects of males were found for all traits under study. Significant \{SCA\} was detected in all traits except inflorescence length. From the ratio of general combining ability to specific combining ability non-additive gene action was predominant for most traits. Parental lines with good performance per se and good performance in crosses for most agronomic traits included: \{ICSA\} 902 NG, \{NR\} 71182-2, \{NR\} 71182-3, \{CS\} 144, and Damougari. Both additive and non-additive gene effects are involved in variations observed among crosses. Hybrid breeding could contribute to sorghum improvement in the dry land agriculture of West Africa. Importance of genotype–environment interaction underlines the necessity of evaluating breeding materials under broad range of conditions. The various traits studied can be improved through breeding procedures using a range of different intra-population and inter-population selection procedures. In hybrid breeding procedures, testing of parent lines for general combining ability should be supplemented by evaluation of individual \{F1\} hybrids for specific combining ability. "

However, in field experiments based on monthly plantings reported elsewhere, panicle initiation took place during long days as well as during short days even for highly photoperiod-sensitive varieties thought to be of the absolute type, or was particularly early for the sowings in September, well before days were shortest. In order to investigate these contradictory results, three tropical sorghum varieties of different photoperiod sensitivity were planted monthly in Mali and the dates of panicle initiation (PI) were recorded. The results indicate that the common concepts of a gradual (linear, or quantitative) response of photoperiod-induced phase (PIP) to \{PP\} at \{PI\} (PPi) (case of the variety Sariaso 10) or a threshold-type response (hyperbolic, or absolute; cases of \{CSM\} 335 and \{IRAT\} 174) could be reproduced for the sowing dates falling into the wet season (May–October), but did not describe adequately crop behaviour during the remaining months of the year. The same varieties were tested in controlled environments with four differential \{PP\} treatments composed of three different initial \{PP\} (12 h 15 min, 12 h 00 min and 11 h 45 min) and two opposite rates of day length change (±1 min/day). Thus after 15 days, two pairs of treatments with opposite day length changes reached the same average \{PP\} (12 h 07 min and 11 h 52 min) and after 30 d, another pair reached a similar average \{PP\} (12 h 00 min). In 2001, 2 varieties reached \{PI\} earlier under decreasing days and the same average PP, but no such additional effect of the rate of change of \{PP\} was observed in 2002. Modelling exercises showed that field variation in the duration to \{PI\} was better explained with rate of change of \{PP\} than with absolute \{PP\} observed during PIP, and best with a combination of both factors in an additive model. It is concluded that in tropical sorghum, floral induction is strongly associated with a negative rate of change of day length in the field, and under certain circumstances under controlled conditions, but more evidence is needed to ascertain the capability of sorghum to sense the rate of change of \{PP\} before a definite model can be formulated.

This was done by comparing hybrids made with topcross pollinators (TCP) based on progenies selected from the original mapping population for presence of the tolerant allele at the target \{QTL\} versus field performance in the phenotyping environments. A set of 36 topcross hybrids was evaluated in 21 field environments, which included both non-stressed and drought-stressed treatments during the flowering and grain filling stages. The QTL-based hybrids were significantly, but modestly, higher yielding in a series of both absolute and partial terminal stress environments. However, this gain under stress was achieved at the cost of a lower yield in the non-stressed evaluation environments. This particular pattern of adaptation in the QTL-based hybrids was consistent with their general phenotype—early flowering, limited effective basal tillering, low biomass and a high harvest index (HI)—which resembled that of the drought tolerant parent of the original mapping population. The results thus confirmed the effectiveness of the putative drought tolerance \{QTL\} on \{LG\} 2, but suggested that it may enhance drought tolerance by favoring a particultar phenotype with adaptation to terminal stress.

Productivity of soybean-based systems on these soils needs to be improved and sustained by better management of natural resources, particularly soil and water. During 1995–1997 a field study was conducted in Peninsular India on a Vertic Inceptisol watershed to study the effect of two soil depths, namely shallow (&lt;50 cm soil depth) and medium-deep (≥50 cm soil depth) and two landform treatments, namely flat and broadbed-and-furrow (BBF) systems, on productivity and resource-use efficiency of soybean–chickpea rotation (soybean in rainy season followed by chickpea in post-rainy season). Soybean grown on flat landform on medium-deep soil had a higher leaf area index and more light interception compared to the soybean grown on the \{BBF\} landform. This resulted in an increase in mean seed yield for the flat landform (2120 kg ha−1) compared to the \{BBF\} landform (1870 kg ha−1). However, the landform treatments on shallow soil did not affect soybean yields. The soybean yield was higher on the medium-deep soil (1760 kg ha−1) than on the shallow soil (1550 kg ha−1) during 1995–1996, but were not different during 1996–1997. In both years chickpea yields and total system productivity (soybean + chickpea yields) were greater on medium-deep soil than on the shallow soil. Total run-off was higher on the flat landform (25% of seasonal rainfall) than on the \{BBF\} landform (20% of seasonal rainfall). This concomitantly increased profile water content (10–30 mm) of both soils in \{BBF\} compared to the flat landform treatment during 1995–1996, but not during 1996–1997. Deep drainage was higher in the \{BBF\} landform than in flat, especially for the shallow soil. Across landforms and soil depths, water use (evapotranspiration) by soybean–chickpea rotation during 1996–1997 ranged from 496 to 563 mm, which accounted for 54–61% of the rainfall. These results indicate that while the \{BBF\} system is useful in decreasing run-off and increasing infiltration of rainfall on Vertic Inceptisols, there is a need to increase light use by soybean on \{BBF\} during the rainy season to increase its productivity. A watershed-based farming system needs to be adopted to capture significant amount of rain water lost as run-off and deep drainage. The stored water can be used for supplemental irrigation to increase productivity of soybean-based systems leading to overall increases in resource-use efficiency, crop productivity, and sustainability.

Using two seasons experimental data, a soybean–chickpea sequencing model was evaluated and used to extrapolate the results over 22 years of historical weather records. The simulation results showed that in 70% of years total runoff for \{BBF\} was greater than 35 mm (range 35–190 mm) compared to greater than 60 mm (range 60–260 mm) for flat on the shallow soil. In contrast on the medium-deep soil it was greater than 70 mm (range 70–280 mm) for \{BBF\} compared to greater than 80 mm (range 80–320 mm) for the flat landform. The decrease in runoff on \{BBF\} resulted in a concomitant increase in deep drainage for both soils.

In 70% of years, the chickpea yields were greater than 500 kg ha−1 (range 500–1500 kg ha−1) for the shallow soil, and greater than 800 kg ha−1 (range 800–1960 kg ha−1) for the medium-deep soil. Total productivity of soybean–chickpea rotation was greater than 3000 kg ha−1 (range 3000–4150 kg ha−1) for the shallow soil and greater than 3450 kg ha−1 (range 3450–4700 kg ha−1) for the medium-deep soil in 70% of years. These results showed that in most years BBF, landform increased rainfall infiltration into the soil and had marginal effect on yields of soybean and chickpea. Crop yields on Vertic Inceptisols can be further increased and sustained by adopting appropriate rain water management practices for exploiting surface runoff and deep drainage water as supplemental irrigation to crops in a watershed setting.

Warm temperatures (most inductive temperatures, mean 23.5°C) hastened the times from sowing to flowering (f) and maturity (m), and between flowering and maturity (fm). Cool temperatures (17.8°C) delayed f, m, and fm but the delay was most pronounced for fm. In the least inductive cool environment, variation in f, m and fm was greatest among 63 lines developed in India. Compared to the most inductive temperature, the delay in cool environment was 2.2 for f, 3.1 for m, and 5.5 for fm, which indicates that fm is the most sensitive phase to low (sub-optimal) temperatures. Equations that describe the rates of development (1/f, 1/m, and 1/fm) were used to determine progress to different stages of development. Results revealed that optimum temperature for fastest time to flowering varied from 23.1 to 26.1°C. The 1/f at mean temperature of 26.8°C was slower, indicating that the mean temperature experienced was supra-optimal. Since the mean temperature of 26.8°C was not very different from the range considered optimal, further analysis revealed that this was mainly due to the high night temperatures. The 1/fm was strong and positive in the range of temperature tested indicating that warm temperatures shortened the duration between flowering and maturity. The optimum temperature range for this effect varied from 24 to 32°C. Cool temperatures at Kabete retarded plant growth while warm temperatures enhanced it. "

Sixteen pearl millet cultivars available to farmers in India were selected to represent three cultivar types: (1) traditional landrace germplasm from the arid/semi-arid millet production zones, (2) improved dual-purpose (grain and stover) open-pollinated varieties incorporating differing amounts of traditional landrace germplasm and (3) commercial, grain-type \{F1\} hybrids, bred for use in the arid/semi-arid zone. The cultivars were grown for 2 years (2000 and 2001) at high fertility (HF: 65 kg N ha−1 and 18 kg P ha−1) and low fertility (LF: 21 kg N ha−1 and 9 kg P ha−1). Within each fertility level high (HP) and low (LP) plant population densities were established by varying sowing rate and then thinning to the target populations (HP: 11 plants m−2 and LP: 5 plants m−2). Stover fodder quality traits (nitrogen concentration, sugar content, in vitro digestibility and metabolizable energy content) were analyzed using a combination of conventional laboratory analysis and near infrared spectroscopy. In general, fertility level and cultivar type had strong effects on grain and stover yields, and on a range of stover nutritional quality traits, but with significant year interactions. In contrast, the effect of population density on these variables was largely insignificant. Higher fertilizer application significantly increased grain and stover yields and stover nitrogen concentration, in vitro digestibility and metabolizable energy content. As a result, fertilization resulted in significant increases in the yields of both digestible and metabolizable stover. Landrace cultivars as a group produced higher quality fodder than modern hybrids, but at a significant cost in grain yield. Dual-purpose, open-pollinated cultivars were generally intermediate between the landraces and hybrids, in terms of both stover quality and grain yield, but produced the highest yields of both digestible and metabolizable stover. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for Indian pearl millet farmers with various resource levels and farming objectives. "

There is however considerable regional variation in the dominant type of crop residue: rice and wheat straws in irrigated regions compared to coarse cereal straws and hay from leguminous crops in the drier, semi-arid regions. This paper synthesizes a series of recent studies on the role and importance of crop residues and farmers’ perceptions of fodder quantity and quality in coarse cereal and groundnut based feeding systems. Crop improvement programs for sorghum, pearl millet and groundnut have traditionally focused on grain/pod yield improvement, pest and water stress tolerance. Only relatively recently have dual-purpose (grain and fodder) plant types been developed. While the nutritive value of fodder from dual-purpose crops can be determined through in vivo and in vitro analysis, such experimental procedures cannot necessarily capture the often-subjective quality attributes that farmers (and their animals) value. Results indicate that farmers perceive a range of quality traits, some of which could be screened for relatively easily, whereas others may be more difficult to assess. These findings highlight the importance of farmer participatory evaluation of fodder traits in the development of improved dual-purpose varieties. However the impact of these varieties on poor farm households will be contingent on the complementary improvement in the effectiveness of seed systems. "

Crop residues (fodder/stover) are important feed resources for ruminants. This review was undertaken with the objective of improving understanding of the role of various crop management factors in affecting the productivity and quality of crop residues. Variability in productivity and quality of residues can be of both genetic and non-genetic origin. Recommended agronomic practices vary according to crop and cultivar and can release the maximum genetic potential determining quantity and quality of residues. Planting method and planting rate recommendations should be followed to maximise productivity. Although low density planting improved fodder quality, fodder yield declined. Time of sowing affected fodder yield in most of the crops, but fodder quality was not generally affected. It was common to observe that application of nitrogen (up to 120 kg ha−1) in cereals and application of phosphorus (up to 60 kg ha−1) in legumes improved the green and dry fodder yields, as well as crude protein (CP), crude fibre (CF) and other quality parameters. Inoculation of cereal seed with nitrogen fixing bacteria such as Azotobacter and seed of pulses with phosphate solubilising bacteria has been reported to decrease fertiliser needs and improve the \{CP\} and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of fodder. Irrigating at more frequent intervals by splitting the same quantity of irrigation water into smaller irrigations and at critical stages improved dry matter and \{CP\} yields. Hand weeding resulted in better weed control efficiency and stover yield than application of herbicides. However, application of herbicides resulted in the greatest benefit:cost ratio. Manual harvesting resulted in lower losses than mechanical harvesting, and may affect quality depending on the extent of loss of different fodder components. Drought stress yielded more digestible organic matter due to increases in the proportion of leaves compared to stems. Saline conditions affected seed germination and crop yields. Several methods are suggested to counteract the effects of salinity. Intercropping of cereals with legumes improved fodder nutritional quality (mostly protein content). In almost all crops, a positive association was found between fodder and grain yield indicating simultaneous improvement in both characters. In most cases, fodder yield and digestibility were positively correlated and showed positive association with plant height, leaf number and the number of tillers per plant, but there were limits and variation among crops. The ICRISAT–ILRI partnership experiments were conducted with a diverse set of sorghum and pearl millet cultivars at ICRISAT, India. Planting density levels in both crops did not influence forage quality although some fodder yield traits were affected. A significant interaction of genotype with planting density was observed for grain and fodder yield in sorghum and grain yield and harvest index in pearl millet. Adherence to recommended crop management practices can potentially facilitate the release of the maximum genetic potential determining quality and yield parameters for improved animal production. "

The ranking of sorghum and millet genotypes by cumulative gas production was consistent throughout the 96-hour fermentation period. However, differences were proportionally greater during the initial 3 and 6 h of fermentation. The multiphase model described by Groot et al. [Groot, J.C.J., Cone, J.W., Williams, B.A., Debersaques, F.M.A., Lantinga, E.A., 1996. Anim. Feed Sci. Technol. 64:77–89] was used to fit the in vitro fermentation gas observations of these substrates, and fermentation kinetics parameters were calculated using the fitted model. The final estimates of the model parameters (A, B, C), tested by varying the initial estimates obtained with the monophasic model by ±50%, were stable, showing no dependence on the starting values of the model parameters. However, in millet stems, the C parameter has shown a tendency to converge near unity. The stability of the final values of the parameters of the model in this study suggests the potential applicability of the multiphase model when only nine gas observations over a period of 96 h were available. However, the indeterminacy in the parameters of phase 1 for some millet stems indicates the need of an intermediate gas value between 0 and 3 h. In both, sorghum and millet the asymptotic gas of the first phase (A1) was negatively correlated with \{NDF\} (r = −0.82, p &lt; 0.05; r = −0.80, p &lt; 0.05, respectively) and lignin (r = −0.86, p &lt; 0.05; r = −0.95, p &lt; 0.01, respectively). The estimated maximum fractional rate of substrate digestion in the second phase (Rm2) showed a strong inverse relationship with lignin (r = −0.93, p &lt; 0.01) in millet but not in sorghum. On the other hand, the time at which the rate of fermentation reached its maximum in phase 1 (tmax1) was negatively correlated with \{ADF\} and lignin (r = −0.88, p &lt; 0.05 and r = −0.87, p &lt; 0.05, respectively) in sorghum, whereas in millet only tmax2 (phase 2) was negatively correlated with lignin (r = −0.88, p &lt; 0.05). Estimated differences in the contribution from the different phases to similar cumulative gas at 48 h in stems of different sorghum genotypes indicate the need to complement measurements of total gas production with selected kinetics parameters. The degree of variability between genotypes observed for kinetics parameters related to both, phases 1 and 2 suggest that these parameters have potential for discriminating feed quality differences between crop residues or plant parts. These results point out the difficulty in finding a single feed quality parameter to be used to rank different crop residues of different genotypes. Additional studies are needed to associate these parameters with voluntary intake and in vivo rumen outflow rates with which these phases could be associated. "

This study investigated the variability in chemical characteristics and digestibility of stovers among 10 `best-bet' sorghum cultivars selected for grain yield with the view to study the merits of selecting among cultivars for feed attributes. Cluster analysis of N, \{ADF\} and \{NDF\} obtained from chemical analyses, and in sacco dry matter digestibility of stovers showed that wide intercultivar variations existed at the three-cluster solution (designated cluster groups III, IV, V). Cultivar BES, the only member of group IV, had a relatively high N content (90 g kg−1 DM), a high 48 h dry matter loss (637 g kg−1 DM) and relatively low \{ADF\} and \{NDF\} values (386 and 598 g kg−1 DM). Members of group V (KSV 8 and Gaya Early) contained the lowest N (67 g kg−1 DM), lowest digestibility coefficient (511 g kg−1 DM) and highest \{ADF\} and \{NDF\} values (466 and 665 g kg−1 DM). Values for members of group \{III\} (ICSV 111, \{ICSV\} 210, \{ICSV\} 247, \{ICSV\} 400, \{ICSH\} 89009NG and \{ICSH\} 89002NG) were intermediate. There were no significant correlations between indicators of nutritive values, grain yield and grain mass. The results suggest existence of variation in indicators of nutritive values within the cultivars to warrant consideration for selection among these for detailed nutritional studies, and that improving the nutritive value in stovers through breeding may not necessarily impair grain yield and grain mass.

abstract = "Publisher Summary Pearl millet is widely grown as a food crop in subsistence agriculture in Africa and on the Indian subcontinent. Pearl millet has a number of advantages that include tolerance to drought, heat, and leached acid sandy soils with very low clay and organic matter content. Its grain is generally superior to sorghum as human food and at least equals maize in value as a feed grain. Whereas, grain is the main purpose of cultivation in Africa and Asia, the forage, or stover, at harvest is an important secondary product in subsistence agriculture for animal feed, fuel, or construction. Two principal types of food are traditionally made from pearl millet porridges and flat unleavened breads. Both of these are made from flour, however, because pearl millet flour deteriorates after a few days and acquires a “mousy” odor, fresh flour must be grounded frequently. Other products include rice-like foods made from pearled grain, couscous, foods from blends with legume flour, and beer. Pearl millet gives a productive pasture for grazing, especially with dwarf varieties, and silage is easily made. Pearl millet is used as a forage crop in the United States, Australia, and southern Africa, but the hybrid with elephant grass (napier grass), P. purpureum Schum., is widely used as a perennial forage crop in east and southern Africa, Brazil, and India where it is principally propagated by cuttings.

Methods for breeding disease-resistant chickpea cultivars are similar to those used for yield breeding, except that the segregating materials have been challenged by the pathogen and selection is made for disease resistance along with other attributes. Some of the techniques employed by breeders include hybridization and mutation. Chickpea is grown primarily by resource-poor farmers on residual moisture with little if any inputs. The short growing season at lower latitudes (0–20◦) also limits yields. The fast-rising temperatures at the reproductive phase force the crop into premature drying. Thus, yields are low (less than one t/ha). At present productivity levels, use of disease-resistant cultivars appears to be the best alternative for management of chickpea diseases. "

Outcomes include two anthropometric indices of short-run nutritional status: body-mass index and age and sex-standardized z scores of mid-arm muscle area. The amount of empowerment of household heads did not affect their nutritional status or other indicators of their well-being, such as income, wealth, expenditures, happiness, social capital, or self-perceived health. It also did not affect the nutritional status of their offspring. Nor did it affect the difference in income, wealth, or monetary expenditures between spouses. The insubstantial effects persisted with other definitions of empowerment or types of regressions. We end with a discussion of why empowerment, despite its popularity in development discourse, has such tenuous links with objective indicators of well-being, and the implication of this finding for future studies of empowerment's effects.

Both agronomic and economic evaluations of an organic amendment called heated sewage sludge (HSS) were conducted in the research station of International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT)–Niamey, Niger, West Africa. For this study, HSS, a material imported from Japan, applied at a dosage application equivalent to 20.0 kg 100 m−2 on lettuce fields led to production levels as high as those of conventional methods, and the yield became even higher than those of conventional methods when the dosage was increased to 50.0 kg 100 m−2 and 100.0 kg 100 m−2. Even though \{HSS\} was imported, its benefits outweighed its cost, as evidenced by the positive net returns. Since profitability in peri-urban horticulture is much higher than that of traditional crop production, the results of this study imply that if adopted, the use of \{HSS\} can lead to increased availability of organic matter for traditional cropping systems.

The considered period extends from January 1992 to December 1995, that is, covering four vegetation cycles. Experimental observations show that \{WSC\} responses at 45° of incidence angle display a marked seasonality associated with the development and senescence of annual grasses during the successive rainy seasons. The interpretation of the σ° temporal plots is performed with the assistance of a semiempirical backscattering model combined with an ecosystem grassland model. Contributions of the various components of the Sahelian landscape to the total backscattering are identified. Overall, the soil contribution is always large but the σ°(45) temporal plots reflect well the vegetation development. The analysis of the different contributions leads to a simplification of the backscattering model. Finally, this latter is parameterized as a function of two surface parameters, namely, the soil volumetric water content and the vegetation biomass. This simplified model allows the vegetation biomass to be estimated with a 33% error. "

The results show that these purchases (as well as those of rice) rise with the opportunity cost of women's time as well as with household income. The results for the two most important coarse grains in the Sahel (millet and sorghum) differ widely, however; while raw millet and processed millet are similarly affected by income and women's opportunity cost of time, the results for raw sorghum are the opposite of those for processed sorghum. Whereas improving sorghum processing will increase total sorghum demand as urban incomes rise, the same cannot be said for millet. Three sets of subsector policies would increase demand for processed coarse grains: (1) promoting access to and use of abrasive-disk dehullers at the semi-wholesale level; (2) promoting improvements in the quality and cleanliness of the grain available to dehullers, and instituting grading by grain quality in the marketing system; (3) increasing consumer information about possible savings realized on purchases of dehulled cereals, via for example, the Malian Market Information System (SIM).

This scheme was derived from measurements of gb, made with heated leaf-replica pairs mounted in the crowns of windbreak trees, and values of bulk aerodynamic conductances for whole trees (ga) in windbreaks, which were determined from the rate of evaporation from two artificially wetted, excised trees, using the hanging-tree technique. Heated pairs of leaf replicas were constructed and tested in a wind tunnel before being deployed in the field. The effects of wind speed (u) on gb in the wind tunnel agreed with expectations based on observations by others of the aerodynamic properties of leaves. Similar responses to wind speed were found when the heated leaf-replica pairs were used in situ; aggregated leaf boundary layer conductances (gbt), calculated by summing gb over the total leaf area of each tree as conductances in parallel, were proportional to uz, where z varied between 0.5 and 0.8, the values expected for laminar and turbulent boundary layers, respectively. In contrast, ga was proportional to u1.1t and was much smaller than gbttb,, even if effects of differences in leaf areas among trees were accounted for. The differences between measured values of ga and gbt were used to derive an empirical model of gac, the conductance for scalar transfer from the limits of the leaf boundary layers to the reference position outside the tree crown. This model can be used to estimate ga from wind speed, so that ga can be estimated by summing, as conductances in series, gac and values of gbt determined from in situ measurements of gb. Thus, at sites where trees are sparsely or non-homogeneously distributed and the cutting of more than a few trees to measure ga is not practicable, heated leaf-replica pairs and the hanging-tree technique can be used together to develop a scheme for scaling gb to the whole tree. This approach should be particularly useful in studies examining energy budgets in agroforestry, horticulture or other settings where trees are isolated or do not form a closed canopy. "

Transpiration by trees in windbreaks, consequently, can be expected to deviate substantially from the equilibrium rate as a result of advection and vertical entrainment, which may therefore influence water budgets for windbreak systems and competitive interactions between trees and crops. To quantify the effects of advection and entrainment on transpiration by windbreak trees, the energy budgets of canopies of Azadirachta indica A. Juss. windbreaks at a site in southern Niger were measured at four different times of year. Each component of the energy budget was determined independently and expressed per unit of windbreak length: net radiation (Rn) was measured using an array of eight linear net radiometers enclosing the windbreak foliage; latent heat fluxes (λAE) were determined by scaling sap flow, measured using the heat-pulse technique, from tree to windbreak length on the basis of leaf area; sensible heat fluxes (H) were determined from measurements of the difference in temperature between the crown of a windbreak tree and ambient air, using aerodynamic conductances estimated by scaling-up in situ measurements of leaf boundary layer conductances; the change in heat storage by the canopy (ΔS) was estimated from changes in wood temperature over time. ΔS was found to be a negligible component of the energy budget of windbreak canopies and comparison of λE + H with Rn showed good agreement. Rn was mostly dissipated as λE during the rainy season and early dry season but as H during the driest period of the year. Examination of exchange fluxes for the windbreaks showed that partitioning of energy by windbreak canopies was strongly affected at all times of year by exchanges of energy between sensible and latent heat at canopy surfaces as a result of advection and entrainment. During moist periods of the year, advection and entrainment enhanced λE relative to λEeq the latent heat flux at equilibrium, by up to 60%, but depressed λE during the driest time of year, so that λE was as low as 40% of ΛEeq Depression of ]glE relative to λEeq by advection and entrainment occurred when surface conductances of the windbreaks were reduced by lack of moisture, whereas λE was enhanced when surface conductances were high. The effects of advection and entrainment on water use by windbreak trees must be accounted for when assessing the wager budgets of windbreak systems, because any reductions in evapotranspiration by crops resulting from shelter may be offset by enhancement of tree transpiration.

Greater emphasis is required on regional strategies for public plant breeding and private seed marketing. National policies need to strengthen input marketing capacity and infrastructure.

Therefore, we conducted a series of experiments to determine the effects of seed size, depth and method of planting, millet variety, pre-sowing tillage, and soil fertilization upon seedling emergence, crop establishment, and yield. All experiments were conducted on a sandy Psammentic Paleustalf in Niger. For all three millet varieties studied, out of a range of sowing depths from 1 to 7 cm, a sowing depth of 3–5 cm resulted in the highest percentage emergence, the highest above-ground biomass, and most secondary roots. High soil temperatures are common during establishment, typical maximum temperatures at a depth of 1 cm exceed 46°C. The adverse effects of wind erosion were least when sowing in hills; establishment, crop stand survival, and yield were better under hill planting than drilling seed. Pre-sowing tillage increased initial stands and their survival, the latter also depending on fertility. Thus, improved crop yields result from better stand survival and higher yields per hill. Fertilizer application of 17 kg ha−1 P and 40 kg ha−1 of N tripled grain yields. Ridging without prior tillage and plowing increased grain and stover yields two- to three-fold. In combination with fertilizer application, sixfold yield increases were obtained. If pre-sowing tillage is considered, then, in view of the time limitations, ridging without prior tillage would be preferable to plowing, as it is a much faster operation giving equally good results in terms of crop establishment and yield.

The \{IGP\} is monotonously flat with a spread of surface soils in hot arid conditions of Rajasthan in west to per-humid conditions in West Bengal. The soil-geomorphology of the \{IGP\} detailed during the last few decades is useful in determining the interrelationship among the pedogenesis, the climate, and the landscape evolution during the Holocene. These studies demonstrate that the \{IGP\} soils developed on five geomorphic surfaces with varying degree of development. Soils occurring on older geomorphic surfaces (&gt; 2.5 ka) are polygenetic with a distinct record of climatic changes and neotectonics. The present synthesis is based on recent developments in pedology achieved through macro- and micromorphology, clay mineralogy, pedogenic calcrete, and polygenetic pedogenic features of the \{IGP\} soils. A critical evaluation of the \{IGP\} soils has helped to comprehend the subtle nuances of the pedogenic processes that were also influenced by anthropogenic activities and cultivation over this vast agricultural tract during the Holocene. We provide state-of-the-art information on the pedology, polygenesis, and soil degradation (natural and anthropogenic) over the last 10 ka. The review has potential as a reference for critical assessment of the pedosphere for health and quality in different parts of the world.

The study reported here was conducted to assess the influence of dead level contours and infiltration pits on in-field soil water dynamics over two growing seasons. A transect consisting of six access tubes, spaced at 5 m interval, was established across each dead level contour with or without an infiltration pit before the onset of the rains. Two access tubes were installed upslope of the contour while four tubes were installed on the downslope side. Dead level contours with infiltration pits captured more rainwater than dead level contours only resulting in more lateral soil water movement. Significant lateral soil water movement was detected at 3 m downslope following rainfall events of 60–70 mm/day. The 0.2–0.6 m soil layer benefited more from the lateral soil water movement at all the farms. Our results suggest that dead level contours have to be constructed at 3–8 m spacing for crops to benefit from the captured rainwater. It is probably worth exploring strip cropping of food and fodder crops on the downslope of the dead level contours and infiltration pits using the current design of these between-field structures. With the advent of in situ rainwater harvesting techniques included in some conservation agriculture practices it will benefit smallholder cropping systems in semi-arid areas if these between-field structures are promoted concurrently with other sustainable land management systems such as conservation agriculture.

The estimation of variance components in genetically broad-based populations provides information about their genetic architecture, allowing the design of an appropriate biofortification breeding method for cross-pollinated crops such as pearl millet. The objective of this study was to estimate intra-population genetic variance using self (S1) and half-sib (HS) progenies in two populations, \{AIMP92901\} and ICMR312. Field trials were evaluated in two contrasting seasons (2009 rainy and 2010 summer; otherwise called environments) in Alfisols at ICRISAT, Patancheru. Analyses of variance showed highly significant variation for \{S1s\} and \{HS\} progenies, reflecting high within-population genetic variation for both micronutrients and other key traits. However, the \{HS\} showed narrow ranges and lower genetic variances than the \{S1\} for all of the traits. The micronutrients were highly positively correlated in \{S1\} (r = 0.77 to 0.86; P &lt; 0.01) and \{HS\} (r = 0.74 to 0.77; P &lt; 0.01) progenies of both populations, implying concurrent genetic improvement for both micronutrients. The genetic variance component was different among populations for Fe and Zn contents across environments, with \{AIMP92901\} showing a greater proportion of dominance and \{ICMR312\} greater additive variance for these micronutrients. The estimates of variance (additive and dominance) were specific for each population, given their dependence on the additive and dominance effects of the segregating loci, which also differ among populations. The possible causes for such differences were discussed. The results showed that the expression of these micronutrients in pearl millet shows largely additive variance, so that breeding high-iron hybrids will require incorporation of these micronutrient traits into both parental lines.

A residue amount of 2000 kg ha−1 reduced the extent of covered millet, but did not provide complete protection during severe sand storms.

Grain production, averaged over two years, was about 500 kg ha−1 for the control, 570 kg ha−1 with 500 kg ha−1 residue, and 730 kg ha−1 with 2000 kg ha−1 residue. Increased yields were caused by both wind erosion protection and direct growth stimulating effects of residue. Stover yields for all treatments in both years were less than 2000 kg ha−1 and thus insufficient to sustain the levels required for protection of crops against wind erosion damages. An increase in dry matter left in the field or the implementation of alternative wind erosion control measures is needed for sustainable crop production in wind-erosion-affected areas. "

Data on milk off-take for human consumption are difficult to collect in household surveys for a number of reasons which make accurate recall challenging for the respondent (continuous production and seasonality among others), introducing possibly severe biases in the computation of full household incomes and farm sales, as well as in the estimation of the contribution of livestock (specifically dairy) production to agricultural value added and the livelihoods of rural households. This paper presents results from a validation exercise implemented in Niger, where alternative survey instruments based on recall methods were administered to randomly selected households, and compared to a 12-month system of physical monitoring and recording of milk production. The results of the exercise show that reasonably accurate estimates via recall methods are possible, and provide a clear ranking of questionnaire design options that can inform future survey operations.

The CSM-CERES-Sorghum model was used to quantify the potential benefits of altering crop life cycle, enhancing yield potential traits, and incorporating drought and heat tolerance in the commonly grown cultivar types at two sites each in India (cv. \{CSV\} 15 at both Akola and Indore) and Mali (cv. \{CSM\} 335 at Samanko and cv. \{CSM\} 63E at Cinzana), West Africa. Under current climate \{CSV\} 15 on average matured in 108 days and produced 3790 kg ha−1 grain yield at Akola; whereas at Indore it matured in 115 days and produced 3540 kg ha−1 grain yield. Similarly under current climate, \{CSM\} 335 matured in 120 days and produced 2700 kg ha−1 grain yield at Samanko; whereas \{CSM\} 63E matured in 85 days at Cinzana and produced 2210 kg ha−1 grain yield. Decreasing crop life cycle duration of cultivars by 10% decreased yields at all the sites under both current and future climates. In contrast, increasing crop life cycle by 10% increased yields up to 12% at Akola, 9% at Indore, 8% at Samanko and 33% at Cinzana. Enhancing yield potential traits (radiation use efficiency, relative leaf size and partitioning of assimilates to the panicle each increased by 10%) in the longer cycle cultivars increased the yields by 11–18% at Akola, 17–19% at Indore, 10–12% at Samanko and 14–25% at Cinzana under current and future climates of the sites. Except for the Samanko site, yield gains were larger by incorporating drought tolerance than heat tolerance under the current climate. However, under future climates yield gains were higher by incorporating heat tolerance at Akola, Samanko and Cinzana, but not at Indore. Net benefits of incorporating both drought and heat tolerance increased yield up to 17% at Akola, 9% at Indore, 7% at Samanko and 16% at Cinzana under climate change. It is concluded that different combinations of traits will be needed to increase and sustain productivity of sorghum in current and future climates at these target sites and that the CSM-CERES-Sorghum model can be used to quantify benefits of incorporating certain traits.

We describe the world's semi-arid and dry sub-humid savannah and steppe regions as global hotspots, in terms of water related constraints to food production, high prevalence of malnourishment and poverty, and rapidly increasing food demands. We argue that major water investments in agriculture are required. In these regions yield gaps are large, not due to lack of water per se, but rather due to inefficient management of water, soils, and crops. An assessment of management options indicates that knowledge exists regarding technologies, management systems, and planning methods. A key strategy is to minimise risk for dry spell induced crop failures, which requires an emphasis on water harvesting systems for supplemental irrigation. Large-scale adoption of water harvesting systems will require a paradigm shift in Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM), in which rainfall is regarded as the entry point for the governance of freshwater, thus incorporating green water resources (sustaining rainfed agriculture and terrestrial ecosystems) and blue water resources (local runoff). The divide between rainfed and irrigated agriculture needs to be reconsidered in favor of a governance, investment, and management paradigm, which considers all water options in agricultural systems. A new focus is needed on the meso-catchment scale, as opposed to the current focus of \{IWRM\} on the basin level and the primary focus of agricultural improvements on the farmer's field. We argue that the catchment scale offers the best opportunities for water investments to build resilience in small-scale agricultural systems and to address trade-offs between water for food and other ecosystem functions and services.

India has been promoting integrated watershed management in drought-prone areas to address these constraints. Watershed communities are being assisted to invest in groundwater re-charging facilities. While communities and the public bear such costs, individual farmers capture irrigation benefits. Groundwater is a free common property resource and land users hold de-facto use rights. This has accelerated private irrigation investments and depletion of aquifers resulting in iniquitous distribution of irrigation water. Power subsidies and negligible pumping costs aggravate the problem. These policy failures and low irrigation costs to farmers are displacing water-efficient crops in favor of water-intensive crops in water-scare areas. The paper reviews the village-level externalities that aggravate groundwater depletion and evaluates potential policy options to enhance local collective action in water management. Using 3SLS, an econometric crop-water productivity model is used to evaluate alternative water policy instruments. The results indicate that different types of water user charges can be introduced with modest consequences on profitability and farm incomes. If properly implemented and managed by the local communities, pro-poor policies could bring considerable sustainability benefits and also ensure enhanced equity in access to the resource. "

Three esophageally fistulated steers were used in a cross-over design to sample diet selected by tethered and herded animals.

Tethered animals selected diets of lower organic matter digestibility (OMD) but tethering had no significant effect on crude protein. Close herded steers consistently consumed more forage than those tethered in both periods. Both grazing method and duration had significant effect on ingestion rate by the steers. Tethered steers had lower average daily gain than those herded. The results demonstrate that the common practice of tethering sedentary cattle in the wet season in the southern Sahel in West Africa reduces forage intake and consequently average daily gain. "

It integrates results from different sources of data and analysis: 1. Spatial stratification using secondary data for \{GIS\} layers: Maize mega-environments combined with recommendation domains for dual-purpose maize were constructed for Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, stratifying the countries by demand factors (livestock densities and human population densities) and feed availability. Relative biomass contributions to feed resources from rangelands were compared to those from croplands to explore the usefulness of global datasets for feed supply estimations. 2. Verification through farming systems analysis: the potential demand for maize residues as feed (maize cropping patterns, maize yields and uses, feed deficits) was compared at contrasting sites, based on household survey data collected on 480 households in 2010. 3. Maize cultivar analysis: Genotypic variability of maize cultivars was compared to evaluate the potential contribution (stover quantity and quality) of dual-purpose maize to reduce feed deficits. The study results illustrate high spatial variability in the demand for and supply of maize residues. Northern Malawi is characterized by high livestock density, high human population density and high feed availability. Farmers achieve maize yields of more than 2 t/ha resulting in surplus of residues. Although livestock is important, southwest Zimbabwe has low livestock densities, low human populations and low feed availability; farming systems are more integrated and farmers make greater use of maize residues to address feed shortages. Central Mozambique also has low cattle densities, low human populations and low feed availability. More rangelands are available but maize yields are very low and livestock face severe feed shortages. The investigation of 14 advanced \{CIMMYT\} maize landraces cultivars and 15 advanced hybrids revealed significant variations in grain and stover yield and fodder quality traits. Where livestock densities are high and alternative feed resources are insufficient, maize cultivars with superior residue yield and fodder quality can have substantial impact on livestock productivity. Cultivars at the higher end of the quality range can provide sufficient energy for providing livestock maintenance requirements and support about 200 g of live weight gain daily. Maize cultivars can be targeted according to primary constraints of demand domains for either stover quantity or stover fodder quality and the paper proposes an approach for this based on voluntary feed intake estimates for maize stover.

Yields have become stagnant and legumes are frequently advocated as an affordable option for resource poor farmers, to enhance productivity. Farmer participatory research was employed to test legume intensification as a means to improve maize-based systems in Malawi. A range of options were evaluated, from grain/legume intercrops of long-duration pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) rotated with maize (Zea mays), to a relay green manure system of maize with Tephrosia vogelii (Fishbean). Two years of on-farm experimentation indicated that under on-farm conditions legume-intensified systems produced residues that contained about 50 kg N/ha per year, two-fold higher than sole-cropped maize residues. Grain yields from legume-intensified systems were comparable to yields from continuous sole maize, even in a dry lakeshore ecology. These preliminary findings were linked to farmer assessment, where farmers participating in the trials expressed strong interest in the technologies. Yet the probability of adoption remains uncertain. Associated surveys outlined constraints and trade-offs underlying technology choice, information that is not usually considered in conjunction with on-farm trials. Although the legumes were highly productive, farmers expressed worries about the marginal loss of maize production. While the trial performance was similar across regions, differences in market condition, farm resources and household composition appears to stimulate different technology choices. Farmers weigh the benefits of weed suppression and potential cash earnings, against the costs of seed, problems of seed access, labor requirements and problems of grain market access and price. Surveyed farmers commonly manage residues by burning. Promotion and experimentation with more efficient use of legume residues may offer higher short-term impacts than efforts to promote adoption of another cash crop. Ultimately, adoption and soil fertility benefits may depend on market returns to legume production. This study documents the value of researchers and farmers partnering in evaluation of technologies, adoption constraints and competing technology choices. "

Field corralling of cattle left between 1.5 and 17 Mg ha−1 of manure on limited areas of the fields.

The overall trend in land use confirmed the historical increase of the cropped areas since mid 20th century, at an annual rate of 2% from 1994 to 2006. This trend is the result of changes in the relative extent of fields permanently cropped and fields under shifting cultivation, and for the latter, the relative proportion of short (3 years) and long (10 years) duration fallows. Type of land use together with topography and soil type determine the herbaceous production and the resulting yield measured towards the end of the wet season. The variation in site yields between years is of the same order of magnitude as the variation in yields between sites within a year. There is an overall decreasing trend in site yields by 5% annually from 1994 to 2006 that is not explained by variations in rainfall. The decreasing trend is observed on fields under shifting cultivation, fallowed fields and rangelands, although not all sites are equally affected. Causes are likely to be multiple which might include changes in land use, decline of soil fertility and increased grazing pressure. Indeed, the remaining rangelands on marginal land and the fallows still accessible to livestock are subject to such a heavy grazing during the rainy season that the herbaceous standing mass measured at the end of the season reflects poorly the actual production. After the two first years of cropping, the herbaceous yield in fields under shifting cultivation with no fertilisation is negatively affected by the number of successive years of cropping. Moreover, clearing fallow after a decreasing number of years affects the mean herbaceous yield of fallowed fields by reducing the contribution of more productive old fallows. Changes in land use, grazing pressure and soil fertility also triggered changes in species composition with a strong reduction in diversity from rangelands to fallows, and again from fallows to cropland weeds. No correlations was found however between productivity and species composition. Cumulative rainfall does not explain between site or between year deviations in herbaceous yield even when sites are sorted by land use type or by soil type in the case of fallow and rangelands. Simulated production calculated with the \{STEP\} model does not explain herbaceous yields much better even when sites are grouped by land use and soil type. However, relative changes of herbaceous yields are reasonably predicted on sites that remained fallowed and were not heavily grazed for at least four consecutive years. "

Among the several factors limiting their productivity, weeds account for about 40%. In order to meet the requirements of growing population, it is essential to improve productivity by reducing such unwarranted losses. Managing weeds with crop competition is an eco-friendly approach. Once the mechanisms of competition are understood, further improvements in weed control could be gained by manipulating other agronomic practices. The choice of cultivars, crop density, seeding rate, direction of planting, and intercropping could be exploited to enhance crop competitiveness against weeds. The variation in competitiveness and weed suppression among cultivars has been documented in rice, and to a lesser extent in wheat and maize. Research has demonstrated that the integration of crop competitiveness with other methods, such as the use of herbicides and manual weeding, is successful in managing weeds. However, in India, greater efforts are needed to exploit crop competitiveness for managing weeds in rice, wheat and maize. The success of these approaches relies on proper understanding of the biology and ecology of weeds, to identify weak points in their life cycle. "

Therefore, to minimize health related hazards from exposure to aflatoxin contaminated food, information on the prevalence and distribution of aflatoxins (AFB1) in the groundnut value chain in Mali is needed for timely interventions. To this end, a study was undertaken in three districts (Kayes, Kita and Kolokani) to assess aflatoxin contamination in the field and storage. Ninety pod samples in each district were collected from fields (30 villages/district and 3 samples/village) during 2009 and 2010. Pre-harvest contamination was estimated at harvest, whereas samples for post-harvest contamination were collected from granaries of the same farmers at a monthly interval for 3 months. The villages in each district were categorized into safe, acceptable, moderate risk and high risk areas based on pre-harvest \{AFB1\} levels. Kayes recorded more pod samples (77%) within 20 μg/kg of pre-harvest aflatoxins followed by Kolokani (55.6%) and Kita (45.6%) based on 2009 and 2010 mean values. Toxin concentrations at harvest were comparatively less in Kayes during both years. Further, Kayes had more villages under safe and acceptable limits when compared to Kolokani and Kita. Overall, 46 out of 90 villages in the three districts had acceptable pre-harvest toxin limits. Further, 12 villages in Kolokani were in the high risk category. An increase in toxin levels was noticed with period of storage during both years. Comparatively, toxin levels after storage were least in Kayes during 2009. Kayes also recorded less \{AFB1\} levels in 2010 after Kita. Our results indicate that Kayes is relatively safe over Kita and Kolokani in pre-harvest aflatoxin contamination. The reasons for district-wide variations in pre-harvest contamination; and the reasons for post-harvest flare up of the problem are discussed. Further, proper storage of pods at farmers' granaries in Mali is suggested to overcome the problem from reaching alarming levels. "

Washed cores of soil and a trench profile technique were used to measure the root length and spatial distribution of roots. These measurements were then analysed to assess whether intercropping changed the size of the root system and whether intermingling of roots from the two crop species occurred. Monocropped millet produced a longer root length per unit ground area than monocropped groundnut (3500 m m−2 compared with 2500 m m−2) and also rooted deeper (90 cm compared with 70 cm). The distribution of root length also differed for the two monocrops while the intercrop appeared intermediate both in total length and in its distribution. Observations made in trenches confirmed the greater length of the millet root system compared with the groundnut and indicated that roots in adjacent rows of millet and groundnut in the intercrop were mixing mid-way through the growing season. This suggests that root interaction between crops may occur during intercropping; it is unlikely, however, that this was a major factor contributing to the increased yields measured in this experiment. Criteria for assessing yield advantages in intercropping are discussed briefly. Two different assessments showed that intercropping resulted in additional root growth, and during the later stages of growth produced 10–15% more root length as compared to the monocrop. "

The short-day treatment was the normal winter/spring day at Hyderabad (latitude 17° N). Long-day conditions were achieved by extending the days to 22.00 h. Kylar was applied at the rate of 1 kg/ha a.i. at early pod-set. Cultivar variability for photoperiod responses was found in both subspecies for pod yield. While four cultivars achieved greater pod yields (38–106%) under short-day conditions, TMV-2 and Robut 33-1 had slightly increased yield in long days. Kylar decreased the differences in yield created by the two daylengths. Change in the proportion of large (&gt; 19/64 × 34″; &gt; 7.5 × 19 mm) seeds was the main factor responsible for the yield differences resulting from the photoperiodic treatments. The Kylar-treated plants produced more large kernels. Generally, the shelling percentages were increased by the Kylar short-day treatments. Only TMV-2 had a significantly increased shelling percentage under long-day conditions. At final harvest all cultivars, except for TMV-2, had accumulated higher levels of vegetative dry matter in the long-day treatment.

The intercrop row arrangement was 1 millet : 3 groundnut and intra-row spacing of each species was the same in monocrop and intercrop. The results for \{PAR\} were compared with similar measurements of total solar radiation. A linear relation was found between the logarithms of the transmission coefficients in the two wavebands. The relation was independent of both age and structure of the canopies and was used to convert measurements of total solar radiation into quantities of \{PAR\} intercepted by the crops. Dry weight of monocropped millet increased linearly with intercepted \{PAR\} during the vegetative and much of the reproductive phases. In contrast, dry weight of monocropped groundnut only increased linearly in the vegetative phase. During the first half of pod filling, there was no increase in dry weight despite a substantial quantity of \{PAR\} interception. In the second half, dry weight of the groundnut increased by a further 30%. Similar relations were observed for the two components of the intercrop. On the basis of a Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) intercropping gave 28% more total dry matter (LER = 1.28) than growing the two crops separately. The processes producing the intercropping advantage are separated by defining two ratios; the Resource Capture Ratio (RCR) and the Conversion Efficiency Ratio (CER). These ratios compare, on a per plant basis, the performance of the component species in the intercrop relative to their respective monocrops in terms of the interception of radiation and the production of dry matter/unit of radiation intercepted, respectively. Per row, the millet intercepted 2.1 (RCR = 2.1) times more \{PAR\} in the intercrop than in the monocrop and used it with a similar efficiency (CER = 0.97) to produce twice as much dry matter.

Two irrigation treatments were applied: a ‘wet’ treatment in which water stress was kept to a minimum by frequent irrigation; and a ‘dry’ treatment which received less water. On the basis of a Total Crop Performance Ratio (tcpr) the wet intercrop gave only 3% more total dry matter (tdm) than the two crops separately, whereas in the dry treatment the advantages was 21%. However, reproductive yield advantages were 14% and 88% in the wet and dry treatments, respectively, and resulted from larger harvest indices in the intercrops. Intercropped sorghum produced more tdm tha would be expected if intercropping had no effect, while intercropped groundnut produced less. Leaf area indices were smaller than expected in all intercrop components. However, sorghum intercepted more radiation per unit row in the intercrop than in the sole crop, but used it to produce dry matter less efficiently when water was plentiful. Groundnut intercepted less radiation than expected, but used it with greater efficiency in both wet and dry treatments. As well as intercepting more radiation, intercropped sorghum also used it more efficiently when water was limited, suggesting that sorghum was able to compete more successfully for soil water with groundnut in the intercrop than with itself in the sole crop.

There were large differences in plant temperature and water status between ‘wet’ and ‘dry’ stands throughout the post-rainy season, but mean differences between sole crops and intercrops within each water regime were small. However, shading of groundnut by sorghum in the intercrop ameliorated to some extent the effects of high temperature and water stress, especially in the droughted stands.

Puddling is traditionally done to reduce water loss from lowland rice fields. Since the very step of puddling, rice root zone undergoes structural changes leading to the formation of a layered profile having a hydraulically less-conductive plow sole below the root zone. However, studies have shown that soil cracking and the presence of preferential flow paths in puddle fields defeat this purpose. Description of soil water regime in such a dynamic soil requires an in situ measurement method for soil hydraulic properties. A field experiment was conducted in twelve 30 m2 plots during the rainy seasons (June to October) of 2004 and 2005 to evaluate a suitable method for estimating soil hydraulic properties of lowland paddy soil. Results showed that piezometric (pressure) heads installed in different soil layers responded to the drying and wetting cycles typically followed in transplanted rice and are observed as a part of monsoon climate in eastern India. The Marquardt–Levenberg algorithm built in the HYDRUS-1D simulation environment was used to inversely estimate soil hydraulic parameters. Estimated parameters revealed larger hydraulic conductivity for the compacted plow sole than those published in literature, which may have resulted from alternate wetting and drying typically observed under monsoon climate and earthworm burrows observed in our experimental field. Results from simulation studies suggest that both the single- and dual-porosity models could simulate water flow considerably well in lowland paddy field although the latter described pressure head time series data slightly better in about 50% of simulations. Similar performance of the single- vs. dual-porosity model may have resulted from estimating a seasonally mean soil hydraulic properties which include the effect of both preferential flow and matrix flow as the specific soil and boundary conditions prevailed. While water may have preferentially transported through the macropores during the wetting cycles in a near-saturated soil, it would have dominantly moved through soil matrix during the drying cycles. This study shows that simple piezometers may be combined with a simulation model to estimate hydraulic properties of different soil layers in a lowland paddy field. "

The development of both public irrigation in the Jordan Valley and private groundwater schemes in the highlands has diverted a large share of the country's water resources to agriculture. Many policy instruments have been used in the last 10 years to reallocate water to nonagricultural uses and encourage improvements in efficiency throughout the water sector. Demand management has been emphasized, with water pricing policies expected to instill conservation and motivate a shift toward higher-value crops. We examine the rationale for, and potential and current impact of, pricing policies in the Jordan Valley. We describe the likelihood of success of such policies in terms of operation and maintenance cost recovery, water savings and improved economic efficiency, and we explore some of the alternatives available for meeting these objectives. We show that while operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs can be recovered higher water prices have limited potential for achieving gains in irrigation efficiency. The current system of quotas, the lack of storage, and technical difficulties experienced in the pressurized networks indicate that little water can be saved. More substantial increases in water prices can be expected to raise overall economic efficiency by motivating farmers to intensify cultivation, adopt higher-value crops, improve technology, or rent out their land to investors. Yet such strategies are constrained by lack of capital and credit, and pervasive risk, notably regarding marketing. Pricing policies, thus, are best implemented together with positive incentives that reduce capital and risk constraints, and offer attractive cropping alternatives or exit options with compensation.

abstract = "Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R.Br.) were grown together in an alley cropping system in a semi-arid area of India. The five treatments included sole millet (SM), sole leucaena (SL) planted in double rows to form hedges with an alley width of 2.8 m, and alley cropping treatments LM5, \{LM6\} and \{LM6P\} with alley widths of 2.8, 3.3 and 3.3 m, respectively. Millet rows within the alleys were spaced at 47 cm, giving five rows in \{LM5\} and six rows in both \{LM6\} and LM6P. \{LM6P\} differed from \{LM6\} in that a vertical polythene barrier separated the root systems of leucaena and millet to a depth of 50cm. Light interception, wind speed, saturation deficit and air, soil and leaf temperatures were monitored during the 1986 and 1987 rainy seasons in treatments SM, \{SL\} and LM5. This paper describes the experimental design and instrumentation and presents representative diurnal time courses illustrating the nature of the microclimatic changes associated with alley cropping. These indicate that alley cropping altered the microclimate experienced by millet to an extent which depended on its proximity to the hedge, hedge shape and the relative size of the two components. The larger leucaena canopy in 1987 than in 1986 resulted in more substantial reductions in wind speed and incident light in the alleys of \{LM5\} as compared with SM. Leaf and soil temperatures within the alleys tended to be warmer during the night and cooler during the day than in \{SM\} and temperature differences between rows within \{LM5\} were related to the degree of shading by leucaena. Analysis of integrated data predicted little effect of the observed changes in saturation deficit on the productivity of millet, while thermal time analysis for 1987 suggested a 2—3 day delay in flowering for millet adjacent to the hedge as compared with sole millet.

The five treatments included sole millet (SM), sole leucaena (SL) planted in double rows to form hedges with an alley width of 2.8 m, and alley cropping treatments LM5, LM6, and \{LM6P\} with alley widths of 2.8, 3.3 and 3.3 m and five, six and six rows of millet, respectively. \{LM6P\} differed from \{LM6\} in that a vertical polythene barrier separated the root systems of leucaena and millet to a depth of 50 cm. Dry matter production and light interception data for millet and leucaena are presented to allow comparison of light capture and utilisation efficiency by the two species under contrasting hedge management in the rainy seasons of 1986 and 1987. Dry matter yields of leucaena did not differ significantly between treatments in either rainy season, but were much higher in 1987 than in 1986 because of the less severe lopping regime. The higher yields in 1987 resulted from a greater mean fractional light interception by leucaena, which increased shading of alley cropped millet when compared with 1986. The dry matter yields of millet in treatments \{LM5\} and \{LM6\} were reduced relative to the sole crop in both years. In 1986, this reduction appeared to result primarily from shading, while in 1987 the mean fractional light interception and the pre-anthesis conversion coefficient were both lower in \{LM5\} than in SM. Above- and below-ground competition interacted in 1986, so that when root competition was reduced (LM6P) the millet was able to grow taller, eventually matching the leucaena in height and partially escaping the shading and yield reduction experienced in \{LM5\} and LM6. In 1987, the hedges were always more than 1 m taller than the millet and the root barrier failed to remove the detrimental competition between leucaena and millet. "

During the growing season, the accumulated sand captured at 0.1 m above the soil surface attained 1262 kg m−2 vertical sampler opening. Ninety per cent of the millet pockets sown with the first rains were covered at 22 days after emergence and the crop was resown. During one single wind erosion event, 384 kg m−2 of sand was trapped and 40% of all millet pockets were totally covered. Surviving plants from the partially covered pockets showed delays in growth and development. The maximum plant height and leaf number were lower with a significant reduction in the leaf area index. Grain yield from unaffected pockets was nearly twice that of the pockets which were partially covered. Protection measures against wind erosion may have a potential to stabilize millet production in the Southern Sahelian Zone. "

Modeled K was compared to K estimated from neutron probe readings at 1.4 m; and modeled moisture retention was compared to lab measurements derived from the hanging water column method and pressure plate apparatus for the following depth intervals: 0–30, 30–60, and &gt; 60 cm at Banizoumbou; and 0–30, 30–120, and &gt; 120 cm at Bagoua. The Campbell \{PTF\} resulted in lower root mean square error (RMSE) (0.05–0.06 m3 m− 3) for soil moisture retention for the three depth intervals at the two sites and performed better than the van Genuchten function (RMSE 0.06–0.07 m3 m− 3) for Bagoua soils which had higher sand content. The van Genuchten \{PTF\} consistently overestimated dry regime moisture retention for the three depth intervals especially at Bagoua but performed well for the wet regime. The Campbell and Vauclin \{PTFs\} underestimated K (RMSE 0.61–1.01 mm d− 1) at both sites whereas the van Genuchten model was close to field measurements (RMSE 0.26–0.47 mm d− 1). These results show that the Campbell model is a cheaper alternative to direct measurement of moisture retention and the van Genuchten function can be used to estimate K for Niger's sandy soils with modest accuracy.

It was observed that state \{III\} and state \{IV\} respiration, respiratory control index (RCI), and P/O ratios were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by methylparathion and carbofuran under in vitro and in vivo conditions.

Daily rainfall data were collected from five meteorological stations located in southern Zimbabwe. Results indicated that no significant changes in the start, end and subsequent length of growing season occurred over the past 50–74 years. There was no significant change in the number of wet days per season over the period reviewed. There is a high probability of 14 and 21 day dry spells during the peak rainfall months. The relationship between start and end of growing season is stronger as aridity increases. We conclude that growing seasons have not changed significantly over the past 50–74 years in southern Zimbabwe. As smallholder agriculture continues to be affected by dry spells and droughts, there is scope in exploring rainwater management technologies in rainfed cropping systems. "

These are analysed in relation to biological and environmental variables. At leaf scale, the flux is most strongly influenced by photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and stomatal conductance. Together with measurements of canopy structure at each site, the measurements of leaf photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and stem respiration were used to parameterise sub-models within the canopy model MAESTRO, which predicts canopy net \{CO2\} flux. Comparison of the independent canopy flux measurements with predictions is informative, as the model represents an integration of our knowledge of the system, and so differences highlight weak points in our understanding as well as measurement artefacts. These differences are largest in tiger bush and smallest in millet, and are attributed to the effect of canopy heterogeneity on measurements rather than biological processes. Generally, good agreement was found at all three sites and the model can be regarded as validated. The model was used to extrapolate measurements in time, and, using a year's weather data, predicted a value for carbon sequestration at the millet site over the growing season very close to harvest measurements.

One “quick-win” proposal is replenishment of soil nutrients for smallholder farmers, through free or subsidised chemical fertilisers. Other proposals include appropriate irrigation technology, improved inputs and interventions targeted at women. Analysis of over 10 years of agro-hydrological and agro-economic studies from southern African show that a different approach is required to interventions proposed. There are sustainability problems with free chemical fertiliser due to transport costs and ancillary costs. Furthermore, recent studies in Zimbabwe and Mozambique show that significant increases in yield can only be obtained when soil fertility management is combined with good crop husbandry, e.g. timely planting and weeding. Ongoing replenishment of fertility would be dependent on a continued free or subsidised fertiliser supply, and transport system. Increasing access to irrigation will help, but is not the only solution and cannot reach even a majority of farmers. It has been determined that short dryspells are often the major cause of low yields in sub-Saharan Africa. Soil–water conservation approaches, e.g. winter weeding and conservation tillage, can reduce risk and increase yield. The following specific recommendations are made for urgent interventions to contribute sustainably to food security in southern Africa: (i) To increases access to fertiliser, consider development of strong input markets at end-user level. (ii) Intensification of technology transfer, focusing on capacity building for transfer of existing technologies and much closer collaboration between state and \{NGO\} sectors, agronomists and water engineers. (iii) Increasing the uptake of soil–water conservation methods, including conservation tillage and weeding, and supplementary irrigation to minimise adverse effects of dryspells, through investments in farmer training. (iv) Linking crop development strategies to livestock development practices and strategies. (v) Developing non-agro-based livelihood strategies in marginal lands. "

The objective of this work was to modify a spatially referenced Water and Nitrogen Management Model (WNMM) to account for the spatial pattern of subsoil salinity, by adjusting crop water uptake, in order to explain the spatial variation in wheat yield in this area. Measurements of above-ground biomass and yield of wheat, and the profile of soil salinity (0–80 cm) were made at 40 locations across an 88 ha paddock (35.78°S, 142.98°E) in the Victorian southern Mallee. The S-shaped water stress response function for crop water uptake proposed by van Genuchten (1987) was explored to modify the \{WNMM\} by adjusting the water uptake due to salinity, which significantly improved yield simulation over the original WNMM. The improvement in the model's ability to simulate wheat yield indicates that the subsoil salinity limits crop performance in the area. The incorporation of a salinity function in spatial crop models offers potential for simulating yield across a landscape and thus practicing precision agriculture provided salinity impact is considered dynamically.

This lack of development, particularly in southern Africa, is of growing concern from both an agricultural and environmental perspective. To address this lack of progress, two development paradigms that improve land and water productivity have evolved, somewhat independently, from different scientific constituencies. One championed by the International Agricultural Research constituency is Integrated Natural Resource Management (INRM), whilst the second championed predominantly by Environmental and Civil Engineering constituencies is Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). As a result of similar objectives of working towards the millennium development goals of improved food security and environmental sustainability, there exists a nexus between the constituencies of the two paradigms, particularly in terms of appreciating the lessons learned. In this paper lessons are drawn from past \{INRM\} research that may have particular relevance to \{IWRM\} scientists as they re-direct their focus from blue water issues to green water issues, and vice-versa. Case studies are drawn from the management of water quality for irrigation, green water productivity and a convergence of \{INRM\} and \{IWRM\} in the management of gold panning in southern Zimbabwe. One point that is abundantly clear from both constituencies is that ‘one-size-fits-all’ or silver bullet solutions that are generally applicable for the enhancement of blue water management/formal irrigation simply do not exist for the smallholder rainfed systems.

abstract = "The surface hydrology of a semi-arid area of patterned vegetation in south-west Niger is described. In this region alternating bands of vegetation and bare ground aligned along the contours of a gently sloping terrain give rise to a phenomenon known as `brousse tigrée' (tiger bush). At the selected study site the vegetation bands are 10–30 m wide, separated by 50–100-m-wide bands of bare ground. Five species of shrub dominate, Guiera senegalensis, Combretum micranthum, C. nigricans, Acacia ataxacantha and A. macrostachya. Herbaceous vegetation is generally limited to the upslope edges of vegetation bands. A comprehensive field programme was undertaken to investigate the hydrology. Topographic, vegetation and surface feature surveys were carried out in conjunction with the measurement of rainfall, surface and subsurface hydraulic conductivity, particle size and soil moisture content. Four types of vegetation class are recognised, each tending to occupy a constant position relative to the others and to the regional slope. In a downslope direction the classes are: bare ground, grassy open bush, closed bush, bare open bush, bare ground etc. The nature of the ground surface is closely linked to the vegetation class. Over the bare, bare open and grassy open classes various types of surface crust are present with each type of crust tending to occupy a constant position on the regional slope relative to the vegetation class and other crust types. Below closed bush crusts are generally absent. The typical downslope sequence from the downslope boundary of a vegetation band is: structural (sieving) crust→erosion crust→(gravel crust)→sedimentation crust→microphytic sedimentation crust→no crust→sieving crust, etc. It is also shown that these crust types are dynamic and evolve from one to the other as hydrological conditions change. Hydraulic conductivities of surface crusts are low, typically falling within the range 10−6–10−7 m s−1. The presence of large expanses of crust over bare regions tends to generate run-off, which moves down the regional slope to be intercepted and pond within and just upslope of vegetated areas. Such run-off concentrates rainfall by a factor of up to 3.7 below vegetated areas. This concentration combined with an absence of crust development in closed bush areas promotes rapid infiltration below and just upslope of vegetation bands. In this way the hydrology of the area operates to ensure that the bulk of the rain which falls is directed as quickly as possible to the areas where it is most needed to support the existing vegetation.

The root xylem of plants showing wilt symptoms was heavily occluded by hyphae. Hyphal occlusion of stem xylem was also recorded up to the fifth internode. The roots of resistant cultivars were penetrated but hyphal growth was very slow. No localized cell death (hypersensitivity) or gross structural changes (lignification) were observed in the vicinity of invading hyphae in resistant cultivars, suggesting that the resistance was dependent upon chemical rather than physical mechanisms. The concentration of the pterocarpans medicarpin and maackiain in the roots increased in the presence of two races of the pathogen. Both pre- and post-induction concentrations of pterocarpans were significantly greater in wilt-resistant cultivars indicating an association between phytoalexin induction and resistance. Medicarpin and maackiain showed antifungal activity toF. oxysporumf.spciceriat similar concentrations to those recorded in wilt-resistant chickpea roots. No significant difference in the sensitivity of races 1 and 2 to the antifungal activity of the pterocarpans was detected, but the accumulation of phytoalexins in response to the more virulent pathotype race 2 was lower in all cultivars than those produced in response to race 1.

Leaf curl induction occurred only in hosts effectively nodulated by this strain. A plasmid-cured, non-nodulating derivative failed to induce leaf curl symptoms. The strain \{IC3342\} competed poorly with fast- and slow-growing root-nodule bacteria, but the observed nodule occupancy of 10% was enough to produce leaf curl symptoms. Suppression of nodule development by added inorganic nitrogen also prevented symptom expression. Approach grafting of a healthy pigeonpea plant and a plant with leaf curl symptoms resulted in the development of leaf curl symptoms on the growing shoots of the healthy plant within 8 days of graft union. Further symptom expression ceased after graft separation. Feeding xylem sap from the leaf curled plant to a healthy plant induced the initial symptom of the syndrome, bending of the growing leaf tip.

None of the \{SSRs\} detected polymorphism in the M. grisea isolates from pearl millet. Seventeen \{SSR\} markers were polymorphic in the 65 non pearl millet isolates and detected 105 alleles, of which one was rare, 83 common, 9 frequent and 12 most frequent. A model-based population structure analysis of the genomic data identified two distinct populations with varying levels of ancestral admixtures among the 65 M. grisea isolates. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that 52% of the total variation among the isolates used in this study was due to differences between the pathogen populations adapted to different hosts, 42% was due to differences in the isolates from the same host, and the remaining 6% due to heterozygosity within isolates. High genetic variability present in M. grisea isolates calls for the continuous monitoring of M. grisea populations anticipating blast resistance breakdown in finger millet cultivars grown in India.

One hundred and nine chickpea genotypes with moderate levels of resistance (BGM severity ≤5.0 on a 1–9 scale) were selected from the preliminary evaluation of 412 genotypes including germplasm and breeding lines under controlled environmental conditions in 2004–2005 at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru, India. In order to validate resistance stability, an ‘International Botrytis Grey Mould Nursery’ (IBGMN) was constituted with 25 genotypes and tested in multi-environments for \{BGM\} resistance at two locations (Gurdaspur and Pantnagar) in India for 4 years and two locations (Tarahara and Rampur) in Nepal for 3 years.

Haulm nitrogen contents ranged from 1.94 to 2.88% and from 1.81 to 2.66% while in vitro digestibility ranged from 57.3 to 64.3% and from 59.5 to 64.2% under water restriction and fully irrigated conditions, respectively. Under fully irrigated conditions haulm nitrogen content and in vitro digestibility were mildly, but significantly inversely, related to pod yields with the two haulms traits accounting for 5 and 4% of the variations in pod yields. However, potential trade-offs between haulm traits and pod yields became more pronounced under water stress where variations in haulm nitrogen content and in vitro digestibility accounted for 40 and 28% of the variations in pod yields, respectively. For haulm nitrogen content and in vitro digestibility no significant interactions were observed between cultivar and treatment suggesting stability of haulm fodder traits across poorer and better water management practices. These results demonstrate that breeding for fodder traits in groundnut can be parallel to breeding for productivity traits, although careful choice of cultivars with high fodder trait value would be needed under water stress conditions.

Among them, three distinct \{SMD\} isolates have been characterized, viz., Patancheru, Bangalore and Coimbatore. Molecular tools offer a viable option to tackle these biotic stresses via identification of the genomic regions associated with the trait such as \{SMD\} resistance.

After screening over 3000 \{SSR\} markers on parental genotypes of each mapping population, intra-specific genetic maps comprising of 11 linkage groups and 120 and 78 \{SSR\} loci were developed for \{ICP\} 8863 × \{ICPL\} 20097 and \{TTB\} 7 × \{ICP\} 7035 populations, respectively.

The minicore (n = 211) chickpea germplasm collection has been evaluated over three years for drought tolerance index (DTI), calculated as the standard residuals, through a regression approach considering drought yield as a function of days to flowering, yield potential and the residual or drought response, in the short season environment of South-India. The minicore collection accessions exhibited large range of variations for days to 50% flowering (26–78 d) and maturity (70–120 d), shoot biomass (1500–4940 kg ha−1) and seed yield (210–2730 kg ha−1) under drought. The heritability for the shoot biomass and seed yields under drought stress (shoot biomass 0.118–0.461; seed yield 0.511–0.795) were relatively higher than that under optimally irrigated environment (shoot biomass 0.232–0.447; seed yield 0.322–0.631). Both the seed yield under drought and \{DTI\} showed significant accession × year interaction. A categorization of the \{DTI\} using a cluster analysis has revealed five major groups with 5 accessions in highly tolerant group, 78 in tolerant, 74 in moderately tolerant, 39 in sensitive and 20 in highly sensitive groups. \{ICC\} 4958, a previously identified drought tolerant genotype, was among the moderately tolerant while Annigeri, a well-adapted cultivar, was in the tolerant group. Though the heritability of \{DTI\} was slightly lesser than that of the yield, the \{DTI\} represented terminal drought tolerance per se, and was independent of phenology and yield potential influences.

A trait-based selection approach can achieve further gains in drought tolerance that has been achieved through direct selection for yield. Separation of yield into its components including the rate of partitioning and its duration could permit a better focus on the most relevant trait for yield enhancement under terminal drought. Current work is aimed at understanding the importance of rate of partitioning or the partitioning coefficient (p) as a major contributory trait associated with drought tolerance both in germplasm and breeding lines. A reference collection of chickpea germplasm (n = 280) was evaluated in the field under both terminal drought and optimally irrigated environments; and a set of desi (n = 60) and kabuli (n = 60) advanced breeding lines under terminal drought. Grain yield was associated with its analytical components – crop growth rate (C), reproductive duration (Dr) and p. The path analysis showed that C and p had a large direct positive contribution to yield while Dr had a marginal but negative contribution to yield under drought. The direct contribution of p was the highest but it was marginally reduced by the indirect negative contributions of Dr. However, the total contributions of p to grain yield remained large. The yield of germplasm accessions under drought across the seasons were closely associated (r2 = 0.70) and also the genotype × year interaction was minimum. The contribution of C, Dr and p to grain yield were similar in the advanced breeding lines. However, kabuli breeding lines had a larger variation for p than the desi lines. The results suggest that a conscious selection for greater p will confer greater tolerance to abiotic stresses, given that terminal drought tends to curtail the length of the reproductive period. "

This is partly because the formal seed systems are not always effective in meeting demand for new seed varieties. Sometimes informal seed recycling and exchange of improved sorghum varieties will take place alongside formal initiatives, as is the case in southern Mali. Focusing on one particular village in the Dioïla district, we analyze the efficacy of farmers’ strategies for preserving varietal seed purity and genetic integrity of an improved inbred-line (Soumba variety). Six seed lots of Soumba, recycled for two to six years by farmers using different practices, were collected and assessed in on-station trials in order to compare their agronomic performance and phenotypic purity (off-type plant frequencies) with control versions of the variety. Additionally, 30 panicle samples were randomly collected from five farmer fields sown with recycled Soumba and assessed for phenotypic purity in a progeny nursery and investigated for molecular diversity using 12 \{SSR\} markers. A total of 150 panicles from five other non-Soumba varieties were collected in the village in order to investigate eventual gene flow and its potential genetic consequences for the Soumba variety. In fields sown with recycled Soumba seed, between 2% and 14% of plants showed phenotypic deviations from the typical Soumba variety. The progeny nursery and \{SSR\} marker analysis verified the presence of the off-type plants observed in the field. The \{STRUCTURE\} program revealed admixtures with other varieties in 23% of Soumba plants, confirming the presence of gene flow. Gene diversity values in Soumba samples ranged from 0.006 for the commercial sample to 0.257 for recycled samples. Introgression and contamination were best minimized when (1) farmers had received specific training in seed production, (2) they could take advantage of isolated fields and (3) they could practise true-to-type panicle selection. Farmers were generally able to maintain the phenotype, as well as sustain or even improve yield performance of their Soumba variety while at the same time genetically enriching their seed stock. "

Defining site-specific fertiliser strategies based on field trials and crop modelling may help to improve the ecological efficiency of this crop. However, no model has been evaluated for winter oilseed rape that simulates the growth of the plant as limited by the interaction of water and N. In this study, the \{APSIM\} canola model which was originally developed for the temperate regions of Australia, was adapted for conditions in Germany and tested against measured data (total biomass, grain yield, leaf area index, N-uptake and soil mineral N) at three sites near Göttingen (northern Germany). In the second part of the study, the evaluated model was used in a simulation experiment to explore site-specific climate and soil related production limitations to match fertiliser rates to yield targets. Historical weather data from four sites across northern Germany and a fertile loamy soil with different rooting depths, implicating different plant available water capacities, were used. Model results showed large differences in yield (up to 1000 kg ha−1) and N-balance (&gt;30 kg ha−1) for 200 kg N-fertiliser rate ha−1 between restricted (50 cm) and unrestricted rooting depths. Simulated yields for such high N-fertiliser rate were lower for sites with continental climate than for sites close to the coast, reflecting different rainfall patterns. Results indicate that water supply plays a critical role when maintaining high N use efficiency and reaching simultaneously grain yields of 4000 kg ha−1. "

When crop residues were applied as mulch, dry matter yield was increased to the same extent by 2 t and 6 t ha−1. Similar dry matter yields were achieved with crop residues (-P) to those with P fertilizer only. An additional yield increase could be obtained by simultaneous application of crop residues and P. Without crop residues, potassium (K) concentrations in the shoot dry matter indicated K deficiency. With crop residues considerable amounts of K (15 kg t−1) were provided and raised the K concentrations in the plants to the sufficiency range. Although with crop residues some P was provided (1.5 kg t−1), the beneficial effects were primarily attributed to increased P acquisition by the millet plants, which was reflected in enhanced root growth in the topsoil (0–10 cm).

The model was calibrated using the crop growth and phenology data of groundnut (cv. Robut 33-1) obtained from the 1987 and 1991 rainy season experiments. In these experiments groundnut was grown at plant populations ranging from 5 to 45 plants/m2 with and without irrigation. Changes were made in the cultivar-specific coefficients related to the light penetration into the crop canopy and dry matter production. The model was validated against independent data obtained from a 1992 rainy season experiment. In 1992, groundnut was grown at plant populations ranging from 10 to 40 plants/m2 and at row spacings of 20, 30 and 60 cm. The model predicted the occurrence of vegetative and reproductive stages, canopy development, total dry matter production and its partitioning to pods and seed accurately. Maximum leaf area index observed during the season was significantly correlated with simulated values (r2 = 0.95). In spite of some incidence of diseases and pests, the correlation between simulated and observed pod yield was significant (r2 = 0.61).

Half of the crop was irrigated while the other half received no water after panicle initiation. Soil water content, stomatal conductance and stem extension were measured periodically. A potential-driven water uptake model, which assumes a static, exponential distribution of roots and couples transpiration to leaf water potentials, described in both seasons the observed pattern and timing of water uptake, as well as predawn leaf water potential and actual transpiration. As the soil dried, estimated transpiration declined below potential transpiration and modeled and measured predawn leaf water potential declined. There was close agreement between observed and modeled predawn leaf water potential and soil water uptake. Analysis using the model indicated that decreased water uptake at depth was attributable to root distribution throughout the soil profile, as well as to low root length density at depth. "

These farmers are more interested in relatively good yields in poor rainfall years (a satisfactory level of ‘assured’ production) than in good average yields. Although soil and crop growth variability limit bumper harvests, they may also reduce the risk of poor harvests and consequent food supply problems.

Four different sequences were obtained from the seven isolates on sorghum or pearl millet, which differed from four sequences previously published for Polymyxa species and obtained for P. graminis isolates on barley, oat and wheat originating from temperate areas in Europe and America (two distinct sequences), for isolates on rice from Colombia and for P. betae isolates on sugar beet from several origins. The sequence variations concerned mainly the composition and length of \{ITS1\} and \{ITS2\} regions. Phylogenetic trees built with the distinct sequences currently known for Polymyxa spp. using parsimony, maximum likelihood and neighbour-joining methods separated P. betae from P. graminis. Within P. graminis, the hierarchy of the clustering partially matched the host range and geographical origin of the isolates. These results confirm the great diversity within P. graminis that has already been observed in host range and temperature requirements studies, and provide new arguments for considering several taxa within the species. On the basis of the ecological requirements and rDNA sequences of distinct P. graminis isolates, five special forms are proposed: P. graminis f. sp. temperata, P. graminis f. sp. tepida, P. graminis f. sp. subtropicalis, P. graminis f. sp. tropicalis and P. graminis f. sp. colombiana.

The varietal differences in soil phosphorus uptake and partitioning of the crop are well documented, but the mechanism of carbon distribution between the source and sink at low P supply is not understood. In the present study, the effect of a low P supply on the distribution of photosynthetic carbon of one high-yielding improved hybrid cultivar, \{ICPH\} 8 and two low-yielding non-hybrid cultivars, \{ICPL\} 87 and \{UPAS\} 120, were compared by feeding the plants 13CO2 at the vegetative and reproductive stages of development. A low P supply significantly decreased plant biomass, P uptake, average leaf area and photosynthetic activity of all genotypes; the decrease was smallest in \{ICPH\} 8 and largest in \{UPAS\} 120. \{ICPH\} 8 retained more plant biomass at low P supply due to higher P-absorption capacity rather than high P-utilization efficiency. The tolerance of \{ICPH\} 8 to low P is mostly related to its maintenance of a high leaf area and rate of photosynthesis. In contrast, P deficiency severely reduced leaf initiation of the sensitive cultivar \{UPAS\} 120, and reduced its photosynthesis. Under limiting P supply, partitioning of 13C increased in favor of the roots in all cultivars, but the resistant cultivar \{ICPH\} 8 partitioned less 13C to roots, and invested more in shoot growth compared to the non-hybrid cultivars. Similarly, partitioning of 13C to the raceme was greater in \{ICPL\} 87 than in the highly sensitive \{UPAS\} 120. It is concluded that P deficiency affects primarily sink activity by restricting cellulose biosynthesis in the meristematic sink cells. "

Measurements of root distribution showed that roots of Leucaena leucocephala Lam. trees are abundant in the top 30 cm of the soil and the presence of a root barrier was effective in restricting lateral movement of the roots. This evidence is contrary to the assumption that trees have deep rooting systems which do not compete with crops.

The differences observed in the two morphs of C. chinensis and ascribed to the flight and flightless forms, are thought to be adaptations for survival and propagation under field and storage conditions, respectively. The predominance of emerged adults of the flightless forms from dry seed and the flight forms from green pods were associated with low moisture content in dry seed and high moisture content in green pods, respectively. These observations show that bruchid control measures are needed in the field as well as in storage. "

The inclusion of legumes in \{RWCS\} assumes a great significance to restore soil fertility. But farmers in the \{IGPR\} rarely grow legumes in the system. We, therefore, carried out farmers’ participatory diagnostic survey in the Upper Gangetic plain zone (UGP) to understand farmers’ fertilizer management practices for wheat (Trititicum aestivum L. Emend Fiori &amp; Paol) following rice (Oryza sativa L.) or pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan(L.)Millsp). The survey indicated that most of the farmers in \{UGP\} grew pigeonpea in place of rice under \{RWCS\} as only a break crop at a 2–3 year interval. The farmers applied, on average, 11 kg N ha−1 and 24 kg P ha−1 to wheat sown after rice, and 12 kg N ha−1 and 19 kg P ha−1 to wheat sown after pigeonpea. Wheat yields, however, were lower (3.3 t ha−1) when sown after pigeonpea than after rice (3.7 t ha−1). The survey was followed by a field experiment at Modipuram (29° 4′ N), Meerut, India that continued during the three consecutive years (1998–1999 to 2000–2001) to examine the effect of inclusion of pigeonpea in place of rice on soil fertility, N and P use efficiency and yields of wheat. In 1998–1999, wheat yields after pigeonpea were lower than after rice, but improved significantly (p &lt; 0.05) by 11.4–15.1% in pigeonpea plots compared with those in rice plots during 1999–2000 and 2000–2001, respectively. The use efficiency of applied N and P fertilizers in wheat, measured as agronomic efficiency and apparent recovery, was increased with combined use of fertilizer N and P at recommended rate, and also with inclusion of pigeonpea in place of rice. The post-wheat harvest NO3–N in soil profile beyond 45 cm depth was significantly greater under rice–wheat system than under pigeonpea–wheat system, suggesting that inclusion of pigeonpea may help in minimizing NO3–N leaching to deeper profile layers beyond root zone. Similarly, in the treatments receiving both 120 kg N and 26 kg P ha−1, NO3–N beyond 45 cm soil depth was lower compared to those receiving N or P alone. Inclusion of pigeonpea in place of rice enhanced carbon accumulation in the soil profile. The available P content was, however, invariably low under pigeonpea plots as compared to that under rice. With continuous rice–wheat cropping, the bulk density (BD) of soil was increased, especially in the 30–45 cm soil profile. Inclusion of pigeonpea in the system not only helped maintaining soil \{BD\} at initial level in the surface (0–15 cm) soil layers, but also in decreasing (p &lt; 0.05) \{BD\} in sub-surface layers (15–30 cm and 30–45 cm). Compared to rice, a statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) positive effect of pigeonpea on root volume (58%) and root weight (99.5%) of succeeding wheat was also recorded. The net economic returns under pigeonpea–wheat system were greater compared with rice–wheat system. "

Difficulties encountered by selected models such as CERES-sorghum and \{STICS\} to simulate crop development may result from the representation of sorghum response to daylength during the photoperiod inductive phase. Four modeling approaches combining two temperature and photoperiod responses (linear, hyperbolic) and two calculation methods for development rates (cumulative, threshold) were evaluated to simulate time to panicle initiation (PI) in highly photoperiod sensitive Guinea sorghum variety CSM388. In the cumulative method, development rates were computed as summations of daily photothermal ratios, whereas in the threshold method accumulated degree days were tested against thermal time requirement to \{PI\} modulated by current photoperiod. Each model was calibrated based on observations from a Sotuba, Mali (12°39′N) planting date experiment spanning a 2-month period in 1996. Observed time from emergence to \{PI\} decreased from 54 to 22 days for a 20 min variation in daylength. Apparent higher performance by threshold methods was further tested against a 1994 independent dataset featuring three latitudes and a much wider range of sowing dates extending from February to September. Results validate the superiority of threshold over cumulative methods and confirm the better fit of a hyperbolic temperature and photoperiod response. A threshold–hyperbolic modeling approach is believed to be more consistent with crop physiology as it associates cumulative (temperature) processes and trigger (photoperiod) events that better reflect the concepts of quantitative plant growth and qualitative plant development. Its mathematical form and computational simplicity should ensure wide applicability for varietal screening over a large range of photoperiod sensitivities including neutral cultivars, and easy implementation into existing models.

Benth. has been hampered by the difficulty of evaluating host resistance in the field and lack of reliable screening techniques. Therefore, we investigated the value of various indirect and direct measures of Striga resistance as selection traits. Two sorghum recombinant inbred populations of 226 F3:5 lines each were developed from the crosses (1) \{IS\} 9830×E 36-1 and (2) N 13×E 36-1. Striga-resistant line \{IS\} 9830 is characterized by low stimulation of Striga seed germination, whereas Striga-susceptible line E 36-1 produces germination stimulants in abundance. Line N 13 possesses “mechanical” resistance and probably also an antibiosis mechanism. Resistance was assessed in 1997 and 1998 using in vitro agar-gel assays with Striga seeds from Kenya, Mali, and Niger, pot trials in the respective three countries, and field experiments in Kenya and Mali. The agar-gel assay proved to be a useful, precise and fast indirect selection method to screen for sorghum entries with the low-stimulant character. However, correlation analysis showed that this resistance mechanism was ineffective in some environments, especially in Kenya, pointing to the necessity of field evaluation. Because of low heritability estimates and moderate to low correlations to Striga resistance under field conditions, pot screening appeared to be of limited use in breeding programs. The field trials confirmed the effectiveness of several direct measures of Striga resistance in sorghum: emerged Striga counts, Striga severity index, and area under the Striga number or severity progress curves. A two-row plot field layout with an empty row between plots, coupled with artificial infestation of test rows, lattice design and six replications offered an improved screening procedure that achieved high heritability. Significant genotype×environment interactions in the field experiments stress the importance of multi-locational trials to achieve stable Striga resistance. "

Identification of plant traits related to increased productivity under water-deficit conditions could be used to increase yields in these water-limited environments. Two traits were examined among 17 peanut genotypes. Transpiration efficiency (TE), ratio of mass increase to water transpired, was the first trait examined. \{TE\} was measured both under well-watered conditions (greenhouse) and soil drying (outdoors in pots) conditions. Virtually no difference was observed in \{TE\} among genotypes under well-watered conditions indicating the gas exchange properties were similar. However, under soil drying conditions there were substantial differences among genotypes. These results indicated that \{TE\} with drying soil might interact with traits associated with water loss on drying soils. Therefore, the second trait examined in this study was the fraction transpirable soil water (FTSW) content at which the decline in transpiration with soil drying was observed. This greenhouse experiment showed large variability among the 17 genotypes. A second-order polynomial described the relationship between \{TE\} under soil drying conditions and the threshold for the decline in transpiration. The \{FTSW\} for maximum \{TE\} was 0.55, but this value is expected to depend on the environmental conditions to which the plants influence TE. "

A 15-parent diallel cross was evaluated under one low nitrogen stress and one optimal nitrogen environment each at Harare (Zimbabwe) and Bako (Ethiopia). Most \{QPM\} hybrids showed higher protein quality levels than the best non-QPM check under both conditions. Protein concentration tended to vary across nitrogen levels, but not endosperm type. Significant differences were found for the test of main effect (nitrogen-level) for endosperm modification and tryptophan concentration. This indicated that \{QPM\} maintains quality even under low soil nitrogen, a widespread condition in Africa. General combining ability (GCA) mean squares were highly significant for most protein quality traits for each environment and across environments whereas specific combining ability (SCA) mean squares were not significant in most cases. This indicated that additive gene effects were primarily responsible for variation of most traits evaluated and hence progeny performance can adequately be predicted on the basis of parental performance. Inbred lines P2, \{P4\} and \{P12\} had desirable \{GCA\} effects for endosperm modification while \{P1\} and \{P3\} had the best \{GCA\} for tryptophan concentration in grain.

Two conservation tillage methods (ripping and planting basins) combined factorially with seven mulch levels (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 10 t ha−1) were compared with conventional mouldboard ploughing. The experiment was run for four consecutive growing seasons allowing for a rotation of maize, cowpea, sorghum and maize in some fields used in the study. Crop yields were determined across all tillage and mulch combinations in each year. Tillage system had no significant effect on maize yield while maize grain yield increased with increase in mulch cover in seasons that had below average rainfall. Mulching at 2–4 t ha−1 gave optimum yields in seasons with below average rainfall. Tillage system and mulching had no significant effect on cowpea yield when soil moisture was not limiting. However, the ripper and basin systems had 142 and 102% more cowpea grain than the conventional system in 2006/2007 because of differences in planting dates used in three systems and poor rainfall distribution. The conventional and ripper systems gave 26 and 38% more sorghum grain than the basin system. Rotating maize with cowpea and sorghum resulted in 114, 123 and 9% more grain than first year maize, maize–maize monocrop and maize–cowpea–maize in the conventional system.

Examples of application in each of these modes are presented.

This paper presents an analysis of yield components for pearl millet, to explain the specific adaptation of local landraces to stress environments in Rajasthan, India. Six genotypes, ranging from high-tillering traditional landraces to low-tillering open-pollinated modern cultivars, were grown in 20 experiments, covering a range of non-stress and drought stress patterns. In each experiment, yield components (panicle number, grain number, 100 grain mass) were measured separately for main shoots, basal tillers, and nodal tillers. Under optimum conditions, landraces had a significantly lower grain yield than the cultivars, but no significant differences were observed at yield levels around 1 ton ha−1. This genotype×environment interaction for grain yield was due to a difference in yield strategy, where landraces aimed at minimising the risk of a crop failure under stress conditions, and modern cultivars aimed at maximising yield potential under optimum conditions. A key aspect of the adaptation of landraces was the small size of the main shoot panicle, as it minimised (1) the loss of productive tillers during stem elongation; (2) the delay in anthesis if mid-season drought occurs; and (3) the reduction in panicle productivity of the basal tillers under stress. In addition, a low investment in structural panicle weight, relative to vegetative crop growth rate, promoted the production of nodal tillers, providing a mechanism to compensate for reduced basal tiller productivity if stress occurred around anthesis. A low maximum 100 grain mass also ensured individual grain mass was little affected by environmental conditions. The strategy of the high-tillering landraces carries a yield penalty under optimum conditions, but is expected to minimise the risk of a crop failure, particularly if mid-season drought stress occurs. The yield architecture of low-tillering varieties, by contrast, will be suited to end-of-season drought stress, provided anthesis is early. Application of the above adaptation mechanisms into a breeding program could enable the identification of plant types that match the prevalent stress patterns in the target environments. "

abstract = "In Asia, like elsewhere, the use of genetic resources has been limited in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) breeding programs, resulting in a narrow genetic base of cultivars. Utilization of exotic germplasm in breeding programs is needed to enhance the diversity of cultivars. Core collections, which generally contain 10% of total accessions and represent the diversity of the entire collection, have been suggested as a means to enhance the use of genetic resources. For traits of economic importance, which often display high genotype × environment interactions, multienvironment evaluation is required to choose desirable parents. The groundnut core collection for Asia, consisting of 29 accessions of subsp. fastigiata var. fastigiata, 245 of subsp. fastigiata var. vulgaris, and 230 of subsp. hypogaea var. hypogaea, along with four control cultivars, was evaluated in multienvironments for 22 agronomic traits to select diverse superior germplasm accessions for use as parents in improvement programs. Data were recorded for 12 traits in six environments, eight traits in four environments, and for two traits in two environments. Analysis of data, using the residual maximum likelihood (REML) approach, indicated that variance components due to genotypes were significant for all 22 traits, and genotypes × environment interaction was significant for eight traits. Estimates of broad sense heritability ranged from 35.5% for pod yield per plant to 98.0% for days to cessation of flowering, indicating relative reliability of selection for different traits. On the basis of performance compared to control cultivars in different environments, 15 fastigiata, 20 vulgaris, and 25 hypogaea accessions from 14 countries were selected. The selected accessions and control cultivars were grouped using scores of the first 15 principal components (PCs) in fastigiata, 20 \{PCs\} in vulgaris, and 21 \{PCs\} in hypogaea. The clustering by Ward's method indicated that the selected accessions were diverse from the control cultivars. These 60 diverse parents will provide the germplasm, which can be used in the improvement programs to broaden the genetic base of groundnut cultivars. "

However, owing to lack of appropriate management practices, the production and the area under cultivation of groundnut have remained low. Mulches increase the soil temperature, retard the loss of soil moisture, and check the weed growth, which are the key factors contributing to the production of groundnut. On-farm trials were conducted in northern Vietnam to study the impact of mulch treatments and explore economically feasible and eco-friendly mulching options. The effect of three mulching materials (polythene, rice straw and chemical) on weed infestation, soil temperature, soil moisture and pod yield were studied. Polythene and straw mulch were effective in suppressing the weed infestation. Different mulching materials showed different effects on soil temperature. Polythene mulch increased the soil temperature by about 6 °C at 5 cm depth and by 4 °C at 10 cm depth. Mulches prevent soil water evaporation retaining soil moisture. Groundnut plants in polythene and straw mulched plots were generally tall, vigorous and reached early flowering. Use of straw as mulch provides an attractive and an environment friendly option in Vietnam, as it is one of the largest rice growing countries with the least use of rice straw. Besides, it recycles plant nutrients effectively. "

This paper addresses the effect of important diseases of groundnut and sorghum on pod and grain yield and crop residue yield and quality. In four genotypes of groundnut, late leaf spot (Phaeoisasariopsis personata) and rust (Puccinia arachidis) are the two major foliar diseases that together could reduce pod and haulm yield by 70% and in vitro digestibility of haulms by 22%. Two genotypes (ICGV 9202 and 92093) were highly resistant to these foliar diseases maintaining high pod and haulm yield as well as high in vitro digestibility of haulms (&gt;62.3%) even under highest disease pressure. Important diseases in sorghum investigated were a viral disease caused by maize stripe virus (MStV) and anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum graminicola. \{MStV\} reduced grain yield by 30%, stover yield by 42% and digestible stover yield by 45%. Effects of \{MStV\} were highly genotype-dependent and grain and stover were affected in different ways in different varieties. The choice of appropriate genotype for a given farming situation will depend on trade-off scenarios for benefits from grain and stover. Similarly, anthracnose could reduce grain yield by 47% and stover yield by 23% but effects on stover quality were variable. As observed for MStV, effects of anthracnose were highly genotype-dependent and genotypes were identified that maintained high grain and stover yield under high disease pressure. "

Stover from 12 genotypes of sorghum and six genotypes of pearl millet grown under high and low fertilizer application was investigated for nitrogen, cell wall constituents, sugar, plant height, stem diameter, leaf number per plant and extent and rate of in vitro gas production of whole stover and of stover cell walls. Organic matter digestibility, organic matter intake, digestible organic matter intake (DOMI) and cell wall digestibility were measured in bulls. Significant genotypic variation was found for chemical, morphological and in vitro fermentation characteristics of stover but their relationship with digestibility and intake measurements was generally poor. While no single chemical, morphological or in vitro measurement described stover quality adequately, some combinations of these measurements resulted in good overall relationships with stover quality measurements. Across sorghum and pearl millet, 71% (P&lt;0.0001) of the variation in stover cell wall digestibility in bulls was accounted by the lag phase of in vitro gas production from cell wall preparations and by acid detergent lignin and acid detergent fiber content of stover. In pearl millet, 98% (P&lt;0.0001) of the variation in \{DOMI\} in bulls was accounted for nitrogen, lag phase and maximum rate of gas production and neutral detergent fiber content. The paper further discusses relationships between indirect animal performance measurements such as digestibility and voluntary feed intake (VFI) and animal productivity, e.g. live weight gain. \{VFI\} is shown to be a more crucial quality assessment in crop residues than digestibility and the relationship between both measurements was shown to be poor. It is argued that crop improvement programs should validate laboratory techniques as well as indirect animal performance measurements with direct animal performance measurements such as milk or meat production before deciding on laboratory selection criteria.

All traits except leaflet width, number of primary branches, nodes on main stem, nodes on cotyledonary branches, total and mature pods, and length of primary and cotyledonary branches, pod length and width, and seed length and width showed genotype×season interaction. The fastigiata and hypogaea groups differed significantly for all traits except one trait each in the rainy season at Raichur and post-rainy season at Kawadimatti and five traits in the post-rainy season at Raichur. The hypogaea group took longer to flower, had more primary branches, longer primary and cotyledonary branches, more nodes on cotyledonary branches, more total pods, mature pods and pegs per plant, longer and wider pods and heavier seeds than the fastigiata group. The range for most traits was different in the two groups. There were significant phenotypic correlations among the various characteristics. Three of these, between number of total pods and mature pods, number of total pods and pegs, and number of mature pods and pegs had values greater than 0.707 (r2=50%) in both the fastigiata and hypogaea groups and in the entire regional collection. Principal component analysis showed that 20 agronomic traits were important in explaining multivariate polymorphism. Pod yield per plant did not significantly account for variation in the first five principal components of fastigiata and hypogaea types as well as for the entire regional collection in either season or location, indicating its relatively low importance as a descriptor. Average phenotypic diversity index was similar in both groups. The Shannon–Weaver diversity index varied among traits between the two groups, and the diversity within a group depended on location, season, and traits recorded. "

Fodder quality of stover was assessed by digestibility and intake measurements in bulls. In sorghum, highly significant genotype-dependent variation was found for GY, \{SY\} and fodder value of stover regardless of level of fertilizer application. \{GY\} and fodder quality of stover were not inversely related and the genotype with the highest GY, for example, had also the best fodder quality in the stover. High \{GY\} and high fodder quality in sorghum stover seem to be compatible traits. In pearl millet, genotypic variation in \{GY\} and \{SY\} and quality was expressed under \{HF\} but not under \{LF\} application. No consistent significant genotypic differences were found for fodder quality measurements in pearl millet except for cell wall digestibility. Digestible organic matter intake (DOMI) when bulls were fed to appetite was considered the crucial determinant of stover quality in sorghum and pearl millet. Live weight changes in bulls estimated by \{DOMI\} varied genotype-dependently from −140 to +100 g per day in 300 kg bulls. However, this paper argues that genotypes promoting high \{DOMI\} are only suitable for farmers with sufficient amounts of stover to allow the feeding of animals to appetite. Farmers with restricted amounts of stover are better served by genotypes that promote high digestibility under restricted feed intake. "

An experiment was conducted at Lucydale, Matopos Research Station, between 2002 and 2005. The model was used to simulate soil and plant responses in the experiment. Sequences of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) were used in the rotations. Legumes accumulated up to 130 kg of N ha−1 which was potentially available for uptake by sorghum in the following season. The \{APSIM\} model predicted total biomass, grain and N yields of the legume phase within the experimental error and performed well in predicting sorghum yield and N supplied in the rotation after cowpea and groundnut. The model generally under-predicted sorghum total biomass and grain yield after pigeonpea. Observed patterns of crop water use, evaporative losses during the dry season and re-charge of soil profile at the start of the rainy season were generally well predicted by the model. An assessment of output on sorghum N and water stresses in the rotation indicated that the legume–cereal rotation is more driven by soil nitrogen availability than water availability even under semi-arid conditions. Further legume–cereal rotation analysis using the model will assist in the understanding of other processes in the rotations in dry environments. "

In pearl millet stems, lignin and esterified p-coumaric acid (pCA) were significantly different between genotypes. In sorghum, N, lignin and phenolic acids—except esterified pCA were significantly different between genotypes. Except at 12 h for sorghum, gas production of walls was significantly different between genotypes and ranked genotypes differently than gas of stems. Soluble sugars in the stems of both pearl millet and sorghum were positively correlated to gas production at 12, 24, and 36 h, and vice versa for cell walls. In pearl millet, phenolic acids were not significantly correlated with either gas production of whole stems or that of walls, with the exception of etherified pCA of walls. On the other hand, in sorghum, etherified pCA of stems and walls were negatively correlated with gas at 72 and 96 h. The significant differences of gas production between genotypes, different ranking of genotypes with the progression of the fermentation, and the gas production differences between whole stems and walls indicate the differential effect of soluble sugars and of cell wall type on the digestibility of whole stems. This study points out the need to look in greater details at the relationship and the interactions between the effects of soluble and structural carbohydrates in stovers and the genetic base that determines it. Such studies could identify the most adequate combination of traits useful in crop improvement programs taking into account feed value of stover of dual-purpose crops. "

Interspecific hybridization is difficult among the peanut species in the genus Arachis, but breeding populations derived from crossing A. hypogaea L. with related species are being evaluated for farmer use. The cultivated peanut, A. hypogaea, is a major crop in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Germplasm resources of wild Arachis species are difficult to maintain due to specialized adaptations to many environments. It is found that because of distribution patterns and probable centers of origin of the cultivated peanut, diploid species of section Arachis, found far from the Bolivia-Argentina region, can most likely be eliminated as possible direct ancestors. It is observed that pollen stainability of intrasectional hybrids of section Arachis averaged 30.2% when crosses were made among species at the same ploidy level. Intrasectional hybrids among species within other groups ranged from a low of 0.2% in section Extrunervosue to a high of 86.8% in section Cuulorhizae. Arachis hypogaea, and A. monticola have an \{AB\} genome, while the genomes of tetraploid species in section Rhizomatosae may be similar to the A genome of section Arachis and the E genome of section Erectoides. It is found that Arachis species are potentially valuable germplasm resources for traits other than disease and insect resistances. "

It is particularly helpful in the production and propagation of many interspecific hybrid combinations with subsequent genome duplication. Similarly, polyploidy has featured prominently in natural plant evolution to facilitate the establishment of populations with wider adaptability and superior potential than their parents.

Several biotic and abiotic stresses limit groundnut productivity, together causing annual yield losses of over \{US\} $ 3.2 billion. The Arachis species harbor genes capable of improving both seed yield and quality in addition to imparting high levels of resistance to diseases and insect pests. Many of the wild Arachis species are not cross compatible with cultivated groundnut. However, efforts to overcome incompatibility in wide crosses have started to liberate resistance genes in interspecific progenies. But these progenies carry a lot of linkage drag. Marker-assisted backcross breeding should minimize the linkage drag as it greatly facilitates monitoring of introgressed chromosome segments carrying beneficial genes from wild Arachis to cultivated groundnut. Transgenic groundnuts with resistance or tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses have been produced and are in various stages of characterization under containment and/or controlled field conditions. Once favorable genes are introduced into cultivated groundnut through wide crossing and/or genetic transformation techniques, these genes will become ideal candidates for marker-accelerated introgression. \{DNA\} marker based genetic linkage map should enable breeders to effectively pyramid genes for good seed quality and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses into agronomically enhanced breeding populations in a much shorter time than would be possible by conventional techniques. To date 110 \{SSR\} markers detected genetic variation in a diverse array of 24 groundnut landraces. However, substantial efforts are still required to develop sufficient PCR-based markers, particularly \{SSRs\} and SNPs, for the construction of high-density genetic linkage map and for the routine application in the molecular breeding in groundnut. The use of automated technologies will become increasingly important for large-scale germplasm characterization and realistic scale marker-assisted selection in groundnut. An international legume genomics initiative has been formed between \{USA\} Universities and the International Agricultural Research Centers of the Eco-Regional Alliance on legumes to translate the benefits of the “consensus legume genome” for rapid impacts on the genetic improvement of tropical legumes.

The occurrence of Ultisols alongside acidic Alfisols and Mollisols in both zeolitic and non-zeolitic parent materials in humid tropical (HT) climatic environments, indicates that the soil diversity in India is large. These soils are not confined to a single production system and generally maintain a positive organic carbon (OC) balance without adding significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. This review presents a synthesis of literature on the recent developments on the pedology of \{RF\} soils, including their physical, chemical, biological, mineralogical and micro-morphological properties, and their degradation status. It also addresses the changes in soil properties in semi-arid tropical (SAT) areas, created by climate shift during the Holocene. This knowledge contributed to our understanding as to how the parent material composition influences the formation of Alfisols, Mollisols and Ultisols in weathering environments of \{HT\} climate; and also as to how the relict Alfisols of \{SAT\} areas are polygenetic. The state-of-the-art information developed through the extensive work on such soils has helped establish an organic link between pedogenetic processes and bulk soil properties, and has provided an insight of many pedological and edaphological issues related to Alfisols, Mollisols and Ultisols mainly of \{HT\} climate. The synthesis has helped us to understand as to why the formation of Oxisols from Ultisols is an improbable genetic pathway in tropical environment of India and elsewhere in the world. There is a strong need to modify the mineralogy class of highly weathered \{RF\} soils. We hope this review will help to dispel some of the myths on the formation of tropical soils and their low fertility by putting in context their characteristics and capacity to be productive. "

Policy interventions like the provision of agricultural credit and expansion of irrigation access are found to be highly important in reducing the adverse effects of climate variability for the capital constrained and poor rainfed farm households. However, to achieve significant changes in food security, a mix of adaptation strategies in the form of credit and irrigation has to be provided simultaneously. We also found that farm level adaption through shifting planting date as well as adopting early maturing crop varieties can substantially reduce the adverse impacts of climate variability. "

The relative growth differences between tolerant and sensitive genotypes persisted at different Na/Ca ratios at 6 and 8 dS m-1 salinity levels. A decrease in the Na/Ca ratio under salinity enhanced K uptake and reduced Na uptake, thus increasing the K/Na ratio. The K/Na ratio in shoots of the tolerant genotype was greater than in the sensitive genotype at different Na/Ca ratios at both salinity levels. The tissue Cl levels increased with decreasing Na/Ca at both salinity levels. This increase was greater in the sensitive than in the tolerant genotype. Thus relative growth differences and differences in Na, K and Cl uptake between tolerant and sensitive genotypes persisted across the range of Na/Ca ratios. This suggests that results of screening for genotypic differences at one particular Na/Ca ratio would be applicable to other Na/Ca ratios. "

abstract = "Abstract Crop residues (CR) have become a limited resource in mixed crop-livestock farms. As a result of the increasing demand and low availability of alternative resources, \{CR\} became an essential resource for household activities, especially for livestock keeping; a major livelihood element of smallholder farmers in the developing world. Farmers’ decisions on \{CR\} use are determined by farmers’ preferences, total crop production, availability of alternative resources and demand for CR. Interaction of these determinants can result in pressures and trade-offs of \{CR\} use. Determinants, pressures and trade-offs are shaped by the specific socio-economic and agro-ecological context of these mixed farms. The objective of this paper is to provide a comparative analysis of the determinants of \{CR\} use and to examine some options to cope with pressures and trade-offs in 12 study sites across Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Drawing on socio-economic data at household and village level, we describe how cereal intensification and livestock feed demand influence use, pressures and trade-offs of \{CR\} use across study sites, specifically cereal residue. Our results show that in low cereal production and livestock feed demand sites, despite a low demand for \{CR\} and availability of alternative biomass, pressures and trade-offs of \{CR\} use are common particularly in the dry season. In sites with moderate cereal production, and low–moderate and moderate livestock feed demand, alternative biomass resources are scarce and most residues are fed to livestock or used to cover household needs. Subsequently, pressures and potential trade-offs are stronger. In sites with low cereal production and high livestock feed demand, pressures and trade-offs depend on the availability of better feed resources. Finally, sites with high cereal production and high livestock feed demand have been able to fulfil most of the demand for CR, limiting pressures and trade-offs. These patterns show that agricultural intensification, better management of communal resources and off-farm activities are plausible development pathways to overcome pressures and trade-offs of \{CR\} use. Although technologies can largely improve these trends, research and development should revisit past initiatives so as to develop innovative approaches to tackle the well-known problem of low agricultural production in many smallholder mixed systems, creating more sustainable futures.

A simulation modeling approach was used to evaluate potential interventions that can be used as entry points to improve crop water productivity. Low-cost interventions that use locally available organic inputs were evaluated using the Agriculture Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM). The farmer practice (FP) was compared to interventions comprising manure application (MN) and maize–mucuna rotation (MMR). Their potential effects on crop water productivity, dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) were assessed. Average maize grain water productivity was 0.32, 0.40 and 0.70 kg m−3 under the FP, \{MN\} and \{MMR\} treatments, respectively, while that of mucuna biomass (Mucuna pruriens) was 1.34 kg m−3. Cropping under the \{FP\} and \{MN\} treatments showed negative trends in \{SOC\} and \{TN\} over 30 years, with average losses ranging from 17 to 74 kg ha−1 yr−1 and 6 to 16 kg ha−1 yr−1, respectively. In contrast, the \{MMR\} treatment showed positive trends in both soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN). The \{SOC\} and \{TN\} increased by 2.6–194 kg ha−1 yr−1 and 6–14 kg ha−1 yr−1, respectively. According to the simulation results it can be concluded that the \{MMR\} treatment can improve the water productivity of smallholder maize systems in the semi-arid areas of Zimbabwe under nutrient-depleted soil conditions and can also contribute to the building up of \{SOC\} and TN.

Sea water inundation from the tsunami caused salinization problems for soil and groundwater in coastal areas of the district, and also induced salt injuries in crops. To document the recovery of the agricultural environment from the tsunami, we conducted observations of the soil, groundwater, and vegetation. Soil electrical conductivity increased sharply after the tsunami, but returned to pre-tsunami levels the following year. Groundwater salinity returned to pre-tsunami levels by 2006. These rapid rates of recovery were due to the monsoon rainfall leaching salt from the highly permeable soils in the area. \{MODIS\} \{NDVI\} values measured before and after the tsunami showed that vegetation damaged by the tsunami recovered to its pre-tsunami state by the next rice cropping season, called samba, which starts from August to February. From these results, we conclude that the agricultural environment of the district has now fully recovered from the tsunami. Based on the results, we have also identified important management implications for soil, groundwater, and vegetation as follows: 1) due to the heavy monsoon rainfall and the high permeability of soils in this region, anthropogenic inputs like fertilizers should be applied carefully to minimize pollution, and the use of green manure is recommended; 2) areas that were contaminated by sea water extended up to 1000 m from the sea shore and over pumping of groundwater should be carefully avoided to prevent inducing sea water intrusion; and 3) data from a moderate resolution sensor of 250 m, such as MODIS, can be applied to impact assessment in widespread paddy field areas like the Nagapattinam District.

Br.), which is due to the rapid drainage (D) of the sandy soils, on which it is typically grown. We present a simple method of calculating D in these soils from weekly neutron-probe data. The method divides the water balance into two phases. In the first, applicable early in the season, water flux across the maximum depth of probe measurement (Zm) is assumed negligible, and evapotranspiration (E) and D are calculated from the change in soil water content (θ) between the bottom of the rootzone (Zr) and Zm, thus allowing calculation of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, K(θ), from the flux across Zr. In the second phase, when soil water starts to percolate across Zm, D is calculated from K(θ), assuming a hydraulic head gradient of −1. The method is used to calculate a one-dimensional water balance of a pearl-millet crop grown in a deep sandy soil at two fertility levels during a season of normal rainfall. Results show that the calculated K(θ) functions compare well with those based on laboratory measurements. An acceptable estimate of drainage, and therefore E could be made. Mean cumulative E and D were, respectively, 211 and 207 mm for the unfertilized crop, and 268 and 148 mm for the fertilized crop with 440 mm of rainfall received during the crop cycle. The fertilized millet crop water balance was simulated, which compared to the calculation method resulted in an about 10% higher seasonal E and a 10% lower seasonal D. Our study shows that E can be corrected for D using a simple but accurate method, and consistent with other studies in the region indicates that rainfall is usually not the primary limiting factor to pearl-millet production.

Moench) yield and some soil properties. The land had been used for growing mainly Blue grama grass (Bouteloua gracilis) and Buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides) for over 50 years. A split-plot field experiment with SW, MB, and \{NT\} as main plots was conducted on a Pullman clay loam (Torrertic Paleustolls). Sub-plot treatments were (a) increased soil water content at planting by adding 114 mm of water (PW +), and (b) existing soil water content at planting (PW −). Because of the surface mulch, more soil water was stored in the \{NT\} treatment than in either the \{SW\} or \{MB\} treatments. The increased stored water was also reflected in greater grain and stover yields for \{NT\} sorghum. Peak water extracted from soil by crop, as estimated from soil water content measurements, occurred during the vegetative stage at 60 days after emergence (DAE). It was greatest for \{NT\} sorghum, followed in order by \{SW\} and MB. Although grain and stover yields were larger with \{NT\} than with \{SW\} or MB, grain and stover from \{MB\} plots contained more nitrogen than those from \{SW\} and \{NT\} plots. Soil organic carbon content at a depth of 0–15 cm was significantly greater (P &lt; 0.05) under \{NT\} (1.40%) than under \{SW\} (1.21%) or \{MB\} (1.25%). Ploughing increased soil nitrogen mineralization, with the result that NO3−-N at a depth of 0–15 cm was larger under \{MB\} than under NT. The NH4+-N content under the three tillage systems was highly variable. From a production viewpoint, a no-tillage system is better than \{MB\} or \{SW\} for converting revegetated land to cropland in locations where soil water is limiting. "

Forty-eight accessions, collected from six different states of India, were used with seven \{AFLP\} primer combinations that generated a total of 770 fragments with an average of 110 fragments per primer combination. A total of 680 (88%) fragments showed polymorphism in the germplasm analyzed, of which 59 (8.7%) fragments were unique (accession specific) and 108 (15.9%) fragments were rare (present in less than 10% accessions). In order to assess the discriminatory power of seven primer combinations used, a variety of marker attributes like polymorphism information content (PIC), marker index (MI) and resolving power (RP) values were calculated. Although the \{PIC\} values ranged from 0.20 (E-ACA/M-CAA) to 0.34 (E-ACT/M-CTT) with an average of 0.26 per primer combination and the \{MI\} values were observed in the range of 17.60 (E-ACA/M-CAA) to 32.30 (E-ACT/M-CTT) with an average of 25.13 per primer combination, the \{RP\} was recognized the real attribute for \{AFLP\} to determine the discriminatory power of the primer combination. The \{RP\} values for different primer combinations varied from 23.11 (E-ACA/M-CAA) to 46.82 (E-ACT/M-CTT) with an average of 35.21.

Majority of groups obtained in phenogram and \{PCA\} contained accessions as per geographical locations. In general, accessions coming from Andhra Pradesh were found diverse as these were scattered in different groups, whereas accessions coming from Chhattisgarh showed occurrence of higher number of unique/rare fragments.

Sowing date experiments are a practical and inexpensive approach for comparison of large collections of lines. Late-sown crops usually experience hotter conditions and phenotypes thus partially capture this environmental influence. Two sets of confounded factors, however, limit the value of sowing date trials. First, daily mean temperature correlates with both minimum and maximum temperature, photoperiod, radiation and vapour pressure deficit, and it may also correlate with rainfall. Second, temperature alters the genotype-dependent phenology of crops, effectively shifting the timing and duration of critical periods against the background of temperature and other environmental variables. Here we advance a crop-level framework to unscramble the confounded effects of sowing date experiments; it is based on four physiological concepts: (1) annual crops accommodate environmental variation through seed number rather than seed size; (2) seed number is most responsive to the environment in species-specific critical windows; (3) non-stressful thermal effects affecting seed set through development and canopy size can be integrated in a photothermal quotient relating intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and mean temperature during the critical window; (4) stressful temperature reduces yield by disrupting reproduction. The framework was tested in a factorial experiment combining four chickpea varieties with putatively contrasting adaptation to thermal stress and five environments resulting from the combination of seasons and sowing dates. Yield ranged from 13 to 577 g m−2. Shifts in phenology led to contrasting photothermal conditions in the critical window between flowering and 400 °C d after flowering that were specific for each variety–environment combination. The photothermal quotient ranged from 2.72 to 6.85 \{MJ\} m−2 °C−1; it explained 50% of the variation in yield and maximum temperature explained 32% of the remaining variation. Thus, half of the variation in yield was associated with developmental, non-stressful thermal effect and (at most) 16% of the variation was attributable to thermal stress. The photothermal quotient corrected by vapour pressure deficit accounted for by 75% of the variation in yield and provided further insight on photosynthesis-mediated responses to temperature. Crop adaptation to non-stressful, developmental thermal effects and stressful temperatures disrupting reproduction involve different physiological processes and requires partially different agronomic and breeding solutions. Our analytical approach partially separates these effects, adds value to sowing date trials, and is likely to return more robust rankings of varieties. "

Targeted technology application may help to improve the efficient use of limited nutrient and water resources. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal combination of fertilizer micro-dosing and manure application rates for improved millet yield and enhanced water use efficiency in low input millet-based cropping system. A two-year field experiment was conducted at a research station in Niger using a randomized complete block design with three replications. The treatments consisted of the factorial combination of: (i) two fertilizer micro-dosing options (20 kg ha−1 of diammonium phosphate (DAP) and 60 kg ha−1 of \{NPK\} corresponding to 2 g hill−1 of \{DAP\} and 6 g hill−1 of NPK, respectively), (ii) cattle manure at four application rates (0 kg ha−1, 1000 kg ha−1, 2000 kg ha−1, 3000 kg ha−1) and (iii) two methods of manure application (broadcasting and hill placement). Millet grain yields under fertilizer micro-dosing combined with manure was increased on average by 59%, 83% and 113% for 1000 kg ha−1, 2000 kg ha−1 and 3000 kg ha−1, respectively compared with fertilizer micro-dosing alone. Combined applications of manure and fertilizer micro-dosing increased water use efficiency significantly. Hill placement of manure increased total dry matter on average by 23% and water use efficiency by 35% relative to manure broadcasting. The total root length density was increased by 66% and 42% in hill placement of manure at 25 cm and 50 cm, respectively, from the hill centre compared with manure broadcast. These results indicate that millet production with the fertilizer micro-dosing technology can be improved further by hill-placement of manure. The combination of 2000 kg ha−1 of manure and 20 kg \{DAP\} ha−1 hill-placed were most promising for increasing millet yield and the efficient use of limited nutrients and water in Sahelian millet based systems. There is need for testing this technology further together with farmers to valuate its effectiveness. "

Japanese accessions grouped together except for a few outliers to form an Echinochloa esculenta group. The third group contained accessions from Russia, Japan, Cameroon, and Egypt. They formed a separate group on the scatterplot and represented accessions with lower values for all traits except basal tiller number. The interrelationships between the traits indicated that accessions with tall plants, long and broad leaves, longer inflorescences, and greater numbers of racemes should be given priority as donors or parents in varietal development initiatives. Cluster analysis identified two main clusters based on agro-morphological characters. "

Candidate gene-based association analysis in a branch number association panel was performed by utilizing the genotyping data of 401 \{SNP\} allelic variants mined from 27 known cloned branch number gene orthologs of chickpea. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) integrating both genome-wide GBS- (4556 SNPs) and candidate gene-based genotyping information of 4957 \{SNPs\} in a structured population of 60 sequenced desi and kabuli accessions (with 350–400 kb \{LD\} decay), detected 11 significant genomic loci (genes) associated (41% combined PVE) with branch number in chickpea. Of these, seven branch number-associated genes were further validated successfully in two inter (ICC 4958 × \{ICC\} 17160)- and intra (ICC 12299 × \{ICC\} 8261)-specific mapping populations. The axillary meristem and shoot apical meristem-specific expression, including differential up- and down-regulation (4–5 fold) of the validated seven branch number-associated genes especially in high branch number as compared to the low branch number-containing parental accessions and homozygous individuals of two aforesaid mapping populations was apparent. Collectively, this combinatorial genomic approach delineated diverse naturally occurring novel functional \{SNP\} allelic variants in seven potential known/candidate genes [PIN1 (PIN-FORMED protein 1), \{TB1\} (teosinte branched 1), BA1/LAX1 (BARREN STALK1/LIKE AUXIN1), \{GRAS8\} (gibberellic acid insensitive/GAI, Repressor of ga13/RGA and Scarecrow8/SCR8), \{ERF\} (ethylene-responsive element-binding factor), \{MAX2\} (more axillary growth 2) and lipase] governing chickpea branch number. The useful information generated from this study have potential to expedite marker-assisted genetic enhancement by developing high-yielding cultivars with more number of productive (pods and seeds) branches in chickpea.

Further shoot elongation was achieved on medium containing 4.40 μM BA. The elongated micro shoots were rooted on \{MS\} medium fortified with 1.97 μM indole-3-butyric acid. The regenerated plantlets with roots were successfully hardened on earthen pots after proper acclimatization under greenhouse conditions.

While deficit irrigation has been shown to have greater economic water productivity (EWP) in such circumstances in other regions, there are limitations to the cost/revenue function approach traditionally used to evaluate EWP, including inapplicability across environments. These limitations can however be overcome with the use of a validated cropping systems model. The \{APSIM\} farming systems model was therefore used to determine whether growing larger areas of deficit irrigated wheat is more profitable than full irrigation of a smaller area in sub-tropical Australia, under water limited conditions. Optimal irrigation strategies were not only profitable but also those considered risk-efficient, i.e. closest to a 1:2 ‘line of indifference’ that identifies the two unit increase in risk (measured as standard deviation) acceptable to farmers in return for a unit increase in profit. The value of stored soil water was assessed by simulating rainfed crop production on unirrigated land, and/or assigning an economic value to stored soil water remaining at the end of the season. The results demonstrated that deficit irrigation of larger areas of wheat was generally more profitable and risk-efficient than smaller areas of full irrigation. When precipitation or stored soil water at sowing was increased, the most risk-efficient strategies were those that spread water across a larger area at a reduced frequency of irrigation. However in a low rainfall environment when water was expensive and soil water had the same economic value as irrigation water, fully irrigating a smaller area was the most profitable and risk-efficient option. The importance of evaluating farm-management strategies using \{EWP\} (i.e. incorporating gross margins) instead of crop water productivity (grain yield per unit of water use) was evident, as re-ranking of farm-management strategies occurred between these alternative methods of calculating whole-farm WP. Accounting for the intrinsic value of stored soil water and precipitation was fundamental to understanding the benefit of deficit irrigation strategies in water limited situations, as the larger crop area sown in conjunction with deficit irrigation strategies accessed much larger absolute volumes of soil water and precipitation. Future evaluations of deficit irrigation strategies should account for such considerations. "

Mungbean (Vigna radiata L.) is grown as a summer-season crop in many parts of the world. The optimum temperature for growth of mungbean is 28–30 °C; increase in temperatures above these limits, especially during reproductive growth, are expected to inhibit its potential performance. Hence a study was conducted to evaluate the effects of high temperatures (&gt;40/25 °C; day/night) during reproductive growth on performance of mungbean and to probe the mechanisms associated with reproductive failures. Here, we tested two extra-short duration (60 days) mungbean genotypes for their response to heat stress under outdoor conditions as well as controlled environment (CE). Two mungbean cultivars (SML 832 and 668) were grown in pots at two sowing dates: (1) the normal sowing time (NS) on 30th March so that day/night temperatures during the reproductive stage were below &lt;40/25 °C and (2) late-sown (LS) on 15th April so that temperatures during the reproductive stage were above &gt;40/25 °C. The plants were fully irrigated during both the sowing situations to avoid any effect of drought stress. While phenology, duration of flowering, podding was not affected, there was a significant reduction in biomass (16–19%), pod set, number of filled pods (32–38%), seed number (43–47%) and seed yield (35–40%) on per plant basis due to heat stress in \{LS\} plants. This was associated with reduction in reproductive function such as pollen viability, pollen germination, pollen tube growth, pollen load and stigma receptivity in heat-stressed (HS) plants. At flowering and podding stage, stomatal conductance and photosynthetic efficiency and chlorophyll concentration were inhibited in leaves of both the genotypes under heat stress. A significant decrease was noticed in sucrose concentration in leaves and anthers along with reduction in activities of sucrose synthesising enzymes (sucrose synthase, sucrose phosphate synthase) and hydrolysing enzymes (acid invertase), which possibly was a vital reason affecting the reproductive function and yield traits. \{CE\} studies also revealed that temperatures more than 35/25 °C, especially 43/30 °C, 45/32 °C (day/night) were highly detrimental for pod set, reproductive function and yield traits for mungbean.

This paper determines how sequential decision-making under weather uncertainty affects the adoption and farm-level effects of cereal technologies in Niger. The study also draws policy implications for a price floor to arrest the substantial fall in cereal prices in good rainfall years when farmers have more grains to sell. The methodology used is Discrete Stochastic Programming. This paper shows that the ability of peasant farmers to adapt cropping and resource-management strategies to the rainfall patterns is the basis for their survival in this high-risk environment. Model results show that by (a) carrying a portfolio mix of varieties of varying maturities, and (b) making sequential decisions based upon rainfall expectations, farmers can adapt to the production uncertainties. Breeding programs should therefore be diversified to develop not only early-maturing cultivars, but also improved intermediate and long-season varieties. "

Significant differences in the survival of \{MSB\} diapausing larvae in millet stems at the end of the dry season were found at both Sadore and Doukoudoukou. At Sadore, mean \{MSB\} larval survival in the treatment where stems were exported at harvest and stored on platforms (treatment 1) was 1.2/stem, i.e. significantly higher than in all other treatments. Survival was between 0.1 and 0.2 larva in treatments 2 (with millet stems left standing from harvest throughout the dry season) and 3 (with millet stems flattened toward the end of the dry season, four months after harvest). It was less than 0.1 larva in treatments 4 (with millet stems flattened in the middle of the dry season, two months after harvest) and 5 (with millet stems flattened at the beginning of the dry season, at harvest).

We fitted difference-in-difference and household fixed effects regression models that account for unobserved heterogeneity across households. Our estimates differentiated the impact of the different \{IPM\} components, in comparison to farmers' practices as a control group. The descriptive statistics of the study show that application of the \{IPM\} strategy resulted in a 48% average increase in mango net income compared to the previous season irrespective of the \{IPM\} combination component used. The extent of improvement in net income, however, varied across treatments; treatments posfb and posmatfb registering the greatest improvements whereas the pos treatment generated the smallest increase in net income. The study findings further show mango yield losses due to fruit fly infestation reduced by an average of 19% among the \{IPM\} users. We also found a reduction in expenditure on pesticides, albeit across all the households. Regression model estimates show that, except for \{IPM\} combinations posbiop and pos, farmers using the rest of the \{IPM\} practices recorded significantly higher incomes from mango compared to their counterparts in the control group. We also noted that although average expenditure on pesticides decreased across all mango farmer households, the reduction was comparable between the treated and control farmer households. Our findings however, show significant decreases in mango damage due to fruit fly infestations among all farmers using the different \{IPM\} treatments. Our study recommends combinations of affordable and easy to apply and maintain \{IPM\} strategies that could yield significant impact on mango fruit fly control. "

Moreover, \{CTD\} at 62 \{DAS\} also showed similar positive association with the grain yield recorded in two previous years (r = 0.45***, 0.42***).

This changed the data requirements as the environmental models require quantitative, high resolution and spatially exhaustive data. As resources to collect new data are limited, \{RLUA\} often relies on already existing data. These data often do not meet the data requirements for the environmental models. Hence, a gap developed between the supply and demand of data in RLUA. This study aims to explore and analyse the effect of using different soil datasets in a case study for Machakos and Makueni counties (Kenya). Six soil datasets were available for the study area and showed large differences. For example, average clay percentages varied between 11.7% and 44.4%. The soil datasets were developed under different assumptions on e.g., soil variability. Four assumptions were verified using a field survey. An ongoing RLUA, the Global Yield Gap Atlas (GYGA) project, was taken as a case study to analyse the effect of using different soil datasets. The \{GYGA\} project aims to assess yield gaps defined as the difference between potential or water-limited yields and actual yields. Rain-fed maize is the dominating cropping system in Machakos and Makueni counties. The \{GYGA\} project uses soil data for the selection of the most dominant maize growing areas and to simulate water-limited maize yields. The protocols developed by the \{GYGA\} project were applied to the six soil datasets. This resulted in the selection of six different maize-growing areas and different water-limited maize yields. Our study clearly demonstrates the large differences between soil datasets. Main challenges with soil data in \{RLUA\} are: i) understand the assumptions in soil datasets, ii) create soil datasets that meet the requirements for regional land use analysis, iii) not only rely on legacy soil data but also collect new soil data and iv) validate soil datasets.

Average chickpea yield in Iran is about 500 kg ha−1 while the world average is 900 kg ha−1. The objective of this study was to investigate chickpea water limited potential yield (Yw) and yield gap in Iran. The analysis was based on data from five representing chickpea producing locations of Iran. Estimated country Yw and yield gap were 991 and 463 kg ha−1, respectively, indicating that farmers have reached 53% (range: 38–64%) of Yw. If farmers could reach 80% of Yw of their locations, by improving agronomy practice, country average yield would increase by 50%, from 528 to 793 kg ha−1. A key finding of the study was that chickpea yield in Iran is largely limited by inefficient use of environmental resources and not the genetics of the current cultivars. Much higher yield increase is obtainable via an agronomic option than a genetic improvement option: using shorter duration cultivars increased Yw to 1237 kg ha−1 (25% increase), but applying a single irrigation of 60 mm at first-pod alone or in combination with shorter duration cultivars increased Yw to 1804 kg ha−1(85% increase) and to 1997 kg ha−1 (104% increase), respectively. Thus, tripling chickpea production would be feasible using a single irrigation with or without shorter duration cultivars (from 528 to 1443 or 1598 kg ha−1). The availability of water for the single irrigation is discussed. "

abstract = "Abstract Seasonal climate forecasts (SCFs) can be used to identify appropriate risk management strategies and to reduce the sensitivity of rural industries and communities to climate risk. However, these forecasts have low utility among farmers in agricultural decision making, unless translated into a more understood portfolio of farm management options. Towards achieving this translation, we developed a mathematical programming model that integrates seasonal climate forecasts to assess ‘what-if?’ crop choice scenarios for famers. We used the Rayapalli village in southern India as a case study. The model maximises expected profitability at village level subject to available resource constraints. The main outputs of the model are the optimal cropping patterns and corresponding agricultural management decisions such as fertiliser, biocide, labour and machinery use. The model is set up to run in two steps. In the first step the initial climate forecast is used to calculate the optimal farm plan and corresponding agricultural management decisions at a village scale. The second step uses a ‘revised forecast’ that is given six weeks later during the growing season. In scenarios where the forecast provides no clear expectation for a dry or wet season the model utilises the total agricultural land available. A significant area is allocated to redgram (pigeon pea) and the rest to maize and paddy rice. In a forecast where a dry season is more probable, cotton is the predominant crop selected. In scenarios where a ‘normal’ season is expected, the model chooses predominantly cotton and maize in addition to paddy rice and redgram. As part of the stakeholder engagement process, we operated the model in an iterative way with participating farmers. For ‘deficient’ rainfall season, farmers were in agreement with the model choice of leaving a large portion of the agriculture land as fallow with only 40 ha (total area 136 ha) of cotton and subsistence paddy rice area. While the model crop choice was redgram in ‘above normal and wet seasons, only a few farmers in the village favoured redgram mainly because of high labour requirements, and the farmers perceptions about risks related to pests and diseases. This highlighted the discrepancy between the optimal cropping pattern, calculated with the model and the farmer's actual decisions which provided useful insights into factors affecting farmer decision making that are not always captured by models. We found that planning for a ‘normal’ season alone is likely to result in losses and opportunity costs and an adaptive climate risk management approach is prudent. In an interactive feedback workshop, majority of participating farmers agreed that their knowledge on the utility and challenges of \{SCF\} have highly improved through the participation in this research and most agreed that exposure to the model improved their understanding of the role of \{SCF\} in crop choice decisions and that the modelling tool was useful to discuss climate risk in agriculture.

The G to T transversion at the third position of codon 249 (AGG) of the \{TP53\} gene, substituting arginine to serine, is the most common aflatoxin-induced mutation linked to HCC. This study examined mutations in \{TP53\} by PCR-RFLP analysis and by measurement of an aflatoxin-albumin adduct as a biomarker for human exposure of aflatoxin \{B1\} by indirect-competitive ELISA, in samples collected from healthy controls as well as patients with hepatitis in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India. A total of 238 blood samples were analyzed the presence of the G to T mutation. Eighteen of these samples were from HBV-positive subjects, 112 of these were from subjects who had HBV-induced liver cirrhosis, and 108 samples were taken from subjects without \{HBV\} infection or liver cirrhosis (control group). The G to T mutation was detected in 10 samples, 8 of which were from subjects positive to both \{HBV\} and aflatoxin-albumin adduct in blood (p = 0.07); whilst two were from individuals who were HBV-negative, but positive for the aflatoxin-albumin adduct (p = 0.14). The aflatoxin-albumin adduct was detected in 37 of 238 samples, 29 samples were from HBV-positive subjects and eight were from individuals who were positive for both \{HBV\} and the \{TP53\} mutation (p = 0.07). The concentration of aflatoxin-albumin adduct ranged from 2.5 to 667 pg/mg albumin. Despite low incidence of the G to T mutation, its detection in subjects positive to aflatoxin-adducts is indicative of a strong association between the mutation and aflatoxin exposure in India. "

The \{SSA\} production systems are generally characterized by cereal/legume mixed-cropping dominated by maize, millet, sorghum, and wheat. The major constraints in both regions to crop production are low soil fertility, insecure rainfall, low-productive genotypes, low adoption of improved soil and crop management practices, and lack of appropriate institutional support. Different cropping systems and accompanying technologies are discussed as well as selected examples of impact of these technologies.

This paper focuses on farming systems in the semi-arid areas of Zimbabwe, where biomass production is limited and farmers integrate crop and livestock activities. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is promoted to intensify crop production, emphasizing the retention of surface mulch with crop residues (CR). This paper quantifies the associated potential economic trade-offs and profitability of using residues for soil amendment or as livestock feed, and explores alternative biomass production options. We draw on household surveys, stakeholder feedback, crop, livestock and economic modeling tools. We use the Trade-Off Analysis Model for Multi Dimensional Impact Assessment (TOA-MD) to compare different \{CR\} use scenarios at community level and for different farm types: particularly the current base system (cattle grazing of maize residues) and sustainable intensification alternatives based on a \{CA\} option (mulching using maize residues ± inorganic fertilizer) and a maize–mucuna (Mucuna pruriens) rotation. Our results indicate that a maize–mucuna rotation can reduce trade-offs between \{CR\} uses for feed and mulch, providing locally available organic soil enhancement, supplementary feed and a potential source of income. Conservation Agriculture without fertilizer application and at non-subsidized fertilizer prices is not financially viable; whereas with subsidized fertilizer it can benefit half the farm population. The poverty effects of all considered alternative biomass options are however limited; they do not raise income sufficiently to lift farmers out of poverty. Further research is needed to establish the competitiveness of alternative biomass enhancing technologies and the socio-economic processes that can facilitate sustainable intensification of mixed crop-livestock systems, particularly in semi-arid environments.

It is mainly cultivated in the semi-arid tropics of Asia and Oceania, Africa and America. In Malawi, it is grown as a source of food and income and for soil improvement in intercropping systems. However, varietal contamination due to natural outcrossing causes significant quality reduction and yield losses. In this study, 48 polymorphic \{SSR\} markers were used to assess the diversity among all pigeonpea varieties cultivated in Malawi to determine if a genetic fingerprint could be identified to distinguish the popular varieties. Results A total of 212 alleles were observed with an average of 5.58 alleles per marker and a maximum of 14 alleles produced by \{CCttc019\} (Marker 40). Polymorphic information content (PIC), ranged from 0.03 to 0.89 with an average of 0.30. A neighbor-joining tree produced 4 clusters. The most commonly cultivated varieties, which include released varieties and cultivated land races, were well-spread across all the clusters observed, indicating that they generally represented the genetic diversity available in Malawi, although substantial variation was evident that can still be exploited through further breeding. Conclusion Screening of the allelic data associated with the five most popular cultivated varieties, revealed 6 markers – CCB1, CCB7, Ccac035, CCttc003, Ccac026 and \{CCttc019\} – which displayed unique allelic profiles for each of the five varieties. This genetic fingerprint can potentially be applied for seed certification to confirm the genetic purity of seeds that are delivered to Malawi farmers. "

The major contribution of these technologies for peanut will likely be improved disease resistance, oil quality, and enhanced productivity. Those attributes may be achieved more effectively through genomic biotechnology to utilize the genetic resources preserved in germplasm collections for maximizing the genetic potential in breeding. Superior cultivars will maximize desirable genetic traits and provide growers with cultivars that are locally adapted and highly productive. Genomics involves the study of the complete genetic makeup, through mapping, sequencing, and functional studies to identify genes that regulate, control or modify trait expression. With the development in sequencing technologies, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has opened the gateway to sequence the genomes in a fast, reliable, and cost-effective manner. The international peanut genome sequencing project was discussed in 2010 and launched in 2012 after much deliberation and strategic planning. The exciting news is that the Peanut Genome Consortium, representing a coalition of international scientists and stakeholders engaged in the International Peanut Genome Initiative, announced the public release of the first chromosomal-scale draft sequences of two peanut species (Arachis duranensis and Arachis ipaënsis) on April 2, 2014 (http://www.peanutbioscience.com/images/4-2-14_News_Release_Notice.pdf). In this chapter, we update the information on the molecular markers, genetic linkage maps, and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of traits mapped to date. Information of the preview of genome sequences, which would be available in peanut populations for high resolution genetic and trait mapping such as multiparent advanced generation intercross and nested association mapping, is also discussed. Furthermore, an innovative method to identify a causal mutant single nucleotide polymorphism or major allele for \{QTLs\} through \{NGS\} techniques such as MutMap and \{QTLseq\} is also discussed in the section on emerging trait mapping strategies. A special emphasis on Africa and China is given in different sections to update on the activities in peanut research and emerging issues. The goal of this chapter is to update the new progress in the development of genetic and genomic resources and technologies in peanuts. "

Lack of appropriate genomic resources has severely hampered molecular breeding activities, and this crop remains among the less-studied crops. The last five years, however, have witnessed accelerated development of genomic resources such as development of molecular markers, genetic and physical maps, generation of expressed sequenced tags (ESTs), development of mutant resources, and functional genomics platforms that facilitate the identification of \{QTLs\} and discovery of genes associated with tolerance/resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses and agronomic traits.

This weed has a complex mode of infestation that adapts to many hosts and environments, complicating conventional breeding for resistance, which is the only form of crop improvement available to Eritrean breeders, but has failed. This study aimed at improving resistance against this parasite by transferring 5 Striga resistant Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) from resistance donor \{N13\} to Striga susceptible Farmer-Preferred Sorghum Variety (FPSV) Hugurtay from Eritrea. The method involved backcrossing using marker-assisted selection (MAS) and evaluation of the best introgressed lines for Striga resistance in artificially infested fields. Foreground selection was performed with up to 11 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers linked to Striga resistance QTLs, while background selection was conducted in the \{BC3F2\} generation with 27 polymorphic unlinked \{SSR\} markers to identify the best recovery of the recurrent parent (RP) genetic background. Out of 84 \{BC3F3\} lines, L2P3-B, L1P5-A and \{L2P5P35\} performed best with respect to both grain yield and reduced Striga infestation. These lines were more resistant to Striga than Hugurtay, but less resistant than N13. The three lines yielded twice as much as N13, with Area Under Striga Number Progression Curve (AUSNPC) values on average 18% higher than that of \{N13\} and 38% lower than that of Hugurtay. This suggests that the introgressed \{QTLs\} conferred significant Striga resistance and yield advantage to these \{BC3F3\} backcross progenies under Striga pressure. These lines have good potential for future release and demonstrate that when \{MAS\} is available to conventional breeders, even in countries with no genotyping facilities, it is a useful tool for enhancement, expediency and precision in crop improvement.

This study was undertaken to determine (1) if parameters describing leaf area development varied among ten peanut (Arachis hypogeae L.) genotypes grown in field and pot experiments, (2) if these parameters were affected by the planting density, and (3) if these parameters varied between Spanish and Virginia genotypes. Leaf area development was described by two steps: prediction of main stem number of nodes based on phyllochron development and plant leaf area dependent based on main stem node number. There was no genetic variation in the phyllochron measured in the field. However, the phyllochron was much longer for plants grown in pots as compared to the field-grown plants. These results indicated a negative aspect of growing peanut plants in the pots used in this experiment. In contrast to phyllochron, there was no difference in the relationship between plant leaf area and main stem node number between the pot and field experiments. However, there was genetic variation in both the pot and field experiments in the exponential coefficient (PLAPOW) of the power function used to describe leaf area development from node number. This genetic variation was confirmed in another experiment with a larger number of genotypes, although possible G × E interaction for the \{PLAPOW\} was found. Sowing density did not affect the power function relating leaf area to main stem node number. There was also no difference in the power function coefficient between Spanish and Virginia genotypes. \{SSM\} (Simple Simulation model) reliably predicted leaf canopy development in groundnut. Indeed the leaf area showed a close agreement between predicted and observed values up to 60000 cm2 m−2. The slightly higher prediction in India and slightly lower prediction in Niger reflected GxE interactions. Until more understanding is obtained on the possible GxE interaction effects on the canopy development, a generic \{PLAPOW\} value of 2.71, no correction for sowing density, and a phyllochron on 53 °C could be used to model canopy development in peanut.

Only 3.26% of the samples from the dryer \{LM3\} zone had &gt; 20 µg/kg compared with 10.28% of the samples from the wetter and humid \{LM1\} zone. There was also a highly significant (χ2 = 9.73; P = 0.0018) association between cultivar improvement status and aflatoxin levels. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the odds for peanuts from Busia being contaminated were 2.6 times greater than those for peanuts from Homabay. Planting improved cultivars would lower the odds of contamination to a half (odds ratio = 0.552) those for local landraces. These results are discussed in relation to the risk of human exposure to aflatoxins and the need for proper sampling procedures for regulatory purposes. "

abstract = "The rainfall pattern in the Sahel is very erratic with a high spatial variability. We tested the often reported hypothesis that the dispersion of farmers’ fields around the village territory helps mitigate agro-climatic risk by increasing yield stability from year to year. We also wished to evaluate whether this strategy had an effect on the yield disparity among households in a village. Based on a network of approximately 60 rain gauges spread over 500 km2 in the Fakara region (Southwest Niger), daily rainfall was interpolated at 300 m × 300 m resolution over a 12-year period. This data was used to compute, by means of the \{APSIM\} crop simulation model, millet biomass and grain yields at the pixel scale. Simulated yields were combined with the land tenure map of the Banizoumbou village in a \{GIS\} to assess millet yield at field and household level. Agro-climatic risk analysis was performed using linear regression between a spatial dispersion index of household fields and the inter-annual (instability) and inter-household (disparity) millet yield variability of 107 households in the village territory. We find that the spatial variability of annual rainfall induces an even higher spatial variability of millet production at pixel, field and household levels. The dispersion of farm fields reduces moderately but significantly the disparity of millet yield between households each year and increases the inter-annual yield stability of a given household. The less the household fields are scattered, the more the presence of a fertility gradient around the village enhances the inter-annual stability but also the disparity between households. Our results provide evidence that field dispersion is an effective strategy to mitigate agro-climatic risk, as claimed by farmers in the Sahelian Niger. Although the results should be confirmed by further research on longer term rainfall spatial data, it is clearly advisable that any land reforms in the area take into account the benefits of field dispersion to mitigate climatic risk.

Examination of the core, borehole geophysics, Radon-222, electromagnetic flowmeter (EMF) profiles and step-drawdown pumping tests did not identify whether fractures contribute to groundwater flow. A number of injection and recovery tests lasting from 3 days to 3 months using potable water showed a large degree of mixing with native groundwater. Withdrawal greater than 12–17% of the injected volume resulted in recovered water containing more native groundwater than injected water. A finite element solute transport model was set up to reproduce the observed salinity in recovered water. Without the inclusion of discrete fractures in the model it was not possible to get a fit between the observed and modelled salinity of recovered water within a realistic range of dispersivity values. The model was subsequently verified by using data from long-term injection and recovery trials. This evaluation of mixing conclusively demonstrated that the aquifer behaved as a fractured rock aquifer and not as an aquifer with primary porosity alone. Therefore, aquifer storage and recovery can be a very useful hydrogeological method to identify the occurrence of fracture flow in aquifers where there is a measurable concentration difference between the injected water and ambient groundwater.

This study examined pine plantations located in the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe relative to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage along an age series. Samples of stand characteristics, forest floor (L, F and H) and 0–10, 10–30 and 30–60 cm soil depth were randomly taken from replicated stands in Pinus patula Schiede &amp; Deppe of 1, 10, 20, 25, and 30 years plus two natural forests. Sodium polytungstate (density 1.6 g cm−3) was used to isolate organic matter into free light fraction (fLF), occluded light fraction (oLF) and mineral associated heavy fraction (MaHF). In both natural and planted forests, above ground tree biomass was the major ecosystem C pool followed by forest floor’s humus (H) layer in addition to the 45%, 31% and 24% of \{SOC\} contributed by the 0–10, 10–30 and 30–60 cm soil depths respectively. Stand age caused significant differences in total organic C and N stocks. Carbon and N declined initially soon after establishment but recovered rapidly at 10 years, after which it declined following silvicultural operations (thinning and pruning) and recovered again by 25 years. Soil C and N stocks were highest in moist forest (18.3 kg C m−2 and 0.66 kg of N m−2) and lowest in the miombo (8.5 kg m−2 of C and 0.22 kg of N m−2). Average soil C among Pinus stands was 11.4 kg of C m−2, being highest at 10 years (13.7 of C kg m−2) and lowest at 1 year (9.9 kg of C m−2). Some inputs of charcoal through bioturbation over the 25 year period contributed to stabilisation of soil organic carbon (SOC) and its depth distribution compared to the one year old stands. Nitrogen was highest at 10 years (0.85 kg of N m−2) and least at 30 years (0.22 kg of N m−2). Carbon and N in density fractions showed the 20 year old stand having similar proportions of fLF and oLF while the rest had significantly higher fLF than oLF. The contribution of fLF C, oLF C and MaHF C to \{SOC\} was 8–13%, 1–7% and 90–91% respectively. Carbon and N in all fractions decreased with depth. The mineral associated C was significantly affected by stand age whilst the fLF and oLF were not. Conversion of depleted miombo woodlands to pine plantations yield better C gains in the short and long run whilst moist forest provide both carbon and biodiversity. Our results highlight the importance of considering forestry age based C pools in estimating C sink potential over a rotation and the possibility of considering conservation of existing natural forests as part of future \{REDD\} + projects.

Farmers in the test group received an information leaflet designed to address gaps in farmer knowledge likely to lead to inadequate treatment; their knowledge was assessed before the intervention, and at 2 weeks and 5 months after the intervention. We assessed the quality of farmer treatments by measuring clinical outcomes in cattle 2 weeks after selection and treatment.

Such seeds often require pretreatments in order to obtain rapid and uniform germination. To develop recommendations for obtaining high rates of seed germination for doum palm, three 100-day long experiments were conducted following application of different pretreatments. For freshly-collected seeds, the effects of 3 ecozones (northern, central and southern), 3 mechanical scarification treatments, and 10 different types and durations of water-soaking treatments were determined. In the second experiment, 13-month-old seeds from the southern ecozone were used to assess the effects of the same mechanical scarification and water-soaking treatments used in the first experiment. In the third experiment, mechanical scarification of 13-month-old seeds from the southern ecozone was combined with chemical treatments using sulfuric acid, gibberellic acid, or ethylene. For all three ecozones together, intact fresh seeds had much lower (0.6% to 2.5%) germination than either seeds with their pericarp removed (78% to 82%) or bare nuts (pericarp and endocarp removed; 73% to 85%). Percentage germination increased significantly from the northern to the southern ecozone, particularly for bare nuts (P&lt;0.002). Soaked seeds had higher germination than did unsoaked seeds (P&lt;0.0001) for both the fresh and the older seeds. The average for the treatments yielding the highest germination of the 13-month-old southern ecozone seeds (66%) was 25% lower than it was for the freshly-collected southern ecozone seeds (91%). The highest germination (85%) for freshly-collected seeds (all ecozones) was obtained with mechanically-scarified seeds soaked in water for 3 days. For intact 13-month-old seeds, the sulfuric acid treatment resulted in 28.3% germination and was the only treatment which resulted in any germination of intact seeds. The 13-month-old mechanically scarified seeds treated with either gibberellic acid or ethylene had higher germination (57% for both) than mechanically scarified seeds treated either with sulfuric acid or not chemically treated (40% and 26.5%, respectively). Thus, it appears that the impermeability of the pericarp to water and oxygen, the need to physiologically activate the embryo with a water-soaking treatment and, in older seeds, a lowered physiological capacity of the embryo all constrained germination rates in older doum palm seeds.

It was important for this study to understand farmer perceptions regarding the role of climate risks within a complex and multifarious set of risks to farmers’ livelihoods. This study used both qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate farmers’ perceptions regarding threats to livelihoods in southern Zambia and south-western Zimbabwe. While farmers report changes in local climatic conditions consistent with climate variability, there is a problem in assigning contribution of climate variability and other factors to observed negative impacts on the agricultural and socio-economic system. Furthermore, while there is a multiplicity of stressors that confront farmers, climate variability remains the most critical and exacerbate livelihood insecurity for those farmers with higher levels of vulnerability to these stressors.

These measures are heightening the spillway of the ‘Mnyabezi 27’ dam and constructing a sand storage dam in the alluvial aquifer of the Mnyabezi River. The upper-Mnyabezi catchment covers approximately 22 km2 and is a tributary of the Thuli River in southern Zimbabwe. Three coupled models are used to simulate the hydrological processes in the Mnyabezi catchment. The first is a rainfall-runoff model, based on the SCS-method. The second is a spreadsheet-based model of the water balance of the reservoir. The third is the finite difference groundwater model \{MODFLOW\} used to simulate the water balance of the alluvial aquifer. The potential water supply in the Mnyabezi catchment under current conditions ranges from 2107 m3 (5.7 months) in a dry year to 3162 m3 (8.7 months) in a wet year. The maximum period of water supply after implementation of the storage capacity measures in a dry year is 2776 m3 (8.4 months) and in a wet year the amount is 3617 m3 (10.8 months). The sand storage dam can only be used as an additional water resource, because the storage capacity of the alluvial aquifer is small. However, when an ephemeral river is underlain by a larger alluvial aquifer, a sand storage dam is a promising way of water supply for smallholder farmers in southern Zimbabwe. "

This impacts on both household livelihoods and food security. In an attempt to improve food security in the catchment a number of drip kit distribution programmes have been initiated since 2003 as part of an on-going global initiative aimed at 2 million poor households per year. A number of recent studies have assessed the technical performance of the drip kits in-lab and in-field. In early 2005 a study was undertaken to assess the impacts and sustainability of the drip kit programme. Representatives of the NGOs, local government, traditional leadership and agricultural extension officers were interviewed. Focus group discussions with beneficiaries and other villagers were held at village level. A survey of 114 households was then conducted in two districts, using a questionnaire developed from the output of the interviews and focus group discussions. The results from the study showed that the \{NGOs\} did not specifically target the distribution of the drip kits to poor members of the community (defined for the purpose of the study as those not owning cattle). Poor households made up 54% of the beneficiaries. This poor targeting of vulnerable households could have been a result of conditions set by some implementing \{NGOs\} that beneficiaries must have an assured water source. On the other hand, only 2% of the beneficiaries had used the kit to produce the expected 5 harvests over the 2 years, owing to problems related to water shortage, access to water and also pests and diseases. About 51% of the respondents had produced at least 3 harvests and 86% produced at least 2 harvests. Due to water shortages during the dry season 61% of production with the drip kit occurred during the wet season. This suggests that most households use the drip kits as supplementary irrigation. Conflicts between beneficiaries and water point committees or other water users developed in some areas especially during the dry season. The main finding from this study was that low cost drip kit programs can only be a sustainable intervention if implemented as an integral part of a long-term development program, not short-term relief programs and the programme should involve a broad range of stakeholders. A first step in any such program, especially in water scarce areas such as Gwanda and Beitbridge, is a detailed analysis of the existing water resources to assess availability and potential conflicts, prior to distribution of drip kits.

There was a large range of genotypic variation in grain yield under salinity and other traits. The yield loss was higher in accessions with prolific growth and yield potential was associated with saline yields. Based on saline yields, accessions were grouped in to four groups and the top tolerant group had 22 accessions with \{IE\} 4797 remaining at the top.

It is unlikely, however, that breeding objectives conserving traditional crop characteristics as found in extensive systems would have been more successful. The authors identify systems caught in the agricultural transition from subsistence to intensified, market-oriented production as the most important target for crop improvement, and provide examples of new breeding objectives for cowpea, sorghum and upland rice. In each of these cases, breeders, with the help of physiologists, have developed innovative plant-type concepts that combine improved yield potential and input responsiveness with specific traditional crop characteristics that remain essential during the agricultural transition. In the case of cowpea, dual-purpose varieties were developed that produce a good grain yield due to an erect plant habit, then produce new leaves enabling a second harvest of green foliage. For upland rice systems that are limited by labour (mainly needed to control weeds that abound due to shortened fallow periods), a weed competitive plant type was developed from Oryza sativa × Oryza glaberrima crosses. Lastly, sorghum breeders who had previously deselected photoperiod sensitivity are now re-inserting sensitivity into plants having “modern” architecture, in order to allow for flexible sowing dates while maintaining an agro-ecologically optimal time of flowering near the end of the wet season. The ecophysiological basis of these plant types, their place in current and future cropping systems, as well as the problem of under-funding for their realisation, are discussed. "

The oldest newly dated phonolite flow is 5.78 Ma (40Ar/39Ar), placing the initiation of Mt Kenya volcanic activity within the Late Miocene, much earlier than reported before, 3–3.5 Ma (K/Ar). The main body of the stratovolcano was already in existence around 4.22–5.27 Ma (40Ar/39Ar) supplying lahars to its lower footslopes. The final recorded volcanic main vent phase in the study area produced multiple phonolitic flows and lahars around 2.8 Ma (40Ar/39Ar). There is evidence of at least two major Pliocene drainage blocking events between 3.89 and 2.81 Ma (40Ar/39Ar) causing lava dammed lakes in which volcanic tuff deposits accumulated. Around this time the river Tana did not incise much and shaped an extensive fluvial plain, whose remnants can now be found around 1150 m altitude. This fluvial plain has been incising during the last 2.8 Ma, whereby the incision rate changed in time due to changing uplift rate and volcanic events. A flood basalt eruption covering 1150 km2, estimated to be 5 km3, on the south flank of Mt Kenya of the Thiba basalts at 0.80 Ma (40Ar/39Ar) plugged the Upper Tana basin and caused significant drainage reorganisation. The Tana was diverted southwards abandoning its former valley. The terrace record in the Tana valley downstream the Thiba basalts appears to register this event as a post 0.8 Ma accelerated incision. Current Thiba valley morphology is relatively young and appears to register uplift controlled terraces with interbedded lahars for the last 300 ka only, indicating a delayed fluvial response of approximately 0.5 Ma. The landscape reconstruction demonstrates that the Tana was well able to compensate for many volcanic events such as lahars and lava flows. Only the build-up of a stratovolcano body and a large flood basalt caused prolonged impact on fluvial landscape development. "

This paper aims to provide one of the longest combined observations of land cover and hydrological changes for semiarid areas using a time series of normalised mosaics of aerial photographs dating back from 1950, field inquiries, and updated groundwater data. The 500 km2 study area in southwest Niger was chosen (i) for its rural environment representative of the rain-fed agriculture belt of the Sahel and (ii) to encompass the main hydrological study sites investigated in this region over the past two decades (Hapex-Sahel and \{AMMA\} experiments, 1990–2000s). Results have significant implications for future freshwater availability and food security in the Sahel. Between 1950 and 1992, ∼ 80% of the study area has been cleared, firstly to open new areas for agriculture and secondly for firewood supply (59% of the plateaux, 42% of the valley bottoms, and 87% of the hillslopes). Intermediate aerial photograph surveys (1960, 1975) attest an accelerated loss in the woody savannah that could not be recovered on the short term. A strong, indirect impact of land clearance is observed on the water resources. Land clearance has resulted in a modification of the soil properties and infiltration capacity and has led to an increase in Hortonian runoff collected in numerous gullies and ponds. Between 1950 and 1992, aerial photographs show a ∼ 2.5 fold increase of the drainage density with the development of large drainage systems and new ponds. Groundwater data also indicate a continuous rise in the water table, mostly noticeable since the 1980s with a mean groundwater level rise of ∼ 4 m for the 1963–2005 period (+ 15% in aquifer reserves). The relatively short ∼ 30 year time-lag between the onset of land clearance and the beginning of the water table rise is linked to the process of indirect groundwater recharge and is timed with the connectivity of the drainage network and the formation of new ponds. Finally, the sustained increase in surface runoff and groundwater recharge during the past four decades indicates that the indirect impact of land clearance on the terrestrial water balance has been stronger than that of the long-lasting Sahelian drought. As the rate of land clearance increased for the past century in semiarid Africa, its main hydrological effects may not yet be fully perceptible. "

The present research in south-west Niger was undertaken to examine the role of micro-organisms and meso-fauna on in situ release rates of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) from cattle and sheep–goat manure collected from village corrals during the rainy season. The results show that (1) macro-organisms played a dominant role in the initial phase of manure decomposition; (2) manure decomposition was faster on crusted than on sandy soils; (3) throughout the study N and P release rates closely followed the dry matter decomposition; (4) during the first 6 weeks after application the K concentration in the manure declined much faster than N or P. At the applied dry matter rate of 18.8 Mg ha−1, the quantities of N, P and K released from the manure during the rainy season were up to 10-fold larger than the annual nutrient uptake of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.), the dominant crop in the traditional agro-pastoral systems. The results indicate considerable nutrient losses with the scarce but heavy rainfalls which could be alleviated by smaller rates of manure application. Those, however, would require a more labour intensive system of corralling or manure distribution. "

A loess hillslope located in eastern Golestan province of Iran was selected to study the role of deforestation and slope position on soil quality attributes. Surface (0–30 cm) and subsurface (30–60 cm) soil samples were taken from five slope positions (summit, SU, shoulder, SH, backslope, BS, footslope, \{FS\} and toeslope, TS) of forest (FO) and adjacent deforested cultivated land (DEF) in a factorial trial with completely randomized design. Ten pedons were also investigated and undisturbed soil samples were taken from different horizons for micromorphological studies. The texture of the original loess is silt loam. The soil textural class varies from silty clay loam in \{FO\} to silt loam in DEF, mainly due to the loss of finer particles as a result of soil erosion followed by deforestation and long-term cultivation. Mean weight diameter (MWD) of aggregates decreased following deforestation (0.88 mm compared to 1.49 mm in FO), as a result of considerable losses of organic carbon (OC) and breakdown of aggregates. Bulk density (BD) increased and soil infiltration rate decreased by about 50% in DEF. Reduction of annual organic matter input to soil as a result of deforestation and also rapid oxidation of organic matter in \{DEF\} were responsible for a significant decrease (&gt;70%) in \{OC\} and total nitrogen (TN). Soil microbial respiration (SMR) also decreased significantly, following deforestation. Carbon, and N contents and population of fungi were significantly higher in all hillslope positions of the \{FO\} than the DEF. Changes in soil quality attributes were not significant in different slope positions of FO, which might be related to the stability of forest landscape. Effect of different slope positions on soil quality attributes was more pronounced in the DEF. The \{SH\} and \{BS\} were found as the most susceptible positions to erosion in DEF. Soils of the \{FO\} were mainly classified as Alfisols and Mollisols with evidences for clay illuviation compared to the weakly developed Inceptisols formed in the DEF. Micromorphological investigations revealed that the \{FO\} soils had strong granular and crumb microstructure with a high porosity indicating the presence of high amount of organic matter. The high microbial and faunal activity was confirmed through the presence of excremental pedofeatures in the topsoil of the FO. Lower organic matter and consequently microbial activity in the topsoil of the \{DEF\} have resulted in the massive microstructure with little porosity. "

Merr.), the CROPGRO-Soybean model was calibrated and validated for the diverse soybean-growing environments of central and peninsular India. The validated model was used to estimate potential yields (water non-limiting and water limiting) and yield gaps of soybean for 21 locations representing major soybean regions of India. The average water non-limiting potential yield of soybean for the locations was 3020 kg ha−1, while the water limiting potential was 2170 kg ha−1 indicating a 28% reduction in yield due to adverse soil moisture conditions. As against this, the actual yields of locations averaged 1000 kg ha−1, which was 2020 and 1170 kg ha−1 less than the water non-limiting potential and water limiting potential yields, respectively. Across locations the water non-limiting potential yields were less variable than water limited potential and actual yields, and strongly correlated with solar radiation during the season (R2 = 0.83, p ≤ 0.01). Both simulated water limiting potential yield (R2 = 0.59, p ≤ 0.01) and actual yield (R2 = 0.33, p ≤ 0.05) had significant but positive and curvilinear relationships with crop season rainfall across locations. The gap between water non-limiting and water limiting potential yields was very large at locations with low crop season rainfall and narrowed down at locations with increasing quantity of crop season rainfall. On the other hand, the gap between water limiting potential yield and actual farmers yield was narrow at locations with low crop season rainfall and increased considerably at locations with increasing amounts of rainfall. This yield gap, which reflects the actual yield gap in rainfed environment, is essentially due to non-adoption of improved crop management practices and could be reduced if proper interventions are made. The simulation study suggested that conservation of rainfall and drought resistant varieties in low rainfall regimes; and alleviation of water-logging and use of water-logging tolerant varieties in high rainfall regimes will be the essential components of improved technologies aimed at reducing the yield gaps of soybean. Harvesting of excess rainfall during the season and its subsequent use as supplemental irrigation would further help in increasing crop yields at most locations. "

The \{N2O\} emissions strongly coincided with N fertilization and rainfall events. The cumulative N2O–N emission from Alfisols was 1.81 N2O–N kg/ha for 90 N treatment and 0.15 N2O–N kg/ha for the 0 N treatment. Similarly, the N2O–N emission from Vertisols was 0.70 N2O–N kg/ha for 90 N treatment and 0.09 N2O–N kg/ha for the 0 N treatment. The mean N2O–N emission factor for fertilizer induced emissions from the Alfisols was 0.90% as compared to 0.32% for Vertisols. Our results suggest that the \{N2O\} emissions are dependent on the soil properties.

A study was undertaken to determine the extent of stakeholder participation in water quality monitoring and surveillance at the operational level, and also to assess indigenous knowledge and practices in water quality monitoring. Two hundred and forty one questionnaires were administered in Mzingwane Catchment, the portion of the Limpopo Basin that falls within Zimbabwe. The focus was on small users in rural communities, whose experiences were captured using a questionnaire and focus group discussions. Extension workers, farmers and \{NGOs\} and relevant sector government ministries and departments were also interviewed and a number of workshops held. Results indicate that there is very limited stakeholder participation despite the presence of adequate supportive structures and organisations. For the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA), stakeholders are the paying permit holders to whom feedback is given following analysis of samples. However, the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare generally only releases information to rural communities when it is deemed necessary for their welfare. There are no guidelines on how a dissatisfied member of the public can raise a complaint – although some stakeholders carry such complaints to Catchment Council meetings. With regard to water quality, the study revealed widespread use of indigenous knowledge and practice by communities. Such knowledge is based on smell, taste, colour and odour perceptions. Residents are generally more concerned about the physical parameters than the bacteriological quality of water. They are aware of what causes water pollution and the effects of pollution on human health, crops, animals and aquatic ecology. They have ways of preventing pollution and appropriate interventions to take when a source of water is polluted, such as boiling water for human consumption, laundry and bathing, or abandoning a water source in extreme cases. Stakeholder participation and ownership of resources needs to be encouraged through participatory planning, and integration between the three government departments (water, environment and health). Local knowledge systems could be integrated into the formal water quality monitoring systems, in order to complement the conventional monitoring networks. "

A total of nine farmers who were practicing surface irrigation were chosen to participate in the study. The vegetable English giant rape (Brassica napus) was grown under the two irrigation systems with three fertilizer treatments in each system: ordinary granular fertilizer, liquid fertilizer (fertigation) and the last treatment with no fertilizer. These trials were replicated three times in a randomized block design. Biometric parameters of leaf area index (LAI) and fresh weight of the produce, water use efficiency (WUE) were used to compare the performance of the two irrigation systems. A water balance of the inflows and outflows was kept for analysis of WUE. The economic profitability and the operation, maintenance and management requirements of the different systems were also evaluated. There was no significant difference in vegetable yield between the irrigation systems at 8.5 ton/ha for drip compared to 7.8 ton/ha in surface irrigation. There were significant increases in yields due to use of fertilizers. Drip irrigation used about 35% of the water used by the surface irrigation systems thus giving much higher water use efficiencies. The leaf area indices were comparable in both systems with the same fertilizer treatment ranging between 0.05 for surface without fertilizer to 6.8 for low cost drip with fertigation. Low cost drip systems did not reflect any labour saving especially when manually lifting the water into the drum compared to the use of siphons in surface irrigation systems. The gross margin level for surface irrigation was lower than for low cost drip irrigation but the gross margin to total variable cost ratio was higher in surface irrigation systems, which meant that surface irrigation systems gave higher returns per variable costs incurred. It was concluded that low cost drip systems achieved water saving of more than 50% compared to surface irrigation systems and that it was not the type of irrigation system that influenced the yield of vegetables significantly but instead it is the type of fertilizer application method that contribute to the increase in the yield of vegetables. It was recommended that low cost technologies should be used in conjunction with good water and nutrient management if higher water and crop productivity are to be realized than surface irrigation systems.

Molecular and morphological identification showed that these cercariae belonged Acanthostomum burminis infecting freshwater snakes as definitive hosts. These cercariae induced malformations (27.8%) and reduced survival to metamorphosis (53.8%). The magnitude of the effects increased with the dose of cercariae. Types of malformations were mainly axial, such as scoliosis and kyphosis. Severe limb malformations such as extra or missing limbs as reported for amphibians exposed to R. ondatrae were not observed in the D. melanostictus. Same authors reported a higher percentage of malformations previously when P. cruciger was exposed to the cercariae A. burminis compared to D. melanostictus. However, tadpoles of D. melanostictus, which are smaller compared to those of P. cruciger, experienced higher mortality than P. cruciger tadpoles. Trematode induced malformations and mortality in amphibians are highly variable and depend on multiple factors such as host species differences such as resistance to infection and tolerance, life-history characteristics such as size at metamorphosis and length of the metamorphosis period, and other factors such as size of the amphibian at the time of trematode exposure.

The study utilizes cross-sectional farm household level data collected in 2008 from a randomly selected sample of 1313 households (700 in Ethiopia and 613 in Tanzania). The causal impact of technology adoption is estimated by utilizing endogenous switching regression. This helps us estimate the true welfare effect of technology adoption by controlling for the role of selection problem on production and adoption decisions. Our analysis reveals that adoption of improved agricultural technologies has a significant positive impact consumption expenditure (in per adult equivalent terms) in rural Ethiopia and Tanzania. This confirms the potential role of technology adoption in improving rural household welfare as higher consumption expenditure from improved technologies translate into lower poverty, higher food security and greater ability to withstand risk. An analysis of the determinants of adoption highlighted inadequate local supply of seed, access to information and perception about the new cultivars as key constraints for technology adoption. "

Common regulatory frameworks are expected to reduce the costs of trading seed and encourage scale economies in seed production. As a result, commercial seed production is expected to expand, providing farmers with improved access to new varieties and stimulating productivity growth. The impact of these harmonization efforts will depend on the details of the regulatory agreements. Policy-makers are being asked to consider a complicated series of trade-offs between stricter measures for quality control and the need to encourage the multiplication and distribution of lower-cost seed. They are also being confronted with two possible views of sectoral development. One view entails the pursuit of better linkages between distinct national seed markets. The second involves the development of truly regionalized seed markets, where seed can be readily produced in one country and sold in any other country. This implies greater regional interdependence of seed supply. The paper compares the harmonization agreements being pursued in each of the three African regions and progress in implementing the accords. Efforts to adapt international seed market standards to the contingencies of African markets are discussed and priorities for further policy analysis are identified. "

A review of African smallholder experiences with integrated soil fertility management practices finds growing use, both indigenously and through participation in agricultural projects. Patterns of use vary considerably across heterogeneous agroecological conditions, communities and households, but are stimulated by profitable commercially oriented agricultural opportunities. The potential for integrated soil fertility management to expand markets for organic inputs, labor, credit, and fertilizer is explored.

The engineering of the legume symbiosis is addressed by participatory assessment of bean recombinant inbred lines contrasting for their efficiency in use of phosphorous for symbiotic nitrogen fixation. With this methodology, in field-sites chosen with farmers of an area of cereal-cropping in the Mediterranean basin, a large spatial and temporal variation in the legume nodulation was found. Soil P availability was a major limiting factor of the rhizobial symbiosis. In order to relate the field measurements with progress in functional genomics of the symbiosis, in situ RT-PCR on nodule sections has been implemented showing that the phytase gene is expressed in the cortex with significantly higher number of transcripts in P-efficient RILs. It is concluded that various tools and indicators are available for developing the ecological engineering of the rhizobial symbiosis, in particular for its beneficial contribution to the bio-geochemical cycle of N, and also P and C.

The alluvial aquifers form ribbon shaped aquifers extending along the channel and reaching over 20 km in length in some localities and are enhanced at lithological boundaries. These alluvial aquifers extend laterally outside the active channel, and individual alluvial aquifers have been measured with area ranging from 45 ha to 723 ha in the channels and 75 ha to 2196 ha on the plains. The alluvial aquifers are more pronounced in the Lower Mzingwane, where the slopes are gentler and allow for more sediment accumulation. Estimated water resources potential ranges between 175,000 m3 and 5,430,000 m3 in the channels and between 80,000 m3 and 6,920,000 m3 in the plains. Such a water resource potential can support irrigation ranging from 18 ha to 543 ha for channels alluvial aquifers and 8 ha to 692 ha for plain alluvial aquifers. Currently, some of these aquifers are being used to provide water for domestic use, livestock watering and dip tanks, commercial irrigation and market gardening. The water quality of the aquifers in general is fairly good due to regular recharge and flushing out of the aquifers by annual river flows and floodwater. Water salinity was found to increase significantly in the end of the dry season, and this effect was more pronounced in water abstracted from wells on the alluvial plains. During drought years, recharge is expected to be less and if the drought is extended water levels in the aquifers may drop substantially, increasing salinity problems. "

Predictions for southern Africa suggest a general decrease in total seasonal rainfall, accompanied by more frequent in-season dry spells that will significantly impact crop and livestock production, and hence economic growth in the region. The hardest hit will be the rural poor in the drier areas, where crop failure due to drought is already common and chronic food emergencies afflict the region in most years. Lessons can be learnt on how the rural poor currently cope with the vagaries of climate and these can be used to help them adapt their current production systems to the future threats of further climate change. But this assumes the institutions that work towards the economic empowerment of the rural poor have the requisite skills to understand their current coping strategies and how adaptation can be facilitated. A new initiative led by Midlands State University and the Zambian Meteorological Office proposes that improving the ability of institutions that train the ‘Future Change Agents’, who will subsequently support smallholder communities in adapting their agricultural practices to current climate variability, is the first step in building adaptive capacity to cope with future climate change. The capacity of African scientists, regional organizations and decision-makers in dealing with the issues of climate change and adaptation will be enhanced on a continuing basis, and the impacts of their agricultural development programs improved.

However, in Sub-Saharan Africa \{IWRM\} planning in such catchments, and the basins they form part of, are often ungauged or constrained by poor data availability. Regionalisation of a hydrological model presents opportunities for prediction in ungauged basins and catchments. This study regionalises HBVx, derived from the conceptual hydrological model HBV, in the semi-arid Mzingwane Catchment, Limpopo Basin, Zimbabwe. Fifteen meso-catchments were studied, including three that were instrumented during the study. Discriminant analysis showed that the characteristics of catchments in the arid agro-ecological Region V were significantly different from those in semi-arid Region IV. Analysis of flow duration curves statistically separated sub-perennial catchments from (sub-)ephemeral catchments. Regionalised parameter sets for \{HBVx\} were derived from means of parameters from the sub-perennial catchments, the (sub-)ephemeral catchments and all catchments. The parameter sets that performed best in the regionalisation are characterised by slow infiltration with moderate/fast “overland flow”. These processes appear more extreme in more degraded catchments. This is points to benefits to be derived from conservation techniques that increase infiltration rate and from runoff farming. Faster, and possibly greater, sub-surface contribution to streamflow is expected from catchments underlain by granitic rocks. Calibration and regionalisation were more successful at the dekad (10 days) time step than when using daily or monthly data, and for the sub-perennial catchments than the (sub-)ephemeral catchments. However, none of the regionalised parameter sets yielded \{CNS\} ⩾ 0.3 for half of the catchments. The \{HBVx\} model thus does offer some assistance to river basin planning in semi-arid basins, particularly for predicting flows in ungauged catchments at longer time steps, such as for water allocation purposes. However, the model is unreliable for more ephemeral and drier catchments. Without more reliable and longer rainfall and runoff data, regionalisation in semi-arid ephemeral catchments will remain highly challenging. "

This results in variable infiltration over a field. Measurements of spatial variability in infiltration and crop growth were made in a millet field at the southern supersite of the HAPEX-Sahel experiment in Niger. Infiltration was calculated from the change in soil water storage measured using a neutron probe at up to 33 locations, before and after rain storms exceeding 10 mm. Data were obtained for five storms in 1993 and 1994. Infiltration varied from 0.3 to 3.4 times the recorded rainfall, though more than 80% of the locations had infiltration between 0.6 and 1.2 times the recorded rainfall. There was some consistency between storms, with locations at the extremes of infiltration having consistently high or low infiltration. The amount of infiltration had little discernable influence on crop growth, other than possibly at the very dry and very wet sites, where growth was reduced. The soil water balance model, SWIM, was used to assess the consequences of variable infiltration and crop growth on the partitioning of water losses between evaporation and drainage in 1992. Simulation of variable infiltration suggested that it has relatively little effect on evaporation, but considerable effect on point drainage. Once there was sufficient infiltration to cause drainage (which was achieved in all but extreme runoff areas), there was a linear relationship between any further cumulative infiltration and the annual loss through drainage, with typically more than 70% of any further input being lost as drainage. This linear relationship meant that on a field scale, variable infiltration had minimal effect on drainage, with increased drainage from runon areas tending to be at the expense of reduced drainage from runoff areas.

However, for many African farmers the large scale use of external inputs will remain beyond reach for the foreseeable future. There is, therefore, also a need for increasing the efficiency of use of locally available nutrients such as manure and crop residues. Data from our manure application experiment for a pearl millet crop in south west Niger showed that, within twelve months of application of cattle manure at rates similar to those found in farmers' fields (9–10 t ha−1), on average 1070 kg ha−1 of C, 91 kg ha−1 of N and 19 kg ha−1 of P were leached to between 1.5 and 2.0 m depth (n=4). In this paper a further analysis is presented of data from that experiment, from individual plots with a range of manure application rates. All other things being equal, the lowest and wettest plots, on concave slopes, suffered the greatest leaching losses of both cattle and sheep manure and urine. The driest plots on convex slopes had the smallest losses. To obtain good millet yields, larger amounts of cattle manure and urine were needed on concave plots than on convex plots. Sheep manure and urine appeared to be a much more efficient organic fertiliser for concave, acid, leached depressions than cattle manure. This is probably due to the fact that sheep urine increased soil pH much more than cattle urine. Given these results, there appear to be possibilities for increasing manure use efficiency in the Sahel, and elsewhere in Africa, by applying manure at different rates on different parts of a farmer's field, in accordance with micro-topographical changes. Fertiliser use efficiency could likely be increased in a similar manner. "

The main objective of this study was to identify water saving rice production technology for rice grown in sandy loam soils in semi-arid conditions using the calibrated CERES-Rice and Maize models of the Decision Support System for Agro Technology Transfer (DSSAT). A two-year experiment with two different crop establishment methods viz., aerobic rice and flooded rice with four nitrogen rates followed by maize under zero tilled conditions was used to calibrate and evaluate \{DSSAT\} CERES-Rice and CERES-Maize models. The calibrated models were used to develop best management options for an aerobic rice–maize sequence which can produce similar yields with water savings relative to that of traditional flooded rice–maize system. The results showed that application of 180 kg N ha−1 in four splits and automatic irrigation with 40 mm, when soil available water (ASW) in top 30 cm fell below to 60% was the best management combination for aerobic rice, saving 41% of water while producing 96% of the yield attainable under flooded conditions. Similarly for maize, application of 120 kg N ha−1 and irrigation with 30 mm of water at 40% \{ASW\} in the top 30 cm soil was the most dominant management option. Further, application of 180 kg N ha−1 with rice followed by 120 kg N ha−1 in maize provided stable yield for both aerobic and flooded rice systems over time as simulated by the model. The results illustrate that \{DSSAT\} model is a useful tool for evaluating alternative management options aimed at maintaining yields and saving water in rice–maize systems in semi-arid regions. "

The most effective and efficient way of managing losses due to \{DM\} is to develop durable host-plant resistance in Asian maize across different \{DM\} pathogens. We assessed resistance in released \{DM\} (P. zeae) resistant \{CIMMYT\} maize lines (CMLs) against Peronosclerospora sorghi and Perenosclerospora heteropogoni to develop \{DM\} resistant (DMR) maize germplasm with a broad-spectrum of resistance, and identify and further improve new sources of \{DMR\} maize germplasm for use in regional breeding programs targeting DM-prone environments. Data indicated that out of 19 \{DM\} resistant CMLs, four (CML-433, 465, 466 and 472) were resistant and 15 susceptible to P. sorghi. Screening of new inbred lines from CIMMYT-Asia (CA) resulted in identification of a set of yellow maize lines with good level of \{DM\} resistance (disease score – 0.0–25%). However, the high quality protein maize (QPM) lines derived from \{CIMMYT\} Population 61 and bi-parental pedigree crosses between elite \{QPM\} lines showed very poor resistance to DM. Progenies of the bi-parental population developed by crossing \{DMR\} (P. sorghi) \{CA\} lines showed further enhanced levels of resistance to both P. sorghi and P. heteropogoni. The study resulted in identification of 10 new inbred lines, in addition to the 4 released CMLs, offering consistent high resistance to both the \{DM\} pathogens. Promising bi-parental populations (13) with combined \{DM\} resistance and other desirable agronomic traits were identified for the extraction of a new generation of \{DMR\} lines with broad-spectrum \{DM\} resistance and other commercial traits. Comparison of genotypic response under different screening methods/DM species clearly indicated that the glasshouse-based sandwich method of screening against P. sorghi was the best method for identifying promising genotypes with a high level of \{DM\} resistance that were also resistant to \{DM\} under field conditions for both the species. However, the highly controlled conditions used for sandwich screening, which is most favourable for disease development, resulted in high disease pressure potentially masking the identification of genotypes with a moderate level of \{DM\} resistance.

The study aimed at determining the incidence of fungal species – emphasis on Aspergillus section Flavi – associated with peanut products. A 0.5 kg representative sample was obtained from each surveyed vendor and the colony forming units (CFU) of fungal species determined. The samples were also analyzed for total aflatoxin level while isolates of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus were screened for production of aflatoxin B1, B2, \{G1\} and G2. Eight fungal species were detected in the samples and were in decreasing order of CFU/g of sample: A. flavus S-strain (467), A. flavus L-strain (341), Penicillium spp. (326), Aspergillus niger (156), Aspergillus tamari (27), Aspergillus alliaceus (21), A. parasiticus (10), and Aspergillus caelatus (5). The overall incidence of A. flavus S-strain in samples from Nairobi was 92 and 1425% higher than samples from Nyanza and Western regions, respectively. The combined incidence of A. flavus and A. parasiticus was varied significantly (p ≤ 0.05) with peanut product: peanut flour (69%), shelled raw peanuts (53%), spoilt peanuts (49%), boiled podded peanuts (45%), podded peanuts (39%), peanut butter (31%), fried peanuts (22%) and roasted peanuts (20%). Seventy three percent of A. flavus and A. parasiticus isolates produced at least one of the aflatoxin types, with 66% producing aflatoxin B1. The total aflatoxin level among peanut products ranged from 0 to 1629 μg/g; and there was a positive correlation (r = 0.2711) between the incidence of A. flavus and A. parasiticus, and total aflatoxin level. The high incidence of aflatoxin producing fungi in peanuts traded in Kenyan markets implies a risk of aflatoxin contamination, highlighting the need for stakeholders to promote sound practices at all stages of the peanut value chain in order to minimize market access by non-complying products.

In the present research, in experiments in farmers’ fields in Niger, 86.8% (SE = 2.6%) communication disruption was achieved when polyethylene vials loaded with 0.5 mg pheromone at 400 dispensers/ha were used and replaced every 21 days.

Experiments carried out on replicated 0.5 ha plots in farmers’ fields in Niger using a single application of these dispensers at 400 dispensers/ha resulted in at least 99% suppression of pheromone trap catches of male C. ignefusalis moths in treated plots relative to numbers in untreated plots for up to 3 months. However, sampling the central portions of these plots before and after harvest showed no significant differences in infestation, damage or yield loss between plots treated with pheromone and untreated plots. This may have been because of small plot size and the immigration of mated female moths into the treated plots which negated any reduction of mating of females within the treated plots. Comparisons of numbers of male C. ignefusalis moths in traps baited with the standard 0.5 mg monitoring lures and those baited with the 80 mg disruption dispensers showed catches in the latter were only 10–20% of those in the former; indicating high level communication disruptions in traps with high dose dispensers.

In a long-term field experiment at Patancheru, India, we evaluated four diverse dryland cropping systems that each included safflower for their effectiveness in controlling Fusarium wilt in safflower. Sorghum (rainy season crop) and safflower (post-rainy season crop) were grown every alternate year as a two-year rotation with: (1) sorghum intercropped with pigeonpea (S/PP − S + SF); (2) cowpea intercropped with pigeonpea (C/PP − S + SF); (3) sorghum followed by chickpea (S + \{CP\} − S + SF); (4) sorghum followed by safflower (S + \{SF\} − S + SF). Continuous sorghum and safflower (S + \{SF\} − S + SF) had higher Fusarium wilt incidence of fully wilted safflower plants (31%) and a larger build-up of Fusarium propagules (1728 cfu g−1 of soil) than other cropping systems. The inclusion of a legume such as chickpea in the rotation (S + \{CP\} − S + SF) reduced wilt incidence (7% fully wilted plants) and the level of inoculum in the soil to about 800 cfu g−1. There was a significant increase in safflower seed yield and biomass yield (883 and 1733 kg ha−1, respectively) in the S + \{CP\} − S + \{SF\} rotation compared with the S + \{SF\} − S + \{SF\} rotation (605 and 1323 kg ha−1, respectively). Nitrogen application at rates of 0 to 120 kg N ha−1 had no effect on wilt incidence in safflower, but increased seed and biomass yield significantly. Intercrop rotations (S/PP − S + \{SF\} and C/PP − S + SF) were less effective to manage the Fusarium wilt. The Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) was almost 10 times higher in the S + \{SF\} − S + \{SF\} rotation (2842) compared with the S + \{CP\} − S + \{SF\} rotation (297). Wilt progress throughout the season in all four systems was linear, with significant differences in intercepts and rates of disease progress among cropping systems; the rate of disease progress was significantly greater in the S + \{SF\} − S + \{SF\} rotation compared with the other three systems, which were similar. There was also a strong linear relationship between wilt incidence and the number of Fusarium propagules in the soil; regressions had the same slope but different intercepts in each system. There was no relationship between wilt incidence and seed yield; nitrogen had the largest effect on yields. A break from safflower cultivation for one year in the post-rainy season by growing chickpea as a sequential crop after sorghum, or as an intercrop with pigeonpea and sorghum, combined with higher rates of nitrogen application to safflower appears to be an effective strategy for reducing Fusarium populations and sustaining safflower yield.

We observed genetic variation for P uptake and utilization in both seedling and mature plants. P utilization efficiency increased under \{LP\} conditions. Total P uptake was more important for grain production than P utilization under \{LP\} field conditions (r = 0.57*** vs r = 0.30***). The estimated response to indirect selection was positive for most of the measured morphological and P-efficiency parameters. We conclude that both seedling and mature plant traits are potentially useful as secondary traits in selection of pearl millet for low-P adaptation. These results should be validated using heterozygous pearl millet genetic materials. Ultimately, pearl millet breeding activities for low P tolerance in \{WA\} should be integrated with other system-oriented research such as nutrient cycling, intercropping or rotations with legumes, better crop-tree-livestock integration, and modest applications of locally available rock phosphate.

In chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), which faces terminal drought and increasing temperature at the end of its growing season, it is widely considered that longer duration genotypes are needed for the higher latitudes of India and shorter duration genotypes for lower latitudes. Here, we compare two sets of genotypes bred in two locations varying in latitude (high latitude: Hisar, Haryana, India; low latitude: ICRISAT, Andhra Pradesh, India) for the number of biological days from emergence to flowering (EMR1) and for the grain filling period (R5R7). Biological days referred to days where the phenological development was optimal and therefore provides a measure of thermal time. Using a robust crop simulation model, the optimum \{EMR1\} and \{R5R7\} were determined for various locations. As expected, \{EMR1\} and \{R5R7\} values of genotypes bred for low latitude were lower than those bred for high latitude. However, predicted yields of these two sets of genotypes were similar when simulated for each of the two environments, yields being overall higher at Hisar. Results for the combined set of genotypes at each location predicted a similar optimum \{EMR1\} to achieve maximum yield at each location: 44.3 biological days at Hisar and 43.5 biological days at ICRISAT. Derivation of optimum \{EMR1\} across a total of ten locations in India indicated a wider range (37.2–51.8 biological days), although in eight locations the optimum \{EMR1\} was in a narrower range (39.4–47.3 biological days). The differences in \{EMR1\} across locations did not correspond to their latitudinal differences. Instead, rainfall through the growing season was significantly and positively related (R2 = 0.55) to optimum EMR1. These results indicate that the breeding for optimum \{EMR1\} of chickpea in India needs to be focused on expected rainfall for a region, and that an optimum \{EMR1\} of about 43 biological days would likely fit most of the environments.

This underpins the livelihood of about 5 million households. Severe drought is common as the crop grown in these areas relies largely on soil moisture stored during the preceding rainy season. Improvement of rabi sorghum cultivars through breeding has been slow but could be accelerated if drought scenarios in the production regions were better understood. The sorghum crop model within the \{APSIM\} (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) platform was used to simulate crop growth and yield and the pattern of crop water status through each season using available historical weather data. The current model reproduced credibly the observed yield variation across the production region (R2 = 0.73). The simulated trajectories of drought stress through each crop season were clustered into five different drought stress patterns. A majority of trajectories indicated terminal drought (43%) with various timings of onset during the crop cycle. The most severe droughts (25% of seasons) were when stress began before flowering and resulted in failure of grain production in most cases, although biomass production was not affected so severely. The frequencies of drought stress types were analyzed for selected locations throughout the rabi tract and showed different zones had different predominating stress patterns. This knowledge can help better focus the search for adaptive traits and management practices to specific stress situations and thus accelerate improvement of rabi sorghum via targeted specific adaptation. The case study presented here is applicable to other sorghum growing environments. "

Crop growth depends on the soil moisture contained in the soil profile, commonly leading to terminal water deficits. The past three decades of research have focused on improving rooting traits, with a particular focus on the speed of root extension in the soil, making the assumption that this would lead to more water extraction. Here, we used a robust crop simulation model to assess genetic and management modifications that would affect water availability to the crop. Against expectations, increasing the rate of depth of root extension to 30 mm day−1 from a baseline of 17 mm day−1, to reflect the characteristics of an existing root trait quantitative trait locus (QTL) on linkage group 5 of chickpea, brought about a yield penalty in all situations (4–6%), especially in locations where the in-season rainfall was low (up to a 15% yield penalty). By contrast, modifying soil characteristics by increasing the depth of effective water extraction from 1000 mm to 1200 mm led to yield increases in all situations (8–12%) as a result of greater water available at the end of the growing season. Changing the rate of leaf area development rate associated with the root \{QTL\} locus on LG5, had no impact on yield except for a yield increase at the two highest yielding locations. The greatest changes in yield were obtained by irrigating the crop with 30 mm at \{R5\} (beginning of seed growth). The average yield gain across all locations was 29% and the high yield benefit was achieved across all yield levels. These results indicated that some benefit would come from growing the crop in soil with a higher depth of effective water extraction, which may require faster root growth in very low rainfall environments, but the greatest yield benefit would result from modest irrigation at R5.

abstract = "Many farmers in central Mozambique intercrop maize with grain legumes as a means to improve food security and income. The objective of this study was to understand the farming system, and to evaluate the suitability of maize–legume intercropping to alleviate the biophysical and socio-economic constraints faced by smallholder farmers in Ruaca and Vunduzi villages, central Mozambique. To achieve this we characterised the farming systems and measured grain yields, rainfall infiltration, economic returns and acceptability of maize–legume intercrops under different N and P application rates. Two intercropping strategies were tested: (a) an additive design of within-row intercropping in which legume was intercropped with alternating hills of maize within the same row; maize plant population was the same as sole crop maize, and (b) a substitutive design with distinct alternating rows of maize and legume (local practice). Fertiliser treatments imposed on all treatments were: (i) no fertiliser, (ii) 20 kg P ha−1, (iii) 20 kg P ha−1 + 30 kg N ha−1, and (iv) 20 kg P ha−1 + 60 kg N ha−1. Intercrops were relatively more productive than the corresponding sole crops; land equivalent ratios (LER) for within-row intercropping ranged between 1.1 and 2.4, and between 1.0 and 1.9 for distinct-row intercropping. Average maize yield penalty for intercropping maize and pigeonpea in the within-row was small (8%) compared with 50% in the distinct-row design; average (season × fertiliser) sole maize yield was 3.2 t ha−1. Intercropping maize and cowpea in within-row led to maize yield loss of only 6%, whereas distinct-row intercropping reduced maize yield by 25% from 2.1 t ha−1 of sole maize (season × fertiliser). Cowpea yield was less affected by intercropping: sole cowpea had an average yield of 0.9 t ha−1, distinct-row intercropping (0.8 t ha−1) and the within-row intercropping yielded 0.9 t ha−1. Legumes were comparatively less affected by the long dry spells which were prevalent during the study period. Response to N and P fertiliser was weak due to poor rainfall distribution. In the third season, maize in rotation with pigeonpea and without N fertiliser application yielded 5.6 t ha−1, eight times more than continuous maize which was severely infested by striga (Striga asiatica) and yielded only 0.7 t ha−1. Rainfall infiltration increased from 6 mm h−1 to 22 mm h−1 with long-term maize–legume intercropping due to a combination of good quality biomass production which provided mulch combined with no tillage. Intercropping maize and pigeonpea was profitable with a rate of return of at least 343% over sole maize cropping. Farmers preferred the within-row maize–legume intercropping with an acceptability score of 84% because of good yields for both maize and legume. Intercropping increased the labour required for weeding by 36% compared with the sole crops. Farmers in Ruaca faced labour constraints due to extensification thus maize–pigeonpea intercropping may improve productivity and help reduce the area cultivated. In Vunduzi, land limitation was a major problem and intensification through legumes is amongst the few feasible options to increase both production and productivity. The late maturity of pigeonpea means that free-grazing of cattle has to be delayed, which allows farmers to retain crop residues in the fields as mulch if they choose to; this allows the use of no-tillage practises. We conclude that maize–legume intercropping has potential to: (a) reduce the risk of crop failure, (b) improve productivity and income, and (c) increase food security in vulnerable production systems, and is a feasible entry point to ecological intensification.

Groundwater levels are declining despite water harvesting measures to enhance aquifer recharge which are supported on a massive scale by watershed development programmes. New programmes are being implemented to improve artificial percolation (i.e., managed aquifer recharge, MAR) although the impact of former measures on aquifer recharge has not yet been assessed. It is therefore crucial to increase our understanding of \{MAR\} to successfully overcome the threat of groundwater scarcity in the near future. This paper scrutinizes the ability of a typical percolation tank to recharge the aquifer using a comprehensive approach combining water accounting, geochemistry and hydrodynamic modelling. Over 2 years of observation, the percolation efficiency (percolated fraction of stored water) of the tank ranged from 57% to 63%, the rest being evaporated. Modelling showed that the percolated water was mostly (80%) pumped straight back by the neighbouring boreholes, limiting the area of \{MAR\} influence but increasing percolation efficiency. "

Here we give an overview over the different management options to control these pests. There is a growing interest in the genetic modification of crops to enhance their resistance against insect pests. Here we present the state-of-the-art of chickpea transformation and give an overview on the available insecticidal genes that could be deployed to increase insect resistance in chickpea. Prior to commercialization, transgenic crops have to be assessed for their effects on the environment including the possible impact on non-target arthropods, many of which are important for biological pest control. Therefore, the arthropod–food web in the Indian chickpea system is described. Possible routes through which entomophagous insects could be exposed to insecticidal proteins expressed by genetically modified chickpeas are discussed, and species that could be selected for pre-release risk assessment are recommended.

In the semi-arid regions of Southern India, farmers traditionally crop sorghum or chickpea on Vertisols during the post-rainy season, keeping the fields fallow during the rainy season. This practice avoids land management problems, but limits the potential for crop intensification to increase systems productivity. A long-term (15 year) experiment at \{ICRISAT\} demonstrated that cropping during the rainy season is technically feasible, and that grain productivity of double cropped sorghum + chickpea (SCP–SCP) and mung bean + sorghum (MS–MS) sequential systems were higher than their conventional counterparts with rainy season fallow, i.e. fallow + post-rainy sorghum (FS–FS) and fallow + post-rainy chickpea (FS–FCP). Without N application, mean grain yield of post-rainy sorghum in the MS–MS system was significantly greater (2520 kg ha−1 per two-year rotation) than in the FS–FS system (1940 kg ha−1 per two-year rotation), with the added benefit of the mung bean grain yield (1000 kg ha−1 per two-year rotation) from the MS–MS system. In the SCP–SCP system the additional grain yield of rainy sorghum (3400 kg ha−1 per two-year rotation) ensured that the total productivity of this system was greater than all other systems. Double cropping MS–MS and SCP–SCP sequential systems had significantly higher crop N uptake compared to traditional fallow systems at all rates of applied nitrogen (N). The intensified MS–MS and SCP–SCP sequential systems without any N fertilizer applied recorded a much higher median gross profit of Rs. 20,600 (US $ 375) and Rs. 15,930 (US $ 290) ha−1 yr−1, respectively, compared to Rs. 1560 (US $ 28) ha−1 yr−1) with the FS–FS system. Applying 120 kg of N ha−1 considerably increased the profitability of all systems, lifting median gross profits of the sorghum + chickpea system over Rs. 60,000 (US $ 1091) ha−1 yr−1 and the conventional system to Rs. 20,570 (US $ 374) ha−1 yr−1. The gross profit margin analysis showed that nitrogen is a key input for improving productivity, particularly for the double cropping systems. However, traditional systems are unviable and risky without N application in the variable climates of the semi-arid tropics. Together, our results show that on Vertisols in semi-arid India, double cropping systems increase systems’ productivity, and are financially more profitability and less risky than traditional fallow post-rainy systems while further benefits can be achieved through fertilizer application.

Lentil (Lens culinaris Med.) was grown during the 1985/86 and 1986/87 seasons at the same sites, following the wheat crops. During the 1985/86 season, no additional P was applied to the lentil crop. During the 1986/87 season, additional P was applied to the lentil crops grown at two of the three sites, in order to compare the residual and direct effects of P fertilizer application. Initial contents of extractable soil P (P-Olsen) were low at all sites: in the range of 2–5 ppm. The response of wheat to direct application of P and of lentil to residual P were described by a modified Mitscherlich equation accounting for the effect of rainfall on potential yield (under rainfed conditions) and on the availability of P to the crop. Under the conditions of the experiments, lentil benefited significantly from P fertilizer applied to the preceding wheat crop. It was concluded that a single application of P to the wheat crop in a wheat-lentil rotation would reduce the cost of lentil production without significantly reducing lentil yields. "

Even on pods with no or few hairs, the pod wall appeared to offer some resistance to both larval penetration and adult emergence. High levels of infestation by C. chinensis were recorded on pigeonpea pods with no or few hairs, those with pods damaged through shattering, and those with pods that had been previously damaged by pod borers. From the results of the study, it was recommended that pigeonpea selection should include screening for high pod hair density and thicker pod wall. "

The model predicted reasonably the temporal changes in leaf area index, biomass and grain yield. The model was used to develop yield–evapotranspiration (ET) relationship, and to assess the influence of soil water-storage capacity on yield. Yield was linearly related to \{ET\} and was reduced non-linearly as soil depth decreased. The yield reduction was minimal when depth decreased from 90 to 67 cm but severe reduction occurred when depth decreased below 45 cm. There exists a threshold soil depth (37 cm), below which crop productivity in Vertic Inceptisols cannot be sustained, even in good rainfall years.

Because experiments with only a few fertility management options on a limited number of sites and years cannot fully capture the complex and highly non-linear soil–climate–crop interactions, crop growth simulation models may suitably complement experimental research to support decision making regarding soil fertility and water management. By means of a long term (23 years) scenario analysis using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model, this study investigates millet response to N in view of establishing N recommendations better adapted to subsistence small-holder millet farming in the Sahel. Prior to this, the \{APSIM\} model was tested on a rainfed randomized complete block experiment carried out during the 1994 and 1995 cropping seasons, having contrasting rainfall conditions. The experiment combined, at three levels each, the application of cattle manure (300, 900 and 2700 kg ha−1), millet residue (300, 900 and 2700 kg ha−1) and mineral fertilizer (unfertilized control, 15 kg N ha−1 + 4.4 kg P ha−1 and 45 kg N ha−1 + 13.1 kg P ha−1) at \{ICRISAT\} Sahelian Center, Niger. The model suitably predicted plant available water \{PAW\} and the simulated water and nitrogen stress were in agreement with measurement (water) and expectation (N) regarding the fertilizer and rainfall conditions of the experiment. \{APSIM\} simulations were in satisfactory agreement with the observed crop growth except for the highest crop residue application rates (&gt;900 kg ha−1). For biomass and grain yield, the model performance was relatively good in 1994 but biomass yields were slightly overpredicted in 1995. The model was able to adequately reproduce the average trend of millet grain yield response to N inputs from manure and fertilizer, and to predict the overall observed higher grain yield in 1995 compared to 1994, despite the better rainfall in 1994. The 23-year, long term scenario analysis combining different application rates of cattle manure, millet residue and mineral fertilizer, showed that moderate N application (15 kg N ha−1) improves both the long term average and the minimum yearly guaranteed yield without increasing inter-annual variability compared to no N input. Although it does imply a lower average yield than at 30 kg N ha−1, the application of 15 kg N ha−1 appears more appropriate for small-holder, subsistence farmers than the usual 30 kg N ha−1 recommendation as it guarantees higher minimum yield in worst years, thereby reducing their vulnerability.

National and international breeding programs have had little success in disseminating modern varieties based on high yield potential caudatum or kafir race breeding materials, mostly introduced from other countries. It has been argued that the breeding objectives were not sufficiently oriented towards the farmers’ needs and preferences, and that they did not target the prevailing growing conditions of Burkina Faso. The objectives of the present article are (i) to identify and examine farmers’ selection criteria for sorghum varieties in the Centre-West of Burkina Faso, (ii) to compare these criteria with the breeder's agronomic observations and standard practices, and (iii) to show how the criteria of both farmers and breeders can be effectively integrated into the early stages of a pedigree breeding program. These objectives take into consideration gender differentiation, consistency of selection criteria and the interrelationship of measured quantitative traits, as well as the impact of these traits and criteria on the final selection. The present paper is based on a pedigree breeding program that was carried out over three years (2001–2003) in two villages of Burkina Faso. Options for integrating farmers’ selection expertise with that of the breeders’ were examined. Participatory selection was initiated with 53 F3/F4 progenies in field trials managed by farmers using rating and voting exercises. The breeders measured and analysed the agronomic data while the farmers evaluated a large number of progenies by means of their three most important selection criteria and a general appreciation. Farmers’ initial choices remained consistent in the selection exercises (voting) performed in subsequent years. The farmers’ methods for defining traits turned out to be more multivariate than the breeders’ formal understanding of these same traits. This was especially so for the criteria of grain quality, earliness, and productivity for which the farmers’ definition encompasses factors such as flour yield and stability across environments. However, rating results between farmer groups were variable. A disagreement between female and male ratings was especially found for the grain quality traits. The results clearly show that farmers can effectively select for traits on the basis of progeny and single plants while pursuing specific agronomic aims such as adaption. Subsequent yield improvement schemes will thus be more efficient in terms of selection intensity related to grain yield. The study is showing the way for breeders to adjust their selection criteria to suit the basic needs of small-scale farmer in semi-arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa. "

We consider how the potential of smallholder farmers to address future milk and meat demands as livestock system transition may be impacted by the trajectory of intensification, the type of livestock commodity and the changing economic circumstances. Examples of ruminant feeding and management options with the potential to increase productivity and mitigate negative environmental impacts, notably greenhouse gases and the use of land and water in the context of developing country crop livestock systems are presented. However, such technical dimensions need to be realistically and practically considered in the context of changing market demands. Furthermore, if crop livestock systems in developing countries are to benefit today's smallholder farmers, radically different approaches will be needed. Equal importance will need to be given to technology based production and efficiency enhancing dimensions together with innovative and practical approaches encompassing institutional, policy and market solutions often in a value chain context.

The economic management of soil fertility in the agricultural area of Niger is analyzed using a dynamic model of farmer decision-making under uncertainty. The model is based on agronomic principles of plant growth and accounts for the carry over of P, an immobile nutrient. At current input prices, a soil P content of at least 14 pmm is found to be desirable. This target is above the natural soil fertility level of about 3 ppm. It can be maintained with a moderate annual application (12 kg \{P2O5\} ha-1) of simple superphosphate.

Conventional models based on fixed \{PP\} thresholds (qualitative response) or additive signal accumulation (qualitative response) are able to predict flowering for only a limited range of conditions. Recently, an alternative concept was proposed based on thresholds that vary with plant age. Using this concept, this study develops a generic model of \{PP\} response of sorghum called “Impatience” because it implements decreasing day length requirements during prolonged wait states, or appetence, during the photoperiod sensitive phase (PSP). The model was applied to experimental field data obtained from sowing date experiments in Mali, in order to validate it and evaluate the range of genotypic response that can be explained with it. It predicted accurately the observations that (1) \{PI\} does not occur at any genotype specific day length, but instead, on increasingly long days as the \{PSP\} is extended; (2) \{PI\} occurs predominantly when day length decreases, or after summer solstice; (3) the duration of \{PSP\} increases linearly (but not always proportionally) when crops are sown earlier in the year; (4), a genotype specific sowing date exists in winter (cool season) or spring (hot dry season) after which \{PSP\} suddenly increases by up to 160 days (“break point”); (5), the largest variance of \{PSP\} occurs near the break point. Most genotypic variations of this complex pattern could be simulated by fitting only one of the four model parameters while using default values for the three other parameters. However, the model tended to underestimate the duration of \{PSP\} when it fell into the cool season, which might be explained by specific thermal effects or a specific inhibitory effect of increasing day length on \{PI\} in some genotypes. The ability of the model to discriminate among genotypes was used to devise a simple, model assisted phenotyping methodology. Genotypic parameters were determined by fitting two model parameters to measured dates of flag leaf ligule appearance for three sowing dates. Thus parameterized, the model predicted accurately the phenological patterns of contrasting materials observed in different experiments. The authors discuss the physiological probability of the model's underlying concepts, the need for further studies to develop them into a comprehensive theory, and possible applications in crop simulation and varietal selection.

The range of variation in yields under salinity was similar in both kabuli and desi chickpeas, indicating that breeding for salinity tolerance can be undertaken in both groups. A strong relationship (r2 = 0.50) was found between the seed yield under salinity and the seed yield under a non-saline control treatment, indicating that the seed yield under salinity was explained in part by a yield potential component and in part by salinity tolerance per se. Seed yields under salinity were therefore computed to separate the yield potential component from the residuals that accounted for salinity tolerance per se. Among the genotypes evaluated, desi genotypes had higher salinity tolerance than kabuli genotypes. The residuals were highly correlated to the ratio of seed yield under salinity to that of the control, indicating that both parameters can be used to assess salinity tolerance. A similar ratio was calculated for shoot dry weight at 50 days after sowing. However, no significant correlation was found between the shoot dry weight ratio and the yield ratio, indicating that differences in salinity tolerance among genotypes could not be inferred from measurements in the vegetative stage. The major trait related to salinity tolerance was the ability to maintain a large number of filled pods, whereas seed size was similar in tolerant and sensitive genotypes. Salinity tolerance was not related to the shoot Na+ or K+ concentrations. "

In this paper, we analyse the relationship of arid zone adaptation with the expression, under optimum conditions, of yield components that determine either the potential sink size or the ability to realise this potential. The objective is to test whether selection under optimal conditions for yield components can identify germplasm with adaptation to arid zones in \{NW\} India, as this could potentially improve the efficiency of pearl millet improvement programs targeting arid zones. We use data from an evaluation of over 100 landraces from \{NW\} India, conducted for two seasons under both severely drought-stressed and favourable conditions in northwest and south India. Trial average grain yields ranged from 14 g m−2 to 182 g m−2. The landraces were grouped into clusters, based on their phenology and yield components as measured under well-watered conditions in south India. In environments without pre-flowering drought stress, tillering type had no effect on potential sink size, but low-tillering, large-panicled landraces yielded significantly more grain, as they were better able to realise their potential sink size. By contrast, in two low-yielding arid zone environments which experienced pre-anthesis drought stress, low-tillering, large-panicled landraces yielded significantly less grain than high-tillering ones with comparable phenology, because of both a reduced potential sink size and a reduced ability to realise this potential. The results indicate that the high grain yield of low-tillering, large-panicled landraces under favourable conditions is due to improved partitioning, rather than resource capture. However, under severe stress with restricted assimilate supply, high-tillering, small-panicled landraces are better able to produce a reproductive sink than are large-panicled ones. Selection under optimum conditions for yield components representing a resource allocation pattern favouring high yield under severe drought stress, combined with a capability to increase grain yield if assimilates are available, was more effective than direct selection for grain yield in identifying germplasm adapted to arid zones. Incorporating such selection in early generations of variety testing could reduce the reliance on random stress environments. This should improve the efficiency of millet breeding programs targeting arid zones. "

Moench] cultivars given, 0, 20, 40, and 80 kg nitrogen (N) ha−1. When fertilized with 80 kg N ha−1, warming temperatures decreased average yields at Chitala and Beitbridge and yields were unchanged at Makindu and Katumani, but with no added fertilizer average yields increased with increase in temperature at all sites except the hottest and driest site, Beitbridge, where the simulated yields decreased with increasing temperature. Simulation of the changes in soil organic carbon showed that the higher temperatures increased the rate of loss of soil organic carbon and increased nitrogen uptake at all except the driest and hottest site. A micro-dose (20 kg N ha−1) of added nitrogen increased the simulated yields by an average of 19% at Beitbridge, 36% at Makindu, 59% at Katumani and 72% at Chitala, considerably greater than any increase from increased temperatures. The use of longer-duration cultivars and lower or higher populations could not consistently be used to overcome any reductions in yield from warming temperatures. We conclude that low-input, small-holder farmers will not immediately have reduced sorghum yields as a consequence of global warming, but micro-dosing with nitrogen fertilizer will significantly increase yields even in the hottest and driest locations.

The analysis is based on a three year (2008–2010) panel sample of small holder farming households across 15 rural districts in Zimbabwe. We make a comparison of \{CA\} with alternative conventional farming methods. Our empirical strategy consists of two methods. First, using a fixed effects model, we estimate maize production functions and derive technical change estimates under \{CA\} and conventional farming. Second, we estimate a joint stochastic production frontier to compare productivity and technical efficiency between \{CA\} and conventional farming. Under CA, technical progress has been land-saving but seed and fertilizer-using, while it has been land-using but seed-saving in conventional farming. Lastly, the results of the efficiency analysis show that that farmers produce 39% more in \{CA\} compared with conventional farming, but technical efficiency levels are essentially equal in both technologies. Overall, the results show significant yield gains in \{CA\} practices and significant contributions to food production. \{CA\} is land-saving, and this is an important issue for land constrained farmers because they can still have viable food production on smaller area. However, high labor and fertilizer demands in \{CA\} present some problems in adoption amongst resource-constrained farmers. "

Although the biophysical implications of \{AWIs\} have been well investigated, the coupling between the biophysical changes and the economic implications thereof is less well understood. In this study we translate the results from a hydrological model, SWAT, on crop yields for different cropping systems with and without agricultural water interventions, to hypothetical farm incomes for a watershed, Kothapally, located in Andhra Pradesh, India. It was found that on average, \{AWI\} significantly improved farm incomes by enabling the cultivation of a high value crop during the monsoon season (cotton), supplementary irrigated to bridge dry spells and replacing a traditional crop (sorghum), and also by enhancing the capacity to produce dry season, fully irrigated vegetable crops, in this case exemplified by onion. \{AWI\} combined with cotton resulted in more than a doubling of farm incomes compared to traditional sorghum-based systems without \{AWI\} during normal and wet years (i.e. for 75% of the years). Interestingly, we observed that the difference between the \{AWI\} system and the no intervention system was larger during years of high average rainfall compared to dry years. It was also found that access to irrigation was more important for farm income than crop choice and \{AWI\} per se, and thus farms with access irrigation benefitted more from \{AWI\} compared to farmers lacking access to irrigation. In conclusion, we suggest that in order to assess equity aspects in terms of farm income generation following the implementation of an \{AWI\} project, there is a need for income analyses at the farm level, since income estimates at the watershed level may mask important differences in economic benefits between farms.

This paper investigates three major factors leading to reduction in performance of \{ASR\} systems in brackish or saline aquifers: lateral flow, density-driven flow and dispersive mixing. Previous analyses of aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) have considered at most two of the above processes, but never all three together, and none have considered lateral flow and density effects together. In this analysis, four dimensionless parameters are defined to give an approximate characterisation of lateral flow, dispersive mixing, mixed convection (density effects during pumping) and free convection (density effects during storage). An extensive set of numerical models spanning a wide parameter range is then used to develop a predictive framework using the dimensionless numbers. If the sum of the four dimensionless numbers (denoted RASR) exceeds 10, the \{ASR\} operation is likely to fail with no recoverable freshwater, while if \{RASR\} &lt; 0.1, the \{ASR\} operation is likely to provide at least some recovery of freshwater. The predictive framework is tested using limited data available from \{ASR\} field sites, broadly lending support to the framework. This study has several important implications. Firstly, the lack of completeness of field data sets in the literature must be rectified if we are to properly characterise mixed-convective flow processes in \{ASR\} operations. Once data are available, the dimensionless numbers can be used to identify suitable \{ASR\} sites and the desirable operational conditions that maximise recovery efficiencies. "

To reduce water use while maintaining high crop production level, improving variety water use efficiency (WUE) is an urgent need, especially because other water-saving measures such as water delivery, irrigation, and agricultural practices have already achieved most possible progresses. Evaluation of variety \{WUE\} can be performed accurately at the individual plant level (WUEp). Reviewing the studies on physiological factors affecting \{WUEp\} performed up to date, stomatal conductance was considered to be an important trait associating closely with WUEp. The trait showed a large degree of varietal variability under well-watered conditions. Crop varieties differ highly in sensitivity of stomata to soil and air drying, with some varieties strongly reducing their stomatal conductance in contrast with those lightly regulating their stomata. As a result, difference among varieties in \{WUEp\} was enlarged under water deficit conditions in contrast with those under well-watered conditions. The relationship between stomatal conductance and yield depends on water availability of whole growing period in local areas. Usually, large stomatal conductance results in a high yield under good irrigation system, whereas a low stomatal conductance can lead to yield benefit under limited stored soil moisture conditions. In the NCP, winter wheat is the largest consumer of irrigation water, improvement strategies for high \{WUE\} aiming at wheat crops are in urgent need. We suggest, for the well-irrigated areas with excessive exploitation of groundwater, the wheat breeding program need to combine medium stomatal conductance (0.35 mmol \{H2O\} m−2 s−1 or so), high carboxylation efficiency, and high harvest index. Areas with partial/full access to irrigation, or infrequent drought, should target wheat varieties with high stomatal conductance under no water stress and low sensitivity of stomata to soil water deficit. Drought-prone rain-fed areas characterized by frequent and long terminal drought should target wheat varieties with low stomatal conductance under no water stress and high stomata sensitivity to soil drying to make water available during grain filling.

Time series of \{MODIS\} imagery taken every eight days before (2001–2002) and during (2002–2003) the supply shock were combined with agricultural census data to document changes in cropping patterns in four large irrigation projects in the downstream sections of the Krishna and Godavari River basins (total command area 18,287 km2). The area cropped in rice in the four irrigated command areas decreased by 32% during the drought year, and rice production in the two districts that experienced the largest flow reductions fell below production levels of 1980. The irrigation project that showed the largest change in double cropped area (−90%) was upstream of the Krishna Delta. In the Krishna Delta, large areas changed from rice–rice to rice–gram double cropping. Historical water management contributed to the vulnerability of rice production to drought: the main reservoir in the system was drained to dead storage levels by the end of each growing season over 1968–2000, with little carryover storage. The land cover change maps suggested that the lower Krishna Basin has experienced a “hard landing” during basin closure, and revised management strategies that account for the new flow regime will be required to maintain agricultural production during droughts.

A long-term experiment was started in July 1988 at ICRISAT, Hyderabad, India, to evaluate practices to improve infiltration and reduce erosion by stimulating biological activity and protecting soil in the rainy season. This paper outlines the rationale for the experiment, describes it, and summarises early results. Fifteen treatments in a randomised block design were applied to plots 28.5 m long by 5 m wide on a 2% slope. Nine annual treatments made up a factorial sub-set: tillage by tined implement to three depths (0, 10 and 20 cm) combined with three mulch treatments (no mulch, farmyard manure (FYM) at 15 t ha−1, and rice straw at 5 t ha−1). Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) was sown in the factorial sub-set in July 1988. Six perennial species ley treatments (combinations of perennial pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), verano stylo (Stylosanthes hamata), and buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris)) completed the randomised block design. All treatments were replicated three times making 45 plots in total. Plots were instrumented to measure runoff and soil loss. Millet straw yield was reduced by tillage to 20 cm and grain yield was significantly reduced by tillage to both 10 and 20 cm. Mulches had no effect on millet straw yield but \{FYM\} significantly increased millet grain yield. The proportion of rainfall running off plots ranged from 15.8 to 39.1%. Perennial species treatments tended to have higher runoff than treatments under millet, but this was not consistent as zero tillage without mulch, and tillage to 10 cm either with mulch or with \{FYM\} mulch, also had relatively high runoff. Rice straw mulch significantly reduced runoff by comparison with \{FYM\} and no mulch. Soil was lost mainly as suspended load, indicating that raindrop detachment was the main erosion process. Effects of perennial species were variable and probably reflected the degree of surface protection provided in this establishment phase. Tillage significantly increased suspended load concentration in the first major runoff event but not in an event later in the season. Rice straw mulch significantly reduced bed load concentration in the first event and reduced suspended load in the later event. The ability of straw mulch to reduce runoff volume and sediment concentration suggests mulch-based systems may be able to contribute to sustainability of farming systems in the semi-arid tropics. The lack of beneficial effects from tillage suggests a limited role for tillage-based systems. Results from subsequent years are needed to form definite conclusions and to show effects of slower biologically-induced changes in the soil. "

Farmers reported that trypanosomosis was the most important cattle disease and estimated that 25% of their herd fall sick each year and 18% of the sick animals die. Nearly all sick animals (90%) were treated with trypanocides and most treatments were administered by untrained farmers. Giving drugs was the strategy most used as primary means of protection (50% of farmers) followed by avoiding high risk areas (32% of farmers) and keeping trypanotolerant cattle (7% of farmers). Few farmers knew about communal tsetse control methods and those who did, rarely practiced them. Farmer diagnosis of trypanosomosis in cattle presented at clinics (n = 113) was in most cases (84%) supported by laboratory tests. However, the signs that most farmers considered indicative of trypanosomosis (staring coat and emaciation) were poor predictors of trypanosomosis. We tested farmer knowledge of injection sites and trypanocide dilutions (n = 423 cattle), and while few (15%) farmers gave under-dosages or over-dosage (2% of farmers), injection techniques were poor with injection-related side effects in 24% of cattle treated by farmers. Despite this, therapeutic outcomes were both objectively (clinical parameters) and subjectively (carer assessment) satisfactory in 89% of cattle treated by farmers. This study found that farmers play a major role in successfully managing trypanosomosis and recommends the recognition and support for community based treatment. "

At least three major debris avalanche deposits have been reconstructed and dated. The oldest deposits indicate an edifice collapse around 4.9 Ma (40Ar/39Ar), followed by a larger event around 4.1 Ma (40Ar/39Ar). The last and best preserved debris avalanche deposit, with still some morphological expression covering the whole 1214 km2 \{SE\} sector, occurred around 2.83 Ma (40Ar/39Ar). This very large debris avalanche event must have truncated the whole top of Mt. Kenya. Of the original typical hummocky relief, only local topographical depressions are still best visible and preserved. Using known geometric empirical parameters of the 3 preserved debris-avalanche deposits, the height of the sector collapse is estimated to be in the range of 5100–6500 m above the current height of 1000 m a.s.l. near the end lobe of the \{VDA\} deposits. This demonstrates that Mt. Kenya attained impressive altitudes during its main activity in the Pliocene, being one of the highest mountains in that time and was most probably covered by an ice cap. Correcting for the known net eastward tilting post eruptive uplift of approximately 500 m of the Mt. Kenya summit, our reconstruction indicates that an at least 5.6 to 7 km a.s.l. high active Mt. Kenya existed in the Pliocene landscape between 5.1 and 2.8 Ma. This volcano must have significantly contributed to regional environmental change, by catching rain on its eastern slopes and projecting a rain shadow towards the Kenya Rift valley in the west. The last major edifice collapse event around 2.8 Ma coincides with a major change in regional vegetation. This suggests that the truncating of Mt. Kenya may have caused significant changes in the local climate surrounding Mt. Kenya with possible implications for environmental change in the central Kenya Rift valley, the cradle of hominin evolution. "

In this review, we describe how root systems can improve the productivity of chickpea under the terminal drought that occurs in a receding stored soil water conditions in central and south India and propose possible breeding and screening methods. In chickpea, total root biomass in early growth stages has been shown to significantly contribute to seed yield under terminal drought in central and south India. Maximising acquisition of water stored in 15–30 cm soil layer by roots had greater implications as the timing of absorption, available soil water and root size matches well for the complete use of water from this zone. However, deeper root systems and a greater exploitation of subsoil water offers potential for further productivity improvements under terminal drought. As proof of this concept, contrasting chickpea accessions for important root traits, such as root biomass and rooting depth, have been screened in a chickpea germplasm collection which comprises rich diversity for root traits. Through analysing mapping populations derived from crosses between these accessions, a ‘QTL hotspot’ that explained a large part of the phenotypic variation for the major drought tolerance traits including root traits was identified and introgressed into a leading Indian chickpea cultivar. Yield advantages of the introgression lines were demonstrated in multi-location evaluations under terminal drought. As an alternative screening method, that would indirectly asses the root system strength, to identify further promising chickpea genotypes with multiple drought tolerance traits, the leaf canopy temperature and carbon isotope discrimination measurements can be proposed.

Our method is based on household survey data collected from 500 farmers in Anantapur and Kurnool Districts, in Andhra Pradesh State of India, in 2013. We carried out principal component analysis (PCA) with subsequent hierarchical clustering methods to build farm typologies. To evaluate sustainability across these farm typologies, we adopted a framework consisting of economic, social and environmental sustainability pillars and associated indicators. We normalized values of target indicators and employed normative approach to assign different weights to these indicators. Composite sustainability indices (CSI) were then estimated by means of weighted sum of indicators, aggregated and integrated into farm typologies. The results suggested that there were five distinct farm typologies representing farming systems in the study area. The majority of farms (&gt;70%) in the study area are small and extensive (typology 1); marginal and off farm based (typology 2). About 20% of the farms are irrigation based and intensive (typology 3); small and medium and off farm based (typology 4) and irrigation based semi-intensive (typology 5). There was apparent variability among farm typologies in terms of farm structure and functions and composite sustainability indices. Farm typologies 3 and 5 showed significantly higher performances for the social and economic indices, while typologies 2 and 4 had relatively stronger values for environment. These discrepancies support the relevance of integrated farm typology- and \{CSI\} approaches in assessing system sustainability and targeting technologies. Universally, for all farm typologies, composite sustainability indices for economic pillar was significantly lower than the social and environment pillars. More than 90% of farmers were in economically less-sustainable class. The correlations between sustainability indices for economic and environment were typology specific. It was strong and positive when aggregated for the whole study systems [all samples (r = 0.183; P &lt; 0.001)] and for agriculture dependent farm typologies (e.g. typologies 1 and 3). This suggests the need to elevate farms economic performance and capacitate them to invest in the environment. These results provide information for policy makers to plan farm typology–context technological interventions and also create baseline information to evaluate sustainability performance in terms of progress made over time.

Here we report the cloning and characterization of a PgDHN gene from the \{C4\} plant Pennisetum glaucum.

abstract = "Abstract Genetic variation among 45 genotypes of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) representing seven subpopulations was assessed using three single primer amplification reaction (SPAR) methods viz., inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR), random amplified polymorphic \{DNA\} (RAPD) and directed amplification of minisatellite-region \{DNA\} (DAMD). Totally 15 ISSR, 8 \{RAPD\} and 7 \{DAMD\} primers generated 263 amplification products, accounting for 84.6% polymorphism across all the genotypes. The Mantel's test of correlation revealed the best correlation between \{ISSR\} and cumulative data with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.84. Assessment of population diversity indicated that the maximum intra population genetic diversity was recorded among high FeZn lines (HFL) having maximum values of Nei's genetic diversity (h) (0.244), Shannon information index (I) (0.368) and the percentage of polymorphic loci (Pp) (72.65%) while the corresponding lowest values of 0.074, 0.109 and 17.95% respectively were observed among the members of \{MDT\} subpopulation. The mean coefficient of gene differentiation (GST) and the gene flow (Nm) between populations were observed to be 0.396 and 0.7680 respectively. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) suggested that maximum genetic variation exists within populations (95%) than among populations (5%). Thus the information obtained from this study could be utilized in sorghum breeding programmes for the development of varieties with improved nutrition and agronomic values in future. "

In many regions, however, daily weather data of sufficient quality and duration are not available. To overcome this limitation, we evaluated a new method to create long-term weather series based on a few years of observed daily temperature data (hereafter called propagated data). The propagated data are comprised of uncorrected gridded solar radiation from the Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource dataset from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA–POWER), rainfall from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) dataset, and location-specific calibration of NASA–POWER Tmax and Tmin using a limited amount of observed daily temperature data. The distributions of simulated yields of maize, rice, or wheat with propagated data were compared with simulated yields using observed weather data at 18 sites in North and South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Other sources of weather data typically used in crop modeling for locations without long-term observed weather data were also included in the comparison: (i) uncorrected NASA–POWER weather data and (ii) generated weather data using the MarkSim weather generator. Results indicated good agreement between yields simulated with propagated weather data and yields simulated using observed weather data. For example, the distribution of simulated yields using propagated data was within 10% of the simulated yields using observed data at 78% of locations and degree of yield stability (quantified by coefficient of variation) was very similar at 89% of locations. In contrast, simulated yields based entirely on uncorrected NASA–POWER data or generated weather data using MarkSim were within 10% of yields simulated using observed data in only 44 and 33% of cases, respectively, and the bias was not consistent across locations and crops. We conclude that, for most locations, 3 years of observed daily Tmax and Tmin data would allow creation of a robust weather data set for simulation of long-term mean yield and yield stability of major cereal crops.

For semi-arid regions in particular, inadequate and highly variable rainfall and short growing periods limit yield potential and create a risky primary production environment. However, short-season crop varieties offer a promising option for farming with increased uncertainties. Against this background, the aim of this work was to collect field trial data for multiple seasons in Eastern Kenya to better calibrate the existing \{APSIM\} (Agricultural Production System sIMulator) legume models for short-season varieties of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)., cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) and lablab (Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet) and to evaluate the performance of the adapted models in terms of biomass production and yield. Finally with the use of a simulation study, the impact of management options (e.g. sowing time, planting density) and future climate predictions on the overall production potential of the different short-season grain legumes was explored. Results indicate that decisions on optimal sowing times will become more important with shortened growing periods to take full advantage of in-season rainfall. Short-season cultivars of beans were advantageous in extreme short growing periods with external droughts due to their very short maturity time. Lablab seemed to cope best with high in season rainfall variability producing stable yields across a range of rainfall scenarios independent of future climate predictions. Cowpea instead was out yielding beans and lablab in wet years and had a very high biomass production. Consequently, using the full diversity of available short-season legumes can function as an essential part of a sustainable risk management strategy to design more resilient farming systems and increase food security in semi-arid Eastern Kenya. Finally, if well calibrated and tested, simulations models have proved to be an excellent tool for ex-ante assessment of agricultural management interventions in the view of future climate change. "

Smallholder farms exhibit diverse resource endowments and little is known on how they benefit from and cope with changes in this institutional support. In this paper we explore farm trajectories during two decades (1994 to 2010) and their link with farm resource endowment and government support. We distinguished a favourable period for cotton production and an unfavourable period during which institutional support collapsed. A panel survey that monitored 30 farms in the Koutiala district in southern Mali over this period was analysed. Based on indicators of resource endowment and using Ascending Hierarchical Classification (AHC), farms were grouped into four types: High Resource Endowed farms with Large Herds (HRE-LH), High Resource Endowed (HRE) farms, Medium Resource Endowed (MRE) farms and Low Resource Endowed (LRE) farms. Average yield, labour productivity and food self-sufficiency status of each type were calculated. Farms remaining in the same type were classified as ‘hanging in’, while farms moving to a type of higher yields, labour productivity and food self-sufficiency status were classified as ‘stepping up’, and farms following the opposite trajectory of deteriorating farming conditions were classified as ‘falling down’. The \{LRE\} farms differed from all other farm types due to lower yields, while both \{LRE\} and \{HRE\} farms differed from the \{MRE\} and HRE-LH farm types due to a combination of less labour productivity and less food self-sufficiency. During those two decades, 17% of the farms ‘stepped up’, while 70% of the farms remained ‘hanging in’, and only 13% of the farms ‘fell down’. We found no obvious negative impact of the collapse of government support on farm trajectories. For MRE, \{HRE\} and HRE-LH farms, average N and P use intensity increased from 1994 to 2004 and then decreased during the following cotton crisis. On the other hand, organic fertilizer use intensity increased continuously over the entire monitoring period for HRE-LH and \{MRE\} farms. Crop yields did not change significantly over time for any farm type and labour productivity decreased. We discuss how technical options specific for different farm types (increase in farm equipment, sale of cereals, incorporation of legumes and intensification of milk production) and broader institutional change (improvement in finance system and infrastructure, tariffs) can enhance ‘step up’ trajectories for farming households and avoid stagnation (‘hanging in’) of the whole agricultural sector.

Salinity is one of the most important abiotic factors, besides drought, extreme temperatures, light and metal stress. The enhanced burden of secondary salinization induced through anthropogenic activities increases pressure on glycophytic crop plants. The recent isolation and characterization of salt tolerance genes encoding signaling components from halophytes, which naturally grow in high salinity, has provided tools for the development of transgenic crop plants with improved salt tolerance and economically beneficial traits. In addition understanding of the differences between glycophytes and halophytes with respect to levels of salinity tolerance is also one of the prerequisite to achieve this goal. Based on the recent developments in mechanisms of salt tolerance in halophytes, we will explore the potential of introducing salt tolerance by choosing the available genes from both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous halophytes, including the salt overly sensitive system (SOS)-related cation/proton antiporters of plasma (NHX/SOS1) and vacuolar membranes (NHX), energy-related pumps, such as plasma membrane and vacuolar H+ adenosine triphosphatase (PM &amp; V-H+ATPase), vacuolar H+ pyrophosphatases (V-H+PPase) and potassium transporter genes. Various halophyte genes responsible for other processes, such as crosstalk signaling, osmotic solutes production and reactive oxygen species (ROS) suppression, which also enhance salt tolerance will be described. In addition, the transgenic overexpression of halophytic genes in crops (rice, peanut, finger millet, soybean, tomato, alfalfa, jatropha, etc.) will be discussed as a successful mechanism for the induction of salt tolerance. Moreover, the advances in genetic engineering technology for the production of genetically modified crops to achieve the improved salinity tolerance under field conditions will also be discussed. "

A trait-based selection had been considered more beneficial in drought tolerance breeding to overcome the environmental influence on drought yields. Large number of traits had been suggested in literature, with less indication on their importance and priority, for use in such breeding programs resulting in poor utilization of critical traits in drought tolerance breeding. To identify the most critical traits that contribute to grain yield under drought, 12 chickpea genotypes, with well-defined drought response, were field evaluated by sampling at regular intervals during the cropping period. Large range of variation was observed for shoot biomass productivity, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area index (LAI) at different days after sowings (DAS), canopy temperature depression (CTD) at mid-reproductive stages, growth duration and both morphological and analytical yield components. Grain yield under drought was closely associated with the rate of partitioning (p), crop growth rate (C), CTD, phenology, \{LAI\} at mid-pod fill stage, pod number m−2 at maturity, shoot biomass at reproductive growth stages and \{SLA\} at physiological maturity. The shoot trait(s) were prioritized based on their significance and contribution to drought tolerance. The trait(s) that conferred tolerance varied across genotypes. The order of traits/plant functions identified as important and critical for the drought tolerance were p, C, CTD, growth duration and other related traits. Relatively less important traits were LAI, \{SLA\} at the mid reproductive stage and pod number per unit area at maturity. The traits Dr, seeds pod−1 and 100-seed weight were found to be least important. Breeding for the best combination of p and C with the right phenology was proposed to be the best selection strategy to enhance terminal drought tolerance in chickpea. "

However, insufficient knowledge on the performance of various options in the context of smallholder farm systems impedes local adaptation and adoption. Therefore, together with farmers in southern Mali we tested a range of options for sustainable intensification including intensification of cereal (maize and sorghum) and legume (groundnut, soyabean and cowpea) sole crops and cereal-legume intercropping during three years on on-farm trials. There was huge variability among fields in crop yields of unamended control plots: maize yielded from 0.20 to 5.24 t ha−1, sorghum from 0 to 3.53 t ha−1, groundnut from 0.10 to 1.16 t ha−1, soyabean from 0 to 2.48 t ha−1 and cowpea from 0 to 1.02 t ha−1. This variability was partly explained by (i) soil type and water holding capacity, (ii) previous crop, its management and the nutrient carry-over and (iii) inter-annual weather variability. Farmers recognized three soil types: gravelly soils, sandy soils and black soils. Yields were very poor on gravelly soils and two to three times greater (depending on the crop) on black soils. Yields were also poor at the end of the typical crop rotation, i.e., after sorghum and millet, and 1.3–1.7 times greater (depending on the crop) after the fertilized crops maize and cotton. We diagnosed a number of cases of technology failure where no improvement in yield was observed with hybrid varieties of maize and sorghum and rhizobial inoculation of soyabean. Regardless of soil type and previous crop, mineral fertilizer improved yields by 34–126% depending on the crop. Targeting options to a given soil type and/or place in the rotation enhanced their agronomic performance: (i) the biomass production of the cowpea fodder variety was doubled on black soils compared with gravelly soils, (ii) the additive maize/cowpea intercropping option after cotton or maize resulted in an average overall \{LER\} of 1.47, no maize grain penalty, and 1.38 t ha−1 more cowpea fodder production compared with sole maize. Soil type and position in the rotation, two indicators easy to assess by farmers and extension workers, allowed the identification of specific niches for enhanced agronomic performance of legume sole cropping and/or intercropping.

Sorghum panicles were collected from January to September 2011 in farmers' granaries in the Northern-Sudanian ecological zone of Burkina Faso to determine the diversity of insect pests and their importance in post-harvest losses. A total of 14 species of insect pests were recorded, including twelve coleopteran and two lepidopteran species. Species diversity peaked between May and September. The highest insect diversity was recorded in sorghum stored in straw granaries and on red coloured grains when compared with that of sorghum stored in mud granaries and on white coloured grains. Rhyzopertha dominica (Fabricius) appears to be the primary insect pest followed by secondary pests including Oryzaephilus mercator (Fauvel), Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens) and Sitophilus zeamais (Motschulsky).

Based on regression coefficient and deadheart incidence, the genotypes \{IS\} 2312, \{ICSB\} 425, \{RSV\} 1090 and \{ICSB\} 428 were stable in expression of resistance to shoot fly across seasons and locations. The genotypes \{CSV\} 22 and \{RSV\} 1093 exhibited high grain yield potential and resistance to shoot fly damage, while Phule Yashoda, \{IS\} 2312, \{RSV\} 1235, and \{ICSV\} 574 were moderately resistant to shoot fly damage, but had high grain yield potential. These genotypes can be used in sorghum improvement for developing cultivars with shoot fly resistance, high grain yield and adaptation to postrainy season. "

The transgenics were selfed for three generations and \{T4\} plants were examined for 100 mM NaCl stress tolerance in pot conditions. The effect of salt stress on chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, internal carbon dioxide concentration, transpiration rates, intrinsic transpiration and water use efficiencies, proline content, \{MDA\} levels, and antioxidant enzyme activities were evaluated in 40-day-old transgenic lines and the results were compared with untransformed control plants. The results show that chlorophyll content declines by 65% in untransformed controls compared to 30–38% loss (significant at P &lt; 0.05) in transgenics but not carotenoid levels. Photosynthetic rate (PSII activity) was reduced in untransformed controls almost completely, while it declined by 62–88% in different transgenic lines. Salinity induced ca 100% stomatal closure in untransformed plants, while stomatal conductance was decreased only by 64–81% in transgenics after 4 days. The intercellular \{CO2\} decreased by ca 30% in individual transgenic lines. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content was lower in transgenics compared to untransformed controls. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD; \{EC\} 1.15.1.1), catalase (CAT; \{EC\} 1.11.1.6) and glutathione reductase (GR; EC1.8.1.7) were quantified in leaves exposed to 100 mM NaCl stress and found higher in transgenics. The results suggest that transgenic lines were able to cope better with salt stress than untransformed controls by protecting photosynthetic and antioxidant enzyme activities. "

We investigated the effects of Capsicum annuum proteinase inhibitors (CanPIs) on C. partellus larvae by in-vitro and in-vivo experiments. Methods Recombinant CanPI-7 (with four-Inhibitory Repeat Domains, IRDs), −22 (two-IRDs) and insect proteinase activities were estimated by proteinase assays, dot blot assays, in gel activity assays. Feeding bioassays of lab reared C. partellus with CanPI-7 and −22 were performed. C. partellus proteinase gene expression was done by RT-PCR. In-silico structure prediction of proteinases and CanPI \{IRDs\} was carried out, their validation and molecular docking was done for estimating the interaction strength. Results Larval proteinases of C. partellus showed higher activity at alkaline pH and expressed few proteinase isoforms. Both CanPIs showed strong inhibition of C. partellus larval proteinases. Feeding bioassays of C. partellus with CanPIs revealed a dose dependent retardation of larval growth, reduction of pupal mass and fecundity, while larval and pupal periods increased significantly. Ingestion of CanPIs resulted in differential up-regulation of C. partellus proteinase isoforms, which were sensitive to CanPI-7 but were insensitive to CanPI-22. In-silico interaction studies indicated the strong interaction of IRD-9 (of CanPI-22) with Chilo proteinases tested. Conclusions Of the two \{PIs\} tested, CanPI-7 prevents induction of inhibitor insensitive proteinases in C. partellus so it can be explored for developing C. partellus tolerance in sorghum. General Significance Ingestion of CanPIs, effectively retards C. partellus growth; while differentially regulating the proteinases. "

Study focus India, world’s largest groundwater user (250 billion m3 yr−1) has been reported to experience declining groundwater levels. However, the statistical significance of the decline has not been analyzed to separate human effects from natural variability. Trends in groundwater levels in three administrative districts of south India were analyzed and explained through changes in irrigation, rainfall, and agricultural power subsidy. New hydrological insights for the region Contrary to common perception of widespread groundwater declines only 22–36% of the wells showed statistically significant declines. The use of well depth during dry well periods may slightly underestimate the number of declining wells (by 1%) and rate of decline. Increase in groundwater irrigated area combined with rainfall and power subsidy policy, were the main causative factors for the decline. Groundwater decline after implementation of free-electricity policy in 2004 confirmed the nexus between power subsidy and groundwater. These declines are likely to worsen due to future well drillings. Trends in other regions with similar hydro-geologic conditions need to be analyzed to verify groundwater declines and its linkages with power subsidy. Once established, reforms in power subsidy and well permit policy along with conversion to efficient micro–irrigation may be needed to maintain or enhance groundwater availability in the crystalline aquifer region of India (240 million ha).

Little information exists on soil and water management technologies requirements for male and female farmers in different agro-ecological regions. The objective of current study was to investigate farmers’ sources of information and perceptions on soil and water management technologies. Four sites selected from different agro-ecological regions (AERs), sub-humid (Mazowe/Goromonzi, and Kadoma) and semi-arid (Matobo and Chiredzi). Data on sources of information on soil and water management, types of technologies preferred by farmers and constraints to adoption of technologies were collected through household interviews and focus group discussions. Results showed that government extension agents, farmer-to farmer extension and non-governmental organizations were the main sources of information on soil and water management technologies at all the sites. \{NGOs\} mainly provide information on reduced tillage methods. Main technologies were mulching (61%), reduced tillage methods (53%), and contour ridges (33%) in Mazowe/Goromonzi district, reduced tillage method (83) and mulching (64%) in Kadoma, and reduced tillage methods (54%) and contour ridges (47%) in Matobo. More farmers used soil and water management technologies at the sub-humid sites than at the semi-arid sites. Soil and water conservation technologies used were similar between male-headed (MHH) and female-headed households (FHH). Soil and water conservation technologies used by farmers matched their preferences in two of the four study sites. The findings are important for targeting soil and water management practices in the various agro-ecological zones. "

The regulation of aflatoxin biosynthesis in various Aspergillus spp. has been extensively studied, and has been shown to be related to oxidative stress responses. Given that environmental stresses such as drought and heat stress result in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within host plant tissues, host-derived \{ROS\} may play an important role in cross-kingdom communication between host plants and A. flavus. Recent technological advances in plant breeding have provided the tools necessary to study and apply knowledge derived from metabolomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic studies in the context of productive breeding populations. Here, we review the current understanding of the potential roles of environmental stress, ROS, and aflatoxin in the interaction between A. flavus and its host plants, and the current status in molecular breeding and marker discovery for resistance to A. flavus colonization and aflatoxin contamination in maize and peanut. We will also propose future directions and a working model for continuing research efforts linking environmental stress tolerance and aflatoxin contamination resistance in maize and peanut. "

The physically-based shallow landslide model LAPSUS-LS is tested for its performance in simulating shallow landslide locations induced by a high intensity rain event in a small-scale landscape. Furthermore, the effect of high resolution digital elevation models on the performance was tested. The performance of the model was optimised by calibrating different parameter values. A satisfactory result was achieved with a high resolution (1 m) DEM. Landslides, however, were generally predicted lower on the slope than mapped erosion scars. This discrepancy could be due to i) inaccuracies in the \{DEM\} or in other model input data such as soil strength properties; ii) relevant processes for this environmental context that are not included in the model; or iii) the limited validity of the infinite length assumption in the infinite slope stability model embedded in the LAPSUS-LS. The trade-off between a correct prediction of landslides versus stable cells becomes increasingly worse with coarser resolutions; and model performance decreases mainly due to altering slope characteristics. The optimal parameter combinations differ per resolution. In this environmental context the 1 m resolution topography resembles actual topography most closely and landslide locations are better distinguished from stable areas than for coarser resolutions. More gain in model performance could be achieved by adding landslide process complexities and parameter heterogeneity of the catchment. "

During the twentieth century, two types of actors cleared that forest: native Amazonians and outside encroachers. Of the two actors, we know more about what drives outside encroachers to clear forest than about what drives native Amazonians to clear forest. The past research focus has served well because during the twentieth century outside encroachers cleared most of the Amazonian forest. But the past research focus needs to be expanded because native Amazonians are claiming de jure stewardship of the forests they inhabit, and with tighter jurisdiction over those forests will likely come changes in the amount of forest native Amazonians clear. Prior research in rural areas of low-income nations suggests that household income affects household forest clearance. To estimate the effects of household real income on the total forest area (old-growth + fallow) cleared by households we use a panel composed of five annual household surveys (2002–2006, inclusive) from 324 households of a native Amazonian society in Bolivia (Tsimane'). We control for household and village fixed effects and use an instrumental variable for household income. We find positive and significant household real income elasticities of forest clearance of 0.35 and 0.47 and an increase in forest clearance of 5.3%/year. The main finding stood up well to sensitivity analysis. These estimates suggest that in the near future, the forest in the Tsimane' territory will likely face increasing pressure from the Tsimane' themselves, not just from outside encroachers. "

At 45° incidence angle, the strong seasonality of σo time series can be directly linked to the successive wet and dry seasons. Moreover, the annual σo dynamic range was found to be strongly correlated to total rainfall. The interpretation of the σo temporal plots is carried out by combining a backscattering model to a grassland growth model. Results highlight the decreasing contribution of the herbaceous component with latitude. However, its contribution is far from negligible and can reach 60% in the Soudano-Sahelian subzone at peak herbaceous mass. Additionally, the tree layer has a negligible effect on the radar signal at the scale of a resolution cell. Finally, a simple parametric backscattering model is calibrated and used in an inversion process. The resolution of the inverse problem is based on a ‘brute-force’ method that consists of exploring all the combinations of parameters of interest. Despite a poor estimation of the temporal variation of the herbaceous mass Bt, the retrieved maximum mass compares well with ground estimates. "

abstract = "The West African Sahel rainfall regime is known for its spatio-temporal variability at different scales which has a strong impact on vegetation development. This study presents results of the combined use of a simple water balance model, a radiative transfer model and \{ERS\} scatterometer data to produce map of vegetation biomass and thus vegetation cover at a spatial resolution of 25 km. The backscattering coefficient measured by spaceborne wind scatterometers over Sahel shows a marked seasonality linked to the drastic changes of both soil and vegetation dielectric properties associated to the alternating dry and wet seasons. For lack of a direct observation, \{METEOSAT\} rainfall estimates are used to calculate temporal series of soil moisture with the help of a water balance model. This a priori information is used as input of the radiative transfer model that simulates the interaction between the radar wave and the surface components (soil and vegetation). Then, an inversion algorithm is applied to retrieve vegetation aerial mass from the \{ERS\} scatterometer data. Because of the nonlinear feature of the inverse problem to be solved, the inversion is performed using a global stochastic nonlinear inversion method. A good agreement is obtained between the inverse solutions and independent field measurements with mean and standard deviation of −54 and 130 kg of dry matter by hectare (kg DM/ha), respectively. The algorithm is then applied to a 350,000 km2 area including the Malian Gourma and Seno region and a Sahelian part of Burkina Faso during two contrasted seasons (1999 and 2000). At the considered resolution, the obtained herbaceous mass maps show a global qualitative consistency (r2=0.71) with \{NDVI\} images acquired by the \{VEGETATION\} instrument. "

In greenhouse studies, four log concentrations of Integral (from 2.2×106 to 2.2×109 cfu/mL) were used as seed treatment (ST). After 25 d, seedlings were dipped (SD) into Integral prior to transplanting. At 30 d after transplanting (DAT), leaf sheaths were inoculated with immature sclerotia of the pathogen.

Even the reputedly tolerant cultivar \{JG11\} was sensitive to salinity. Plants exposed to 60 mM NaCl since seedlings, died by 52 d without producing any pods; at 40 mM NaCl plants died by 75 d with few pods formed; and at 20 mM NaCl plants had 78–82% dry mass of controls, with slightly higher flower numbers but 33% less pods. Shoot Cl exceeded shoot Na by 2–5 times in both the vegetative and reproductive phase, and these ions also entered the flowers. Conversion of flowers into pods was sensitive to NaCl. Pollen from salinized plants was viable, but addition of 40 mM NaCl to an in vitro medium severely reduced pollen germination and tube growth. Plants recovered when NaCl was removed at flower bud initiation, adding new vegetative growth and forming flowers, pods and seeds. Our results demonstrate that chickpea is sensitive to salinity at both the vegetative and reproductive phase, with pod formation being particularly sensitive.

Plant breeding has been highly successful in dealing with many pest problems in Africa, especially diseases, but is limited to the genes available within the crop genome. Years of breeding and studying cultural practices have not always been successful in alleviating many problems that biotechnology may be able to solve. We pinpoint the major intractable regional problems as: (1) weeds: parasitic weeds (Striga and Orobanche spp.) throughout Africa; grass weeds of wheat (Bromus and Lolium) intractable to herbicides in North Africa; (2) insect and diseases: stem borers and post-harvest grain weevils in sub-Saharan Africa; Bemesia tabaci (white fly) as the vector of the tomato leaf curl virus complex on vegetable crops in North Africa; and (3) the mycotoxins: fumonisins and aflatoxins in stored grains. Abiotic stresses may exacerbate many of these problems, and biotechnological alleviations of abiotic stress could partially allay some predicaments. Some of these constraints are already under study using biotechnological procedures, but others may require longer-term research and development to alleviate the problems. Despite the huge impacts of post-harvest weevils and of mycotoxins in grains, these issues had not been given high priority in national biotechnological programs, possibly due to a lack of knowledge of their immensity. The need for public sector involvement is accentuated for cases where immediate profits are not perceived (e.g. lowering mycotoxin levels in farmer utilized grain, which does not increase yield) but where the public weal will gain, and will be invaluable, especially where the private sector supplies genes already isolated.

To this end, 799 markers were screened across 16 farmer preferred and other cultivated African groundnut varieties that are routinely used in groundnut improvement, some with known resistance traits. Results The \{SSR\} markers amplified 817 loci and were graded on a scale of 1 to 4 according to successful amplification and ease of scoring of amplified alleles. Of these, 376 markers exhibited Polymorphic Information Content (PIC) values ranging from 0.06 to 0.86, with 1476 alleles detected at an average of 3.7 alleles per locus. The remaining 423 markers were either monomorphic or did not work well. The best performing polymorphic markers were subsequently used to construct a dissimilarity matrix that indicated the relatedness of the varieties in order to aid selection of appropriately diverse parents for groundnut improvement. The closest related varieties were \{MGV5\} and ICGV-SM 90704 and most distant were Chalimbana and 47–10. The mean dissimilarity value was 0.51, ranging from 0.34 to 0.66. Discussion Of the 376 informative markers identified in this study, 139 (37%) have previously been mapped to the Arachis genome and can now be employed in Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping and the additional 237 markers identified can be used to improve the efficiency of introgression of resistance to multiple important biotic constraints into farmer-preferred varieties of Sub-Saharan Africa.

One hundred and fifty-five accessions together with five controls (four common and one location-specific control) were evaluated for 21 descriptors at five agro-ecologically diverse locations in India during the 2008 rainy season. The experiment was conducted in an alpha design with three replications at Patancheru, and in an augmented design with one of the five controls repeated after every nine-test entries at other locations. A number of diverse germplasm accessions with agronomically (earliness and high grain yield) and nutritionally (high seed protein, calcium, iron and zinc) superior traits were identified for use in foxtail millet breeding. The hierarchical cluster analysis of data using phenotypic distances resulted in 25 clusters, from each cluster, ∼10% or a minimum of one accession was selected to form a mini core, which comprised of 35 accessions. The comparison of mean, variance, frequency distribution, diversity (H’) and phenotypic correlations revealed that the mini core indeed captured adequate variability from the core collection. This mini core collection is an ideal pool of diverse germplasm for studying population structure and diversity, and identifying new sources of variation for use in breeding and genomics studies in foxtail millet.

The use of mineral N fertilizer was found to be profitable with economically optimal rates of 40 and 80 kg N ha−1 for more intensively managed homestead fields and less intensively managed bush fields respectively. Agronomic N use efficiency varied from 21 to 37 kg grain kg−1 N for the homestead fields and from 15 to 49 kg grain kg−1 N in the bush fields. Simulated grain yield for homestead fields at 40 kg N ha−1 application was equal to yield for bush fields at 80 kg N ha−1. Water use efficiency generally increased with increased mineral N rate and was greater for the homestead fields compared with the bush fields. Grain yield per unit of cumulative evapo-transpiration (simulated) was consistently higher compared with yield per unit of cumulative precipitation for the season, probably because of runoff and deep percolation. In the simulation experiment, grain yield variability was less with mineral N application and under higher soil fertility (organic matter) condition. Application of mineral N reduced variability in yield from a \{CV\} of 37 to 11% in the bush farm and from 17 to 7% in the homestead fields. The use of mineral fertilizer and encouraging practices that retain organic matter to the soil provide a more sustainable system for ensuring crop production and hence food security. "

Two-hundred full-sib families (FS) representing the \{C5\} selection cycle were evaluated together with the genepool parental landraces, experimental varieties derived from previous cycles and local checks in Striga-infested fields at Sadoré (Niger) and Cinzana (Mali). Substantial and mostly significant selection progress could be documented. The accumulated percentage gain from selection amounted to 51%/1% lower Striga infestation (measured by area under Striga number progress curve, ASNPC), 46%/62% lower downy mildew incidence, and 49%/31% higher panicle yield of the C5-FS compared to the mean of the genepool parents at Sadoré/Cinzana, respectively. Experimental varieties selected from previous cycles also revealed lower \{ASNPC\} and mostly higher yield compared to genepool parents at their selection sites. Significant genetic variation among the C5-FS and operative heritabilities of 76% (Cinzana), 84% (Sadoré) and 34% (combined across locations) for \{ASNPC\} will enable continued selection gain for Striga resistance. High genotype × environment interaction variances for all target traits suggest that different experimental varieties need to be extracted from the genepool for different sites. The genepool-derived varieties will be further validated on-farm and are expected to contribute to integrated Striga control in pearl millet in West Africa. "

The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term (up to nine years) impacts of nutrient management strategies and their local feasibility on crop productivity, soil fertility status and rainfall infiltration on two contrasting soil types and different prior management regimes in Murehwa, Zimbabwe. The nutrient management strategies employed in the study were: a control with no fertiliser, amendments of 100 kg N ha−1, 100 kg N + lime, three rates of manure application (5, 15 and 25 t ha−1) in combination with 100 kg N ha−1, and three rates of P fertiliser (10, 30 and 50 kg P ha−1) in combination with 100 kg N, 20 kg Ca, 5 kg Zn and 10 kg Mn ha−1. Maize grain yields in sandy soils did not respond to the sole application of 100 kg N ha−1; manure application had immediate and incremental benefits on crop yields on the sandy soils. A combination of 25 t ha−1 manure and 100 kg N gave the largest treatment yield of 9.3 t ha−1 on the homefield clay soils, 6.1 t ha−1 in the clay outfield, 7.6 t ha−1 in the homefield and 3.4 t ha−1 in the eighth season. Yields of the largest manure application on the sandy outfields were comparable to yields with 100 kg N in combination with 30 kg P, 20 kg Ca, 5 kg Zn and 10 kg Mn ha−1 in the homefields suggesting the need to target nutrients differently to different fields. Manure application improved rainfall infiltration in the clay soils from 21 to 31 mm h−1 but on the sandy soils the manure effect on infiltration was not significant. Despite the large manure applications, crop productivity and \{SOC\} build-up in the outfield sandy soils was small highlighting the difficulty to recover the fertility of degraded soils. The major cause of poor crop productivity on the degraded sandy soils despite the large additions of manure could not be ascertained. The current practice of allocating manure and fertiliser to fields closest to homesteads exacerbates land degradation in the sandy outfields and increases soil fertility gradients but results in the most harvest for the farm. On clay soils, manure may be targeted to outfields and mineral fertiliser to homefields to increase total crop productivity. Farmers who owned cattle in the study site can achieve high manure application rates on small plots, and manure application can be rotated according to crop sequences. Consistent application of manure in combination with mineral fertilisers can be an effective option to improve crop yield, \{SOC\} and moisture conservation under smallholder farming conditions. Combined manure and mineral fertiliser application can be adapted locally as a feasible entry point for ecological intensification in mixed crop–livestock systems. "

Groundnut (cv. Robut 33-1) was grown during the rainy and post-rainy seasons at these sites under various management practices such as sowing dates and differential irrigation. Using the data sets from several years, the model was calibrated for genetic coefficients of cvs. Robut 33-1 and \{TMV\} 2 determining their phenology and growth, as well as for soil physical parameters influencing the soil water balance. The model was validated for cv. Robut 33-1 against independent data sets obtained from field experiments conducted during the later years. The model predicted the occurrence of flowering and podding within ±5 days of observed values at locations where growth stages were recorded most frequently. Predictions of growth stages beyond podding were less accurate because of difficulties, associated with the indeterminate nature of the crop, to record growth stages after pod growth has started in the soil. Changes in vegetative growth stages, total dry matter accumulation, growth of pods and seeds, and soil moisture were predicted accurately by the model. Predicted pod yields were significantly correlated (r2 = 0.90) with observed yields. These results indicate that under biotic stress-free situations, the model \{PNUTGRO\} can be used to predict groundnut yieldsin different environments as determined by season, sowing date, and moisture regimes.

Plant reproduction suffers under salt stress in chickpea, but it remains unclear which process is most affected and what traits discriminate tolerant from sensitive lines. Three pot experiments were carried out to compare the effects of salt application (17 g NaCl kg−1 Alfisol) at sowing (SS) and at the start of flowering (SF) on growth, canopy transpiration, plant architecture, and flower, pod and seed development (timing, numbers, mass, abortion). Six pairs of tolerant/sensitive lines with similar flowering times within each pair, but different among the pairs, were used. Shoot biomass was similar in tolerant and sensitive lines in the \{SS\} and \{SF\} treatments, whereas the seed yield decreased more under \{SS\} and \{SF\} treatments in the sensitive lines. The flower, pod and seed numbers within all pairs was higher in the tolerant than in the sensitive lines in the non-saline controls, but the differences in numbers of seeds and pods further increased in both the \{SS\} and \{SF\} treatments. By contrast, neither the duration of flowering or podding, nor the percentage of flower or pod abortion, discriminated tolerant from sensitive lines. In non-saline controls the numbers of primary branches was 100% higher across the sensitive lines, whereas the number of tertiary branches was 8-fold higher across tolerant lines. The relative transpiration of the tolerant lines in the salt treatments was above that for the sensitive lines in three pairs of tolerant/sensitive lines, but did not differ within two pairs. Our results demonstrate that constitutive traits, i.e. numbers of flowers and tertiary branches, and adaptive traits, i.e. high number of seeds under salt stress, are both critical aspects of salinity tolerance in chickpea.

A major portion of this reactive-N, applied as fertilizer to crops, leaks into the environment with cascading negative effects on ecosystem functions and contributes to global warming. Natural ecosystems use multiple pathways of the N-cycle to regulate the flow of this element. By contrast, the large amounts of N currently applied in agricultural systems cycle primarily through the nitrification process, a single inefficient route that allows much of the reactive-N to leak into the environment. The fact that present agricultural systems do not channel this reactive-N through alternate pathways is largely due to uncontrolled soil nitrifier activity, creating a rapid nitrifying soil environment. Regulating nitrification is therefore central to any strategy for improving nitrogen-use efficiency. Biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) is an active plant-mediated natural function, where nitrification inhibitors released from plant roots suppress soil-nitrifying activity, thereby forcing N into other pathways. This review illustrates the presence of detection methods for variation in physiological regulation of BNI-function in field crops and pasture grasses and analyzes the potential for its genetic manipulation. We present a conceptual framework utilizing a BNI-platform that integrates diverse crop science disciplines with ecological principles. Sustainable agriculture will require development of production systems that include new crop cultivars capable of controlling nitrification (i.e., high BNI-capacity) and improved agronomic practices to minimize leakage of reactive-N during the N-cycle, a critical requirement for increasing food production while avoiding environmental damage.

Multiple sources of natural recharge include infiltration from ephemeral stream flow in the Todd River; groundwater throughflow between connected alluvial basins; regional groundwater flow from the underlying Tertiary aquifer; and diffuse recharge. In addition treatment, storage and irrigation reuse of Alice Springs’ waste water has resulted in additional recharge of effluent, via infiltration. Water resource management plans for the region include effluent reuse through Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) within one of the connected alluvial basins, with the purpose of managing the excess waste water overflows while also supplementing groundwater resources for irrigation and protecting their quality. Hydrogeochemical tracers, chloride and the stable isotopes of water, were used in a three-member mixing model to define and quantify the major recharge sources. The mixing model was not sensitive enough to quantify minor contributions from effluent in groundwater that were identified only by an evaporated isotopic signature. The contribution of the multiple recharge sources varied spatially with proximity to the recharge source; with Todd River, effluent and Town Basin throughflow contributing to the Inner Farm Basin groundwater. The Outer Farm Basin was largely influenced by the Todd River, the Inner Farm Basin throughflow and the older Tertiary aquifer. While Inner Farm groundwater throughflow contains an effluent component, only Outer Farm Basin groundwater near the interface between the two basins clearly illustrated an effluent signature. Aside from this, effluent recharge was not evident in the Outer Farm Basin, indicating that past unmanaged recharge practices will not mask signs of Managed Aquifer Recharge through the Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) operation. The long-term impact of effluent recharge is a shift from sodium and calcium as co-dominant cations in the groundwater, as evident in the Outer Farm Basin, to dominance by sodium alone, as typical for the Inner Farm Basin.

They are especially important in small-holder crop-livestock production systems in the sub-humid, semi-arid, and arid tropics and subtropics where most of the world’s poorest livestock producers and consumers are found. Taking as examples tropically adapted cereals in the crop improvement mandate of the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), namely pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], this paper explores opportunities for using marker-assisted crop breeding methods to improve the quality and quantity of cereal crop residues for use as ruminant livestock feedstuffs. In the case of pearl millet, \{ICRISAT\} has been heavily involved with several UK-based collaborating research institutes, in development and initial application of the molecular genetic tools for marker-assisted breeding. We have obtained some useful experience in quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and marker-assisted selection (MAS) for stover yield, foliar disease resistance, and in vitro estimates of the nutritive value of various stover fractions for ruminants. In sorghum, \{ICRISAT\} has focused on initiating a large-scale high-throughput marker-assisted backcrossing program for the stay-green component of terminal drought tolerance—a trait that is likely to be associated not only with more stable grain and stover yield, but which is also expected to contribute to maintenance of ruminant nutritional value of stover produced under drought stress conditions. Conventional and marker-assisted breeding for foliar disease resistance is recommended for dual-purpose cereal improvement, or indeed for improvement of the nutritional value of residues for any crop in which these are used as feedstuffs for ruminant livestock. Practical problems faced and proposed ways of dealing with these are discussed. "

There is no substantial host plant resistance to \{BGM\} in current chickpea cultivars, but component studies have developed various agronomic options to manage the disease. These include reduced seed rate, delayed sowing and thinning of plants to ensure an open canopy, and need-based foliar application of fungicide. These components were combined with other agronomic requirements for the target region, such as application of phosphate fertilizer, pest management measures against chickpea pod borer, and fungicidal seed treatment against collar rot. The resultant integrated crop management (ICM) package was compared with normal farmer practice (FP) for chickpea cultivation in farmer-managed, operational scale plots at 100 locations across five districts in western Bangladesh in the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 seasons. Grain yields in \{ICM\} plots were generally 15–50% higher than in \{FP\} in both seasons. Conduct of these on-farm evaluations in two additional districts in 2004–2005 gave similar results. In 2004–2005, 505 farmer-managed demonstrations were conducted in the five original districts, giving a 5–104% yield advantage (district means) of \{ICM\} over FP. In 2005–2006, 642 demonstrations were conducted across the eight districts giving district-wise yield advantages of 27–70%. Effective implementation of \{BGM\} management practices by participating farmers demonstrated that remunerative and reliable chickpea yields could be obtained in this BGM-prone environment. The \{ICM\} strategy evolved has relevance to other chickpea growing regions prone to \{BGM\} in South Asia, Australia and the Americas. Studies are now required on the adoption of components of the \{ICM\} package, and the underlying reasons, to identify any adoption constraints and thus guide further promotion of chickpea cultivation.

Only a very small percentage of genetic variability has been used in crop breeding programs. Traditionally, \{F1\} plants are used to backcross to the adapted lines or populations. An alternative approach is to backcross the \{F2\} individuals selected for agronomic acceptability. Our objective was to determine whether selection before backcross would lead to more progenies with both high yield and acceptable levels of agronomic performance than direct backcross without selection. To test the feasibility of the proposed approach, we conducted parallel experiments in which two exotic sorghum accessions were crossed to two adapted sorghum parents and further backcrossing was conducted with either \{F1\} or selected \{F2\} plants. Fifty random \{S1\} families were evaluated in three test environments. Although selection before backcross resulted in a higher frequency of families with maturity equal to or earlier than those of the adapted parents, no consistent changes in grain yield and plant height were observed between populations with and without selection. Similar results were found with either an inbred or a population as the recurrent parents. Given these findings and the extra generation required, we do not recommend selection before backcross in the process of introgression of exotic germplasm. "

Yet, the effects of fire on soil inhabiting organisms are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to examine the responses of soil macro-invertebrates to early fires in a Sudanian savanna-woodland on a set of experimental plots subject to different fuel load treatments. The abundance of major macro-invertebrate taxa and functional groups, and taxon richness were quantified in soil cores collected from three different soil layers before and immediately after burning. The results indicated that, overall, there was substantial spatial and temporal variation in the composition of macro-invertebrate assemblages. The immediate effects of fire were to reduce total invertebrate numbers and numbers of many invertebrate groups dramatically. This is probably due to the fact that many of the surface-dwelling macrofauna perished as a result of less favorable microclimate due to fire, diminished resources, or migrate to safer environments. Fuel load treatment did not affect the community taxonomic richness or abundance of the soil-dwelling fauna. Furthermore, annual changes in community composition were more pronounced at the burnt site than in the control. This could be related to the inter-annual difference in precipitation pattern recorded during the two-year study period at our site. Since soil macrofauna population declines in fire-disturbed areas, increasing fire prevalence may jeopardize the long-term conservation of fire sensitive macrofauna groups. Special fire management attention is therefore recommended with due consideration to the type of burning and fuel properties to avoid the detrimental effects of intense fire affecting the resilience of savanna soil macrofauna species.

Researchers are now routinely using candidate gene‐based mapping and genome‐wide linkage disequilibrium and association analysis in addition to classical \{QTL\} mapping to identify markers broadly applicable to breeding programs. Marker‐assisted selection (MAS) is practiced for enhancing various host plant resistances, several quality traits, and a number of abiotic stress tolerances in many well‐researched crops. Markers are also increasingly used to transfer yield or quality‐ enhancing \{QTL\} alleles from wild relatives to elite cultivars. Large‐scale MAS‐based breeding programs for crops such as rice, maize, wheat, barley, pearl millet, and common bean have already been initiated worldwide. Advances in “omics” technologies are now assisting researchers to address complex biological issues of significant agricultural importance: modeling genotype‐by‐environment interaction; fine‐mapping, cloning, and pyramiding of QTL; gene expression analysis and gene function elucidation; dissecting the genetic structure of germplasm collections to mine novel alleles and develop genetically structured trait‐based core collections; and understanding the molecular basis of heterosis. The challenge now is to translate and integrate this knowledge into appropriate tools and methodologies for plant breeding programs. The role of computational tools in achieving this is becoming increasingly important.

abstract = "Sodicity‐induced soil degradation is a major environmental constraint with severe negative impacts on agricultural productivity and sustainability in arid and semiarid regions. As an important category of salt‐affected soils, sodic soils are characterized by excess levels of sodium ions (Na+) in the soil solution phase as well as on the cation exchange complex, exhibiting unique structural problems as a result of certain physical processes (slaking, swelling, and dispersion of clay) and specific conditions (surface crusting and hardsetting). Saline‐sodic soils, another category of salt‐affected soils, are generally grouped with sodic soils because of several common properties and management approaches. Sodic and saline‐sodic soils occur within the boundaries of at least 75 countries, and their extent has increased steadily in several major irrigation schemes throughout the world. The use of these soils for crop production is on the increase as they are a valuable resource that cannot be neglected, especially in areas where significant investments have already been made in irrigation infrastructure. It is imperative to find ways to improve sodic and saline‐sodic soils to ensure that they are able to support highly productive land‐use systems to meet the challenges of global food security. Nearly a century‐old record reveals amelioration of sodic soils through the provision of a readily available source of calcium (Ca2+) to replace excess Na+ on the cation exchange complex; the displaced Na+ subject to leaching from the root zone through the application of excess irrigation water in the presence of a drainage system. Many sodic soils do contain inherent or precipitated sources of Ca2+, that is calcite (CaCO3), at varying depths within the soil profile. However, due to its negligible solubility, natural dissolution of calcite does not provide sufficient quantities of Ca2+ to affect soil amelioration with routine management practices. Consequently, amelioration of these soils has been predominantly achieved through the application of chemical amendments. However, amendment costs have increased prohibitively over the past two decades due to competing demands from industry and reductions in government subsidies for their agricultural use in several developing countries. In parallel, scientific research and farmers’ feedback have demonstrated that sodic soils can be brought back to a highly productive state through a plant‐assisted approach generically termed “phytoremediation.” Typical plant‐based strategies for contaminated soils, such as those containing elevated levels of metals and metalloids, work through the cultivation of specific plant species capable of hyperaccumulating target ionic species in their shoots, thereby removing them from the soil. In contrast, phytoremediation of sodic soils is achieved by the ability of plant roots to increase the dissolution rate of calcite, thereby resulting in enhanced levels of Ca2+ in soil solution to effectively replace Na+ from the cation exchange complex. Phytoremediation has shown to be advantageous in several aspects: (1) no financial outlay to purchase chemical amendments, (2) accrued financial or other benefits from crops grown during amelioration, (3) promotion of soil‐aggregate stability and creation of macropores that improve soil hydraulic properties and root proliferation, (4) greater plant‐nutrient availability in soil after phytoremediation, (5) more uniform and greater zone of amelioration in terms of soil depth, and (6) environmental considerations in terms of carbon sequestration in the postamelioration soil. Phytoremediation is particularly effective when used on moderately saline‐sodic and sodic soils. It is a viable solution for resource‐poor farmers through community‐based management, which would help in strengthening the linkages among researchers, farm advisors, and farmers. These linkages will continue to be fostered as the use of sodic soils becomes more prevalent. The success of phytoremediation of sodic soils requires a greater understanding of the processes fostering phytoremediation, the potential of plant species to withstand ambient salinity and sodicity levels in soil and water, and also of the uses and markets for the agricultural products produced. Strategic research on such aspects would further elucidate the role of phytoremediation in the restoration of sodic soils for sustainable agriculture and conservation of environmental quality. "

Analyses combine downscaled rainfall forecasts, crop yield simulation, stochastic enterprise budgeting and identification of profit-maximizing fertilizer N rates and stand densities. October–February rainfall predictions were downscaled from a GCM, run with both observed and forecast sea surface temperature boundary conditions – representing upper and lower bounds of predictability – and stochastically disaggregated into daily crop model inputs. Simulated interactive effects of rainfall, N supply and stand density on yield and profit are consistent with literature. Perfect foreknowledge of daily weather for the growing season would be worth an estimated 15–30% of the average gross value of production and 24–69% of average gross margin, depending on location and on whether household labor is included in cost calculations. \{GCM\} predictions based on observed sea surface temperatures increased average gross margins 24% at Katumani and 9% at Makindu when labor cost was included. At the lead time used, forecasts using forecast sea surface temperatures are not skillful and showed near-zero value. Forecast value was much more sensitive to grain price than to input costs. Stochastic dominance analysis shows that farmers at any level of risk aversion would prefer the forecast-based management strategy over management optimized for climatology under the study’s assumptions, despite high probability (25% at Katumani, 34% at Makindu) of lower returns in individual years. Results contribute to knowledge of seasonal forecast value in a relatively high-risk, high-predictability context; utility and value of forecasts derived from a GCM; and risk implications of smallholder farmers responding to forecasts.

It was found that certain seasonal descriptors—namely total seasonal rainfall, number of rain-days and cessation dates of the rainy season—when aggregated into annual and national means manifested almost the same evolution pattern; while others, notably average rainfall per rain-day and onset date of the growing period, showed different patterns of evolution. It was concluded that the recent reduction in seasonal precipitation amount was related to a reduced number of rain-days in August and September, with precocious cessation of the rainy season as a consequence. However, all the seasonal descriptors showed recovery trends since the end of the 1980s, with the mean rainfall per rain-day, exhibiting the steadiest trend. But, the descriptors were more volatile during that recovery time according to the upward trends in their interannual variability. Importantly, the links between the seasonal descriptors and two sea surface temperature indexes were discussed in light of climate change impacts on rain-fed agriculture, the main source of food for the population of Burkina Faso.

This study focuses on \{ASR\} with stormwater in a low permeability fractured rock aquifer and the selection of water treatment methods to prevent well clogging. In this study two different injection and recovery phases were trialed. In the first phase ∼1380 m3 of potable water was injected and recovered over four cycles. In the second phase ∼3300 m3 of treated stormwater was injected and ∼2410 m3 were subsequently recovered over three cycles. Due to the success of the potable water injection cycles, its water quality was used to set pre-treatment targets for harvested urban stormwater of ≤0.6 \{NTU\} turbidity, ≤1.7 mg/L dissolved organic carbon and ≤0.2 mg/L biodegradable dissolved organic carbon. A range of potential \{ASR\} pre-treatment options were subsequently evaluated resulting in the adoption of an ultrafiltration/granular activated carbon system to remove suspended solids and nutrients which cause physical and biological clogging. \{ASR\} cycle testing with potable water and treated stormwater demonstrated that urban stormwater containing variable turbidity (mean 5.5 NTU) and organic carbon (mean 8.3 mg/L) concentrations before treatment could be injected into a low transmissivity fractured rock aquifer and recovered for irrigation supplies. A small decline in permeability of the formation in the vicinity of the injection well was apparent even with high quality water that met turbidity and \{DOC\} but could not consistently achieve the \{BDOC\} criteria.

A marginal loss (&lt;15%) in \{C11PI\} activity against trypsin at 80 °C and basic pH (12.0) was associated with concurrent changes in its far-UV \{CD\} spectra. Further, in vitro assays demonstrated that \{C11PI\} possessed significant inhibitory potential (IC50 of 78 ng) against AjPs.

The resultant transcriptome assembly, referred to as CcTA v2, comprised 21 434 transcript assembly contigs (TACs) with an \{N50\} of 1510 bp, the largest one being ∼8 kb. Of the 21 434 TACs, 16 622 (77.5%) could be mapped on to the soybean genome build 1.0.9 under fairly stringent alignment parameters. Based on knowledge of intron junctions, 10 009 primer pairs were designed from 5033 \{TACs\} for amplifying intron spanning regions (ISRs). By using in silico mapping of BAC-end-derived \{SSR\} loci of pigeonpea on the soybean genome as a reference, putative mapping positions at the chromosome level were predicted for 6284 \{ISR\} markers, covering all 11 pigeonpea chromosomes. A subset of 128 \{ISR\} markers were analyzed on a set of eight genotypes. While 116 markers were validated, 70 markers showed one to three alleles, with an average of 0.16 polymorphism information content (PIC) value. In summary, the CcTA v2 transcript assembly and \{ISR\} markers will serve as a useful resource to accelerate genetic research and breeding applications in pigeonpea. "

However, there is a wide range in quality and spatial and temporal scale and resolution of climate and soil data underpinning these studies, as well as widely differing assumptions about cropping-system context and crop model calibration. Here we present an explicit rationale and methodology for selecting data sources for simulating crop yields and estimating yield gaps at specific locations that can be applied across widely different levels of data availability and quality. The method consists of a tiered approach that identifies the most scientifically robust requirements for data availability and quality, as well as other, less rigorous options when data are not available or are of poor quality. Examples are given using this approach to estimate maize yield gaps in the state of Nebraska (USA), and at a national scale for Argentina and Kenya. These examples were selected to represent contrasting scenarios of data availability and quality for the variables used to estimate yield gaps. The goal of the proposed methods is to provide transparent, reproducible, and scientifically robust guidelines for estimating yield gaps; guidelines which are also relevant for simulating the impact of climate change and land-use change at local to global spatial scales. Likewise, the improved understanding of data requirements and alternatives for simulating crop yields and estimating yield gaps as described here can help identify the most critical “data gaps” and focus global efforts to fill them. A related paper (Van Bussel et al., 2015) examines issues of site selection to minimize data requirements and up-scaling from location-specific estimates to regional and national spatial scales. "

Two resistance classes (pre- and post-attachment) and several resistant genotypes have been identified among \{NERICA\} (New Rice for Africa) cultivars under laboratory conditions (in vitro) previously. However, little is known about expression of this resistance under field conditions. Here we investigated (1) whether resistance exhibited under controlled conditions would express under representative Striga-infested field conditions, and (2) whether \{NERICA\} cultivars would achieve relatively good grain yields under Striga-infested conditions. Twenty-five rice cultivars, including all 18 upland \{NERICA\} cultivars, were screened in S. asiatica-infested (in Tanzania) and S. hermonthica-infested (in Kenya) fields during two seasons. Additionally, a selection of cultivars was tested in vitro, in mini-rhizotron systems. For the first time, resistance observed under controlled conditions was confirmed in the field for NERICA-2, -5, -10 and -17 (against S. asiatica) and NERICA-1 to -5, -10, -12, -13 and -17 (against S. hermonthica). Despite high Striga-infestation levels, yields of around 1.8 t ha−1 were obtained with NERICA-1, -9 and -10 (in the S. asiatica-infested field) and around 1.4 t ha−1 with NERICA-3, -4, -8, -12 and -13 (in the S. hermonthica-infested field). In addition, potential levels of tolerance were identified in vitro, in NERICA-1, -17 and -9 (S. asiatica) and in NERICA-1, -17 and -10 (S. hermonthica). These findings are highly relevant to rice agronomists and breeders and molecular geneticists working on Striga resistance. In addition, cultivars combining broad-spectrum resistance with good grain yields in Striga-infested fields can be recommended to rice farmers in Striga-prone areas. "

Foreground selection for target gene(s) was followed by arduous phenotypic and background selection which fast-tracked the recovery of recurrent parent genome (RPG) to an extent of 95.8% in one of the near-isogenic lines (NILs) namely, Pusa 1728-23-33-31-56, which also showed high degree of resemblance to recurrent parent, \{PB6\} in phenotype. The phenotypic selection prior to background selection provided an additional opportunity for identifying the novel recombinants viz., Pusa 1884-9-12-14 and Pusa 1884-3-9-175, superior to parental lines in terms of early maturity, higher yield and improved quality parameters. There was no significant difference between the \{RPG\} recovery estimated based on \{SSR\} or \{SNP\} markers, however, the panel of \{SNPs\} markers was considered as the better choice for background selection as it provided better genome coverage and included \{SNPs\} in the genic regions. Multi-location evaluation of \{NILs\} depicted their stable and high mean performance in comparison to the respective recurrent parents. The Pi2 + Pi54 carrying \{NILs\} were effective in combating a pan-India panel of Magnaporthe oryzae isolates with high level of field resistance in northern, eastern and southern parts of India.

Carl Linneaus first described the cultivated species in 1753, as A. hypogaea L. Cultivated peanut can be classified into two subspecies, fastigiata and hypogaea, based on the presence or absence of floral axes on the main stem. They can be further divided into six botanical varieties (subspecies hypogaea: var. hirsuta, and var. hypogaea; subspecies fastigiata: var. aequatoriana, var. fastigiata, var. peruviana, and var. vulgaris) based on a range of morphological characteristics. The cultivated peanut is a self-pollinating allotetraploid (AABB genome, 2n = 4x = 40) putatively derived from the natural hybridization of two wild diploid species Arachis duranensis (AA genome, 2n = 2x = 20) and Arachis ipaënsis (BB genome, 2n = 2x = 20). It is well documented that cultivated peanut has a narrow genetic base which was likely due to a single polyploidization event that isolated it from the wild species and created small founder populations and a significant genetic bottleneck in the cultigen. Genetic variability is known to decline in proportion to the severity of the bottleneck and the smaller the population and the longer it remains small the more the allelic diversity erodes with the low frequency alleles being most at risk during a bottleneck. Nucleotide substitution rates suggest that the A, B, and K (Arachis batizocoi) genomes diverged fairly recently, between 2.3 and 2.9 million years ago. Large germplasm collections are maintained in India, China, and the United States. "

Flows of these services are strongly influenced by climate, land use and their interactions. Savannas cover c. 20% of the Earth's land surface and changes in the structure and dynamics of savanna vegetation may strongly influence local people's living conditions, as well as the climate system and global biogeochemical cycles. In this study, we use a dynamic vegetation model, the aDGVM, to explore interactive effects of climate and land use on the vegetation structure and distribution of West African savannas under current and anticipated future environmental conditions. We parameterized the model for West African savannas and extended it by including sub-models to simulate fire management, grazing, and wood cutting. The model projects that under future climate without human land use impacts, large savanna areas would shift toward more wood dominated vegetation due to \{CO2\} fertilization effects, increased water use efficiency and decreased fire activity. However, land use activities could maintain desired vegetation states that ensure fluxes of important ecosystem services, even under anticipated future conditions. Ecosystem management can mitigate climate change impacts on vegetation and delay or avoid undesired vegetation shifts. The results highlight the effects of land use on the future distribution and dynamics of savannas. The identification of management strategies is essential to maintain important ecosystem services under future conditions in savannas worldwide. "

Unfortunately, in many African countries, production doesn't satisfy the demand in grains due to various constrains. Understanding farmers practices and behavior in the management of grain legume pests is a crucial step in the development of sustainable management strategies. A total of 216 farmers were surveyed in eight districts of eastern Kenya to evaluate farmers' knowledge and perceptions of grain legume pests; to examine current pest management practices, and to identify other production constraints. Grain legumes are grown by a wide age-group of farmers, with both genders equally represented. Chemical control remains the main pest management strategy, and, to ensure pesticide effectiveness, farmers also use increased application rates, chemical alternation, frequent application and mixtures of chemicals. While farmers used other control measures, they showed only limited interest in biological control. The majority of the farmers had experience in grain legume farming and were able to identify the major pests, which were the legume flower thrips Megalurothrips sjostedti Trybom, the cowpea aphid Aphis craccivora Koch and the legume pod borer Maruca vitrata Fabricius. Our survey revealed that education and proximity to extension services contributed significantly to farmers' knowledge of grain legume pests, suggesting the need to provide continuous training and capacity building on integrated pest management in grain legume farming. The study also suggests integration of other pest management strategies such as the use of early maturing varieties, biopesticides and biofertilizer to reduce the use of chemical for sustainable pest management.

The molecular mechanisms of drought stress tolerance in Pennisetum remain elusive. We have used a shotgun proteomics approach to investigate protein signatures from different tissues under drought and control conditions. Drought stressed plants showed significant changes in stomatal conductance and increased root growth compared to the control plants. Root, leaf and seed tissues were harvested and 2281 proteins were identified and quantified in total. Leaf tissue showed the largest number of significant changes (120), followed by roots (25) and seeds (10). Increased levels of root proteins involved in cell wall-, lipid-, secondary- and signaling metabolism and the concomitantly observed increased root length point to an impaired shoot–root communication under drought stress. The harvest index (HI) showed a significant reduction under drought stress. Proteins with a high correlation to the \{HI\} were identified using sparse partial least square (sPLS) analysis. Considering the importance of Pearl millet as a stress tolerant food crop, this study provides a first reference data set for future investigations of the underlying molecular mechanisms. Biological significance Drought stress is the most limiting factor for plant growth and crop production worldwide. At the same time drought susceptible cereal crops are among the largest producers worldwide. In contrast, Pearl millet is a drought and salt tolerant cereal crop especially used in arid and semi-arid regions by small farmers. The multifactorial molecular mechanisms of this unique drought tolerance are not known. Here, we employ shotgun proteomics for a first characterization of the Pearl millet drought stress proteome. The experimental setup and the data set generated from this study reveal comprehensive physiological and proteomic responses of the drought stressed Pearl millet plants. Our study reveals statistically significant tissue-specific protein signatures during the adaptation to drought conditions. Thus, the work provides a first reference study of the drought stress proteome and related drought responsive proteins (DRP's) in Pearl millet. "

These predominantly greyish welded and non-welded tuffs form up to 12 m thick units, which are sometimes characterized by a basal vitrophyre. The four flow units yielded 40Ar/39Ar ages ranging from 6.36 to 8.13 Ma, indicating a period of ~ 1.8 Ma of pantelleritic volcanic activity during the Late Miocene in central Kenya. Tentative compositional and age correlations with other known tuff deposits suggest that the pantelleritic tuffs originally covered 40,000 km2 in central Kenya, extending much further than earlier recorded Pliocene tuffs. This newly identified magmatic phase occurred between the phonolitic flood eruptions (16–8 Ma) and the Pliocene tuff eruptions (6–4 Ma). The occurrence of multiple ash flow tuff deposits up to 150 km away from the inferred eruptive center(s) in the central sector of the Kenya Rift, indicates multi-cyclic peralkaline supereruptions during the Late Miocene. By analogy with more recent pantelleritic eruptions, the tuffs are thought to have been sulfur-rich; during eruption, they formed stratospheric aerosols, with significant environmental impact. The timing of the eruptions coincides with the shift towards more savannah-dominated environments in East Africa. "

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles by regulating target gene expression important for plant development and tolerance to stress conditions. Additionally, recently discovered phased siRNAs (phasiRNAs), a new class of small RNAs, are abundantly produced in legumes. Nevertheless, little is known about these regulatory molecules in chickpea. The small \{RNA\} population was sequenced from leaves and flowers of chickpea to identify conserved and novel miRNAs as well as phasiRNAs/phasiRNA loci. Bioinformatics analysis revealed 157 miRNA loci for the 96 highly conserved and known miRNA homologs belonging to 38 miRNA families in chickpea. Furthermore, 20 novel miRNAs belonging to 17 miRNA families were identified. Sequence analysis revealed approximately 60 phasiRNA loci. Potential target genes likely to be regulated by these miRNAs were predicted and some were confirmed by modified 5′ \{RACE\} assay. Predicted targets are mostly transcription factors that might be important for developmental processes, and others include superoxide dismutases, plantacyanin, laccases and F-box proteins that could participate in stress responses and protein degradation. Overall, this study provides an inventory of miRNA–target gene interactions for chickpea, useful for the comparative analysis of small \{RNAs\} among legumes. "

However, to date limited pearl millet hybrid development has been undertaken in West Africa (WA), which is the center of pearl millet origin and diversity and where this crop is most important outside India. Using a diverse set of \{WA\} pearl millet germplasm, objectives of this study were to determine the superiority of population hybrids over open-pollinated varieties for agro-morphological and agronomic traits in \{WA\} pearl millet germplasm; and (ii) to derive strategies for pearl millet hybrid breeding in WA, based on quantitative-genetic parameters, combining ability and heterotic patterns among geographically close versus distant pearl millet populations. A 10 × 10 factorial mating design was performed with four parental \{OPVs\} from each of five \{WA\} countries. The 100 population hybrids and their parents were tested for 14 traits at six locations in one year, thereby using contrasting locations to indirectly sample the rainfall variability inherent to \{WA\} pearl millet production environments. Grain yield showed an average panmictic midparent heterosis (PMpH) of 16.7%, ranging from −26 to 73%. The mean grain yield of hybrids based on inter-country crosses did not differ significantly from intra-country crosses. Geographic distance between parents was positively correlated with hybrid grain yield (r = 0.31), but not with \{PMpH\} . Some crosses between accessions from Niger/Nigeria and Senegal were outstanding. Predictability of population hybrid performance for grain yield was moderate based on midparent values (r = 0.43) and slightly better based on general combining ability (GCA) (r = 0.56). Overall, pearl millet hybrid breeding in \{WA\} seems very promising, but there do not seem to be clear “natural” heterotic groups among \{WA\} pearl millet landraces. Such heterotic groups as the basis of sustainable hybrid breeding need rather to be created systematically, by building on existing combining ability patterns and aiming to maximize combining ability between the groups.

The impulse spectra were categorized into five different types of frequency patterns (profiles), designated Broadband, HighF, MidF1, MidF2 and LowF to indicate differences in their peak energies and broadness of frequency range. Groups (trains) of three or more closely spaced impulses, termed bursts, were observed to occur frequently in all recordings, as has been reported for sounds produced by other insects. Mean rates of bursts, mean counts of impulses per burst, and mean rates of impulses in bursts were calculated and compared among the two species and stages. The counts of broadband and MidF2 impulses per burst and the rates of broadband and MidF2 impulses in bursts were significantly different for adult than for 4th instar S. zeamais and either stage of P. truncatus. These findings can be useful in developing an acoustic sensor system for automated detection of hidden insects including P. truncatus and S. zeamais in bulk storage warehouses.

Because most wild species are diploid, the first step of introgression usually involves hybridization of wild species and polyploidization to produce a synthetic allotetraploid (AABB) that is sexually compatible with peanut. This study investigates drought-related traits such as leaf morphology, transpiration profile, chlorophyll meter readings (SCMR), specific leaf area (SLA) and transpiration rate per leaf area for two wild diploids (Arachis duranensis and Arachis ipaënsis) that could be of interest for improvement of the peanut crop. Furthermore, the inheritance of the traits from the diploid to the tetraploid state was investigated. Results showed that whilst some diploid traits such as SCMR, are maintained through hybridization and polyploidization, most characters, such as the leaf area, stomata size, trichome density and transpiration profile, are substantially modified. The study concludes that direct evaluations of drought-related traits in wild diploids may be useful for evaluation of wild species to be used in introgression. However, evaluations on wild-derived synthetic tetraploids are likely to be more informative. "

The output \{MRS\} geophysical parameters, i.e. water content and decay constants versus depth, were compared to hydrogeological characteristics, i.e. water table depth, total porosity, specific yield and transmissivity estimated from direct measurements, pumping tests and transient groundwater modelling. The MRS-determined parameters were then used to estimate the rates of groundwater recharge. Contained in poorly consolidated Tertiary sandstones, the \{CT3\} aquifer's water table has continuously risen by 4 m in total over the past four decades. Additionally, a significant portion of this increase has occurred in the past decade alone, with an annual rise now ranging between 0.1 and 0.3 m depending on the monitored well. Increase in groundwater recharge due to land clearance and deforestation explains this situation. According to previous estimations, the pre-clearing recharge ranged from 1 to 5 mm per year in 1950–60 s, while more recent recharge rates (1990s–2000s) range from 20 to 50 mm per year. These recharge values are directly affected by estimated aquifer specific yield value, while the spatial variation of rates of water table rise can be attributed to large scale hydrodynamic heterogeneities in the aquifer. However, few field measurements were available to confirm these assumptions. The main results of this study are: (1) The water table depth and aquifer transmissivity are estimated from \{MRS\} output parameters with an average accuracy of ± 10% and ± 9% respectively. (2) The MRS-determined water content is linked to both the total porosity and the specific yield of the aquifer, but no quantitative formulation can be proposed as yet. (3) Using the average MRS-determined water content over the investigated area, i.e. 13%, the groundwater recharge rates can be estimated to be ~ 2 mm per year in the 1950–1960s (pre-clearing period), and ~ 23 mm per year for the last decade. (4) The variations in specific yield and transmissivity cannot explain by themselves the spatial variability of the rise of the water table. (5) The ranges in transmissivity and water content obtained from \{MRS\} are more realistic than the groundwater modelling outputs. Therefore, \{MRS\} could be used to better constrain the aquifer parameters in groundwater modelling with a dense site network. Finally, this work illustrates how \{MRS\} can successfully improve characterisation and transient multi-year groundwater balance of commonly found sedimentary aquifers, particularly when integrated with well observations and pumping tests.

Detailed field measurements were concentrated at 3 “supersites” and 3 ancillary sites. Four aircraft were used for remote sensing and flux measurement. Observations from space were acquired from nine sensors on seven different satellite platforms. Conditions in 1992 turned out to be average for the last decade with good gradients of precipitation and a variety of vegetation productivities between the study sites.

The objective of this study was to assess \{CO2\} emissions in the soil surface following tillage abandonment and to investigate some of the underlying soil physical, chemical and biological controls. Maize (Zea mays) was planted under conventional tillage (T) and no-tillage (NT), both without crop residues under smallholder farming conditions in Potshini, South Africa. Intact top-soil (0–0.05 m) core samples (N = 54) from three 5 × 15 m2 plots per treatment were collected two years after conversion of T to \{NT\} to evaluate the short-term \{CO2\} emissions. Depending on the treatment, cores were left intact, compacted by 5 and 10%, or had surface crusts removed. They were incubated for 20 days with measurements of \{CO2\} fluxes twice a day during the first three days and once a day thereafter. Soil organic C (SOC) content, soil bulk density (ρb), aggregate stability, soil organic matter quality, and microbial biomass and its activity were evaluated at the onset of the incubation. \{CO2\} emissions were 22% lower under \{NT\} compared with T with \{CO2\} emissions of 0.9 ± 0.10 vs 1.1 ± 0.10 mg C–CO2 gC−1 day−1 under \{NT\} and T, respectively, suggesting greater \{SOC\} protection under NT. However, there were greater total \{CO2\} emissions per unit of surface by 9% under \{NT\} compared to T (1.15 ± 0.03 vs 1.05 ± 0.04 g C–CO2 m−2 day−1). \{SOC\} protection significantly increased with the increase in soil bulk density (r = 0.89) and aggregate stability (from 1.7 ± 0.25 mm to 2.3 ± 0.31, r = 0.50), and to the decrease in microbial biomass and its activity (r = −0.59 and −0.57, respectively). In contrast, the greater \{NT\} \{CO2\} emissions per m2 were explained by top-soil enrichment in \{SOC\} by 48% (from 12.4 ± 0.2 to 19.1 ± 0.4 g kg−1, r = 0.59). These results on the soil controls of tillage impact on \{CO2\} emissions are expected to inform on the required shifts in agricultural practices for enhancing C sequestration in soils. In the context of the study, any mechanism favoring aggregate stability and promoting \{SOC\} allocation deep in the soil profile rather than in the top-soil would greatly diminish soil \{CO2\} outputs and thus stimulate C sequestration.

The evaluation was based on multiple measurements of biomass taken before and after the drought stress was applied using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), along with other selection criteria including anthesis-silking interval, leaf senescence, chlorophyll content, root capacitance, final grain yield, and grain yield components. Kernel weight was the most stable trait under drought stress. Correlations between the primary trait (grain yield) and the secondary traits, except the root capacitance and \{ASI\} under water-stressed condition, were all significant. Root capacitance had relatively low heritability and low genetic correlation with other drought resistance criteria, and is not recommended as a drought resistance criterion. Significant reduction of \{NDVI\} values measured in the afternoon when the leaves became rolling, compared to those measured in the morning when the leaves were open, provides a reliable index for leaf rolling, which however was not significantly correlated with grain yield. \{NDVIs\} measured across different developmental stages were highly correlated with each other and with most of the secondary traits as well as, grain yield, indicating that \{NDVI\} can be used as a secondary trait for large-scale drought resistance screening. Regression models built based on non-yield drought criteria and yield components explained about 40% and 95% of the variation for the grain yield, respectively. Some maize lines developed in China for temperate regions showed strong drought resistance comparable to tropical maize lines when tested under tropical condition, indicating that temperate lines with a wide adaptability can be used in drought resistance breeding for both temperate and tropical environments.

Factors identified as having a major impact on afforestation are: the presence or proximity of a wood-processing industry, the distance to highways, and land allocation to households. Whereas the two former variables are in most areas of the province positively correlated with afforestation, an unexpected negative correlation was observed for the latter. The analysis of these results, supported by an in-depth knowledge of the area and of the political context, leads to the conclusion that, during the time period considered, afforestation was largely driven by state organisations on protected state-owned land, and forestry was not a significant component of household economic activities.

They were compared for variation in conidium and conidiophore morphology, temperature requirements for sporulation, germination and germ-tube growth and for pathogenicity on different sorghum and maize cultivars. Although there were significant differences in isolate morphology, all conformed to the known range for P. sorghi. Mean conidial length × width ranged from 21–23 μm × 16·9–19·2 μm, and mean conidiophore length (basal cell-branching) ranged from 116·3–135·6 μm. All isolates sporulated in the range 14–26°C (optimal at 16–23°), although one isolate from maize from Umbeluzi in Mozambique had a broader optimal range for sporulation (12–25°). Conidia of all isolates germinated between 10° and 34°. Germ-tube response to temperature was similar for all isolates (10–34°). The isolates varied in their pathogenicity towards sorghum cultivars, with an isolate from Rwanda being pathogenic to more sorghum differentials than any other. Cluster analysis of isolates based on host reaction indicated five groups at the 85% similarity level. The existence of pathogenic variability has ramifications for the breeding of sorghum for resistance to downy mildew in Africa. "

High and low yielding sites were clearly separated by a range of physical and biological characters, low yield being associated with low latitude and pre-season rainfall, high temperature, early phenology, short crop duration, low biomass and fecundity. Genotype by environment interactions for yield were highly significant (P &lt; 0.001), and accounted for more variance than that attributed to genotypes alone. Ward's hierarchical clustering indicated that the genotypes could be separated into discrete groups, comprising material specifically adapted to the north (Clusters 2 and 3) or south (Cluster 5), widely or consistently poorly adapted germplasm (Clusters 1 and 4, respectively). Cluster 5, comprising germplasm from southern and central India, was characterized by early phenology, confirming the role of drought escape in southern India. With increasing latitude Cluster 5 genotypes remained early, but had the capacity to delay maturity considerably, resulting in average, and occasionally above average yields. However, compared to well-adapted material in the north, Cluster 5 biomass was low, and the time interval between flowering and podding up to 50 days, representing repeated cycles of flowering and subsequent abortion. Clusters 2 and 3, dominated by northern Indian genotypes, were characterized by later phenology, and were able to delay the onset of flowering significantly more than the remaining germplasm at late flowering northern sites. In Cluster 3, the second highest yielding group overall, this increased both source and sink potential at productive northern sites. Cluster 2 was uniformly later than Cluster 3, and lower yielding at most sites. Cluster 1 was characterized by intermediate flowering and relatively early, responsive maturity, a phenological compromise responsible for wide adaptation, by providing sufficient drought escape in the south, and enough biomass in the north to produce above average yields in these contrasting environments. \{ICCV\} 10 from the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), and 2 Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) lines, \{BG\} 391 and \{BG\} 1006, were the most consistently high yielding, ranking in the top 10 at 10 and 8 sites, respectively.

Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) is constrained by multiple stresses and alleviating them would improve \{SNF\} contribution to agroecosystems. Genetic differences in adaptation tolerance to various stresses are known in both host plant and rhizobium. The discovery and use of promiscuous germplasm in soybean led to the release of high-yielding cultivars in Africa. High N2-fixing soybean cultivars are commercially grown in Australia and some countries in Africa and South America and those of pea in Russia. \{SNF\} is a complex trait, governed by multigenes with varying effects. Few major quantitative trait loci (QTL) and candidate genes underlying \{QTL\} are reported in grain and model legumes. Nodulating genes in model legumes are cloned and orthologs determined in grain legumes. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from nodulation genes are available in common bean and soybean. Genomes of chickpea, pigeonpea, and soybean; and genomes of several rhizobium species are decoded. Expression studies revealed few genes associated with \{SNF\} in model and grain legumes. Advances in host plant and rhizobium genomics are helping identify \{DNA\} markers to aid breeding of legume cultivars with high symbiotic efficiency. A paradigm shift is needed by breeding programs to simultaneously improve host plant and rhizobium to harness the strength of positive symbiotic interactions in cultivar development. Computation models based on metabolic reconstruction pathways are providing greater insights to explore genotype–phenotype relationships in SNF. Models to simulate the response of \{N2\} fixation to a range of environmental variables and crop growth are assisting researchers to quantify \{SNF\} for efficient and sustainable agricultural production systems. Such knowledge helps identifying bottlenecks in specific legume–rhizobia systems that could be overcome by legume breeding to enhance SNF. This review discusses the recent developments to improve \{SNF\} and productivity of grain legumes. "

A combination of models was used to analyse land use and labour allocation strategies for optimizing income for wealthy (2.5 ha with eight cattle) and poor (0.9 ha without cattle) farms in Murewa, Zimbabwe. Trade-offs between profitability, labour use and partial nutrient balances were also evaluated for alternative resource management strategies. Farm data were captured using the Integrated Modelling Platform for Mixed Animal-Crop Systems (IMPACT), which was directly linked to the Household Resource use Optimization Model (HROM). \{HROM\} was applied to optimize net cash income within the constraints specific to the households. Effects of alternative nutrient resource management strategies in crop and milk production were simulated using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and \{RUMINANT\} models, respectively, and the output evaluated using HROM. The poor farm had a net income of US$ 1 yr−1 and the farmer relied on selling unskilled labour to supplement her income. The poor farm’s income was marginally increased by US$18 yr−1 and the soil nitrogen (N) balance was increased from 6 to 9 kg ha−1 yr−1 by expanding groundnut production from the previous 5–25% of the land area. Further increases in area allocated to groundnut production were constrained by lack of labour. On the poor farm, maize production was most profitable when cultivated on a reduced land area with optimal weeding. The wealthy farm had a maize-dominated cropping system that yielded a net cash balance of US$290 yr−1, mainly from the sale of crop produce. Net income could be increased to US$1175 yr−1, by re-allocating the 240 hired labour-days more efficiently, although this reallocation substantially reduced partial soil N and phosphorus (P) balances by 74 kg N ha−1 and 11 kg P ha−1, respectively, resulting in negative nutrient balances. Few opportunities existed to increase productivity and income of the smallholder farms without inducing negative nutrient balances. On the wealthy farm, groundnut was the least profitable crop; shifting its production to the most fertile field did not improve income unless the groundnut residues were fed to lactating cows. The analysis carried out in this paper highlights the need to develop practical technological recommendations and development interventions that consider farm resource endowment (land, fertilizers, manure and labour), variability in soil fertility within farms and competing resource use options.

This process has a profound influence on what form of mineral-N is absorbed, used by plants, and retained in the soil, or lost to the environment, which in turn affects N-cycling, N-use efficiency (NUE) and ecosystem health and services. As reactive-N is often the most limiting in natural ecosystems, plants have acquired a range of mechanisms that suppress soil-nitrifier activity to limit N-losses via N-leaching and denitrification. Plants’ ability to produce and release nitrification inhibitors from roots and suppress soil-nitrifier activity is termed ‘biological nitrification inhibition’ (BNI). With recent developments in methodology for in-situ measurement of nitrification inhibition, it is now possible to characterize \{BNI\} function in plants. This review assesses the current status of our understanding of the production and release of biological nitrification inhibitors (BNIs) and their potential in improving \{NUE\} in agriculture. A suite of genetic, soil and environmental factors regulate \{BNI\} activity in plants. BNI-function can be genetically exploited to improve the BNI-capacity of major food- and feed-crops to develop next-generation production systems with reduced nitrification and \{N2O\} emission rates to benefit both agriculture and the environment. The feasibility of such an approach is discussed based on the progresses made. "

abstract = "Abstract Accurate estimation of yield gaps is only possible for locations where high quality local data are available, which are, however, lacking in many regions of the world. The challenge is how yield gap estimates based on location-specific input data can be used to obtain yield gap estimates for larger spatial areas. Hence, insight about the minimum number of locations required to achieve robust estimates of yield gaps at larger spatial scales is essential because data collection at a large number of locations is expensive and time consuming. In this paper we describe an approach that consists of a climate zonation scheme supplemented by agronomical and locally relevant weather, soil and cropping system data. Two elements of this methodology are evaluated here: the effects on simulated national crop yield potentials attributable to missing and/or poor quality data and the error that might be introduced in scaled up yield gap estimates due to the selected climate zonation scheme. Variation in simulated yield potentials among weather stations located within the same climate zone, represented by the coefficient of variation, served as a measure of the performance of the climate zonation scheme for upscaling of yield potentials. We found that our approach was most appropriate for countries with homogeneous topography and large climate zones, and that local up-to-date knowledge of crop area distribution is required for selecting relevant locations for data collection. Estimated national water-limited yield potentials were found to be robust if data could be collected that are representative for approximately 50% of the national harvested area of a crop. In a sensitivity analysis for rainfed maize in four countries, assuming only 25% coverage of the national harvested crop area (to represent countries with poor data availability), national water-limited yield potentials were found to be over- or underestimated by 3 to 27% compared to estimates with the recommended crop area coverage of ≥50%. It was shown that the variation of simulated yield potentials within the same climate zone is small. Water-limited potentials in semi-arid areas are an exception, because the climate zones in these semi-arid areas represent aridity limits of crop production for the studied crops. We conclude that the developed approach is robust for scaling up yield gap estimates from field, i.e. weather station data supplemented by local soil and cropping system data, to regional and national levels. Possible errors occur in semi-arid areas with large variability in rainfall and in countries with more heterogeneous topography and climatic conditions in which data availability hindered full application of the approach.

Reliable location-specific estimates of yield gaps, either derived from research plots or simulation models, are available only for a limited number of locations and crops due to cost and time required for field studies or for obtaining data on long-term weather, crop rotations and management practices, and soil properties. Given these constraints, we compare global agro-climatic zonation schemes for suitability to up-scale location-specific estimates of Yp and Yw, which are the basis for estimating yield gaps at regional, national, and global scales. Six global climate zonation schemes were evaluated for climatic homogeneity within delineated climate zones (CZs) and coverage of crop area. An efficient \{CZ\} scheme should strike an effective balance between zone size and number of zones required to cover a large portion of harvested area of major food crops. Climate heterogeneity was very large in \{CZ\} schemes with less than 100 zones. Of the other four schemes, the Global Yield Gap Atlas Extrapolation Domain (GYGA-ED) approach, based on a matrix of three categorical variables (growing degree days, aridity index, temperature seasonality) to delineate \{CZs\} for harvested area of all major food crops, achieved reasonable balance between number of \{CZs\} to cover 80% of global crop area and climate homogeneity within zones. While \{CZ\} schemes derived from two climate-related categorical variables require a similar number of zones to cover 80% of crop area, within-zone heterogeneity is substantially greater than for the GYGA-ED for most weather variables that are sensitive drivers of crop production. Some \{CZ\} schemes are crop-specific, which limits utility for up-scaling location-specific evaluation of yield gaps in regions with crop rotations rather than single crop species. "

The long-term experiment started in 1986 on a Typic Xerofluvent soil in Central Italy using a randomized complete block design with four replications. Ten years after the experiment began, \{SOC\} and \{STN\} concentrations in the 0–30 cm soil layer were already higher under \{NT\} compared to CT. The shallow layer (0–10 cm) showed the highest \{SOC\} and \{STN\} concentration increments. However, no differences between tillage systems were observed in the deeper layers. After 28 years, continuous \{NT\} increased \{SOC\} and \{STN\} content in the 30 cm soil depth by 22% compared to initial values. In the same period, continuous \{CT\} decreased \{SOC\} and \{STN\} content by 3% and 5%, respectively. On average, the total \{SOC\} and \{STN\} gains under \{NT\} may be attributed to the shallow layer increments. In the 10–20 and 20–30 cm soil layers, \{SOC\} accumulation over time was negligible also under NT. In the whole profile (0–30 cm), the mean annual \{SOC\} variation was +0.40 Mg ha−1 yr−1 and −0.06 Mg ha−1 yr−1 under \{NT\} and CT, respectively. Under NT, \{SOC\} content increased rapidly in the first ten years (+0.75 Mg ha−1yr−1); later on, \{SOC\} increments were slower indicating the reaching of a new equilibrium. Data show that \{NT\} is a useful alternative management practice increasing carbon sequestration and soil health in Mediterranean conditions. "

However, the long-term impact of grassland management such as burning, which is still common in many areas of the world, on \{SOC\} is still a matter of debate. The objective of this study was to quantify the long-term effects of annual burning on \{CO2\} output from soils and \{SOC\} stocks. The study was performed on a 62 years old field trial comparing annual burning (AB) to no burning associated with tree encroachment (NB), and to annual mowing (AM) with all treatments laid out in randomized block design with three replicates per treatment. \{CO2\} emissions from soil were continuously measured over two years and were correlated to soil chemical and physical properties. \{AB\} and \{AM\} produced 30 and 34% greater \{CO2\} emissions from soil than \{NB\} (1.80 ± 0.13 vs. 2.34 ± 0.18 and 2.41 ± 0.17 g C-CO2 m− 2 d− 1 for NB, \{AB\} and \{AM\} respectively). \{AB\} and \{AM\} also produced greater \{CO2\} emissions from soil and per gram of soil carbon (1.32 ± 0.1 and 1.35 ± 0.1 mg C-CO2 g C− 1 d− 1, respectively) than \{NB\} (1.05 ± 0.07 mg C-CO2 g C− 1 d− 1), which corresponded to significant differences of respectively 26% and 29%. Overall, \{CO2\} emissions from soil (per m2) significantly increased with soil water content (r = 0.72) followed by \{SOC\} stocks (r = 0.59), \{SOC\} content (r = 0.50), soil bulk density (r = 0.49), soil temperature (r = 0.47), C:N ratio (r = 0.46) and mean weight diameter (r = 0.38). These findings suggest that long-term annual burning increases \{CO2\} output from soils. Additional greenhouse gases emissions from burning itself and alternative grassland management techniques were finally discussed. "

The programme released four biological control agents—the larval parasitoids Cotesia flavipes and Cotesia sesamiae, the egg parasitoid Telenomus isis and the pupal parasitoid Xanthopimpla stemmator—to control the economically important stemborer pests Busseola fusca, Chilo partellus and Sesamia calamistis. Two of the natural enemies that were released got established and spread to many localities in the region. This study adopted the economic surplus model based on production, market and \{GIS\} data to evaluate the economic benefits and cost-effectiveness of the programme in three countries—Kenya, Mozambique and Zambia. Findings show that the biological control intervention has contributed to an aggregate monetary surplus of US$ 1.4 billion to the economies of the three countries with 84% from maize production and the remaining 16% from sorghum production. The net present value over the twenty years period was estimated at US$ 272 million for both crops and ranged from US$ 142 million for Kenya to US$ 39 million for Zambia. The attractive internal rate of return (IRR) of 67% compared to the considered discount rate of 10%, as well as the estimated benefit–cost ratio (BCR) of 33:1, illustrate the efficiency of investment in the \{BC\} research and intervention. The estimated number of people lifted out of poverty through the BC-programme was on average 57,400 persons (consumers and producers) per year in Kenya, 44,120 persons in Mozambique, and 36,170 persons in Zambia, representing an annual average reduction of poor populations, respectively of 0.35, 0.25 and 0.20% in each of the three countries. These findings underscore the need for increased investment in \{BC\} research to sustain cereal production and improve poor living conditions. "

This article provides the state of the art on \{DH\} technology including the induction and identification of haploids, what factors influence haploid induction, molecular basis of microspore embryogenesis, the genetics underpinnings of haploid induction and its use in plant breeding, particularly to fix traits and unlock genetic variation. Both in vitro and in vivo methods have been used to induce haploids that are thereafter chromosome doubled to produce DH. Various heritable factors contribute to the successful induction of haploids, whose genetics is that of a quantitative trait. Genomic regions associated with in vitro and in vivo \{DH\} production were noted in various crops with the aid of \{DNA\} markers. It seems that \{F2\} plants are the most suitable for the induction of \{DH\} lines than \{F1\} plants. Identifying putative haploids is a key issue in haploid breeding. \{DH\} technology in Brassicas and cereals, such as barley, maize, rice, rye and wheat, has been improved and used routinely in cultivar development, while in other food staples such as pulses and root crops the technology has not reached to the stage leading to its application in plant breeding. The centromere-mediated haploid induction system has been used in Arabidopsis, but not yet in crops. Most food staples are derived from genomic resources-rich crops, including those with sequenced reference genomes. The integration of genomic resources with \{DH\} technology provides new opportunities for the improving selection methods, maximizing selection gains and accelerate cultivar development. Marker-aided breeding and \{DH\} technology have been used to improve host plant resistance in barley, rice, and wheat. Multinational seed companies are using \{DH\} technology in large-scale production of inbred lines for further development of hybrid cultivars, particularly in maize. The public sector provides support to national programs or small-medium private seed for the exploitation of \{DH\} technology in plant breeding. "

A genome-wide 119169 and 110491 \{ISM\} (intron-spanning markers) from 23129 desi and 20386 kabuli protein-coding genes and 7454 in silico InDel (insertion-deletion) (1–45-bp)-based \{ILP\} (intron-length polymorphism) markers from 3283 genes were developed that were structurally and functionally annotated on eight chromosomes and unanchored scaffolds of chickpea. A much higher amplification efficiency (83%) and intra-specific polymorphic potential (86%) detected by these markers than that of other sequence-based genetic markers among desi and kabuli chickpea accessions was apparent even by a cost-effective agarose gel-based assay. The genome-wide physically mapped 1718 \{ILP\} markers assayed a wider level of functional genetic diversity (19–81%) and well-defined phylogenetics among domesticated chickpea accessions. The gene-derived 1424 \{ILP\} markers were anchored on a high-density (inter-marker distance: 0.65 cM) desi intra-specific genetic linkage map/functional transcript map (ICC 4958 × \{ICC\} 2263) of chickpea. This reference genetic map identified six major genomic regions harbouring six robust \{QTLs\} mapped on five chromosomes, which explained 11–23% seed weight trait variation (7.6–10.5 LOD) in chickpea. The integration of high-resolution \{QTL\} mapping with differential expression profiling detected six including one potential serine carboxypeptidase gene with \{ILP\} markers (linked tightly to the major seed weight QTLs) exhibiting seed-specific expression as well as pronounced up-regulation especially in seeds of high (ICC 4958) as compared to low (ICC 2263) seed weight mapping parental accessions. The marker information generated in the present study was made publicly accessible through a user-friendly web-resource, “Chickpea ISM-ILP Marker Database”. The designing of multiple \{ISM\} and \{ILP\} markers (2–5 markers/gene) from an individual gene (transcription factor) with numerous aforementioned desirable genetic attributes can widen the user-preference to select suitable primer combination for simultaneous large-scale assaying of functional allelic variation, natural allelic diversity, molecular mapping and expression profiling of genes among chickpea accessions. This will essentially accelerate the identification of functionally relevant molecular tags regulating vital agronomic traits for genomics-assisted crop improvement by optimal resource expenses in chickpea.

Comprehensive transcriptome assemblies and genome sequences have either been developed or underway in these crops. Based on these resources, dense genetic maps, \{QTL\} maps as well as physical maps for these legume species have also been developed. As a result, these crops have graduated from ‘orphan’ or ‘less-studied’ crops to ‘genomic resources rich’ crops. This article summarizes the above-mentioned advances in genomics and genomics-assisted breeding applications in the form of marker-assisted selection (MAS) for hybrid purity assessment in pigeonpea; marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC) for introgressing \{QTL\} region for drought-tolerance related traits, Fusarium wilt (FW) resistance and Ascochyta blight (AB) resistance in chickpea; late leaf spot (LLS), leaf rust and nematode resistance in groundnut. We critically present the case of use of other modern breeding approaches like marker-assisted recurrent selection (MARS) and genomic selection (GS) to utilize the full potential of genomics-assisted breeding for developing superior cultivars with enhanced tolerance to various environmental stresses. In addition, this article recommends the use of advanced-backcross (AB-backcross) breeding and development of specialized populations such as multi-parents advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) for creating new variations that will help in developing superior lines with broadened genetic base. In summary, we propose the use of integrated genomics and breeding approach in these legume crops to enhance crop productivity in marginal environments ensuring food security in developing countries.

The measurements were used to categorize the state of the surface and profile soil water regimes during the experiment and to derive functional relationships for the soil water characteristic curve, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function, and infiltration function. Sample results for different supersites and different vegetation covers are presented showing soil water profiles and total soil water storage on days corresponding to the experimental ‘Golden Days’. Sample results are also presented for spatial and temporal distribution of surface moisture content and infiltration tests. The results demonstrate that the major experimental objective of monitoring the supersites during the most rapid vegetative growth stage with the largest change of the surface energy balance following the rainy season was very nearly achieved. Separation of the effects of probable root activity and drainage of the soil profile is possible. The potential for localized advection between the bare soil and vegetation strips of the tiger bush sites is demonstrated. "

One-hundred and twenty three lines with wilt incidence &lt;10% were selected from preliminary evaluation of 948 lines including germplasm and breeding lines from the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) for wilt resistance in the sick plot during 2003/2004 crop season at ICRISAT, Patancheru, India. Sixty lines were selected for second round of evaluation (2005/2006) and from those 57 lines were selected for third round of evaluation (2006/2007). In order to validate resistance stability, a Chickpea Wilt Nursery was constituted with 27 lines (7 germplasm accessions, 19 breeding lines and a highly susceptible check) and further tested in multi-location experiment for wilt resistance at 9 locations in India for three years (2007/2008–2009/2010). Variability in wilt incidence due to genetic differences among the genotypes, among the environments, and that due to genotype × environment interaction was highly significant (P &lt; 0.001). Although complete resistance across the locations was not found, the genotype and genotype × environment (GGE) biplot analyses allowed the selection of three breeding lines (ICCV 05527, \{ICCV\} 05528 and \{ICCV\} 96818) and one germplasm accession (ICC 11322) with moderate level of disease resistance and stable performance across the environments. Genotype × environment (G × E) interaction contributed 36.7% of total variation of the multi-environment evaluation, revealing instability of the phenotypic expression across environments.

Out of the 919 primers tested, 89 successfully amplified \{DNA\} from one or more species and 340 primers generated \{PCR\} amplicons from at least half of the species in the panel. Only 5.2% of the primers tested produced clear amplicons in all 16 species. The majority of the primers (66.9%) were developed from tall fescue and rice and these two species showed amplification rate of 41.6% and 19.0% across the panel, respectively. The highest amplification rate was found for conserved-intron scanning primers (CISP) developed from pearl millet (91%) and sorghum (75%) \{EST\} sequences that aligned to rice sequences. The primers with successful amplification identified in this study showed promise in other grass species as demonstrated in differentiating a set of 13 clones of reed canary grass, a species for which very little genomic research has been done. Sequences from the amplified \{PCR\} fragments indicated the potential for the transferable \{CISP\} markers for comparative mapping purposes.

The large demand for palm oil has resulted in a rapid expansion of oil palm cultivation across the globe. Because of the dwindling availability of land in Southeast Asia, most expansion of the industry is expected in Central and South America and sub-Saharan Africa, where land with suitable agro-ecological conditions is available. Using Ghana as a case study, a method for evaluating areas that are both suitable and available for oil palm production is presented. Our assessment used spatial data and \{GIS\} techniques, and showed that areas with suitable climatic conditions (annual average water deficit &lt;400 mm) is about 20% greater than was previously identified. The observed differences are the result of using different methods to determine suitability, and climate change. A major climatic factor limiting suitability for oil palm production in Ghana is the annual water deficit, with the most suitable areas located in the rainforest and semi-deciduous forest zones with higher rainfall in southern Ghana. Opportunities for large-scale oil palm plantation development is limited, however, because of the lack of availability of large and contiguous tracts of land that are required for commercial plantation oil palm development. A feasible strategy for oil palm expansion is therefore smallholder production, which can make use of smaller parcels of land. Alternatively, oil palm production in Ghana can be increased by yield intensification on land already planted to oil palm. This can also reduce the requirement for further land clearance for new plantations to meet the growing demand for palm oil. Such assessments will be essential for guiding government policy makers and investors considering investments in oil palm development. "

abstract = "Abstract Pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] is a versatile, stress-tolerant, and nutritious grain legume, possessing traits of value for enhancing the sustainability of dry sub-tropical and tropical agricultural systems. The use of crop wild relatives (CWR) in pigeonpea breeding has been successful in providing important resistance, quality, and breeding efficiency traits to the crop. Current breeding objectives for pigeonpea include increasing its tolerance to abiotic stresses, including heat, cold, drought, and waterlogging. Here we assess the potential for pigeonpea \{CWR\} to be further employed in crop improvement by compiling wild species occurrence and ex situ conservation information, producing geographic distribution models for the species, identifying gaps in the comprehensiveness of current germplasm collections, and using ecogeographic information to identify \{CWR\} populations with the potential to contribute agronomic traits of priority to breeders. The fifteen prioritized relatives of pigeonpea generally occur in South and Southeast Asia to Australia, with the highest concentrations of species in southern India and northern Australia. These taxa differ considerably among themselves and in comparison to the crop in their adaptations to temperature, precipitation and edaphic conditions. We find that these wild genetic resources are broadly under-represented in ex situ conservation systems, with 80% of species assessed as high priority for further collecting, thus their availability to plant breeders is insufficient. We identify species and highlight geographic locations for further collecting in order to improve the completeness of pigeonpea \{CWR\} germplasm collections, with particular emphasis on potential traits for abiotic stress tolerance.

abstract = "Abstract Wheat, rice, maize, pearl millet, and sorghum provide over half of the world's food calories. To maintain global food security, with the added challenge of climate change, there is an increasing need to exploit existing genetic variability and develop cultivars with superior genetic yield potential and stress adaptation. The opportunity to share knowledge between crops and identify priority traits for future research can be exploited to increase breeding impacts and assist in identifying the genetic loci that control adaptation. A more internationally coordinated approach to crop phenotyping and modeling, combined with effective sharing of knowledge, facilities, and data, will boost the cost effectiveness and facilitate genetic gains of all staple crops, with likely spill over to more neglected crops.
