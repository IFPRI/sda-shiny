The bean and maize growth cycles were found to be offset in time, with bean growth significantly exceeding maize growth during the first 26 days. Maize dry matter (DM) significantly exceeded that of the beans after 47 days but nitrogen content (N) did not differ consistently between the bean and maize monocrops after 33 days. The staggering of growth cycles in the bean: maize intercrops resulted in significantly more DM, N, and \{LAI\} then either component monocrop during all or part of the first 82 days, yet average intercrops yields of crude protein, energy and photosynthate equivalent did not exceed those of the higher yielding monocrop. Yield in monocrops and intercrops is discussed in relation to the temporal and spatial overlap in resource demands by the bean and maize. Potential predictors of ecological combining ability in simultaneously planted bean: maize intercrops are considered. "

abstract = "Indeterminate bush and climbing beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) were grown both in monoculture and intercropped with maize (Zea mays L.). Bean responses were contrasted to determine, first, the basis for the greater yield potential of the climibing beans in monoculture, and second, the source of the relatively larger yield losses exhibited by the climbing compared to the bush bean, when intercropped with maize. Climbing bean yield potential was associated with a longer life cycle than bush bean (92 vs. 80 days to maturity), and with prolonged durations of both leaf area establishment and podfilling. Up to 47 and 75 days, respectively, bean \{LAI\} and pod dry weight were nearly identical in the two plant types in monoculture, after which growth ceased in the bush bean but continued in the climbibg beam. The 660 kg/ha yield advantage of the climbing bean over bush bean (3020 vs. 2360 kg/ha) was a direct result of podfilling after 75 sdays, which was supported in part by leaf area produced after 47 days. The large climbing bean yield loss when intercropped with maize (reduction of 1440 kg/ha in the bush bean vs. 1960 kg/ha in climbing bean) was attributed to greater overlap with the increasingly dominant maize. In climbing bean, maize caused two-week reductions in both the leaf area establishment and podfilling phases. When beans were intercropped, the durations of both phases were equal in the bush and climbing cultivars, and as a result, final yields (920 vs. 1060 kg/ha, respectively), were not significantly different. Differences in the timing and magnitude of growth responses in the indeterminate bush and climbing beans are discussed in relation to selecting beans for intercropping with maize. "

A climate probability model (using FloraMap) was obtained using data from 304 geo-referenced locations where B. tabaci and geminiviruses cause significant damage. Clustering of the 304 points produced a simple model with two climatic variables: a dry season of at least 4 months each with less than 80 mm of rain and a mean temperature of the hottest month exceeding 21 °C. A modified Koeppen climate classification showed that 55% of the geminivirus-affected localities are in the tropical wet/dry region, 22% in the tropical and subtropical dry/humid climates and the remaining locations belonged to the wet equatorial and trade wind litoral climates. These findings contribute to understanding whitefly/geminivirus epidemics and implementation of sustainable integrated pest and disease management practices. "

The existence of B. tabaci biotypes and numerous whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses (begomoviruses) affecting food and industrial crops has become a major constraint to agricultural development in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The predominant whitefly and begomovirus method of control has been the application of insecticides. The excessive use of agrochemicals over the past decades, has contributed to an exponential increase in B. tabaci populations and incidence of begomoviruses transmitted by this whitefly vector. Under these conditions, biological and integrated whitefly/geminivirus control practices have not met expectations. Incorporating begomovirus resistance in a relatively small number of crops improved by conventional plant breeding methods has been a sustainable and efficient disease control strategy.

The modification of tannin content is a goal of biofortification breeding programs, while almost all bean improvement considers seed colour in selection priorities as this affects consumer preference and food quality. In the present study, we analyzed condensed tannins, tannin monomers and anthocyanin levels in an inter-genepool population derived from the cross \{DOR364\} × \{G19833\} using \{HPLC\} and spectrophotometric methods.

The valuation of environmental services at the local level has been relatively understudied in the literature on environmental services. According to residents, water availability has been declining over time in the zone as a result of watershed degradation. Since the primary use of water is for domestic consumption, the contingent valuation methodology (CVM) is used to estimate the value of improving water supplies in the micro-watershed. The results suggest that the economic value that local residents place on improving the quality of natural water sources is relatively modest, approximately US$10,000 per year. The costs and benefits of several possible land management interventions for improving the water situation are discussed. Intervention is difficult to justify solely on the value of expected improvements in water quality or availability, however, further analysis of mitigation options reveals that they may be justifiable from other perspectives as part of an integrated community resource management strategy. The conclusion is that a participatory, multi-sector approach is best for identifying complementarities that can simplify management of complex systems like watersheds. "

Four field trials were conducted at Palmira, Colombia to evaluate the response of different bean lines to \{SSC\} which resulted in up to 20% yield increase. However, effectiveness of \{SSC\} varied with trial and bean line. In a comparison of ten lines previously characterized for adaptation to water deficit, nine lines suggested a strong negative association between relative yields under \{SSC\} and yield under water deficit (r = −0.84, P &lt; 0.01) and relative yield under \{SSC\} and root length density under water deficit (r = −0.79, P&lt; 0.01). The tenth showed high yields under both \{SSC\} and water deficit. Physiological maturity was delayed by SSC, and canopy dry weight increased while seed yield was improved.

Possible causes of the seed-size effect include effects of characteristics correlated with seed size that in turn affect efficiency of certain physiological processes, or differences in adaptation resulting from limited gene exchange among gene pools differing in characteristic seed size. To examine the possibility of a physiological cause related to developmental correlations between seed size and tissue cell volumes, seed weight and approximate cell volumes of cotyledons, hypocotyl and root endodermis, guard cells, and palisade mesophyll, and volumes of pollen grains, were determined for 15 genotypes, including two wild accessions.

A general consensus exists that B. tabaci is a complex of morphologically indistinguishable populations with different biological biotypes. In the Americas, though the polyphagous B. tabaci biotype B appears to feed on cassava, it is postulated that the absence of \{CMGs\} is related to the inability of this biotype to colonize this crop effectively. However, its potential adaptation is considered a threat for cassava production in the Neotropics. This study was initiated to verify whether B. tabaci can become gradually adapted to M. esculenta. Trials in rearing chambers were carried out measuring population development of whitefly individuals passed through a series of intermediate hosts, previously selected and based on phylogenetic closeness to Manihot. The capacity of biotype B to adapt gradually to cassava, started on a legume (Phaseolus vulgaris), followed on two Euphorbiaceae (Euphorbia pulcherrima and Jatropha gossypiifolia) until, finally reaching a commercial cassava variety. B. tabaci female mean longevity on cassava, coming from P. vulgaris, E. pulcherrima and J. gossypiifolia was 3.1, 5.6 and 3.3 days, respectively. The highest oviposition rate (2.6 eggs/female/2 days), the shortest development time (44.4 days) and the highest value of rm (0.48 day−1) were for populations coming from J. gossypiifolia, where 27.5% of the individuals coming from this host survived and reproduced on cassava. The importance and potential impact of phylogenetically close plants as intermediate hosts faciliting the adaptation of B. tabaci biotype B to cassava is discussed. "

Recently, post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) has been employed as a method of choice to control plant viruses. \{PTGS\} acts by cleaving or translational repression of target messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in a sequence-specific manner by complementary small interfering RNAs. Viruses, in turn, encode suppressors of silencing, which interfere in one or more steps of the \{PTGS\} pathway. In this article the recent progress and future challenges in the control of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and \{RNA\} plant viruses by \{PTGS\} are reviewed. "

abstract = "Among common bean cultivars (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) with bush growth habits, large-seeded cultivars usually give lower yields than small-seeded ones, especially in warm, tropical environments. One suggested cause of this yield difference is that the determinate stem type typical of large-seeded bush cultivars is somehow less efficient than the indeterminate habits usually associated with small-seeded cultivars. To evaluate this hypothesis, yields of five pairs of large-seeded near-isogenic lines of contrasting growth habits were compared over five trials at three sites in Colombia. To obtain evidence from a group of materials with a broader genetic background, an additional 19 indeterminate and five determinate medium- to large-seeded experimental lines were grown in five trials at the three sites. In comparisons of the near-isogenic lines, no effect of growth habit on yield was detected in any of the trials. Determinate growth habit, on the average, resulted in 4 days earlier maturity. For the evaluation of 24 lines, the mean yield of the determinate lines over the five locations was 1700 kg ha−1, significantly lower than the mean yield of 1890 kg ha−1 for the indeterminates. Determinates matured 5 days earlier than indeterminates. Stability analyses for both studies indicated greater variation in yield stability of indeterminete lines as compared to the determinates. In the 24-genotype study, several indeterminate lines combined both high and stable yields. While the results of the near-isogenic lines indicate that differences in growth habit are not sufficient to explain low yields in large-seeded cultivars, the comparison among 24 lines suggests that the genotypic variation present within indeterminate growth habits may offer greater potential for yield improvement of large-seeded bush types without loss of yield stability.

This study sort to identify and assess the patterns of land degradation indicators in selected districts of western Kenya. The study employed the use of Land Degradation Sampling Framework (LDSF) to characterize the sites. \{LDSF\} a spatially stratified, random sampling design framework consisting of 10 km × 10 km blocks and clusters of plots. The study broadly identified and classified the indicators and attributes of land degradation into soil and site stability, hydrologic function and biotic integrity. Assessment of general vegetation structure showed that over 70% of the land was under cropland with forests accounting for 8% of the area. Sheet erosion was the major form of soil loss. High variability was observed for the soil properties and this can be due to both inherent soil characteristics as well as land management practices. There was distinct variation in the soil properties between the topsoil (0–20 cm) and the subsoil (20–30 cm) with the topsoil having higher values for most of the parameters compared to the subsoil. Using coefficient of variation (CV) as criteria for expressing variability, Ca, TON, Mg, \{SOC\} and silt were most variable soil properties for the 0–20 cm depth. Moderate variability (CV 0.15–0.35) was observed for CEC, P, K and clay while Na, Sand and pH had the least variability (CV &lt; 0.15). For the subsoil (20–30 cm), Ca, Mg and silt were the most variable. About 94% of the farms sampled were recorded to have very strongly acidic soil levels (pH 4.5–5.5) while 6% of the farms had moderately acidic soil levels (pH 5.6–6.0). Over 55% of the farms had low (&lt; 2%) total organic carbon levels and this varied with land use. Soils with \{SOM\} below this ‘critical level’ are at a threat of degradation if not well managed. The principal component analysis (PCA) identified three main explanatory factors for soil variability: ‘soil fertility potential’, ‘soil physical properties’ and ‘available P’. Improving productivity of land therefore calls for the adoption of integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) options as a strategy to ensuring nutrient availability while at the same time building the natural nutrient reserve through soil organic matter build up.

Despite the wide recognition of the importance of these services, drivers of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics across various land uses in East Africa are poorly understood. The objectives of this study were threefold: to quantify \{SOC\} stocks across Tanzania; assess the effect of land cover and erosion on SOC; and investigate the relationship between inherent and dynamic soil properties under diverse land uses. The Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF) was used to assess the variability of ecological metrics at different spatial scales. \{SOC\} was quantified within and between different land cover types (forest, woodland, shrubland, grassland and cropland) in Tanzania. A total of 2052 soil samples from 1082–1000 m2 plots were collected from seven 100-km2 sentinel sites in 2010. Composite soil samples were collected at each plot from two depths (0–20 and 20–50 cm) and cumulative soil mass samples were collected to 100 cm. Soil samples were analyzed using a combination of traditional analytical laboratory methods and mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR). Model performance of \{MIR\} spectral predictions for carbon was good, with an \{R2\} of &gt; 0.95 and \{RMSEP\} of 4.3 g kg− 1, when using an independent validation datasets. Woodland and cropland were the most frequently occurring vegetation structure types in the sampled sites, with 388 and 246 plots, respectively. Average topsoil \{OC\} (and range) was 12.4 (1.5–81.4) g C kg− 1 (n = 1082) and average subsoil \{OC\} (and range) was 7.3 (0.64–53.8) g C kg− 1 (n = 970) for the seven sites. Forested plots had the highest mean topsoil organic carbon concentrations (17.3 g C kg− 1) followed by cropland (13.3 g C kg− 1), for all sites included in the study, but with high levels of variability between sites. Soil mass at 30 cm was measured and these data were used to calculate carbon stocks for the different land cover types. An approach based on remote sensing was explored for the mapping of \{SOC\} stocks at 30 cm for Tanzania using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery from 2012. Results indicate that the use of image reflectance for the mapping of \{SOC\} stocks has promising potential, with \{R2\} values ranging from 0.77 to 0.81 and \{RMSEP\} values from 0.90 to 1.03 kg m− 2 for the three validation datasets. There is high utility of these maps for strategic land management interventions that prioritize ecosystem services. "

We analyze cocoa's vulnerability to climate change in the West African cocoa belt, based on climate projections for the 2050s of 19 Global Circulation Models under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change intermediate emissions scenario \{RCP\} 6.0. We use a combination of a statistical model of climatic suitability (Maxent) and the analysis of individual, potentially limiting climate variables. We find that: 1) contrary to expectation, maximum dry season temperatures are projected to become as or more limiting for cocoa as dry season water availability; 2) to reduce the vulnerability of cocoa to excessive dry season temperatures, the systematic use of adaptation strategies like shade trees in cocoa farms will be necessary, in reversal of the current trend of shade reduction; 3) there is a strong differentiation of climate vulnerability within the cocoa belt, with the most vulnerable areas near the forest-savanna transition in Nigeria and eastern Côte d'Ivoire, and the least vulnerable areas in the southern parts of Cameroon, Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire and Liberia; 4) this spatial differentiation of climate vulnerability may lead to future shifts in cocoa production within the region, with the opportunity of partially compensating losses and gains, but also the risk of local production expansion leading to new deforestation. We conclude that adaptation strategies for cocoa in West Africa need to focus at several levels, from the consideration of tolerance to high temperatures in cocoa breeding programs, the promotion of shade trees in cocoa farms, to policies incentivizing the intensification of cocoa production on existing farms where future climate conditions permit and the establishment of new farms in already deforested areas.

All tested plants were infected by a mix of viruses that induced distinct \{LS\} in ‘Secundina’. Out of the three newly described viruses, a member of family Secoviridae could experimentally induce \{LS\} in single infection.

The original version of the EcoCrop model predicts crop suitability based on monthly temperature and precipitation, without taking into account soil constraints. Recently, continuous soil property maps of Tanzania were produced (Vagen et al, submitted) based on data from systematic surveys across sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of incorporating information on soil fertility constraints, such as low soil organic carbon content (SOC) into the EcoCrop model. Crop suitability maps derived with and without consideration of low \{SOC\} were compared. \{SOC\} values were extracted for 1036 locations of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) presence and the 2-percentile (0.9% SOC) was taken as a lower limit for suitability. The EcoCrop model was then run with current climate data, with and without \{SOC\} as a limiting factor, to create suitability maps. An independent spatial point dataset of registered bean presence/absence (n=1113), and regional production statistics were used for validation. The agreement between bean presence and bean suitability was higher (Cohen's unweighted kappa=0.06) when low \{SOC\} was included in the model compared to when only climate was considered (kappa=0.02). The regional statistics showed that the proportion of the area where low \{SOC\} restricted the suitability was negatively correlated with the proportion of the area planted with beans (r =-0.42, p=0.07). In summary, we identified a lower limit of \{SOC\} for the soil to be suitable for common beans production and investigated the importance of taking this soil fertility constraint into account for accurate suitability modelling. It was concluded that for more accurate suitability modelling, e.g. for decision support for adaptation to climate change, low \{SOC\} should be considered as a constraining factor. "

We used data constituting over 2700 data points from 126 farm fields of 25 different studies conducted from 1996 to 2009. Potassium (K) deficiency is negligible in western Kenya while ommission of P and N result in a 50% and 43% reduction in yield, respectively, relative to a full \{NPK\} treatment. In poor fields (low control yields) \{PAE\} was low in the absence of fertilizer N. Overall, lack of N application decreased \{PAE\} from 29 to 19 kg grain kg−1 P. Boundary analysis indicate that maximum yields are reached at about 50 kg P ha−1. Using a marginal rate of return of 100%, maximum P application rate for western Kenya should be 38 kg P ha−1. Without chemical N fertilizer application, organic resources increased \{PAE\} by 60–100% compared to continuous maize system without organic resources. Maximum \{PAE\} decreased at increased plant-available soil P and soil coarsiness. Our analysis represents best management practices and \{PAE\} may be lower than the reported values under farmer's conditions. "

Firstly, adoption of SOC-sequestration measures will take time, and reasonably such schemes could only be implemented gradually at large-scale. Secondly, if soils are managed as carbon sinks, then \{SOC\} will increase only over a limited time, up to the point when a new \{SOC\} equilibrium is reached. This paper combines these two processes and predicts potential \{SOC\} sequestration dynamics in agricultural land at global scale and the corresponding \{CC\} mitigation potential. Assuming that global governments would agree on a worldwide effort to gradually change land use practices towards turning agricultural soils into carbon sinks starting 2014, the projected 87-year (2014–2100) global \{SOC\} sequestration potential of agricultural land ranged between 31 and 64 Gt. This is equal to 1.9–3.9% of the SRES-A2 projected 87-year anthropogenic emissions. \{SOC\} sequestration would peak 2032–33, at that time reaching 4.3–8.9% of the projected annual SRES-A2 emission. About 30 years later the sequestration rate would have reduced by half. Thus, \{SOC\} sequestration is not a C wedge that could contribute increasingly to mitigating CC. Rather, the mitigation potential is limited, contributing very little to solving the climate problem of the coming decades. However, we deliberately did not elaborate on the importance of maintaining or increasing \{SOC\} for sustaining soil health, agro-ecosystem functioning and productivity; an issue of global significance that deserves proper consideration irrespectively of any potential additional sequestration of SOC.

Potential benefits of combining genomic tools with traditional breeding have been a source of widespread interest and resulted in numerous efforts to achieve the desired synergy among disciplines. The International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) is applying functional genomics by focusing on characterizing genetic diversity for crop improvement in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), tropical grasses, and upland rice (Oriza sativa L.). This article reviews how \{CIAT\} combines genomic approaches, plant breeding, and physiology to understand and exploit underlying genetic mechanisms of abiotic stress adaptation for crop improvement. The overall \{CIAT\} strategy combines both bottom-up (gene to phenotype) and top-down (phenotype to gene) approaches by using gene pools as sources for breeding tools. The strategy offers broad benefits by combining not only in-house crop knowledge, but publicly available knowledge from well-studied model plants such as arabidopsis [Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.]. Successfully applying functional genomics in trait gene discovery requires diverse genetic resources, crop phenotyping, genomics tools integrated with bioinformatics and proof of gene function in planta (proof of concept). In applying genomic approaches to crop improvement, two major gaps remain. The first gap lies in understanding the desired phenotypic trait of crops in the field and enhancing that knowledge through genomics. The second gap concerns mechanisms for applying genomic information to obtain improved crop phenotypes. A further challenge is to effectively combine different genomic approaches, integrating information to maximize crop improvement efforts. Research at \{CIAT\} on drought tolerance in common bean and aluminum resistance in tropical forage grasses (Brachiaria spp.) is used to illustrate the opportunities and constraints in breeding for adaptation to abiotic stresses.

This is an imperative if countries are to respond to the \{COP21\} agreement and meet their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs). The CSA-RA is designed to assess biophysical including climatic, socio-cultural, economic and technological characteristics at the household, farm and community/regional level. The CSA-RA employs gender-disaggregated methods, including gender differences in perceptions of climate change and its impacts. The CSA-RA combines common participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and rapid rural appraisal (RRA) tools into one methodology, that disaggregates the gender dimension, and includes resource mapping; climate calendars; historical calendars; cropping calendars; organization mapping; transect walks; key informant interviews; farmer interviews; and pairwise ranking matrix. The tool collects qualitative and quantitative data from various stakeholders (farmers, local leaders, researchers, local-level agricultural experts, private sector actors, donor organizations, and policy implementers), allowing expansive analysis, triangulation and validation. Application of the CSA-RA in Tanzania and Uganda reveals heterogeneity across the sites in terms of vulnerability, constraints and \{CSA\} priorities among different social groups (gender) and agro-ecological zones. Thus, the CSA-RA allows stakeholders to simultaneously take into account biophysical and socio-economic aspects to target and implement CSA. "

A case study of a new rice variety in Nepal shows that in the initial stage of diffusion large farmers are more able to absorb the risk of evaluating the biological potential of the new technology. In the take-off stage of diffusion, when adopters move to full-scale production with the new technology, it is evaluated for its management characteristics and small farmers may emerge as the greater adopters. This paper suggests that rapid adoption of new technology by small farmers requires, firstly, decentralization of biological screening to small-scale site-specific trials with farmers and secondly, a focus of extension efforts on the evaluation of full-scale management requirements with the participation of small farmers.

Because charcoal production diverts scarce dry-season labor from land clearing for agriculture, deforestation by pioneer farmers may be slower. The model predicts that after 10 years, a representative pioneer farmer who produces charcoal would earn 17% higher net income and clear 17% less forested area. A sensitivity analysis predicts that any additional labor would be chiefly devoted to charcoal production, reinforcing the conservation effect. "

The crosses and parents were evaluated in replicated trials for two years. The results indicated that both additive and non-additive gene action play a role in conditioning grain Fe and Zn concentration in sorghum. However, non-additive gene action is predominant in conditioning grain Fe; and additive gene action in conditioning grain Zn. Some of the crosses showed significant heterosis for grain Fe concentration without yield penalty and some crosses showed targeted grain Zn concentration (40 mg kg−1) coupled with higher grain yields. The results also showed that it is possible to improve grain Fe concentration through exploiting heterosis, but there would be little opportunity if any for improving grain Zn through heterosis breeding. To develop hybrids with high grain Fe and Zn concentration in sorghum both parents needs to be improved for these micronutrients. Combining higher grain Fe and Zn with high yield is feasible. "

This paper challenges five predominant myths about seed aid: (1) seed aid is needed whenever food aid is; (2) seed aid can do no harm; (3) disasters wipe out seed systems; (4) effective implementation is a straightforward logistical exercise, and; (5) improved seed is the best form of aid. These myths are juxtaposed with recent empirical work across a range of countries, particularly in Eastern and Southern Africa. The perpetuation of such myths highlights a serious absence of scrutiny of emergency seed aid, and helps explain why such aid is repeated year after year in many sites, with little apparent positive effect. The paper argues that the invisibility of seed aid is a major cause for the lack of oversight and concludes that donors and farmer beneficiaries must become centrally involved in seed aid governance.

In this study we used cluster analysis to group technologies and ordered probit to determine the probability of multiple technology adoption. The result show that usage of \{ISFM\} in the Chinyanja Triangle (Southern Africa) is grouped into 3 technological sets based on complementarities. The set of nutrient dense technologies of inorganic fertiliser, compost and animal manure (ISFMset3) indicates that they are used by farmers who face similar opportunities of having land that require minimal input, sell produce at farm gate as opposed to market, have more transport and communication facilities, and recover from livestock loss. Loss of crops, however, deter adoption of this set. The technological set comprising of fallow, rotation and grain legumes (ISFMset2) which enhances biomass accumulation and nitrogen fixation with complementary effects in cereal dominated farming system, is more likely adopted by households with land that require more inputs, are more educated, own more bicycles and have higher financial capital. Other four technologies (ISFMset1 including mulch, lime, compost and agroforestry) are used by a few individuals to address specific constraints in nutrient and water retention, and acidity. The result also indicated variations in usage of \{ISFMset3\} between sites. These results are instrumental in identifying factors that influence adoption of a set of \{ISFM\} technologies in the Chinyanja Triangle and could be of use in targeting research and development initiatives.

Understanding which farming options will give the highest return on investment in light of climate change is critical information for decision-making. While there is continued investment in testing adaptation options using on-farm experiments, simulation models remain important tools for ‘ex-ante’ assessments of the impacts of proposed climate-smart agricultural technologies (CSA). This study used the Ruminant model and the Trade-offs Analysis model for Multi-Dimensional Impact Assessment (TOA-MD) to assess how improved livestock management options affect the three pillars of CSA: increased productivity, improved food security, and reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our sample was stratified into: 1) households with local cow breeds (n = 28); 2) households with improved dairy cow breeds (n = 70); and 3) households without dairy cows (n = 66). Results showed that the predicted adoption rates for improved livestock feeding among households with improved dairy cows (stratum 2) were likely to be higher compared to households with only local cows (stratum 1). Both households with local cows and those with improved cows had increased income and food security. However, overall poverty reduction was only modest for households with local cows. Expected methane emissions intensity declined with adoption of improved livestock feeding strategies both in stratum 1 and stratum 2, and greater impacts were observed when households in stratum 2 received an additional improved cow breed. Providing a cow to households that were not keeping cows showed substantial economic gains. Additional research is, however, needed to understand why those farms currently do not have cows, which may determine if the predicted adoption rates are feasible. "

The initial \{BGMV\} epidemics observed in Brazil in the early 1970s were associated with large populations of the whitefly vector Bemisia tabaci, caused by the increasing planting of soybean, a suitable reproductive host of this whitefly species in Brazil. The characteristic systemic yellowing induced by \{BGMV\} was simultaneously observed throughout Central America and the Caribbean region, but the causal virus was later shown to be a distinct species currently known as Bean golden yellow mosaic virus. Golden mosaic-like symptoms observed in the 1970s in northwestern Mexico are caused by unrelated whitefly-transmitted viruses originally detected in cucurbits in southwestern USA, namely squash leaf curl virus and its legume variant bean calico mosaic virus. \{BGMV\} and bean golden yellow mosaic virus (BGYMV) are bipartite, single-stranded \{DNA\} viruses transmitted in a semipersistent manner by different biotypes of the whitefly species B. tabaci. These viruses replicate in the nuclei of affected plant cells, causing a major disruption of physiological processes that usually leads to significant yield losses and plant death. Genetic resistance has been effectively deployed to manage these diseases, but an integrated disease management approach is needed to guarantee the sustainability of cropping systems threatened by these whitefly-borne viruses.

This article presents a micro-level simulation study that was undertaken for Northern Ghana, building on the approach and data developed within a research project of the \{CGIAR\} Challenge Programme on Water and Food. The study applied agent-based modelling to analyse how adaptation affects the distribution of household food security and poverty under current climate and price variability. Specifically, we examined the effectiveness of policy interventions related to the promotion of agricultural credit and off-farm employment opportunities. Our simulation experiments suggest that both climate and price variability have a pronounced negative effect on household welfare. Moreover, we found substantial difference in the poverty and food security status of households due to climate and price variability. Provision of agricultural credit and access to off-farm employment are found to be highly effective policy entry points that deserve more empirical research. "

A methodology was developed for assessing water availability and use under different development pathways at a watershed scale to determine whether water security is a potential problem, and if so, under what conditions it is likely to occur. This methodology makes use of a GIS-based spatial water budget model for simulating stream water availability, water use and stream flow control on a daily basis at a watershed scale. Here, we analysed water availability under three plausible development scenarios for the 3246 ha Cabuyal River watershed in southwest Colombia in the year 2025: Corporate Farming (CF), Ecological Watershed (EW), and Business as Usual (BU). Simulated average river flows at the watershed outlet were, respectively, 874, 796 and 925 l s−1 for the CF, \{EW\} and \{BU\} scenarios. The contribution of base flow to river flow (base flow index) was on average, 80.8, 85.6 and 77.9%, respectively, for the three scenarios. The watershed had the potential to meet the anticipated increase in water use under each explorative scenario. However, dams were necessary to store irrigation water in the \{CF\} scenario, otherwise over 60% of the available water would have been used during the dry season. Such a high figure raises concerns about effects on aquatic and riparian ecology, concentrations of potential contaminants, water reserves for especially low rainfall years, and the watershed resilience to meet temporarily higher water needs during the day. Analyses indicated that current water-use conflicts in the watershed can be resolved if irrigation water supply is separated from drinking water supply. This study helped reduce some of the complexity associated with the interdependencies between land and water resources, the impact of using them, and spatial linkages within the watershed. Results of this study can be used for teaching local stakeholders about basic landscape responses and helping multi-institutional alliances to become proactive and to guide development to the benefit of local communities.

A total of 486 microsatellite primers were evaluated using bulked segregant analysis (BSA), 11 showed polymorphism between the contrasting pools and only one showed significant differences between resistant and susceptible individuals. In conclusion, fecundity was the parameter that impacted most on the intrinsic rate of A. socialis population growth. "

abstract = "Prices of most of agricultural commodities show a long-term declining trend. Increasingly markets are signaling demand for differentiated products and in order to increase their incomes farmers and traders are looking to higher value options, including differentiated products. Product differentiation occurs when a product offering is perceived by the consumer to differ from its competition on any physical or non-physical characteristic including price. The differentiation can be based both on perceptual differences and also on actual product differences, based on measurable characteristics. The information requirements for supply chain management of differentiated high value products are much more stringent than for traditional agricultural commodities requiring a two-way information flow from the producer to the customer. The conceptual base for information systems to support supply chain management of differentiated products is described in this paper. An Internet-based coffee information system (CINFO), illustrates how these principles can be applied to the case of specialty coffee. \{CINFO\} provides farmers information on where and how to produce coffee with particular features, whilst at the same time providing traders with information on the availability of products with particular traits. Furthermore, \{CINFO\} traces individual product batches indicating where and how they were produced, processed and distributed to the end consumer so as to facilitate identity preservation, which is the key to obtaining added value from differentiation.

Roots from a total of 149 accessions from the germplasm collection at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) were analyzed for total crude protein content. For 140 clones the evaluations were based on two different root samples and independent quantifications. Results from eight clones were based on three samples, and only for one clone had four different estimations been made. Large differences in protein content (ranging from 0.95% to 6.42%) were observed in the sample analyzed.

However, mycelial transformation consistently generated a significantly higher number of transformants than did conidial transformation. The mitotic stability of the transferred \{DNA\} was confirmed by growing ten transformants in liquid and agar media for six generations. In all cases, resistance to the selection pressure (hygromycin B) was maintained.

The short shelf life of harvested roots results in large losses and high transport and marketing costs. Recent reports on positive genetic variation for tolerance to \{PPD\} will facilitate breeding for extended shelf life of the roots and a better understanding of the biochemical and genetic events leading to PPD. However, \{PPD\} scoring is difficult and prone to large experimental errors. It is often the case that roots from the same plant can have 0 and 100% \{PPD\} score due to injuries during the harvest process, variation in dry matter content and, most likely, other variables yet to be identified. Therefore, sampling a root for biochemical or genetic studies and measuring \{PPD\} in a different root, is not a reliable approach. A device has been developed and tested for the possibility of extracting a core of root parenchyma, filling the space with melted paraffin (to reduce oxygen availability), and then one or two weeks later visually quantifying \{PPD\} in the same root. Sampling the roots did not have any significant effect on \{PPD\} suggesting that the protocol can be used for biochemical composition and gene expression studies related to the causes of \{PPD\} and the possibilities of developing tolerance to it.

Building upon this idea, we sought to understand the impacts of agricultural management on ant communities in the Orinoco River Basin of eastern Colombia and to identify species that could be used as indicators of soil-based ecosystem services. Ants were collected and identified from the soil and litter layer within 75 fields (nine \{TSBF\} sub-samples along a transect in each field) divided among five common agricultural land uses in the region: 1) annual crops (maize, soy and rice), 2) rubber plantations, 3) oil palm plantations, 4) improved pastures (based on Brachiaria spp.), and 5) semi-natural savannas. As expected, land management was found to greatly influence ant communities. Improved pastures showed the highest species richness (6.9 species per transect) and semi-natural savanna the greatest abundance of ants (145 individuals per transect). Within each of these fields a suite of soil and agroecosystem characteristics were measured and combined into synthetic indicators of five soil-based ecosystem services: 1) nutrient provision, 2) water storage and regulation, 3) maintenance of soil structure, 4) climate regulation services and 5) soil biodiversity and biological activity. Ant species were then associated with these synthetic indicators using the IndVal method to identify indicator species for each of the five consolidated ecosystem services measured. In total, 14 indicator species were identified and found to be significantly associated with either the high or low provision of each of the five services. The development of such bioindicators offers a rapid and relatively inexpensive tool to facilitate land management and policy decisions in this biologically diverse and rapidly changing region of Colombia.

Few investigations have focused on wild Manihot species, and the phylogeny of the genus is still unclear. In this study the \{DNA\} sequence variation from two chloroplast regions, the nuclear \{DNA\} gene \{G3pdh\} and two nuclear sequences derived from the 3′-end of two cassava ESTs, were used in order to infer the phylogenetic relationships among a subset of wild Manihot species, including two species from Cnidoscolus as out-groups. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses were conducted for each data set and for a combined matrix due to the low variation of each region when analyzed independently. A penalized likelihood analysis of the chloroplast region trnL–trnF, calibrated with various age estimates for genera in the Euphorbiaceae extracted from the literature was used to determine the ages of origin and diversification of the genus. The two Mesoamerican species sampled form a well-defined clade. The South American species can be grouped into clades of varying size, but the relationships amongst them cannot be established with the data available. The age of the crown node of Manihot was estimated at 6.6 million years ago. Manihot esculenta varieties do not form a monophyletic group that is consistent with the possibility of multiple introgressions of genes from other wild species. The low levels of variation observed in the \{DNA\} regions sampled suggest a recent and explosive diversification of the genus, which is confirmed by our age estimates. "

We assessed the expression of the hsp23, 40, 70 and 90 genes at the mRNA level when submitted to heat shocks of 40 and 44 °C/1 h (control at 25 °C). For this, we evaluated a set of available and suitable reference genes in order to perform data normalization using the real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) technique, and then confirmed the production of \{HSP70\} protein based on Western blot. Results were compared with the hardening capacity of B. tabaci, measured by fitness components as a response to heat shocks, using 40 °C as the induction temperature. Three of the four genes (hsp23, 70 and 90) were upregulated by heat stress at mRNA, showing differential expression patterns. Hsp70 expression was confirmed at the protein level. Hardening significantly increased fitness following heat stress, suggesting that \{HSPs\} may contribute to hardening capacity in B. tabaci. Potential role of each gene in the heat-shock response for whiteflies is discussed. "

Demand studies for orientating agricultural research show conceptual symmetry with production studies but their inclusion allows for better judgement on the potential of alternative research ventures and for improved targeting of agricultural research objectives, such as equity, rural income and price stability. Demand analysis should be consistent with the state of maturity of the commodity research program. Demand studies can be organized around the themes of research strategies, technology design and technology transfer. This is afterwards illustrated with the approaches taken by CIAT's cassava and bean program, showing that the exact subjects of study are rather commodity specific. "

However, quantitative production figures are necessary to provide coffee stakeholders and policy makers with evidence to justify immediate action. Using data from the northern Tanzanian highlands, we demonstrate for the first time that increasing night time (Tmin) temperature is the most significant climatic variable responsible for diminishing C. arabica yields between 1961 and 2012. Projecting this forward, every 1 °C rise in Tmin will result in annual yield losses of 137 ± 16.87 kg ha−1 (P = 1.80e-10). According to our \{ARIMA\} model, average coffee production will drop to 145 ± 41 kg ha−1 (P = 8.45e-09) by 2060. Consequently, without adequate adaptation strategies and/or substantial external inputs, coffee production will be severely reduced in the Tanzanian highlands in the near future. Attention should also be drawn to the arabica growing regions of Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ethiopia and Kenya, as substantiated time series evidence shows these areas have followed strikingly similar minimum temperature trends. This is the first study on coffee, globally, providing essential time series evidence that climate change has already had a negative impact on C. arabica yields. "

Agriculture is a climate-dependent activity and hence is highly sensitive to climatic changes and climate variability. Nevertheless, there is a knowledge gap when agricultural researchers intend to assess the production of minor crops for which data or models are not available. Therefore, we integrated the current expert knowledge reported in the FAO-EcoCrop database, with the basic mechanistic model (also named EcoCrop), originally developed by Hijmans et al. (2001). We further developed the model, providing calibration and evaluation procedures. To that aim, we used sorghum (Sorghum bicolor Moench) as a case study and both calibrated EcoCrop for the sorghum crop and analyzed the impacts of the SRES-A1B 2030s climate on sorghum climatic suitability. The model performed well, with a high true positive rate (TPR) and a low false negative rate (FNR) under present conditions when assessed against national and subnational agricultural statistics (min \{TPR\} = 0.967, max \{FNR\} = 0.026). The model predicted high sorghum climatic suitability in areas where it grows optimally and matched the sorghum geographic distribution fairly well. Negative impacts were predicted by 2030s. Vulnerabilities in countries where sorghum cultivation is already marginal are likely (with a high degree of certainty): the western Sahel region, southern Africa, northern India, and the western coast of India are particularly vulnerable. We highlight the considerable opportunity of using EcoCrop to assess global food security issues, broad climatic constraints and regional crop-suitability shifts in the context of climate change and the possibility of coupling it with other large-area approaches.

These aspects are discussed in this review. In general terms, it has been found that root and tuber crops are sensitive to soil compaction, inadequate aeration or poor drainage and therefore respond favorably to intensive tillage, followed by ridging or mounding. However, large differences exist between crops, with potato, sweet potato and yam requiring more intensive cultivation than cassava and taro. On light-textured soils, cassava can be grown without or with minimum tillage as long as weeds are controlled; in heavy or compacted soil cassava responds favorably to tillage and yields tend to increase when grown on ridges. In order to reduce erosion as well as production costs, cassava should be grown with as little tillage as possible as long as high yield can be maintained. Contour ridging and mulching are other practices that not only tend to increase yields but also reduce erosion losses. Organized data for use in a classification of the tillage requirements of different soils for the various root crops is lacking. We suggest that research efforts should be directed towards the characterization of the physico-chemical and biological factors which determine the tillage requirements of a given soil for a given root crop.

abstract = "Farmer organization and collective action are often seen as key factors in enhancing farmers’ access to markets. Often, too little attention is directed at (a) the most appropriate types of organization; (b) whether organization makes less or more sense in the case of producers of an undifferentiated commodity or a higher value product; (c) whether the public or private sector is best placed to support farmer organizations; and (d) the conditions necessary for ensuring their economic viability. Research in Mexico and Central America explored these issues for commodity maize and high value vegetables, respectively. The benefits of farmer organization are more evident in the vegetable sector, characterized by high transaction costs associated with market access. However, horticultural farmer organizations in Honduras and El Salvador include less than 5% of total horticultural producers. This is possibly due to farmer organizations’ limited business skills and non-replicable organizational models. There is less incentive for maize farmers to organize to access output markets as the transaction costs are relatively low. The benefits of maize farmer organization are clearer when it comes to accessing inputs such as credit, seed and fertilizer. Farmer organization is a critical factor in making markets work for the poor, but the role and timing of public and private investment in these organizations is poorly understood. "

The participatory process used is shown to have considerable potential in facilitating farmer consensus about which soil-related constraints should be tackled first. Consensus building is presented as an important step prior to collective action by farming communities in integrated soil management at the landscape scale. Taking advantage of the complementary nature of local and scientific knowledge is highlighted as an overall strategy for sustainable soil management. "

The three methodologies are described, and the resultant experimental designs are compared in terms of their criteria for testing fertilizers under small farm conditions. The results show that increased scope for farmer participation produced significant changes in the design of on-farm trials due to important insights into how farmers themselves would evaluate fertilizers, and raised basic research questions about improvements in the technology.

This paper examines the regionalized incomes derived from milk production by relating dry season length to milk production parameters for dairy farms. Cattle farms were assessed using two samples. Milk production in the dry and wet seasons was characterized by monthly net income from milk per cow. Sample A (97 farms) was classified according to a) herd size classes and b) performance in dry season milk production. Sample B (30 farms) assessed advanced farms that used more forage technologies than the others. The income from milk was related to environmental conditions by means of a countrywide map based on dry season length. The map was created by estimating the water balance for each month in a GIS. Yearly income from milk/cow was regionalized for the farm classifications and combined with agricultural census data. Results of the \{GIS\} analysis show a detailed zoning of dry season length and yearly income per cow from milk. Climate-income maps quantify the income ranges of the examined groups of farms. Climate change models predict temperature rise and decreasing precipitation for Honduras. In view of these trends the results can be used for an interpretation of farm vulnerability and resilience to climate change. "

However, information about their impact on soil is scanty and investigations focusing exclusively on baseline data on C. odorata fallows in humid savannahs are still lacking. This study was designed to assess changes in soil physical, chemical and biological properties after the establishment of C. odorata fallows in humid savannahs of Ivory Coast. Sampling sites were selected such that a portion of C. odorata fallow was located next to the shrub savannah, the most common natural ecosystem in the area. Results revealed a rise of soil organic carbon (+ 27.9%), total nitrogen (+ 36.7%), total phosphorus (+ 56.8%), extractable calcium (+ 68.3) and magnesium (+ 140.3%) in the first 10 cm of soil beneath the C. odorata fallow relative to the savannah. Furthermore, the fallow was associated with high N-mineral pool as N-NO3− and N-NH4+ content increased at + 72.5% and + 71.5%, respectively. The infiltration capacity of water under C. odorata-based fallow was markedly high and soil macroinvertebrates, mainly earthworms, showed significant increases in density and biomass. The large quantity of good quality standing biomass produced by C. odorata is likely the main factor controlling the improvement of soil quality. The results suggest that there are merits for the integration of C. odorata fallow in a cropping system for sustainable food production in the buffer zone of Lamto Reserve. This can also help to reduce pressure on forest islands. "

The objective of this research is to guide crop improvement efforts by prioritizing areas of high poverty, the key problem of high drought risk and the crops grown and consumed in these areas. Global spatial data on crop production, climate and poverty (as proxied by child stunting) were used to identify geographic areas of high priority for crop improvement. The analysis employed spatial overlay, drought modelling and descriptive statistics to identify where best to target technology generation to achieve its intended human welfare goals. Analysis showed that drought coincides with high levels of poverty in 15 major farming systems, especially in South Asia, the Sahel and eastern and southern Africa, where high diversity in drought frequency characterizes the environments. Thirteen crops make up the bulk of food production in these areas. A database was developed for use in agricultural research and development targeting and priority setting to raise the productivity of crops on which the poor in marginal environments depend. "

However, their contribution to tropical soil quality and crop performance, as well as relations with agricultural management (e.g., Conservation Agriculture), are not well understood. This study aimed to quantify soil macrofauna and its impact on soil aggregation, soil carbon and crop yields in a maize–soybean system under tropical sub-humid conditions. A field trial was established in Western Kenya in 2003 with tillage and residue retention as independent factors. A macrofauna exclusion experiment was superimposed in 2005 through regular insecticide applications, and measurements were taken from 2005 to 2012. Termites were the most abundant macrofauna group comprising 61% of total macrofauna numbers followed by ants (20%), while few earthworms were present (5%). Insecticide application significantly reduced termites (by 86 and 62%) and earthworms (by 100 and 88%) at 0–15 and 15–30 cm soil depth respectively. Termite diversity was low, with all species belonging to the family of Macrotermitinae which feed on wood, leaf litter and dead/dry grass. Seven years of macrofauna exclusion did not affect soil aggregation or carbon contents, which might be explained by the low residue retention and the nesting and feeding behavior of the dominant termites present. Macrofauna exclusion resulted in 34% higher maize grain yield and 22% higher soybean grain yield, indicating that pest damage – probably including termites – overruled any potentially beneficial impact of soil macrofauna. Results contrast with previous studies on the effects of termites on plant growth, which were mostly conducted in (semi-) arid regions. Future research should contribute to sustainable management strategies that reduce detrimental impact due to dominance of potential pest species while conserving soil macrofauna diversity and their beneficial functions in agroecosystems.

A comprehensive literature review on nutrient balances in Africa was carried out to illustrate the main approaches, challenges, and progress, with emphasis on issues of scale. The review showed nutrient balances being widely used across the continent. The collected dataset from 57 peer-reviewed studies indicated, however, that most of the balances were calculated at plot and farm scale, and generated in East Africa. Data confirmed the expected trend of negative balances in the continent for nitrogen and potassium, where &gt;75% of selected studies had mean values below zero. For phosphorus only 56% of studies showed negative mean balances. Several cases with positive nutrient balances indicated that soil nutrient mining cannot be generalized across the continent. Land use systems of wealthier farmers mostly presented higher nitrogen and phosphorus balances than systems of poorer farmers (p &lt; 0.001). Plots located close to homesteads also usually presented higher balances than plots located relatively farther away (p &lt; 0.05). Partial nutrient balances were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) than full balances calculated for the same systems, but the later carried more uncertainties. The change in magnitude of nutrient balances from plot to continental level did not show any noticeable trend, which challenges prevailing assumptions that an increasing trend exists. However, methodological differences made a proper inter-scale comparison of results difficult. Actually, the review illustrated the high diversity of methods used to calculate nutrient balances and highlighted the main pit-falls, especially when nutrient flows and balances were scaled-up. Major generic problems were the arbitrary inclusion/exclusion of flows from the calculations, short evaluation periods, and difficulties on setting of spatial-temporal boundaries, inclusion of lateral flows, and linking the balances to soil nutrient stocks. The need for properly describing the methods used and reporting the estimates (i.e. appropriate units and measure of variability and error) were also highlighted. Main challenges during scaling-up were related to the type of aggregation and internalization of nutrient flows, as well as issues of non-linearity, and spatial variability, resolution and extent, which have not been properly addressed yet. In fact, gathered information showed that despite some few initiatives, scaling-up methods are still incipient. Lastly, promising technologies and recommendations to deal with these challenges were presented to assist in future research on nutrient balances at different spatial scales in Africa and worldwide.

Best silage qualities were achieved with high \{DM\} Clitoria ternatea (542 g/kg FM), while worst silages resulted from Centrosema brasilianum (259 g DM/kg FM), especially without sugar addition. In general, both additives increased lactic acid production while dropping the pH (P&lt;0.001). High acidification was also correlated with restricted NH3-N formation (14 to 68 g/kg of total N in the combined treatment). Butyric acid concentrations ranged from 0 to 18 g/kg \{DM\} except for C. brasilianum silages (30 g/kg \{DM\} in Control, 25 g/kg \{DM\} in L. plantarum only treatment). No clear effect of treatment could be observed for this parameter. The fermentability coefficient predicted quite well the silage quality for a couple of materials, but not consistently overall. As nitrate was scarce in all plant materials (&lt;2.1 g/kg DM), some clostridial activity was probably favored. Acetic acid concentrations were very low (acetic + propionic acid 0 to 18 g/kg DM) except for Vigna unguiculata silages (22 to 53 g/kg DM). All silages were regarded as aerobically stable during the 4-d period of temperature measurement, except for the Lablab purpureus silages treated with the combined additive. Further research is needed on suitable native lactic acid bacteria strains for tropical forage silages to select the most suitable inoculants for differing forage species and conditions, for improving silage quality. Legume silages in particular can provide a valuable source of protein for improved animal production, which represents a livelihood of many smallholders in the tropical belt. "

Water quality, quantity and seasonal flow have thus also become environmental services with potential monetary value. Yet, currently the region's pioneer \{PES\} schemes are not paying for measured environmental services, but for proxy land uses thought to provide the(se) service(s). Hydrological modeling makes explicit the tacit causal relationships and tests underlying assumptions. Ideally, when combined with an economic analysis of land-use alternatives, this could inform decision makers on how much to pay for different interventions in different spatial locations. This paper focuses on two Andean watersheds: Moyobamba (Peru) and Pimampiro (Ecuador). In the first case, a municipal water company is preparing a payment for environmental services (PES) scheme to reduce upstream sediment loads. In the second, a similar conservation-oriented municipal \{PES\} scheme has operated since 2000, but the hydrological linkages have never been tested. Applying the Soil &amp; Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), we identify in both watersheds biophysically critical areas for service delivery, and compare services for current land uses with change scenarios: deforestation, reforestation, live barriers, and agroforestry. We then use the \{ECOSAUT\} optimization model to predict net economic benefits for service providers. In Moyobamba, switching to shade-grown coffee would halve sediment yields, and increase significantly farmers’ economic benefits. This requires high up-front investment, but the willingness to pay of water users in Moyobamba town may suffice to cover the upfront costs. In Pimampiro, resumed deforestation would increase sediments by &gt;50% and reduce dry-season flow by 0.5%, thus reinforcing the rationale of the existing \{PES\} scheme, focused on conserving native forests and grasslands.

The study was carried out at two locations and data was analyzed with linear correlation, path coefficient and genotype × trait biplot analyses. Multiple trait data related to mechanisms of drought and bean fly tolerance were collected on 196 genotypes grown under i) water deficit at mid-pod fill, or ii) unprotected against bean fly; iii) irrigated, well watered conditions, or iv) bean fly protection with chemicals. Seed yield exhibited positive and significant correlations with leaf chlorophyll content, vertical root pulling resistance, pod harvest index, pods per plant and seeds per pod at both phenotypic and genotypic levels under stress and non-stress conditions. Genotypic correlations of traits with seed yield were greater than their respective phenotypic correlations across environments indicating the greater contribution of genotypic factors to the trait correlation. Pods per plant and seeds per pod had high positive direct effects on seed yield both under stress and non-stress whereas pods per plant had the highest indirect effect on seed yield through pod harvest index under stress. In general, our results suggest that vertical root pulling resistance and pod harvest index are important selection objectives for improving seed yield in common beans under non-stress and stress conditions, and particularly useful for drought and \{BSM\} tolerance evaluation.

In Sub-Saharan Africa and (to a lesser extent) in South Asia, limited data availability and institutional networking constrain agricultural research and development. Here we performed a review of relevant aspects in relation to coupling agriculture–climate predictions, and a three-step analysis of the importance of climate data for agricultural impact assessment. First, using meta-data from the scientific literature we examined trends in the use of climate and weather data in agricultural research, and we found that despite agricultural researchers’ preference for field-scale weather data (50.4% of cases in the assembled literature), large-scale datasets coupled with weather generators can be useful in the agricultural context. Using well-known interpolation techniques, we then assessed the sensitivities of the weather station network to the lack of data and found high sensitivities to data loss only over mountainous areas in Nepal and Ethiopia (random removal of data impacted precipitation estimates by ±1300 mm/year and temperature estimates by ±3 °C). Finally, we numerically compared \{IPCC\} Fourth Assessment Report (4AR) climate models’ representation of mean climates and interannual variability with different observational datasets. Climate models were found inadequate for field-scale agricultural studies in West Africa and South Asia, as their ability to represent mean climates and climate variability was limited: more than 50% of the country-model combinations showed &lt;50% adjustment for annual mean rainfall (mean climates), and there were large rainfall biases in \{GCM\} outputs (1000–2500 mm/year), although this varied on a \{GCM\} basis (climate variability). Temperature biases were also large for certain areas (5–10 °C in the Himalayas and Sahel). All this is expected to improve with IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report; hence, appropriate usage of even these new climate models is still required. This improved usage entails bias reduction (weighting of climate models or bias-correcting the climate change signals), the implementation of methods to match the spatial scales, and the quantification of uncertainties to the maximum extent possible.

Solar and sun drying were not significantly different in terms of provitamin A retention. The shape of the sweetpotato pieces (chip or crimped slice) influenced provitamin A retention during sun drying; crimped slices retained more provitamin A. Other minor provitamin A compounds in fresh sweetpotato included 13-cis- and 9-cis-β-carotene and β-carotene 5,6 epoxide. No significant increase in the cis-isomers was observed after drying. Vitamin A activity in flours was found to be greater than 1,500 \{RE\} (β-carotene:retinol; 13:1) per 100 g including in sun-dried samples. Flour from orange-fleshed sweetpotato therefore has potential as a significant source of provitamin A. "

Aside from seminal work in Brazil, Passiflora pest biology, ecology and management has received utterly little research attention. In this study, we determined the composition and seasonal dynamics of the Dipteran species complex associated with the three passionfruit crops (i.e., Passiflora edulis f. edulis Sims, P. edulis f. flavicarpa Degener and P. ligularis Juss.) in their principal production regions in Colombia. From 2008 to 2010, bait trapping and field-collection of Passiflora flowers, flower buds and (immature) fruit were carried out to characterize infestation levels by Diptera and associated natural enemies. A total of five Drosophila spp. and eight different species of Lonchaeidae were reported, with the latter representing members of the genera Neosilba and Dasiops. Contrary to the literature, no Tephritid fly adults emerged from &gt;15,000 samples. Although maximum Lonchaeid infestation was 100% in fruits of purple passionfruit and flower buds and flowers of sweet passionfruit, average infestation levels fluctuated between 1 and 15%. Fruits and flower buds with visual damage were up to ten times more likely to contain Lonchaeid larvae, providing the basis for effective sanitation practices. Seasonal Lonchaeid population fluctuations were damped, while abundance differed between geographical zones. Climate-based niche modeling further indicates that several Colombian valleys and mid-altitude mountain ranges provide suitable environments for the most abundant Dipteran, Dasiops inedulis Steyskal. The parasitoid community was composed of two species at particularly low parasitism levels (i.e., at 0.1–0.2%), with Lonchaeid larvae potentially benefiting from both physical and chemical refuges. Our work provides scientifically-based information regarding key herbivores of passionfruit crops, clarifies the susceptibility of Colombia-grown Passiflora spp. to quarantine fruit fly pests, and provides the basis for future integrated pest management (IPM) programs.

Consequently, the government has invested substantial resources in soil and water conservation (SWC). One of such interventions was exclosure, which was aimed restoring biodiversity, biomass and soil fertility. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of exclosures on soil fertility restoration and examine its variability across age, agro-ecology and landscape position. The study was conducted in the Gubalafto district of North Wello Zone, northern Ethiopian highlands. Vegetation cover was estimated and soil samples were collected from three age categories (open sites, 10- and 27-year-old exclosures), two agro-ecological zones (mild and cool) and in three landscape positions (lower, mid and upper). The samples were analyzed for selected soil physico-chemical properties using standard laboratory procedures. The results were statistically tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Vegetation ground and canopy cover increased with exclosure age. The soils of the exclosures showed significantly higher organic carbon (9 g/kg) and total nitrogen content (1.2 g/kg p ≤ 0.06 at α = 0.05) than the open sites. However, no statistical significant difference was observed between the 10- and 27-year-old exclosures, indicating that the restoration rate decreased with increasing exclosure age. This could be related to the low quantity and quality of the biomass, which influenced organic matter input and mineralization. Exclosures in the mild zone showed significantly higher soil fertility restoration than those in the cool zone. The differences between the two zones could be attributed to the effect of micro-climate on biomass production, vegetation types and organic matter mineralization. The soil physico-chemical properties neither had significant differences nor followed a regular trend across the landscape positions. The non-significant soil fertility restoration variation across the landscape positions could be attributed to complementary effect of structural \{SWC\} measures. Therefore, exclosure implementation and utilization planning should consider soil fertility restoration variation with age, agro-ecology and management conditions of the respective exclosure. "

In some situations, the uncertainties associated with choices in model structure, model inputs and parameters can exceed the spatiotemporal variability of simulated yields, thus limiting predictability. For Indian groundnut, we used the General Large Area Model for annual crops (GLAM) with an existing framework to decompose uncertainty, to first understand how skill changes with added model complexity, and then to determine the relevant uncertainty sources in yield and other prognostic variables (total biomass, leaf area index and harvest index). We developed an ensemble of simulations by perturbing \{GLAM\} parameters using two different input meteorology datasets, and two model versions that differ in the complexity with which they account for assimilation. We found that added complexity improved model skill, as measured by changes in the root mean squared error (RMSE), by 5–10% in specific pockets of western, central and southern India, but that 85% of the groundnut growing area either did not show improved skill or showed decreased skill from such added complexity. Thus, adding complexity or using overly complex models at regional or global scales should be exercised with caution. Uncertainty analysis indicated that, in situations where soil and air moisture dynamics are the major determinants of productivity, predictability in yield is high. Where uncertainty for yield is high, the choice of weather input data was found critical for reducing uncertainty. However, for other prognostic variables (including leaf area index, total biomass and the harvest index) parametric uncertainty was generally the most important source, with a contribution of up to 90% in some cases, suggesting that regional-scale data additional to yield to constrain model parameters is needed. Our study provides further evidence that regional-scale studies should explicitly quantify multiple uncertainty sources. "

In this study, we assessed the insecticidal and repellent action of \{DMDS\} against A. lucorum under laboratory and field conditions. \{DMDS\} did not cause mortality of A. lucorum adults or nymphs at concentrations of 10.6 and 170.9 mg a.i./1. In Y-tube olfactometer tests, both male and female A. lucorum adults preferred clean air over \{DMDS\} odors. In choice and no-choice cage trials, feeding damage and the number of A. lucorum eggs were lower on mungbean plants treated with \{DMDS\} than on control plants. Under field conditions, adult A. lucorum density was lower in DMDS-treated mungbean and cotton fields than in untreated fields, and this effect lasted 6 d, but nymph populations were not affected. Under field conditions, adult A. lucorum were repelled at a distance of up to 6 m from DMDS-sprayed cotton plants for 6 d after application.

Furthermore, among cultivars varying in photoperiod response for flowering, yields are often lower in photoperiod-sensitive genotypes. While the seed-size effect might extend to overall crop growth, photoperiod response would be expected primarily to influence phenology and, possibly, partitioning. To examine these hypothesized effects, yield, crop dry weight at two stages, harvest index (hi), and day to maturity were evaluated for 62 genotypes grown at three sites in Colombia and at Davis, California. Regression analyses indicated highly significant negative relationships between seed weight and all variables except days to maturity, even when significant photoperiod effects were accounted for or when analyses were restricted to genotypes from highland environments. Greater sensitivity to photoperiod was associated with lower yields and hi, and delayed maturity, at Davis, and there was a similar, but much weaker, trend of lower yield and hi in the other environments. Because large seed size was associated with reduced growth, relative growth rate (rgr) of 16 bean genotypes was measured at two of the Colombian sites. At both sites, rgr was negatively correlated with seed weight (R2 = 0.59 and \{R2\} = 0.44, P &lt; 0.01). These results suggest that greater seed size is associated not only with reduced yield, but also with reduced overall growth, and that the effect is largely independent of photoperiod sensitivity, even though the latter influenced phenology and partitioning.

This study was conducted to quantify dry matter content and carotenoids found in different sections of the cassava roots from six clones and to assess true retention of carotenoids after 30 min of boiling. Retention was quantified in normalized prisms taken from proximal, central and distal sectors of the root. Dry matter content (DMC) was measured along and across the roots and varied from 14.1 to 51.0%. \{DMC\} tended to be lower at the center of the root and in distal sections. \{DMC\} affected the homogeneity of the food matrix and, therefore, contributed in spatial variation in retention of carotenoids. Average true retention (dry matter basis) was 86.6% and ranged from 76.0 and 96.7% (averages per clone and section of the root, respectively). Retention was positively associated with carotenoid content in unprocessed samples, although the relationship was weak. The study shows that during boiling weight of samples changed from slight losses to gains of up to 40% (depending on original \{DMC\} of the uncooked root), resulting in an “apparent dilution” of the carotenoids. Results suggested the occurrence of some isomerization. All-trans β-carotene losses (13%) were partially explained by increases in the 13-cis (34%) and 15-cis (8%) isoforms, as well as lixiviation (&lt; 1%) into the boiling water. "

To quantify effects of sowing date and determine possible underlying causes, germplasm of diverse origins was evaluated at two sites in the highlands using multiple sowing dates. In all trials, seed yield, seed weight, harvest index and canopy dry weight decreased with late sowings. Large effects of sowing date, cultivar and their interaction were found for the four traits. The possible importance of phenology per se and of weather conditions was first examined using regression analyses. Variation in seed yield, seed weight, harvest index and canopy dry weight was more closely associated with time to maturity than with time to flowering. Of three weather variables examined, minimum temperature during seed filling revealed the strongest relations with the four traits. Few interactions of any parameter with line were significant, indicating that the cultivars did not have a strong differential response to a specific weather condition such as night temperature. Simulation analyses comparing photoperiod-sensitive and day-neutral cultivars indicated that radiation and temperature explained part of the yield reduction with late sowings. Daylength also had an influence, however, even in the day-neutral cultivar. Given that phenology had a strong effect on yield and that its inheritance is better understood than that of other physiological traits, priority should be given to understanding the genetic basis of the response of cultivar phenology to sowing date in the region.

The fragile nature of these agroecosystems and limited capacity of resource-poor farmers in the region to adopt the large-scale use of conventional fertilizer and pest control technologies suggest the need for agroecological intensification to restore soil functioning and ensure long-term sustainability in these systems. This review addresses soil fertility decline from a management perspective and considers six basic approaches to enhance nutrient cycling, crop nutrient acquisition, and long-term productivity. A mass balance approach first defines basic boundaries for nutrient cycling and suggests that erosion control and identification of alternative nutrient sources (e.g., peri-urban wastes, rock phosphate) are critical for reversing negative nutrient budgets. Meanwhile, short-term nutrient dynamics could benefit greatly from improved management of organic residues in combination with low-level inorganic fertilizer applications. There is also a need for greater understanding of soil physiochemical properties throughout much of the Andes and the impacts of management. Similarly, soil biological functioning is critical for successful agroecological intensification and there is great potential for both inoculative and management strategies to promote beneficial soil communities. Crop breeding for smallholder environments should complement strategies of agroecological intensification, taking advantage of high regional agrobiodiversity and experience from stress breeding programs in other regions. Finally, we suggest several means by which the spatial and temporal organization of farms may be improved to enhance overall agroecosystem function. "

Tolerance to \{PPD\} was recently reported in different cassava genotypes, opening up new opportunities to analyze biochemical changes in stored roots and in the functional properties of their starches. Roots from PPD-susceptible (HMC-1) and tolerant (AM 206-5) clones were harvested and stored for up to 14 d in ambient tropical conditions. \{AM\} 206-5 is also characterized by amylose-free starch. Roots and starch were analyzed each day. \{PPD\} levels differed significantly between the two clones (35% and 8% at day 14) and showed a relation to scopoletin synthesis, which reached maximum levels around day 3 or 4 of storage. Roots lost weight consistently during storage (≈10% in two weeks). Starch loss per day of root storage was estimated at about 1%. This could be the result of consistent increases in total sugars and respiration of root tissue. Important changes in starch properties were observed. Gel clarity decreased gradually during storage, with more pronounced changes occurring in starches from HMC-1. Swelling power decreased only in the case of \{AM\} 206-5. Gel viscosity increased in both genotypes. Improved tolerance to \{PPD\} could significantly reduce the economic impact of the short shelf life of ordinary cassava root processing.

In this paper, we develop models for digital soil mapping based on remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) platform for Africa. The article presents maps of soil organic carbon (SOC), pH, sand and sum of exchangeable bases, as well as prevalence of root-depth restrictions in the upper 50 cm of the soil profile. Prediction models were developed based on spatially balanced field survey data, representing all major climate zones on the continent. The prediction models for soil property mapping performed well, with overall \{RMSEP\} values of 10.6, 0.34, 9.1, and 6.5 for SOC, pH, sand, and sum of bases, respectively. The accuracy of the prediction model for root-depth restrictions was 77%, with an \{AUC\} of 0.85 and Cohen's kappa value of 0.52 when averaged across predictions run on independent test data. The methods and maps developed can provide much improved identification of soil and land health constraints, and spatial targeting of land management interventions at various scales, informing both policy and practice.

However, biochemical methods cannot effectively distinguish between pathogenic and non-pathogenic xanthomonads. In this study, gram-negative and yellow-pigmented mucoid bacteria were isolated from \{BXW\} symptomatic and symptomless bananas collected from different parts of Uganda. Biolog, Xcm-specific (GspDm), Xanthomonas vasicola species-specific (NZ085) and Xanthomonas genus-specific (X1623) primers in PCR, and sequencing of \{ITS\} region were used to identify and characterize the isolates. Biolog tests revealed several isolates as xanthomonads. The GspDm and \{NZ085\} primers accurately identified three isolates from diseased bananas as Xcm and these were pathogenic when re-inoculated into bananas. \{DNA\} from more isolates than those amplified by GspDm and \{NZ085\} primers were amplified by the \{X1623\} primers implying they are xanthomonads, these were however non-pathogenic on bananas. In the 16–23 \{ITS\} sequence based phylogeny, the pathogenic bacteria clustered together with the Xcm reference strain, while the non-pathogenic xanthomonads isolated from both \{BXW\} symptomatic and symptomless bananas clustered with group I xanthomonads. The findings reveal dynamic Xanthomonas populations in bananas, which can easily be misrepresented by only using phenotyping and biochemical tests. A combination of tools provides the most accurate identity and characterization of these plant associated bacteria. The interactions between the pathogenic and non-pathogenic xanthomonads in bananas may pave way to understanding effect of microbial interactions on \{BXW\} disease development and offer clues to biocontrol of Xcm.

In the study the tolerance of 55 strains of Rhizobium phaseoli to acid pH, aluminium (Al) and manganese (Mn) in nutrient medium was examined and the tolerance of these stresses related to the survival and nodulating ability of strains of R. phaseoli in acid soils. At pH 4.5 only six of the 55 strains tested produced isolate colonies on modified Keyser-Munns medium. Eight strains grew well on pH 4.7 medium to which 6 ppm Al had been added, but only six of these grew when the Al was replaced with 50 ppm Mn. When two strains differing in tolerance to pH in nutrient medium were introduced into an Ultisol from Santander de Quilichao, Colombia, which had been limed to differing pH values, the tolerant strain \{CIAT\} 899 survived better from pH 4.15 to 4.90. In a field trial with soil limed to pH values from 3.8 to 4.4, the percentage of plants nodulated and the number of nodules per plant was greater when \{CIAT\} 899 was used as inoculant, instead of the strain \{CIAT\} 632, shown sensitive to pH in both nutrient media and soil tests. In this trial granular, soil applied inoculants gave better results than those which were seed applied. In a second field trial, on a Typic Distrandept limed from pH 4.45 to 5.20, yields of P. vulgaris were enhanced by inoculation, but again \{CIAT\} 899 performed better than did \{CIAT\} 632. In this trial there was no significant difference between inoculation methods. The possible value of granular inoculation methods to the production of P. vulgaris under small-farm conditions is discussed. "

Density of planting is also low in many cases (average 3 plants per m2 each of beans and maize in Colombia). Three experiments were conducted at \{CIAT\} in Cali, Colombia, to compare planting systems. Planting in hills significantly reduced lodging of the maize in two out of three experiments. Higher bean density also tended to reduce maize lodging due to an anchoring effect of the climbing stems. Maize yields were reduced by planting in hills in two out of three experiments, but tended to increase slightly with bean density. Bean yield was also reduced by planting in hills but increased with density up to 9 plants per m2, associated with a reduction in node number per plant, especially on the branches. Bean harvest index was increased by planting in hills, but reduced by higher bean density. Bean cultivars significantly affected maize yield, which was negatively related to bean plant height and node number. The best-yielding bean cultivar (G2525) had a well-developed climbing main stem; it gave 53% greater yield than G4017, which had well-developed branches. There were no significant interactions of bean cultivars with spacing or density. Increased bean density, either in hills or in rows, had beneficial effects both on bean and maize yields, the latter mainly due to reduced lodging. Reducing the spacing between hills and increasing bean density has potential for increasing the total productivity of this cropping system. "

The inefficiency of public seed firms and the reluctance of large scale, private seed firms to enter the market for a self-pollinated crop that is dominated by small scale farmers will necessitate the development of non-market solutions to the dissemination problem if small-scale farmers are to benefit from new, higher yields cultivars.

Environmental and sustainability indicators, when combined with tools for their visualisation, manipulation and analysis are essential components of the monitoring process. By providing these information products and tools policy-makers can be given the opportunity to spatially interrogate the driving forces and the current state of rural development. However it is also vitally important for decision-makers to understand how trends will develop in the short-term future and the possible impacts of their decisions on the development process. This paper shows how the results of a spatially explicit land use model have been incorporated into a set of rural sustainability indicators to provide information to policy-makers in a form consistent with the information used in the monitoring process. The success of the monitoring process will depend not only on the availability of tools and indicators but also on the skills of the users and an institutional framework that fosters the application of these skills. Reliable and harmonised data are the key to obtaining useful results from the land use model chosen for this study, however responsibility for these data lies with the appropriate institutions in the countries of Central America. Demonstrating what can be done with ‘their’ data may provide these institutions with the necessary justification to overcome a lack of political will to invest in data collection, data use and the implementation of standards.

At the landscape or farm scale, the most commonly reported variability is the gradient of decreasing soil fertility from intensively managed “home” fields to more extensively managed “bush” fields. Case study evidence from an agro-pastoral community of southern Mali’s cotton zone showed that “home” and “bush” fields differed significantly in nutrient balances and soil fertility status but that inter-household differences related to household practice and social factors were even more important. Plot and household-level soil nutrient balances were calculated in 1996–1997 from participatory exercises such as resource flow mapping, participant observation, and soil sampling. The overall community-level nutrient balances averaged −9.2 kg N ha−1, +0.8 kg P ha−1, and −3.4 kg K ha−1, with significant inter-household variation. Soil analysis confirmed significant variation in soil nutrient status at both the landscape and plot levels. Comparing the scale and patterns of input use inequality using Gini coefficients showed the range of coefficients attributable to household behaviours matched or surpassed those attributable to distance factors alone. Input use intensity declined with increasing distance from nutrient sources but field level nutrient balances were better explained by household practice than by distance. Systemic differences in household asset ownership, use, and resource allocation behaviour suggested that much of the diversity seen in the nutrient balances and soil analyses was due to persistent inter-household inequality and the consequent exchanges of agro-pastoral resources. Inter-household negotiations for inputs (such as exchanges of manure and carts) and household-level decisions about input allocation created, exploited, and reinforced a mosaic of soil fertility “hotspots” surrounded by less fertile and less intensively managed patches.

The entries included 43 genetic recombinants selected from a breeding population, four parental accessions and an additional eight germplasm accessions. Small amounts of fertilizer were applied at establishment (kg ha−1: 40 N, 20 P, 20 K, 14 Ca, 12 Mg and 12 S). A number of plant attributes including forage yield, leaf area, shoot nutrient composition and shoot nutrient uptake were measured during both seasons. Significant genetic variation was observed in several plant attributes such as leaf area, shoot nutrient content, nutrient partitioning to leaves, shoot nutrient uptake, and forage yield in both seasons. Forage yield ranged from 59 to 343 g plant−1 in the wet season and 5 to 174 g plant−1 in the dry season. Correlation between forage yield and shoot nutrient uptake indicated the importance of nutrient acquisition, particularly of phosphorus (r=0.90; P&lt;0.0001), for adaptation to infertile acid soil stress. Two genetic recombinants (BRN093/3009, FM9201/1873) were productive when grown under infertile acid soil stress in both wet and dry seasons. But, neither of these two recombinants is highly resistant to xylem-feeding insects known as spittlebugs (Homoptera: Cercopidae). One spittlebug-resistant genetic recombinant (BRN093/1371) exhibited several desirable attributes such as superior leaf area and leaf biomass, greater N content in leaves, and greater partitioning of N and P to leaves that could contribute to adaptation and persistence in these soils. This recombinant is being utilized in a breeding program to develop superior Brachiaria lines. "

The emphasis in, for example, Western Europe has changed from maximum productivity only to also include environmental considerations, such as reduction of nutrient losses to groundwater and maintaining an open landscape with high biodiversity, etc. In less-productive regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, environmental considerations still have low priority. Agricultural ecosystems comprise almost 40% (5 Gha) of the total land area of the Earth. About 11% of the total land area is arable land (cultivated with crops), and approximately 27% of the total land area is under permanent pasture, grazed by cattle, goats, sheep, camels, etc. Plant biodiversity is extremely low – if weed control is successful there may be only one species present. In spite of this, belowground biodiversity can be high, although often lower than in natural ecosystems. Ecological research performed in agricultural systems has advantages compared with research in most natural ecosystems, since agricultural fields are ‘homogenized’, that is, trees, larger stones, etc. are removed and regular soil cultivation to some extent evens out differences in topsoil properties over time.

Fingerprinting of soil elemental composition may form a useful basis for evaluating soils in a way that relates to soil-forming factors and inherent soil functional properties. The objectives of this paper are to quantify the proportion of variability in total elemental composition by total X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) method of 1074 soil samples from the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) Project baseline and to determine the relationships with soil forming factors. The samples were from 34 sentinel sites measuring 10 × 10 km, randomized within major climate zones in SSA. Within each sentinel site there were sixteen spatially stratified 1 km2 clusters, within which there were ten 100 m2 plots. The within and between site patterns of variation in total element composition of 17 elements; Al, P, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Sr, Y, Ta, and Pb, were explored. Total element concentration values were within the range reported globally for soil Cr, Mn, Zn, Ni, V, Sr, and Y and higher than reported range for Al, Cu, Ta, Pb, and Ga. There were significant variations (P &lt; 0.05) in total element composition within and between the sites for all the elements analyzed with the greatest proportion of total variance and number of significant variance components occurring at the site (55–88%) followed by the cluster nested within site (10–40%) levels. The explorations of the relationships between element composition data and site factors using Random Forest regression demonstrated that soil-forming factors have important influence on total elemental composition in the soil. The fact that the soil-forming factors are related to the concentration of naturally occurring elements in the soil gives rise to the notion that they might be predicted from the soils' element composition. Results implied that &gt; 70% of variation in soil element composition patterns can be predicted using information in existing databases or readily observable features. Successful use of \{TXRF\} technique would open up possibilities for using total soil elemental composition fingerprints as a useful basis for characterizing soils in a way that relates to soil-forming factors and inherent soil functional properties.

Over half of the African population is rural and directly dependent on locally grown crops. Further, 28% of the population is chronically hungry and over half of people are living on less than US$ 1 per day as a result of soil fertility depletion. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is simultaneously a source and sink for nutrients and plays a vital role in soil fertility maintenance. In most parts of West Africa agro-ecosystems (except the forest zone), the soils are inherently low in SOC. The low \{SOC\} content is due to the low shoot and root growth of crops and natural vegetation, the rapid turnover rates of organic material as a result of high soil temperatures and fauna activity particularly termites and the low soil clay content. With kaolinite as the main clay type, the cation exchange capacity of the soils in this region, often less that 1 cmol kg−1, depends heavily on the SOC. There is a rapid decline of \{SOC\} levels with continuous cultivation. For the sandy soils, average annual losses may be as high as 4.7% whereas with sandy loam soils, losses are lower, with an average of 2%. To maintain food production for a rapidly growing population, application of mineral fertilizers and the effective recycling of organic amendments such as crop residues and manures are essential especially in the smallholder farming systems that rely predominantly on organic residues to maintain soil fertility. There is need to increase crop biomass at farm level and future research should focus on improvement of nutrient use efficiency in order to increase crop biomass. Research should also focus on ways of alleviating socio-economic constraints in order to increase the legume component in the cropping systems. This will produce higher quality fodder for the livestock and also increase biomass at farm-level. This paper reviews various strategies and lessons learnt in improving soil organic carbon status in West Africa soils. "

The objectives of this paper are to provide an overview of efforts using \{SWAT\} to quantify ecosystem services, to determine the model’s capability examining various types of services, and to describe the approach used by various researchers. A literature review was conducted to identify studies in which \{SWAT\} was explicitly used for quantifying ecosystem services in terms of provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural aspects. A total of 44 peer reviewed publications were identified. Most of these used \{SWAT\} to quantify provisioning services (34%), regulating services (27%), or a combination of both (25%). While studies using \{SWAT\} for evaluating ecosystem services are limited (approximately 1% of SWAT’s peered review publications), and usage (vs. potential) of services by beneficiaries is a current model limitation, the available literature sets the stage for the continuous development and potential of \{SWAT\} as a methodological framework for quantifying ecosystem services to assist in decision-making.

To analyse the effects of shade on physical coffee quality and on sensorial cup quality of Coffea arabica L. cv. Caturra KMC, a study was carried out with 94 plots on 16 farms in two municipalities, Timaná and Oporapa, located at elevations from 1272 to 1730 masl. in Huila, Colombia. The study was designed with emphasis on shade cover variation within each of the two study areas, while minimizing the variability of environment, agronomic management other than shade, and post-harvest processing. 46 samples of shade coffee and 46 samples of sun coffee were evaluated for physical and sensorial attributes using three professional coffee cuppers (assessors). A principal component analysis including all quality and environmental variables showed that sensory attributes were influenced negatively by shade, and that physical attributes were influenced positively by altitude. A mixed linear model, with coffee cupper and farm as random variables, revealed different shade effects on coffee quality in the two areas. In Oporapa, situated at high altitudes, shade had a negative effect on fragrance, acidity, body, sweetness and preference of the beverage, while no effect was found on the physical quality. In Timaná, situated at lower altitudes, shade did not have a significant effect on sensorial attributes, but significantly reduced the number of small beans. At high altitudes with low temperatures and no nutrient or water deficits, shade trees may thus have a partly adverse effect on C. arabica cv. Caturra resulting in reduced sensory quality. The occurrence of berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) was lower at high altitudes and higher under shade. Future studies on shade and coffee quality should focus on the interaction between physical and chemical characteristics of beans. "

There is a pressing need for wide-scale innovation leading to development that improves the livelihoods and food security of the world's population while at the same time addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation. A variety of promising climate-smart interventions have been identified. However, what remains is the prioritization of interventions for investment and broad dissemination. The suitability and adoption of interventions depends on a variety of bio-physical and socio-economic factors. Also their impacts, when adopted and out-scaled, are likely to be highly heterogeneous. This heterogeneity expresses itself not only spatially and temporally but also in terms of the stakeholders affected, some might win and some might lose. A mechanism that can facilitate a systematic, holistic assessment of the likely spread and consequential impact of potential interventions is one way of improving the selection and targeting of such options. In this paper we provide climate smart agriculture (CSA) planners and implementers at all levels with a generic framework for evaluating and prioritising potential interventions. This entails an iterative process of mapping out recommendation domains, assessing adoption potential and estimating impacts. Through examples, related to livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa, we demonstrate each of the steps and how they are interlinked. The framework is applicable in many different forms, scales and settings. It has a wide applicability beyond the examples presented and we hope to stimulate readers to integrate the concepts in the planning process for climate-smart agriculture, which invariably involves multi-stakeholder, multi-scale and multi-objective decision-making.

The genetic diversity of D. rabiei population was high with inter-population variability accounting for 83% of the total variation, whereas the genetic diversity among populations was very low (17%). Principal component analysis grouped the isolates from Aleppo, Idlib, Hama, Homs and Hassakeh provinces together, while Daraa and Tartous were in different groups. Isolates from Lattakia and Suweida provinces formed very distinct clusters compared to the others. The 56 isolates were grouped into four pathotypes, namely, pathotype-1 (12 isolates), pathotype-2 (13 isolates), pathotype-3 (5 isolates) and pathotype-4 (26 isolates) with varying degrees of virulence on the chickpea genotypes. Our findings showed a clear genetic shift toward more virulence over time and space in the populations of D. rabiei in Syria. These results stress the need for chickpea breeding materials to be tested for resistance to the more virulent pathotypes. Also, concerted action should be taken to ensure the shipment of healthy seeds of international chickpea nurseries to avoid D. rabiei genotypes or pathotypes flow from Syria to other countries. "

Economic incentives, such as payments for environmental services could promote conservation, but deforestation often occurs on land without crucial tenure-security prerequisites. Improving the enforcement of existing regulatory disincentives thus represents an important element of Brazil's anti-deforestation action plan. However, conservation law enforcement costs and benefits have been much less studied than for conditional payments. We develop a conceptual framework and a spatially explicit model to analyze field-based regulatory enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon. We validate our model, based on historical deforestation and enforcement mission data from 2003 to 2008. By simulating the current conservation law enforcement practice, we analyze the costs of liability establishment and legal coercion for alternative conservation targets, and evaluate corresponding income impacts. Our findings suggest that spatial patterns of both deforestation and inspection costs markedly influence enforcement patterns and their income effects. Field-based enforcement is a highly cost-effective forest conservation instrument from a regulator's point of view, but comes at high opportunity costs for land users. Payments for environmental services could compensate costs, but will increase budget outlays vis-à-vis a command-and-control dominated strategy. Both legal and institutional challenges have to be overcome to make conservation payments work at a larger scale. Decision-makers may have to innovatively combine incentive and disincentive-based policy instruments in order to make tropical forest conservation both financially viable and socially compatible. "

Both fungal entomopathogens were detected more often in the proximal end of the root than in the distal end. Colonization levels of B. bassiana were higher when plants were sampled at 7–9 days post-inoculation (84%) compared to 47–49 days post-inoculation (40%). In contrast, the colonization levels of M. anisopliae remained constant from 7–9 days post-inoculation (80%) to 47–49 days post-inoculation (80%), which suggests M. anisopliae is better able to persist in the soil, or as an endophyte in cassava roots over time. Differences in colonization success and plant growth were found among the fungal entomopathogen treatments. "

More recently modern science and research methods based on controlled experiments became the most visible instrument of technological change in agriculture, nevertheless farmers continued to develop and implement new technologies based on their own observations made under commercial conditions. Modern information technology and social organization of producers make it possible to use operational research, which is based on the observation and analysis of operations so as to improve them, to manage crops better. The article describes two cases, coffee and sugarcane, in which observation of the results obtained by farmers, with the natural variation in the environment and the distinct management practices they apply can be used to determine site specific crop management practices. The basis of the methodology is to (a) obtain data from a series of cropping events that characterizes the conditions under which each crop is grown, how it is managed and how it performs under commercial conditions (data capture), (b) to manage and analyze the data in centralized databases (data management and analysis) and (c) make the information derived from the data analysis available to growers so that they can use it to make better informed decisions (interpretation). All aspects of the methodology depend on the social organization of the growers and the supply chain of which they form a part, and hence social organization is an integral part of the methodology. The processes of characterization of the growing conditions, including both environmental and management parameters, the establishment of databases, the data analysis and interpretation, and mechanisms of interacting with producers are described with emphasis on the importance of social organization and farmers’ groups. Examples are given of how this approach can be used to better understand the crop response to variation in the environment and management, and how this can be used by farmers to improve productivity and quality in two contrasting crops. The paper demonstrates that operational research can be used to evaluate farmers’ experiences and to share that knowledge amongst them so as to improve their production practices in the context of their particular environment. It is suggested that the operation research approach is particularly effective in heterogeneous landscapes with perennial crops that have not been the subject of intense research. Furthermore operational research is effective in determining the crop response to variables that are not readily studied in small plots and in determining optimal combinations of multiple variables. Producers believe in the results obtained as there are none of the problems of scaling up from experimental plots to commercial conditions. It is proposed that the approaches described can readily be applied to other crop species. "

In this study, mid-infrared spectroscopy in combination with spatial analyses tools is being proposed to facilitate landscape evaluation and monitoring. Mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) and geostatistics were integrated for evaluating soil spatial structures of three land settlement schemes in Zimbabwe (i.e. communal area, old resettlement and new resettlement; on loamy-sand, sandy-loam and clay soils, respectively). A nested non-aligned design with hierarchical grids of 750, 150 and 30 m resulted in 432 sampling points across all three villages (730–1360 ha). At each point, a composite topsoil sample was taken and analyzed by MIRS. Conventional laboratory analyses on 25–38% of the samples were used for the prediction of concentration values on the remaining samples through the application of MIRS–partial least squares regression models. These models were successful (R2 ≥ 0.89) for sand, clay, pH, total C and N, exchangeable Ca, Mg and effective CEC; but not for silt, available P and exchangeable K and Al (R2 ≤ 0.82). Minimum sample sizes required to accurately estimate the mean of each soil property in each village were calculated. With regard to locations, fewer samples were needed in the new resettlement area than in the other two areas (e.g. 66 versus 133–473 samples for estimating soil C at 10% error, respectively); regarding parameters, less samples were needed for estimating pH and sand (i.e. 3–52 versus 27–504 samples for the remaining properties, at same error margin). Spatial analyses of soil properties in each village were assessed by constructing standardized isotropic semivariograms, which were usually well described by spherical models. Spatial autocorrelation of most variables was displayed over ranges of 250–695 m. Nugget-to-sill ratios showed that, in general, spatial dependence of soil properties was: new resettlement &gt; old resettlement &gt; communal area; which was potentially attributed to both intrinsic (e.g. texture) and extrinsic (e.g. management) factors. As a new approach, geostatistical analysis was performed using \{MIRS\} data directly, after principal component analyses, where the first three components explained 70% of the overall variability. Semivariograms based on these components showed that spatial dependence per village was similar to overall dependence identified from individual soil properties in each area. In fact, the first component (explaining 49% of variation) related well with all soil properties of reference samples (absolute correlation values of 0.55–0.96). This showed that \{MIRS\} data could be directly linked to geostatistics for a broad and quick evaluation of soil spatial variability. It is concluded that integrating \{MIRS\} with geostatistical analyses is a cost-effective promising approach, i.e. for soil fertility and carbon sequestration assessments, mapping and monitoring at landscape level.

Four plant species (Arachis pintoi, Brachiaria brizantha, Leucaena leucocephala and Solanum rugosum) were grown alone and in every possible combination on experimental plots within three replicate farms. After 28 months, soils were sampled to determine impacts on 5 categories of variables: soil macrofauna, aggregate morphology, chemical fertility, water storage and compaction. No clear effects of plant species richness were observed on any of the soil properties measured. However, individual plant species had significant impacts on variables in all 5 categories. Most notably, the herbaceous legume, A. pintoi, promoted both earthworm and ant densities and a corresponding 87% increase in biogenic aggregates in plots with vs. without A. pintoi. Meanwhile, B. brizantha increased the proportion of root-derived aggregates, while negatively impacting ant densities. Significant covariation was observed among many of the 5 data sets (categories), namely soil aggregate morphology and soil macrofauna, as well as aggregate morphology and soil compaction. This research demonstrates that plant species composition can impact soil properties through faunal-mediated effects, and stresses the necessity of considering soil macrofauna in agroecosystem management.

We hypothesize that the application of these different \{ISFM\} components can result in significant increases in productivity and economic benefits of cassava–legume intercropping systems. Participatory demonstration trials were conducted in the highlands of Sud-Kivu, \{DR\} Congo with 12 farmer groups during 3 seasons. Treatments included the farmers’ common practice (local common bean and cassava varieties, seed broadcast and manure addition) and sequentially added \{ISFM\} components: improved bean and cassava germplasm, modified crop arrangements, compound \{NPK\} fertilizer application and alternative legume species (groundnut or soybean). The use of improved germplasm did not result in yield increases without simultaneous implementation of other \{ISFM\} components. Modifying the crop arrangement by planting cassava at 2 m between rows and 0.5 m within the row, intercropped with four legume lines, increased bean yields during the first season and permits a second bean intercrop, which can increase total legume production by up to 1 t ha−1 and result in an additional revenue of almost 1000 \{USD\} ha−1. Crop arrangement or a second legume intercrop did not affect cassava storage root yields. Fertilizer application increased both legume and cassava yield, and net revenue by 400–700 \{USD\} ha−1 with a marginal rate of return of 1.6–2.7. Replacing the common bean intercrop by groundnut increased net revenue by 200–400 \{USD\} ha−1 partly because of the higher market value of the grains, but mostly due to a positive effect on cassava storage root yield. Soybean affected cassava yields negatively because of its high biomass production and long maturity period; modifications are needed to integrate a soybean intercrop into the system. The findings demonstrate the large potential of \{ISFM\} to increase productivity in cassava–legume systems in the Central-African highlands. Benefits were, however, not observed in all study sites. In poor soils, productivity increases were variable or absent, and soil amendments are required. A better understanding of the conditions under which positive effects occur can enable better targeting and local adaptation of the technologies. "

In this study, the scientifically measured soil attributes significantly differed (P ≤ 0.05) among the \{SQ\} categories identified by the local farmers. Using variables retained in the four identified component factors, discriminant analysis identified soil porosity to be the most powerful variable that can help discriminate the \{SQ\} status.

Significant variations (P ≤ 0.05) were shown between the proportions of farmers used certain \{SQ\} indicator and those who didn't while categorizing SQ.

However, little is known on spatial distribution and variability of soil properties at catchment-scale in many tropical developing regions including Ethiopia. This study aims to examine catchment-scale spatial dependence and variability of soil properties using classical and geostatistical methods to indicate for site-specific soil management in the Mai-Negus catchment, northern Ethiopia. Soil samples were collected based on sampling zones identified by the knowledge of local farmers and field observation and analyzed following standard laboratory procedures for selected soil properties. The coefficient of variation of the soil properties ranged from 8.6% (pH) to 73.4% (clay) at catchment-scale. The mean soil organic carbon (OC) (1.21%), total nitrogen (TN) (0.12%), and available phosphorus (Pav) (7.8 mg kg−1) of the soils in the catchment were low, whereas high in exchangeable potassium (Ex K) (0.77 cmolc kg−1), and medium in cation exchange capacity (CEC) (23.4 cmolc kg−1) compared to the rate for African soils reported in literature. The results of semivariograms indicated a strong (8%) to moderate (63%) degree of spatial dependence for the soil properties. In addition, the goodness-of-prediction criterium (G) are higher than zero indicating that spatial soil properties mapped based on kriging interpolation are more accurate than the catchment average value (classical statistics) for site-specific management decisions. This study indicates a wide range of variability in the soil properties as the kriged maps of the soil properties at catchment-scale showed for sand (15–70%), silt (18–77%), clay (3–51%), bulk density (1.00–2.00 Mg m−3), \{OC\} (0.20–4.5%), \{TN\} (0.05–1.0%), Pav (1–26 mg kg−1), Ex K (0.10–1.30 cmolc kg−1), exchangeable calcium, Ex Ca (5–28 cmolc kg−1), exchangeable magnesium, Ex Mg (2–15 cmolc kg−1), \{CEC\} (8–51 cmolc kg−1), and iron (3–45 mg kg−1). The lowest soil nutrients and fine soil particles were measured on the sub-sampling zones such as low soil quality, eroded sites, and marginal land soils. Introducing appropriate interventions such as conservation tillage, fertilizer rates, agro-forestry practices, crop rotation, exclosure degraded lands, and conservation measures based on the kriged soil properties maps produced is crucial for sustainable production and environmental services.

However, little information is documented on indicators such as variations in soil properties across different landforms in a catchment. This study was aimed to assess soil properties and their changes across sites with different erosion statuses, and identify landscape positions that require prior management attention in the Mai-Negus catchment, northern Ethiopia. Three types of erosion-status sites (stable, eroding and aggrading) were identified using reconnaissance surveys, and then the corresponding soil samples were collected and analyzed. The major soil properties were significantly varied (P ≤ 0.05) among the three erosion-status sites. The highest soil pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, cation exchange capacity, iron and zinc were recorded from the aggrading sites in the reservoir and valley landforms of the study catchment. A higher bulk density was generally recorded in the eroding sites, whereas a lower value was observed in the aggrading sites. The highest sand content was observed in the eroding sites of the mountain followed by the central ridge landform. The paired mean difference and the correlation matrix of most soil properties between the different erosion statuses also showed significant differences. About 95% of the erosion-status sites were correctly classified by the discriminant function, indicating that the field survey-based classification was acceptable for decision making. On the basis of this study, suitable interventions should thus be introduced to the prioritized landforms, which are the mountain and central ridge, and eroding sites with severely degraded soil properties across the catchment.

Environmental differences between coffee-growing areas in the departments of Cauca and Nariño were statistically significant for several characteristics, including the number of dry months, annual precipitation and diurnal temperature range. The dominant varieties (Caturra and Colombia) did not show major differences in quality attributes, and were pooled for the analyses with the environmental data. There are significant differences in biochemical and sensorial product characteristics between the two departments. The spatial patterns in product characteristics exhibit a non-random, regionally-changing structure that is related to those in the environmental data. The generated results provided ample evidence to support the application for regionally-based denominations of origin. Recommendations were derived to help mainstreaming the developed approach and thereby facilitate policy decisions for its use in other geographies and with other crops. Furthermore, the importance of systematic interdisciplinary institutional collaboration for large-scale denomination of origin projects was corroborated for food policy dialogue and decision making. It seems plausible that producers of high-quality products within other commodities are likely to follow the \{FNC\} in seeking denomination of origin for their goods. The presented approach is crucial to facilitate policy. "

Reliable indicators of farm performance are needed in order to model these links, and to therefore be able to design interventions which meet the differing needs of specific user groups. However, the lack of standardization of performance indicators has led to a wide array of tools and ad-hoc indicators which limit our ability to compare across studies and to draw general conclusions on relationships and trade-offs whereby performance indicators are shaped by farm management and the wider social-environmental context. \{RHoMIS\} is a household survey tool designed to rapidly characterise a series of standardised indicators across the spectrum of agricultural production and market integration, nutrition, food security, poverty and \{GHG\} emissions. The survey tool takes 40–60 min to administer per household using a digital implementation platform. This is linked to a set of automated analysis procedures that enable immediate cross-site bench-marking and intra-site characterisation. We trialled the survey in two contrasting agro-ecosystems, in Lushoto district of Tanzania (n = 150) and in the Trifinio border region of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras (n = 285). The tool rapidly characterised variability between farming systems at landscape scales in both locations identifying key differences across the population of farm households that would be critical for targeting \{CSA\} interventions. Our results suggest that at both sites the climate smartness of different farm strategies is clearly determined by an interaction between the characteristics of the farm household and the farm strategy. In general strategies that enabled production intensification contributed more towards the goals of climate smart agriculture on smaller farms, whereas increased market orientation was more successful on larger farms. On small farms off-farm income needs to be in place before interventions can be promoted successfully, whereas on the larger farms a choice is made between investing labour in off-farm incomes, or investing that labour into the farm, resulting in a negative association between off-farm labour and intensification, market orientation and crop diversity on the larger farms, which is in complete opposition to the associations found for the smaller farms. The balance of indicators selected gave an adequate snap shot picture of the two sites, and allowed us to appraise the ‘CSA-ness’ of different existing farm strategies, within the context of other major development objectives.

Species richness per ∼50 km side cell ranged from 1 to 2149 taxa, but with most of the areas presenting between 1 and 58 taxa. Population accessibility, expansion of agriculture and grazing pressure were found to be the key drivers of immediate extinction risk. A considerable (78.4%) number of species presented at least one population under high threat due to the expansion and intensification of these anthropogenic activities. In addition, some 13.8% of the analysed species presented up to 80% of their populations at risk of extinction (high threat index). On the conservation side, 82.3% of the analysed taxa have at least one population occurring within a protected site. However, it is important to note that for a protected area system to be effective and efficient, the conservation of within-taxon genetic diversity is required. The expansion, monitoring and strengthening of 24 existing protected areas holding up to 70% of South American plant diversity is suggested; as is the revision of seven additional sites where up to 200 species not currently conserved are present.

However this legume contribution varies with the physico-chemical and biological conditions of the nodulated-root rhizosphere. In order to assess the abiotic and biotic constrains that might limit this symbiosis at the agroecosystem level, a nodular diagnosis is proposed with common bean as a model grain-legume, and a major source of plant proteins for world human nutrition. The engineering of the legume symbiosis is addressed by participatory assessment of bean recombinant inbred lines contrasting for their efficiency in use of phosphorous for symbiotic nitrogen fixation. With this methodology, in field-sites chosen with farmers of an area of cereal-cropping in the Mediterranean basin, a large spatial and temporal variation in the legume nodulation was found. Soil P availability was a major limiting factor of the rhizobial symbiosis. In order to relate the field measurements with progress in functional genomics of the symbiosis, in situ RT-PCR on nodule sections has been implemented showing that the phytase gene is expressed in the cortex with significantly higher number of transcripts in P-efficient RILs. It is concluded that various tools and indicators are available for developing the ecological engineering of the rhizobial symbiosis, in particular for its beneficial contribution to the bio-geochemical cycle of N, and also P and C.

The objective of this paper is to illustrate the benefits of systematically targeting management practices by coffee growers to improve attributes of their product. Data from case studies in Colombia and Mexico show statistically significant differences in beverage quality of coffees grown under different production conditions such as slope aspect, varieties, times of harvest, and shade levels. Possible intervention options can be selected by growers in terms of their ease of implementation, the likely improvement of quality that they achieve and the resource intensiveness they require. The conclusion is that optimum management is site specific so that it is not possible to make any blanket recommendations. Using continuous management cycles of implementation, observation, interpretation and evaluation the site specificity provides growers an opportunity to improve management over time to produce a higher quality product.

The difference between experimental data under laboratory or field conditions fitted and data predicted by the model was less than 10% for trans-β-carotene, or for total carotenoids. The formation of the volatile compounds, β-ionone; 5,6-epoxy-β-ionone; dihydroactinidiolide; β-cyclocitral, was measured by SPME-GC-MS and was clearly related to the degradation of trans-β-carotene.

Information linked to milk and cattle production such as activities, inputs (labour, means of production, capital) and outputs (milk, cheese, animals) were recorded using a closed-ended questionnaire. The communities were divided into two groups with low (LC) and high (HC) level of dependence on income from milk and animal sales. The survey results showed that cattle production on the \{LC\} farms was based on less land and a smaller herd (3.32 ha/farm, 1.06 lactating cows) than on \{HC\} farms (10.28 ha/farm, 4.19 lactating cows). The data from the survey and the results of the nutritional analyses of 74 feed samples were introduced into a model that applied linear programming techniques in order to estimate the farm household income under the current production systems and evaluate the economic impact of improved forage varieties for hay production. Furthermore, the economic viability of other changes in fodder and herd management was tested. Both groups were characterised by a dual-purpose system generating a gross income from the sale of both, milk and live animals in the amount of -21 (LC) and +1057 US$/farm and year (HC). Due to higher production costs for forages and better access to markets, \{LC\} communities were characterised by an integrated crop–livestock system whereas in the \{HC\} group income was mainly based on livestock. Introduction of improved and fertilized barley for hay production, was estimated to increase the annual farm income to 127 and 1257 US$ for \{LC\} and HC, respectively. This increase was accompanied by an increment of the animal number. Maintaining the animal number but increasing the milk production/cow by feeding additional forage was a less profitable option generating 50 and 1221 US$ of income per farm and year for \{LC\} and HC, respectively. The production of hay was limited by high costs (external labour) in \{LC\} communities and the restricted availability of family labour in the \{HC\} group. A scenario based on the use of improved cow genotypes led to the highest estimated annual farm income for \{HC\} communities (1280 US$) but was less favourable for LC. The modelling results showed that the best development strategy depends on various factors such as production costs, access to the markets and to irrigation and availability of different feed resources.

Unanswered questions relate to the propensity of farmers in conflict affected areas to conserve forests for climate change mitigation. Such questions include, for what reasons and under what circumstances would such farmer participate in climate change mitigation activities? In this paper we address these questions by developing an econometric Logit model to understand factors influencing the propensity to conserve forest of farmers from 14 villages in Colombia. These villages are located in a region recognized as a stronghold of guerrilla insurgencies and as the center for illegal crop cultivation. The region was selected as it is also the proposed target area for piloting Colombian government \{REDD\} + activities. A household survey (n = 90) showed that four explanatory variables are significantly related to the ‘propensity to conserve forest’. ‘Harvest of non-timber forest products’ (specifically bush meat) positively influences a farmer's propensity to conserve forest. In contrast, higher ‘percentage of forest area’, ‘deforestation for (the production of) subsistence crops’ and ‘harvest of wood product’, each have a negative influence. Overall, results show an already high propensity to conserve forest among farmers (70% of respondents) and indicate their growing propensity toward the conservation of primary forest and management of degraded lands and secondary forest. These results might be attributable to efforts undertaken to reduce the causes of armed-conflicts and ecosystem deterioration, such as enhancement of land tenure security and farmer associations' rules to reduce deforestation. They might also be linked to communities' positive attitudes toward water resources conservation. We conclude that most farmers will not oppose forest conservation as long as it is compatible with their respective livelihood priorities. "

In many regions, however, daily weather data of sufficient quality and duration are not available. To overcome this limitation, we evaluated a new method to create long-term weather series based on a few years of observed daily temperature data (hereafter called propagated data). The propagated data are comprised of uncorrected gridded solar radiation from the Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource dataset from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA–POWER), rainfall from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) dataset, and location-specific calibration of NASA–POWER Tmax and Tmin using a limited amount of observed daily temperature data. The distributions of simulated yields of maize, rice, or wheat with propagated data were compared with simulated yields using observed weather data at 18 sites in North and South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Other sources of weather data typically used in crop modeling for locations without long-term observed weather data were also included in the comparison: (i) uncorrected NASA–POWER weather data and (ii) generated weather data using the MarkSim weather generator. Results indicated good agreement between yields simulated with propagated weather data and yields simulated using observed weather data. For example, the distribution of simulated yields using propagated data was within 10% of the simulated yields using observed data at 78% of locations and degree of yield stability (quantified by coefficient of variation) was very similar at 89% of locations. In contrast, simulated yields based entirely on uncorrected NASA–POWER data or generated weather data using MarkSim were within 10% of yields simulated using observed data in only 44 and 33% of cases, respectively, and the bias was not consistent across locations and crops. We conclude that, for most locations, 3 years of observed daily Tmax and Tmin data would allow creation of a robust weather data set for simulation of long-term mean yield and yield stability of major cereal crops.

For semi-arid regions in particular, inadequate and highly variable rainfall and short growing periods limit yield potential and create a risky primary production environment. However, short-season crop varieties offer a promising option for farming with increased uncertainties. Against this background, the aim of this work was to collect field trial data for multiple seasons in Eastern Kenya to better calibrate the existing \{APSIM\} (Agricultural Production System sIMulator) legume models for short-season varieties of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)., cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) and lablab (Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet) and to evaluate the performance of the adapted models in terms of biomass production and yield. Finally with the use of a simulation study, the impact of management options (e.g. sowing time, planting density) and future climate predictions on the overall production potential of the different short-season grain legumes was explored. Results indicate that decisions on optimal sowing times will become more important with shortened growing periods to take full advantage of in-season rainfall. Short-season cultivars of beans were advantageous in extreme short growing periods with external droughts due to their very short maturity time. Lablab seemed to cope best with high in season rainfall variability producing stable yields across a range of rainfall scenarios independent of future climate predictions. Cowpea instead was out yielding beans and lablab in wet years and had a very high biomass production. Consequently, using the full diversity of available short-season legumes can function as an essential part of a sustainable risk management strategy to design more resilient farming systems and increase food security in semi-arid Eastern Kenya. Finally, if well calibrated and tested, simulations models have proved to be an excellent tool for ex-ante assessment of agricultural management interventions in the view of future climate change. "

Malawi has seen significant efforts in addressing the availability of agricultural inputs at village level in the last few years; for example, the improvement of rural agro-dealer networks. Nevertheless inputs are still difficult to obtain for many remote smallholder farmers. Spatial analysis can help in the expansion of input stockists, especially agro-dealer networks, by assessing the coverage of existing input outlets and deriving optimum locations for village-level input stockists. We address three research questions. First, what is the locational efficiency of the current village-level stockists of inputs (Citizens Network for Foreign Affairs – Rural Agricultural Market Development Trust trained network of agro dealers and public sector)? Secondly, how many village-level stockists of markets are needed to reach 60% of the population in the central region of Malawi within one hour? Finally we address the potential spatial components of the sustainability of input stockists relating to the potential demand from smallholder farmers and the access to bulk supplies. The problem of finding the optimum location for village-level stockists of markets is addressed in two stages, using spatial analysis in conjunction with location–allocation models. First, the locational efficiency of the existing network of stockists of inputs is determined, followed by the establishment of a set of optimal sites for village-level stockists of inputs. A final step explores the viability of stockists and calculates the population surrounding the stockists taking into account competition from other sources of inputs and the accessibility of the selected stockists to potential wholesalers who are bulk distributors of farm inputs. Our results show that locational efficiency can be assessed in terms of the differential access of households to resources and transport. Often, these differences are not considered in covering problems and can have a large effect on the physical access to inputs. The results can be used to define which areas are inherently difficult to serve with agricultural inputs and could inform efforts to provide incentives to remote areas. Further implications for input policies in Malawi are that improvements in road infrastructure might not directly benefit the poorest farmers (if they are walking) but could serve to reduce the wholesale prices and therefore the retail price. In addition, the improvement in roads might increase the number of potential customers of any particular stockist, with economies of scale allowing the reduction of prices while ensuring a satisfactory profit margin for the stockist. The results of our models imply that Citizens Network for Foreign Affairs may need to train stockists over a wider area to increase the access to inputs of those smallholder farmers with least resources.

Maize grain yield was highest in the previously not cropped bush control and lowest in the previous Flemingia system.

Maize grain yield was highest when tillage was combined with fertilizer application, significantly higher from individual tillage or fertilizer application. Tilled only and fertilized only produced higher yields than no-till and no fertilizer.

In most cases, policymakers focus on extensively forested areas where the flows of ecosystem services between agriculture and the environment is generally characterized by massive flows of carbon and soil nutrients from forests to agriculture. In these forest margin areas the stock of primary forest is eventually exhausted and the cheap ingredients provided by nature to agriculture become increasingly scarce. At this point, policy interest generally wanes, and agriculture and the environment begin slow declines in ecosystem service exchange, often with negative consequences for rural poverty. How does one promote increased flows of ecosystem services from agricultural lands without increasing poverty when forests and soils have been depleted? Can the standard instruments, e.g., payments for ecosystem services, be effective in such situations, and if so, do the costs to society of securing these services increase? Here we focus on the flows of ecosystem services at the end of the cycle of converting primary forest to agriculture. Primary data from the Bragantina area in the southeastern Brazilian Amazon, an area cleared of primary forest decades ago, are used to characterize smallholder production systems, to describe the flows of ecosystem services into and from these systems, and to develop a bioeconomic model of smallholder agriculture capable of predicting the effects of several types of policy action on ecosystem services provided by and to agriculture, and on-farm household incomes and food self-reliance. Of particular interest is the Proambiente Pilot Program in Brazil, which uses smallholder payment schemes to induce farmers to manage land and forest resources in ways that generate more ecosystem services. Baseline results suggest that smallholder agriculture leads to a gradual loss of ecosystem services (mainly above-ground and root carbon) provided by secondary forest fallows, and that reduction in fallow age leads to reductions in plant diversity. Intensifying agricultural activities accelerates this process, but considerably increases smallholder incomes. Paying farmers for ecosystem services linked to the retention of secondary forests and the Proambiente program both increase area in forest fallow, but the latter substantially reduces farm income because of input use restrictions. In general, programs aiming to promote the production of ecosystem services should not limit farmers' choices of ways to provide them. Employment and food self-reliance issues associated with policy options for increasing on-farm stocks of carbon and plant biodiversity are also explored. "

Technologies evaluated consisted of the traditional maize (Zea mays L.) – bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) intercrop, maize – Desmodium (Desmodium uncinatum (Jacq.) DC.) push–pull intercrop, Crotalaria (Crotalaria ochroleuca G. Don) – maize rotation, and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) – maize rotation. Within each of these systems, imazapyr-coated herbicide-resistant maize (IR-maize) and fertilizer were super-imposed as sub-plot factors. The push–pull system was observed to significantly reduce Striga emergence and stemborer damage from the second season onwards. IR-maize reduced and delayed Striga emergence from the first cropping season. Differences in Striga emergence and stemborer damage between the other systems were not significantly different. After five cropping seasons, the Striga seedbank was significantly higher in the maize-bean intercrop system than in the push–pull system under both maize varieties while the rotational systems had intermediate values not different from the day zero values. Under IR-maize, the Striga seedbank was significantly lower than under local maize for all cropping systems. Maize yields varied between seasons, districts, and cropping systems. Yields in the push–pull system were higher than in the maize-bean intercrop after two seasons and in the absence of mid-season drought stress. Both maize and soybean responded significantly to fertilizer application for both districts and for most seasons. The various interventions did not substantially affect various soil fertility-related parameters after five seasons. In the short term, IR-maize integrated in a push–pull system is the most promising option to reduce Striga while the rotational systems may need a longer timeframe to reduce the Striga seedbank. Finally, farmer-led evaluation of the various technologies will determine which of those is really most acceptable under the prevailing farming conditions. "

Success with adopting \{CA\} on farms in Africa has been limited, despite more than two decades of research and development investments. Through analyzing past and on-going \{CA\} experiences in a set of case studies, this paper seeks to better understand the reasons for the limited adoption of \{CA\} and to assess where, when and for whom \{CA\} works best. \{CA\} is analyzed and understood within a framework that distinguishes the following scales of analysis: field, farm, village and region. \{CA\} has a potential to increase crop yields in the fields, especially under conditions of erratic rainfall and over the long-term as a result of a gradual increase of overall soil quality. The impact on farm income with the practice of \{CA\} on some fields of the farm is far less evident, and depends on the type of farm. The lack of an immediate increase in farm income with \{CA\} explains in many cases the non-adoption of CA. Smallholders have often short-term time horizons: future benefits do not adequately outweigh their immediate needs. Another key factor that explains the limited \{CA\} adoption in mixed crop-livestock farming systems is the fact that crop harvest residues are preferably used as fodder for livestock, preventing their use as soil cover. Finally, in most case studies good markets for purchase of inputs and sale of produce – a key prerequisite condition for adoption of new technologies – were lacking. The case studies show clear evidence for the need to target end users (not all farmers are potential end user of CA) and adapt \{CA\} systems to the local circumstances of the farmers, considering in particular the farmer's investment capacity in the practice of \{CA\} and the compatibility of \{CA\} with his/her production objectives and existing farming activities. The identification of situations where, when and for whom \{CA\} works will help future development agents to better target their investments with CA. "

In contrast to other so far characterized quinic-acid esters, \{DFQA\} exists in a chair conformation with the carboxylic group in the axial orientation. It accumulates in older parts of the root system, but not in root apices or shoots. Higher levels were found in B. ruziziensis, which is poorly adapted to infertile acid soils, than in well adapted B. decumbens. \{DFQA\} was also found in the soil, most likely as a result of root decay, because it was not detected in root exudates of plants cultivated in solution culture.

The investigation of several metrics that were initially developed for landscape ecology analysis constitutes one method. In this study we applied a method of landscape metrics to quantify the spatial configuration of surface micro-topography and erosion-related features, in order to generate a possible complementary tool for environmental management. In a 3.7 m wide and 9.7 m long soil box used during a rainfall simulation study, digital images were systematically acquired in four instances: (a) when the soil was dry; (b) after a short duration rain for initial wetting; (c) after the first erosive rain; and (d) after the 2nd erosive rain. Thirteen locations were established in the box and digital photos were taken at these locations with the camera positioned at the same orthogonal distance from the soil surface under the same ambient light intensity. Digital photos were converted into bimodal images and seven landscape metrics were analyzed: percentage of land, number of patches, density of patches, largest patch index, edge density, shape index, and fractal dimension. Digital images were an appropriate tool because they can generate data very quickly. The landscape metrics were sensitive to changes in soil surface micro-morphology especially after the 1st erosive rain event, indicating significant erosional feature development between the initial wetting and first erosive rainfall. The method is considered suitable for spatial patterns of soil micro-topography evolution from rainfall events that bear similarity to landscape scale pattern evolution from eco-hydrological processes. Although much more study is needed for calibrating the landscape metrics at the micro-scale, this study is a step forward in demonstrating the advantages of the method. "

This study is conducted at a river-basin scale to (1) identify land degradation hotspots in a basin or sub-basin, and (2) assess the correspondence and divergence of land degradation assessed by \{NDVI\} shifts with and without accounting for atmospheric fertilization with that based on soil erosion assessment at a sub-basin scale.

The results were compared with the critical zone of soil loss in the White Volta sub-basin derived from a spatially distributed soil erosion model, validated by field-measured data. A spatial comparison of the above studies revealed that the biomass productivity (NDVI)-based land degradation assessment grossly underestimated the extent to which soil is being lost, unless a correction was included to account for atmospheric fertilization. Based on inter-annual \{NDVI\} signals land degradation was evident in about 8% of the Volta basin's landmass, but when accounting for atmospheric fertilization, as much as 65% of the land is losing some of its vital attributes such as soil quality or vegetation productivity.

Still partly resembling the design of the state orders imposed during the planned economy, cotton production policy is used to ensure the stability of national export revenues at the expense of farm incomes. In this paper we argue that modifying the cotton policy may improve the situation with farm incomes and food production, and reduce pressure on water resources, the availability of which in Central Asia is expected to decrease. To conduct an ex ante analysis of cotton policy modifications intended to improve rural incomes, a bio-economic optimization model was developed at the level of a water users association in the Khorezm region of Uzbekistan. Policy simulations showed that abolishing the current cotton policy would be a more economically attractive option for farmers and also increase grain production rather than various forms of this policy modification. However, abolishing the current cotton policy can present pressure on irrigation water resources as farmers would opt to cultivate water-intensive crops, thus requiring supplemental policies and institutions for sustainable resources use.

With expansion of arable land and resultant decline in grazing resources, crop residues are becoming an increasingly important component of livestock feeds. This demand for livestock feeds has implications for the long-term sustainability of such systems since failure to return biomass to soils has implications for soil quality and the capacity of soils to support long-term productivity. Biomass allocation patterns are likely to vary with overall level of productivity and hence availability. In this study we used a household survey to quantify crop residue allocation patterns across a gradient of productivity in Eastern Africa focusing on two sites in Ethiopia and one in Kenya. We assessed the underlying determinants of crop residue allocation patterns with a view to understanding how productivity increases through intensification will influence biomass allocation in Eastern Africa and how livelihood and natural resource management objectives could be optimized. Results showed that farmers strongly favour allocation of residues to livestock feeding but that allocation to soil increases along the productivity gradient. This reduced feeding to livestock and increased allocation to soil fertility is associated with smaller farm sizes leading to reduced animal traction needs for tillage, increased overall livestock productivity, increased use of inputs and a reduced reliance on farm-based activities in overall livelihood strategies. The implications of these trends are that productivity increases in smallholder systems are likely to reduce pressure on biomass in the long term and that measures that enhance the prospects for farmers to intensify their production systems are likely to increase soil health and sustainability objectives in general. A key conclusion of the work is that intensification of livestock production could reduce crop residue allocation to soils with long term implications for soil productivity. "

A common response of farmers is to shorten fallow periods, which can lead to a decline in crop yields, due to incomplete nutrient replenishment. However, whether farmers change their management of soil and nutrients according to the fallow length is not known. A survey was carried out in southern Cameroon in 1995 to establish factors determining farmers’ nutrient management practices (NMPs). Three classes of indigenous \{NMPs\} were identified: crop placement, mulching, and the use of inputs. Crop placement comprised intentional cultivation of certain crops in ash patches or near to tree trunks and stumps. Mulching was done with weeds and crop residues, on the soil surface next to crops or in planting holes. Crop placement was found in 88.8% of fields and mulching in 57.4%, while inputs were used in only 1.7%. Nutrient management seemed to be restricted to an optimal allocation of crops to nutrient sources in the field. Relationships were weak between the frequency of crop placement or mulching and indices of land or labor availability. Fallow length seems to be negatively correlated to crop placement at rotten trunks or stumps or in ash patches and positively to placement near recently felled trees. Crop placement and mulching of crop residues were used less often in simplified crop associations than in traditional intercrops. Nutrient inputs were mainly given to monocrops. Application of purchased inputs concentrated on commercial crops. Most respondents knew the advantages and risks of currently practiced methods, but often lacked information on the use of locally available internal inputs (refuse, kitchen ash, manure). Application of internal inputs was considered too labor demanding. The use of purchased inputs was limited by high prices. Soil fertility was in most cases not regarded as a problem. "

Hot-water treatment reduced nematode infestation to about 30% of that found in untreated plants and increased rhizome survival by 11%. Fertilizer application increased the proportion of bunch-producing plants from 44 to 65% through reduced die-back, toppling and pseudostem breakage during the dry season but had no effect on bunch weight per plant.

Fertilized and hot-water treated plots produced 20.8 Mg ha−1. First ratoon yields were unaffected by fertilizer, but increased due to hot-water treatment from 0.81 to 5.0 Mg ha−1. Plant-crop bunch weight decreased with increasing time between planting and harvest. Mean bunch fresh weight was negatively correlated with an index of root nematode infestation and positively correlated with the number of living roots. For the plant-crop and plant-crop plus ratoon yields, the yield increase due to combined use of fertilizer and hot-water treatment was larger than increases attained by individual measures. Thus combination of hot-water treatment and fertilizer had a synergistic effect on plantain fresh bunch yield, justifying introduction of both measures simultaneously. "

In this study, we determined the effect of parasitism by Binodoxys communis (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) on wing development and flight of the summer alate stage of the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines (Hemiptera: Aphididae), and quantified the effect of aphid flight duration on subsequent B. communis development. Parasitism by B. communis was allowed at alatoid 3rd (L3) and 4th instar (L4) nymphal stages of A. glycines and subsequent aphid flight was measured using a computer-monitored flight mill. Only 25% of aphids parasitized as \{L3\} alatoid nymphs produced normal winged adults, compared to 100% of \{L4\} alatoids. While flight performance of aphids that had been parasitized as 4th-instar alatoid nymphs 24 or 48 h prior to testing was similar to that of unparasitized alates of identical age, it declined sharply for alates that had been parasitized as 4th-instar alatoid nymphs 72 and 96 h prior to testing. Parasitoid larval and pupal development times, percent mummification and adult emergence rates did not differ between treatments in which aphids had flown over varying durations.

In the current study we demonstrate the utility of Landsat \{ETM\} + imagery for landscape-level assessments of land degradation risk and soil condition through a combination of systematic field methodologies, infrared (IR) spectroscopy and ensemble modeling techniques. The approaches presented allow for the development of maps at spatial scales that are appropriate for making spatially explicit management recommendations. Field data and soil samples collected from 38 sites, each 100 km2, were used to develop predictive models that were applied as part of a case study to an independent dataset from four sites in Ethiopia. The predictions based on Landsat reflectance were robust, with R-squared values of 0.86 for pH and 0.79 for soil organic carbon (SOC), and were used to create predicted surfaces (maps) for these soil properties. Further, models were developed for the mapping of the occurrence of soil erosion and root depth restrictions within 50 cm of the soil surface (RDR50), with an accuracy of about 80% for both variables. The maps generated from these models were used to assess the spatial distribution of soil pH and SOC, which are important indicators of soil condition, and land degradation risk factors in order to target relevant management options.

Eight commonly used pesticides were applied onto passion fruits cultivated in Colombia. Pesticide concentrations were measured periodically (between application and harvest) in whole fruits and fruit pulp. Measured concentrations were compared with predicted residues calculated with a dynamic and crop-specific pesticide uptake model, namely dynamiCROP. The model accounts for the time between pesticide application and harvest, the time between harvest and consumption, the amount of spray deposition on plant surfaces, uptake processes, dilution due to crop growth, degradation in plant components, and reduction due to food processing (peeling). Measured and modelled residues correspond well (r2 = 0.88–0.99), with all predictions falling within the 90% confidence interval of the measured values. A mean error of 43% over all studied pesticides was observed between model estimates and measurements. The fraction of pesticide applied during cultivation that is eventually ingested by humans is on average 10−4–10−6, depending on the time period between application and ingestion and the processing step considered. Model calculations and intake fractions via fruit consumption based on experimental data corresponded well for all pesticides with a deviation of less than a factor of 2. Pesticide residues in fruits measured at recommended harvest dates were all below European Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) and therefore do not indicate any violation of international regulatory thresholds.

In this study, we employ life cycle assessment to assess the environmental impact of tomato production in a key growing area, the Alto Ricaurte province. A regional farmer survey (n = 117) was the primary data source, while secondary data for background processes were based on Ecoinvent v. 2.0 and \{LCAFoods\} databases. An uncertainty analysis for the primary data source was carried out considering the high variability in local management practices. All resources consumption and emissions were allocated to a functional unit of one ton of tomatoes, restricting the boundaries of the system from raw material extraction up to the farm gate. We applied the \{CML2001\} v.2.05 impact assessment method including 10 midpoint categories. The production system consisted of six stages: nursery, infrastructure, machinery, fertilization, pest management and waste management. At the inventory level, results exhibited a high dispersion indicating the wide range of products and doses applied by growers, especially for the fertilization and pest management stages. Overall, the infrastructure stage had the largest burden for most impact categories. The fertilization stage was the second highest burden for abiotic depletion, acidification and eutrophication potentials. The waste management stage was the main contributor to the overall impact for freshwater and marine aquatic ecotoxicity potentials. The impacts for each stage were largely determined by the production of agricultural inputs. Uncertainty analysis showed positive skewed distributions, with a few growers extending the tail towards the highest environmental impact side. The main stages contributing to the uncertainty on the outcome were the fertilization, pest management and waste stages. "

In this study, the importance of a broad range of plant species as overwintering hosts for each Adelphocoris sp. was compared. Nymphal emergence from a total of 126 plant species was monitored at two distinct locations. The eggs of A. suturalis successfully eclosed from un-plowed cotton field soil and 115 plant species, primarily pastures, weeds and agricultural crops. The eggs of A. lineolatus successfully eclosed from 40 plant species, mainly pastures and weeds. Finally, A. fasciaticollis overwintered on 35 plant species, primarily tree species, weeds and agricultural crops. In conclusion, the most common and widely distributed mirid species, A. suturalis, overwintered on a comparatively broader range of plants compared to the other two species. These observations help to understand the differences in geographical distribution and abundance of the three Adelphocoris species, and constitute the basis for forecasting and pest management protocols for Adelphocoris spp. in China.

The algorithm is tested using a simulated dataset to compare results with ordinal regression, and to test the stability of the model with increasingly sparse calibration data. For all but the richest input datasets it outperforms ordinal regression, as determined using Cohen’s weighted kappa. The model also performs well with sparse datasets.

The experimental residence time distribution (RTDexp) was calculated by the outflow of the starch concentration. Using Matlab®, the \{RTDexp\} was compared to the theoretical residence time distribution (RTDth). The dynamic model obtained was built up on Simulink® and tested with four different strategies of recycling methods. Sedimented starch was collected from the different types of processes; the pH value and the titratable acidity of starch were then measured. The results showed a good correlation between \{RTDexp\} and RTDth. The reactors were described by a model of two mixed tanks in series.

Complete earthworms were collected from samplings performed in native savannahs and man-made pastures of the eastern plains of Colombia and from a poplar grove (Populus sp.) in Central Spain. A strong correlation between the preserved fresh weight and the maximum preclitellar diameter was found for all the species studied. Three types of models have provided a convenient method to estimate earthworm biomass: (i) linear for almost all the species; (ii) exponential for a large Neotropical anecic species, Martiodrilus carimaguensis (Glossoscolecidae); and (iii) second degree polynomic equation.

This pest invaded China at the onset of the 20th century, possibly through repeated introductions from several different locations worldwide. In this paper, we describe different behavioral parameters of this Hubei P. gossypiella strain under laboratory and field conditions. Using an infra-red video recorder, we observed (nocturnal) emergence, flight and mating activities, and oviposition patterns. Moth emergence started from 13:00 and continued up till 23:00. Under laboratory and field conditions, 2-7-d-old moths initiated flight around sunset, peaked 50 min later and gradually declined until 04:00. Although mating started immediately after darkness (i.e., 20:00), mating behavior was most intense from 23:00 to 03:40. Oviposition also showed distinct time-related patterns, with approx. 70% eggs laid between 20:00 and 22:00. In the studies of the relationship between flight and oviposition, the duration of flight had an effect on oviposition. The 1-d-old moths flown for 6 and 12 h began oviposition earlier than the unflown ones, and the 6-h flight had no effect on the egg production. However, the longevity of the flown moths was shortened after flight. In addition, the peaks of oviposition for the flown moths were advanced 2–3 d. The age when the moths flied affected the oviposition of adult moths. The earlier the moths started to fly after emergence, the greater the fecundity they had. The average egg production of moths flown for 24 h was less than that of non-flown moths which were of the same age. Both flight and delay in mating could advance the oviposition peak. Our study provides detailed insights in nocturnal activities and the reproductive biology of local P. gossypiella populations, which could be employed to fine-tune current pest management programs in China.

Along with the fast development in molecular biology and biotechnology, a large amount of biological data is available for genetic studies of important breeding traits in plants, which in turn allows the conduction of genotypic selection in the breeding process. However, gene information has not been effectively used in crop improvement because of the lack of appropriate tools. The simulation approach can utilize the vast and diverse genetic information, predict the cross performance, and compare different selection methods. Thus, the best performing crosses and effective breeding strategies can be identified. QuLine is a computer tool capable of defining a range, from simple to complex genetic models, and simulating breeding processes for developing final advanced lines. On the basis of the results from simulation experiments, breeders can optimize their breeding methodology and greatly improve the breeding efficiency. In this article, the underlying principles of simulation modeling in crop enhancement is initially introduced, following which several applications of QuLine are summarized, by comparing the different selection strategies, the precision parental selection, using known gene information, and the design approach in breeding. Breeding simulation allows the definition of complicated genetic models consisting of multiple alleles, pleiotropy, epistasis, and genes, by environment interaction, and provides a useful tool for breeders, to efficiently use the wide spectrum of genetic data and information available.

Allioni] in the Central High Plains agricultural region. The study uses fuzzy set logic methods and implements the fuzzy simple additive weighting (FSAW) method through modeling in \{GIS\} raster to analyze Wyoming State’s agricultural land use, and the identified suitability attributes for optimum burclover establishment; the long-term summer diurnal temperature flux, September–October precipitation, and April–July precipitation. Further, the study uses one of the two categories of multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) known as multiple attribute decision making (MADM), to combine the range of each attribute’s possible suitability values in meaningful ways that allow suitability criteria to be evaluated on the basis of low, medium, and high suitability for optimum burclover establishment. The inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation technique interpolated the point shape files of the identified suitability attributes and produced surface maps that allowed characterization of long-term summer diurnal temperature flux and seasonal precipitation for the State of Wyoming. The fuzzy additive weighting and defuzzification methods transformed data from different sources into useful information that can be effectively used to enhance decision making in agriculture. Finally, defuzzification transformed fuzzy scores into useful crisp scores and produced the final output map with calculated centroid. The resulting calculated trapezoidal centroid map with useful crisp scores from transformed disparate fuzzy data demonstrates that spatial suitability analysis can be used effectively to enhance decision making in agricultural planning and management. Likewise, the effective ranking of relative suitability of Wyoming agricultural land for optimum establishment of Laramie Tifton burclover validates the value of using fuzzy set logic and additive weighting approaches for ex-ante assessment of the potential suitability of agricultural technologies.

To analyze the gains from cooperation, we simulate various cooperative game solutions over seven cotton producing farms in a bio-economic model of a water users association. The study results show that cooperation can fulfill multiple objectives: ensure the cotton production targets, increase farm profits and grain production, and reduce the pressure on water resources. We investigate a situation where farms differ in soil quality and distance to irrigation canals. The proposed modification in the national cotton procurement policy that utilizes the comparative advantages of cooperating cotton-producing farms can make the cooperative agreements economically attractive even among heterogeneous farms. It should be noted that the benefits offered from farm cooperation may be smaller or even vanish if transaction costs grow excessively in response to the heterogeneity of participating farms and the size of the cooperative. In addition, the economic benefits will not necessarily be distributed equally among participating farms and thus require the development of fair division rules. In this respect, net gain allocation schemes based on production costs, size and cotton output of farm cooperation are presented and discussed against the distinct social features of rural Uzbekistan.

In doing so we evaluate the quality and scientific rigor of that evidence, identify the key conclusions that emerge from the literature, and assess whether these conclusions are consistent across the sources. The results of the assessment show that while some specific topics are consistently and rigorously documented, thus substantiating some of the claims found in the literature, other areas of research still lack the level of disaggregated data or an appropriate methodology to reach consistency and robust conclusions. More specifically, the analysis reveals that while fish contributes undeniably to nutrition and food security, the links between fisheries/aquaculture and poverty alleviation are complex and still unclear. In particular national and household level studies on fisheries’ contributions to poverty alleviation lack good conceptual models and produce inconsistent results. For aquaculture, national and household studies tend to focus on export value chains and use diverse approaches. They suggest some degree of poverty alleviation and possibly other positive outcomes for adopters, but these outcomes also depend on the small-scale farming contexts and on whether adoption was emergent or due to development assistance interventions. Impacts of fish trade on food security and poverty alleviation are ambiguous and confounded by a focus on international trade and a lack of consistent methods. The influences of major drivers (decentralization, climate change, demographic transition) are still insufficiently documented and therefore poorly understood. Finally the evaluation reveals that evidence-based research and policy narratives are often disconnected, with some of the strongest and long-lasting policy narratives lacking any strong and rigorous evidence-based validation. Building on these different results, this paper identifies six key gaps facing policy-makers, development practitioners, and researchers. "

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of land use on ant and termite communities in Colombian savanna landscapes, and to assess whether this impact is associated with the modification of soil physical and chemical properties. Ants and termites were sampled in five different agricultural and semi-natural systems across three regions of the eastern Colombian Llanos: 1) annual crops (maize, soy and rice), 2) rubber plantations, 3) oil palm plantations, 4) improved pastures and 5) semi-natural savannas. A total of 91 ant and 16 termite species were collected. Multivariate analysis revealed that termite communities significantly differed among land uses, but not between regions. Ant communities differed between regions and land uses. Based on between group analyses of termite communities, three groups of land use can be distinguished: one formed by semi-natural savannas and improved pastures, the second by oil palm plantations and annual crops and the third by rubber plantations. General linear models applied separately to each species found 19 significant associations of soil physical or chemical properties, land uses or regions with 15 ant species and 14 significant associations with 6 termite species. Taken together, there is a strong association between land use and ant or termite communities and this influence is likely due to changes in ant and termite habitats resulting from agricultural practices such as tillage, fertilization, and lime addition. These results suggest that annual crops are the most detrimental land use for termites and ants, because their communities are highly sensitive to vegetation cover and agricultural practices such as tillage. Maintaining a high diversity of soil engineers and the ecosystem services they provide likely depends on the maintenance of natural ecosystems in the landscape and the adoption of practices that reduce impacts on soil ecosystem engineers when native ecosystems have been transformed into agricultural systems.

For α in the 0–1 range, pieces of plantain pulp exhibited a lower rapidly digestible starch fraction (30%) and a higher resistant starch fraction (33%) than the flour paste, suggesting some structural effects. Both Weibull and exponential models showed a good fit for α over temperature range and starch digestibility fractions over α. Although no explicit relationship was established between the intact pulp structure and grinded flour state of plantain, the evaluation of the degree of starch gelatinization and digestibility of a plantain flour paste, could be used to predict the gelatinization and digestibility behaviour of plantain starch in entire pieces of pulp.

The goal of the study was to identify hotspots of energy use and \{GHG\} emissions, as well as sustainable practices, with a view to uncover opportunities to improve the environmental performance of cassava starch production. \{VLT\} required 2527 MJ/t starch, mainly (77%) from biogas used to dry starch, but was the most efficient in terms of water use (10 m3/t starch) due to the practice of water recycling between unit operations. \{ST1\} and \{ST2\} were similar in terms of electricity use (212 MJ/t starch), and were able to rely on solar energy to dry starch, due to the small volumes of production. In contrast, water use varied from 21 to 62 m3/t starch due to differences in the design of the rasping and starch recovery (extraction) operations. \{GHG\} emissions were 149, 93 and 105 kg CO2eq/t starch for VLT, \{ST1\} and \{ST2\} respectively. For \{ST1\} and ST2, methane emissions from untreated wastewater were the main contribution to \{GHG\} emissions. For VLT, methane was captured to produce biogas and to dry starch, and the main contribution to \{GHG\} emissions was the use of non-renewable grid electricity. Biogas technology was adopted in the past 12 years in the case of VLT. Previously fuel oil was used instead of biogas, which resulted in \{GHG\} emissions of 539 kg CO2eq/t starch. \{VLT\} used markedly more electricity than \{ST1\} and ST2, which was necessary to ensure the high output and consistent starch quality. Strategies to reduce the impacts of cassava starch production could focus on (1) increasing the energy efficiency of the drying operation, in order to make more biogas available for other uses such as production of renewable electricity; (2) improving the design of some unit operations with regards to water and energy efficiency; and (3) promoting the transfer and adoption of water recycling practices.

Water shortage caused reduction in mean conductance to &lt;1 mm s−1 at which level the control of water loss maintained leaf water potential &gt; −1.5 \{MPa\} at all times. Stress plots recovered more slowly during the late afternoon but during the day had higher leaf water potentials than the controls. At the same levels of leaf water potential the conductance of M Mex 59 was less than that of M Col 22 in both control and stress plots. Measurements are also reported of the stomatal distribution, density and pore size for both fully expanded leaves and those whose expansion was seriously restricted by the water shortage. "

abstract = "Densities of maize (Zea mays L.) and climbing beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) were studied in monoculture and in a number of intercrop combinations over two seasons in the Cauca Valley of Colombia (4°N Latitude, 1000 m elevation). Maize densities from 1.5 to 10.5 plants per m2 were combined with bean densities from 5.6 to 37.5 plants per m2. Bean/ maize density combinations included 48 treatments in the first season and 25 treatments in the second season. Yields and yield components of both crops were measured. Maize density had a greater influence than bean density on both maize and bean yields and yield components. Maize is taller and shades the developing bean crop. A vigorous intercropped climbing bean reduced maize yield in the second season, though not in the first. Maize yields were positively correlated with maize density and ears per plant. Bean seed yield was positively correlated with pods per m2 and pods per plant, but not with bean density. Bean yields and yield components were consistently and negatively correlated with maize yields and yield components: negative correlations between maize and bean yields were r = −0.84∗∗and r = −0.72∗∗ for the first and second seasons. Per plant yield is reduced in both intercrop components by increased density of either crop. One additional maize plant per m2 reduces per plant maize grain yield about five to six times more than one additional bean plant added to the intercrop. Bean yield per plant is reduced two to three times as much by adding one additional maize plant per m2 compared to adding one additional bean plant per m2. Intra-specific competition appears to be more intense than inter-specific competition. Effects of one additional plant of either species decrease at higher densities in the intercrop as both components compete for scarce growth factors. Total grain yields did not show an advantage for either monoculture or intercropping at higher maize densities. Land equivalent ratios consistently were greater than one, and specific combinations reached \{LER\} = 1.20. Total protein yield was higher for intercrop systems over all density combinations. Net income was higher for monoculture beans and for intercrop patterns than for monoculture maize. Results suggest that a range in maize/ climbing bean density combinations can be used to obtain maximum or near maximum total production and net income. "

To determine whether optimum density combinations existed for intercropping, maize densities from 1 to 10 plants per m2 were combined with bean densities from 10 to 40 plants per m2. Yields and yield components of both crops were measured, and net income and biological efficiency of intercrop patterns compared to monoculture of each component crop. Maximum maize yields in monoculture were 3640 kg ha−1 with a tall hydbrid in the first season, and 7000 kg ha−1 with a semi-dwarf hybrid in the second season. Bean yield maxima in monoculture were about 2100 kg ha−1 in each season. Highest intercrop yields were attained with low to moderate maize densities and a wide range of bush bean densities. Higher total grain yields were found in intercrops in each season than in the best monoculture treatment. Bush bean yield per plant was reduced by increasing bean or maize plants per m2 in the intercrop, but not proportionally to the number of additional plants. Thus, bush beans under severe competition are more efficient in use of scarce resources. One tall maize plant was equivalent in competition to three-and-a-half to four bush bean plants, while one semi-dwarf maize plant was equivalent to two to three bush bean plants. Net income generally was higher in the intercrop patterns, followed by monoculture beans and monoculture maize. Biological efficiency as measured by the Land Equivalent Ratio was higher in intercrop than in monoculture, and one intercrop treatment in the first season showed a 65% advantage over the single crop alternatives.

To study the impact of this factor on competition and yield, four bean cultivars were intercropped with maize using different relative planting dates for the two component crops in the pattern. These intercropping patterns were compared with monocultures of each crop in two successive seasons in the Cauca Valley of Colombia. Yields of beans, the lower story crop, were strongly affected by maize competition. The first crop planted in each pattern was less affected compared to monoculture than the crop which was planted later. Maize and bean yields were negatively correlated across cropping patterns and dates of planting. Competition from maize also reduced bean components of yield in all four bean cultivars. Yield reduction of climbing beans (compared to monoculture) due to intercropping was greater than yield reduction in the other three bean cultivars. Bean seed yield per plant, pods per plant and pods per m2 were significantly correlated with maize yield. Maize yield was reduced by early competition from an advanced planting of each of the four bean cultivars. Nineteen of the 20 intercrop combinations (four bean cultivars × five dates) had \{LER\} (Land Equivalent Ratio) values greater than unity in both seasons. Highest \{LER\} values above 1.5 indicate a biological potential for intercropping to produce 50% more under these conditions than monoculture. "

These samples were analyzed for dry matter (DM) and nutrient content. Soil samples were also taken at monthly intervals and analyzed. Results indicated that in cassava \{DM\} accumulation was slow during the first 2 months, increased rapidly during the next 4 months and slowed down during the final 6 months as \{DM\} production was partly offset by leaf fall. At harvest (12 months) \{DM\} was present mainly in roots, followed by stem, leaves and petioles. Nutrient concentrations varied between plant parts and with the age of both the tissue and the plant. The concentration of most nutrients was highest between 2 and 3 months and then declined. Each nutrient had its own particular concentration profile within the plant. Thus, N, P and S concentrations tended to be high in the leaves, while those of K, Ca and Mg were high in petioles and stem; the Mn concentration was particularly high in petioles, whereas Fe concentration was low in petioles but high in roots. B and Cu were evently distributed within the plant. Most nutrients accumulated initially in leaves and stem, but were translocated to roots in the latter part of the growth cycle. Only Ca, Mg and Mn accumulated more in stems than roots. Removal of accumulated nutrients in the root harvest can seriously deplete nutrient reserves in the soil, particularly that of K, and to a lesser extent for N. Soil pH, exchangeable Al, Ca, Mg as well as available P were not greatly affected by plant growth, while exchangeable K decreased markedly during the crop cycle. "

The relationship between the yield of bean cultivars and maize when intercropped was negative. For each additional kilo of bean yield, between 1 and 2 kg of maize yield were lost due to competition. The regression slope could be used to predict the yield of maize in monoculture, and the maize yield reduction served as an index of the competitive ability of bean varieties. Bean yields averaged 1000 kg/ha, with maximum yields up to 2400 kg/ha, when intercropped with maize. Maize yields were 3500 kg/ha on average, up to a maximum of 5500 kg/ha, when intercropped with beans. The yield reduction of maize was between 15% and 30% when intercropped with beans, but there was no reduction in yield with relay cropping. The most competitive bean varieties yielded the most when intercropped with maize, but these varieties were not necessarily the highest yielding in monoculture. The most competitive bean varieties were taller, more vigorous, and later to maturity. The most competitive maize genotypes were also tall plant types. Somewhat shorter maize plants can give improved net income when intercropped with climbing beans, provided they are resistant to stem lodging. It is probable that greater efficiency of production could be obtained by breeding genotypes, both of beans and maize, which are somewhat less competitive, paying special attention to lodging resistance in maize, and in beans to physiological efficiency under shade, and improved nitrogen fixation.

The loss of leaf area during water stress is shown to be dominated by restricted leaf area development and not by leaf loss. Leaf life was increased under stress. Leaf size was the most sensitive parameter of leaf area production and the most responsive following the release from stress, but apex production and the rate of leaf production per apex were also susceptible.

Relay intercropping allowed a two-fold increase in bean yield compared to associated intercropping (simultaneous planting) with maize but took longer to achieve. Bean equivalent yield per day was slightly higher in associated intercropping. Wide spacing (approximately 1 m between hills) is traditionally used by farmers but narrower spacing significantly improved bean yield when combined with an improved disease-resistant cultivar. Narrower spacing did not affect disease incidence. Maize yield was significantly increased at the narrower spacing in relay intercropping, and slightly decreased in associated intercropping. Potential benefits of introducing a semi-climbing, disease-resistant cultivar like G7908, together with closer spacing and higher density, were indicated by increases in bean yield of 57% in relay intercropping and 250% in associated intercropping.

Amounts of nitrogen fixed ranged from 0.3 to 40 kg N ha−1 12 weeks−1 during the wet season and were greatest with Stylosanthes capitata followed by Centrosema acutifolium and Arachis pintoi mainly as a result of greater legume biomass in the former compared with the latter two species. There were little or no differences amongst the three legumes in kg N fixed t legume DM−1. Amounts of nitrogen fixed per unit area decreased over the 3 year period mainly as a result of a loss of legume biomass. The % N derived from fixation (%Ndfa) was generally greater than 80% in all legumes on both soil types and there were little or no differences in %Ndfa with two levels of fertilization given at establishment. The %Ndfa did not change over time. In a separate experiment with A. pintoi, %Ndfa did decrease with increasing legume proportion in the sward. The results indicate that in tropical pastures sown on low fertility acid soils the amounts of nitrogen fixed by forage legumes are dependent on legume growth and persistence.

New technologies that require labor inputs during such labor-scarce seasons are less likely to be adopted. Financial ex ante assessments of technology alternatives, however, neglect the implications of seasonal labor shortages. Standard returns to labor estimates assume that the value of labor to farmers is constant despite temporary increases in demand. This paper develops an alternative measure, returns to opportunity-costed labor (RTOCL), which discerns the seasonally-changing costs of labor. \{RTOCL\} more accurately reflects farmer decision criteria and serves as a useful measure in ex ante analysis of technology interventions. A case study of a bush fallow agricultural system in the Peruvian Amazon illustrates how seasonal labor shortages lead to farm management tradeoffs that affect the prospects of technology adoption. Two improvements of a new upland rice variety are contrasted: higher yield versus early maturity. Empirical results of an agro-economic mathematical model reveal that the early maturity characteristic enables rice to become more complementary to peak-season labor demands of the agricultural system. This early maturity characteristic permits farmers to cultivate larger areas and reap greater financial benefits than a variety with a high yield characteristic. Model results support the need to address heterogeneous seasonal labor demands when developing and disseminating agricultural technologies intended to benefit resource-poor farmers. "

Soil organisms are extremely diverse and contribute to a wide range of ecosystem services that are essential to the sustainable function of natural and managed ecosystems. The soil organism community can have direct and indirect impacts on land productivity. Direct impacts are those where specific organisms affect crop yield immediately. Indirect effects include those provided by soil organisms participating in carbon and nutrient cycles, soil structure modification and food web interactions that generate ecosystem services that ultimately affect productivity. Recognizing the great biological and functional diversity in the soil and the complexity of ecological interactions it becomes necessary to focus in this paper on soil biota that have a strong linkage to functions which underpin ‘soil based’ ecosystem services. Selected organisms from different functional groups (i.e. microsymbionts, decomposers, elemental transformers, soil ecosystem engineers, soil-borne pest and diseases, and microregulators) are used to illustrate the linkages of soil biota and ecosystem services essential to life on earth as well as with those associated with the provision of goods and the regulation of ecosystem processes. These services are not only essential to ecosystem function but also a critical resource for the sustainable management of agricultural ecosystems. Research opportunities and gaps related to methodological, experimental and conceptual approaches that may be helpful to address the challenge of linking soil biodiversity and function to the provision of ecosystem services and land productivity are discussed. These include: 1) integration of spatial variability research in soil ecology and a focus on ‘hot spots’ of biological activity, 2) using a selective functional group approach to study soil biota and function, 3) combining new and existing methodological approaches that link selected soil organisms, the temporal and spatial dynamics of their function, and their contribution to the provision of selected ‘soil based' ecosystem services, 4) using understanding about hierarchical relationships to manage soil biota and function in cropping systems, 5) using local knowledge about plants as indicators of soil quality, remote sensing and \{GIS\} technologies, and plant-soil biota interactions to help understand the impacts of soil biota at landscape scale, and 6) developing land quality monitoring systems that inform land users about their land's ecosystem service performance, improve capacities to predict and adapt to environmental changes, and support policy and decision-making.

A participatory approach and a methodological guide were developed to identify and classify local indicators of soil quality and relate them to technical soil parameters, and thus develop a common language between farmers, extension workers and scientists. This methodological guide was initially developed and used in Latin America and the Caribbean-LAC (Honduras, Nicaragua, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Dominican Republic), and was later improved during adaptation and use in eastern African (Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia) through a South–South exchange of expertise and experiences. The aim of the methodological guide is to constitute an initial step in the empowerment of local communities to develop a local soil quality monitoring and decision-making system for better management of soil resources. This approach uses consensus building to develop practical solutions to soil management constraints identified, as well as to monitor the impact of management strategies implemented to address these constraints. The particular focus on local and technical indicators of agroecosystem change is useful for providing farmers with early warnings about unobservable changes in soil properties before they lead to more serious and visible forms of soil degradation. The methodological approach presented here constitutes one tool to incorporate local demands and perceptions of soil management constraints as an essential input to relevant research for development activities. The participatory process followed was effective in facilitating farmer consensus; for example, about which soil related constraints were most important and what potential soil management options could be used. Development of local capacities for consensus building constitute a critical step prior to collective action by farming communities resulting in the adoption of integrated soil fertility management strategies at the farm and landscape scale.

However in the Eastern Plains (Llanos Orientales) of Colombia, when Oxisols are subjected to tillage using disc harrow, soil physical conditions deteriorate rapidly. We report here that change in land use with deep-rooted tropical pastures can enhance soil quality by improving the size and stability of soil aggregates when compared with soils under monocropping. In addition, rates of water infiltration improved by 5–10-fold while rainfall acceptance capacity improved by 3–5-fold. We suggest that intensive and sustainable use of these Oxisols, could only be possible if an “arable” or “productive layer” (i.e. a layer with improved soil physical, chemical and biological properties) is constructed and maintained. One option to achieve this arable layer is through the use of introduced tropical pastures with deep-rooting abilities that can result in increased soil organic matter and associated improvements in soil physical, chemical and biological properties. One land use option that can achieve these soil improvements is agropastoralism whereby pastures and crops are grown in short-term rotations. "

Images were acquired using a standard commercial digital or \{SLR\} camera lifted by a kite or balloon. The optimum camera settings varied with conditions. The feasibility of correcting for distortions in the images and calibration of the sensor was explored, but it was not possible to automatically correct images and standardize the radiometric parameters over a range of conditions. Nevertheless, a combination of automated and visual analysis of the images obtained provided a means of classifying and quantifying various aspects of crop growth and development. This information was shown to be related to various bean and banana growth characteristics and can be used to predict bean yields and to estimate plant growth related parameters in banana plantations. The information is readily understood and, due to the robustness of the technology at a budget price, the methodology is a potentially powerful way of generating and providing information to local managers of genetic and natural resources as well as to owners of commercial plantations.

Roots of tropical grasses and legumes were buried in the field in two acid Oxisols of widely differing textures during either the dry or the wet season. Results were analyzed, using four decay models: single exponential, single exponential with residue, double exponential, and a model in which the relative decomposition rate (RDR) decreases non-linearly as a function of the litter fraction left: 1/X.dX/dt = − k(XX0)1b. In the dry season, the \{RDR\} of all roots decreased steeply with a declining fraction of leftover root weight. This indicates a rapid loss of a small fraction of easily decomposable material, leaving behind a large fraction of recalcitrant material. In the wet season, \{RDR\} decreased more gradually. The basic pattern of decomposition was the same for both clay loam and sandy soil, although the absolute values for \{RDR\} and the steepness of its decrease differed. Given that the two soils differed widely in texture and consequent water retention characteristics, the differences in \{RDR\} may have resulted from differences in soil water regime. The very high C-to-P ratios in the roots (up to 1780) reflect low P availability in these strongly P-sorbing Oxisols. Because microbial C-to-P ratios in these soils ranged from 34 to 50, considerable P immobilization may be needed for decomposition to proceed. Thus, P is likely to be an important rate-controlling factor in litter decomposition in these soils. "

However, plants not occurring in the forest colonized fields and fallow. In total, 595 species were identified across treatments. Changes in communities generally reflected the replacement of shade-tolerant plants, with seed dispersed by bats, other mammals, ants, and larger birds, and by pioneer plants adapted to open conditions and producing larger numbers of small seed, dispersed by smaller birds and the wind. Each form of land use hosted 7–25% of the original forest species, plus 13–66 plant species adapted to that land use. As field conditions changed over time, different sets of more competitive weeds emerged. As a response, farmers changed crops, fallowed fields, and cleared more forest. Farmers were most concerned about Rottboellia cochinchinensis (Lour.) Clayton in fields after fallow, and Imperata brasiliensis Trin., an indicator of land degradation. Older fallow was similar to forest in many respects, although species composition differed. Farmers named useful species across treatments, but counts of these were very low, suggesting high human intervention in the forest and heavy pressure on such species in all land uses. "

Data from several sources were used to estimate nutrient fluxes, including farmer interviews, observations of the farming systems, soil analyses, and the output of simulation models. Results from the three locations were combined because of similarity of farming systems, with the Palissa location treated separately. Nutrient balances were determined to be negative for all crops except for N and P in the banana-based land use type (LUT) which benefited from the transfer of nutrients from other land use types in organic materials. The annual crops-LUT occupied more land than other \{LUTs\} and accounted for more nutrient loss than all other \{LUTs\} combined. Crop harvest and soil erosion were the major causes of nutrient losses at the crop and \{LUT\} levels. N and K balances were positive and negative, respectively, for the fallow and pasture LUTs. Harvests and livestock dung and urine were brought to the household LUT, and the losses in this relatively small \{LUT\} appeared to be high from burning, volatilization and erosion. No farmer used fertilizer and nutrients in any form were applied to banana, only. Marketing and purchasing of commodities resulted in farm-level nutrient deficits for Palissa but had little effect on the balances at other locations. The cumulative effect of several low-input management practices was estimated to give nutrient balances of near zero for N and P, but K losses at the field-level continued to be high. "

Therefore the promiscuity of kudzu, and its ability to respond to inoculation in the Eastern Plains of Colombia were studied. When inoculated onto kudzu grown in soil cores, five serologically distinct strains of rhizobia originally isolated from kudzu, and two strains from other legumes (CIAT 3101 and Nitragin 32H1), gave significant (60–70%) increases in N yield over the uninoculated control. \{CB\} 756 (a recommended strain), eight strains from other legumes and fourteen kudzu strains did not give significant responses. The six most effective strains were the same in soil cores and Leonard jars, and all originated from kudzu. In soil cores, nodule numbers with the most effective strains were not significantly different from those in the uninoculated control, the implication being that these inoculated strains competed effectively with the native strains. On Macroptilium atropurpureum cv. Siratro grown in Leonard jars, only 29 of 72 slow-growing strains effective on kudzu or other legumes gave more than 75% maximum yield, an indication that this legume cannot be used to evaluate the promiscuity of strains from these legumes. In two field trials, seed inoculation at normal rates (50 g inoculant kg−1 seeds) with selected strains caused more than two-fold significant increases in N yields of kudzu. In one of these trials 16% (3.5 × 103 rhizobia g−1) of the population of native rhizobia in the soil able to nodulate Siratro (2.2 × 104 rhizobia g−1) was able to nodulate kudzu. The most effective inoculated strains were \{CIAT\} 3918 (possibly=TAL 647), \{CIAT\} 2434 and \{CIAT\} 3850. It is concluded that kudzu is ‘promiscuous ineffective’ rather than ‘promiscuous effective’, and that this and the low proportion of effective native strains account for the observed inoculation responses.

Continuous production under these conditions can lead to soil nutrient depletion. On sloping land, cassava cultivation can also cause severe erosion if the crop is not properly managed. This paper reviews the literature to show that cassava does extract large amounts of nutrients, especially potassium (K), from the soil. However, when nutrient extraction is calculated on the basis of per unit quantity dry-matter produced, cassava extracts much less N and P than, and similar amounts of K to, most other crops. Long-term fertility trials indicate that, without adequate K fertilization, cassava yields eventually decline due to K depletion, except in those soils containing large amounts of K-bearing minerals. While cassava production may result in severe erosion when grown on steep slopes, simple agronomic practices can usually maintain soil losses within acceptable levels. The effect different cultivation practices on erosion and yield varies from location to location, and the most appropriate practices can be identified through simple erosion-control trials on farmers' fields. Thus, productivity of continuously grown cassava fields can be maintained through judicious use of fertilizers and soil management practices that control erosion. "

Both the concentration and content of N, P, and K in the stems varied with fertilization treatment, being least with no nutrients applied to the soil. Sprouting rate was strongly influenced by the N, P, and K contents in the stakes. The lowest sprouting rate occurred with stakes that received no K, but moderate levels of N and P. Sprouting potential was not affected by planting stakes in fertilized or unfertilized soils, however, indicating that nutritional reserves contained in the stakes was more important. Stakes from plots with moderate level of N, P, and K application resulted in plants that had the greatest leaf area, foliage and stems suited as propagation material.

The specific objectives were to study the relationship among agronomic traits, to evaluate genotypic sensitivity to changes in the environment, and to characterize and determine the representativeness of the evaluation environments. Correlations found between root yield and related physiological or quality traits were in a favorable direction for breeding purposes. This indicates that when selecting for a complex set of traits, indices might be established with major emphasis on traits with high heritability and/or stability. For some traits (number of commercial roots and length of stem with attached leaves) the range of genetic variability was broader in favorable environments. Variation among evaluation sites was greater than variation across years. The results indicate that intermediate to low genotypic sensitivity in terms of cassava root yield andry matter content can be combined with improved potential for dry matter production per unit area. In order to improve the performance and stability of cassava gene-pools, representative sites should be selected within the priority agro-ecosystem, to evaluate the genetic base for at least two years before selection is made. Association between the mean and the sensitivity coefficient for different traits was either nonsignificant or positive for breeding purposes. Improvement in the mean of traits can be made independently from, or in relation to, genotypic ability to react to environmental changes. "

Gas exchange (CO2 uptake and \{H2O\} loss) of individual leaves was monitored on three different occasions at 4–6 months after planning. There were significant correlations among leaf photosynthesis, total biomass and root yield across all cultivars. When the cultivars were grouped on the basis of top weight (as a proxy for leaf area), the correlations were significant only with average and high top-weight cultivars. The same trends were observed for correlations among mesophyll conductance, total biomass and root yield. There were no significant correlations between biomass or root yield and leaf conductance. The results suggest that, when light interception is not limiting, selection for high leaf photosynthesis is likely to lead to higher yield. The results of a second-year trial (1988/1989) with 16 cultivars, selected on the basis of their yield, showed a significant correlation between leaf photosynthesis, measured only once at 4 months after planting, and final root yield. Root yield was positively correlated with mesophyll conductance, and negatively correlated with intercellular CO2, but not significantly correlated with leaf conductance. Furthermore, root yield in the 1988/1989 season was significantly correlated with leaf photosynthesis measured in the 1986/1987 season. It is suggested that screening for high leaf photosynthetic rate under field conditions could be used as a selection criterion for parent materials to obtain progeny with high yield. "

Settlers were interviewed in two Amazon colonies about land use, and rates and causes of deforestation. Farmers in Pedro Peixoto, Acre, cleared about 2 ha per year per family, and settlers in Theobroma, Rondonia, cleared some 3 ha per year to produce first rice, which was then followed by beans, maize and cassava. Settlers then converted land to pasture not only to raise cattle, but also as a way to add substantial value to their lands for ‘improvements’—i.e. for more clearing, pasture, fencing, corrals and ponds. Analysis of satellite images of the Pedro Peixoto site agreed with data reported by farmers on rates of deforestation and improved our understanding of the dynamics of deforestation. "

The typical cropping cycle in the region includes monocrops or intercrops of maize (Zea mays L.), beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and/or cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). Cassava is usually the last crop before local farmers leave plots to natural fallow until soil fertility is recovered and a new cropping phase can be initiated. Previous studies on land use in the Río Cabuyal watershed (6500 ha) show that a considerable proportion of land (about 25–30%) remains under natural fallow every year. The focus of our studies is on systems of accelerated regeneration of soil fertility, or improved fallow systems, as an alternative to the natural regeneration by the native flora. Fallow improvement studies were conducted on plots following cassava cultivation. The potential for soil fertility recovery after 12 and 28 months was evaluated with two fast growing trees, Calliandra calothyrsus Meissn (CAL) and Indigofera constricta L.(IND), and one shrub, Tithonia diversifolia (Hemsl.) Gray (TTH), as slash/mulch fallow systems compared to the natural fallow (NAT). All planted slash/mulch fallow systems produced greater biomass than the natural fallow. Greatest dry biomass (16.4 Mg ha−1 year−1) was produced by TTH. Other planted fallows (CAL and IND) produced about 40% less biomass than \{TTH\} and the control (NAT) about 75% less. Nutrient levels in the biomass were especially high for TTH, followed by IND, CAL, and NAT. The impact of fallow management on soil chemical, physical and biological parameters related to residual soil fertility during the cropping phase was evaluated. Soil parameters most affected by slash/mulch fallow systems included soil total N, available N (ammonium and nitrate), exchangeable cations (K, Ca, Mg and Al), amount of P in light fraction, soil bulk density and air permeability, and soil macrofauna diversity. Results from field studies suggest that the Tithonia slash/mulch fallow system could be the best option to regenerate soil fertility of degraded volcanic-ash soils of the Andean hillsides. "

Under such conditions, yields often decline when the crop is grown successively without fertilizer application. An 8-year on-farm trial was conducted on sandy soils in northern Colombia to study effects of (1) surface mulching with residues of the grass Panicum maximum, (2) moderate applications of N, P and K fertilizer and (3) tillage on crop productivity, root quality and soil properties. Mulch applications significantly increased root and top biomass, increased root dry matter content while reducing its yearly variation, and decreased root HCN, particularly in the absence of fertilizer. Mulch applications also significantly reduced soil temperatures within the top 20 cm and increased soil organic carbon, K, P, Ca and Mg. Without mulch, soil pH decreased over the years. Annual applications of 21 kg ha−1 P resulted in a build-up of soil P, whereas no build-up of soil K was observed with applications of 41 kg K ha−1. The application of N, P and K fertilizer significantly increased root and top biomass and reduced root HCN, especially if no mulch was applied. Where both mulch and fertilizer applications were absent, root yield and top biomass declined over the years. Tillage, except when combined with fertilizer application, had no effect on root yield, top biomass, root dry matter or \{HCN\} contents. Neither were effects of tillage observed in any of the studied soil parameters. The trial indicated that, to sustain cassava productivity in poor sandy soils, applications of plant mulch and/or chemical fertilizer are highly desirable. "

Prices, production practices and profitability are compared for 1975 and 1989. By means of a production function, the effects of allocative efficiency, technical efficiency and technical change on productivity and profitability are analyzed. The observed changes reflect very well the price trends over the period. Between 1975 and 1989, total factor productivity increased by 50%. Bean/maize producers almost doubled returns to land and labor. Increased technical efficiency had most effect on profitability, followed by technical change. Allocative efficiency had more impact on yields than on profitability because it was associated with high input costs. Considerable opportunities for further productivity increases were identified. Conclusions on the nature of the modernization process are drawn. Implications for agricultural policy, research and the role of the small farm in agricultural development are derived. "

This study evaluated variation in leaf retention and its relation to cassava productivity under irrigated and stressed conditions. In the first trial 1350 clones were evaluated on the North Coast of Colombia with a 5-month dry period towards the end of the growth cycle. Clones with the leaf retention trait produced more total fresh biomass and yielded 33% more root dry matter than plants without the trait. In the irrigated trial 110 clones were evaluated on the \{CIAT\} farm at about 1000 mamsl. Leaf retention was quantified using a 1–5 visual score with five corresponding to excellent leaf retention. Genetic correlations between leaf retention and fresh foliage production (0.49), root dry matter yield (0.46), fresh root production (0.43) and root dry matter content (0.25) were obtained. Increased root yield under stressed and unstressed conditions was associated with increased total biomass production and increased harvest index. These finding concur with the results of cassava growth models that include leaf longevity as a variable. The lack of any negative genetic correlations between leaf retention and useful agronomic traits coupled with the relatively high genetic correlation for root yield and the high heritability (0.55) for leaf retention indicate that it should be relatively easy and advantageous to incorporate this characteristic in breeding and selection programs directed to increasing root yield under both water stressed and unstressed conditions.

Participating \{CGIAR\} and other international centers include the Centre for International Tropical Agriculture (CIAT); the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA); The International Potato Centre (CIP); the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Centre (AVRDC); and the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE), in close collaboration with the National Resources Institute (NRI‐UK); national agricultural research institutions; agricultural universities; and advanced agricultural research laboratories in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Pacific Region, and the Americas. The \{TWFP\} was launched in 1996 as five separate but closely linked subprojects targeting: (1) Bemisia tabaci as a vector of viruses affecting cassava and sweet potato in sub‐Saharan Africa (IITA, NRI, CIP, CIAT); (2) B. tabaci as a vector of viruses in mixed cropping systems of Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean (CIAT); (3) B. tabaci as a vector of viruses in mixed cropping systems of eastern and southern Africa (ICIPE, AVRDC); (4) B. tabaci as a vector of viruses in mixed cropping systems of Southeast Asia (AVRDC); (5) Trialeurodes vaporariorum as a pest in mixed cropping systems of the Andean highlands (CIAT); and (6) whiteflies as pests of cassava in South America (CIAT). Diagnostic surveys conducted in Phase I (1997–2000) clearly showed that the two main whitefly pests in the Tropics are B. tabaci and, in the highlands, T. vaporariorum. Other whitefly species investigated by the \{TWFP\} included B. afer and Aleurotrachelus socialis. B. tabaci is the main vector of plant viruses inducing African cassava mosaic disease, sweet potato virus disease, bean golden mosaic disease, and many other diseases of horticultural crops, mainly tomato, hot and sweet peppers, squash, melon, and several other cucurbits. Genetic resistance was identified as the most important component of an \{IPM\} programme, followed by phytosanitary, cultural and legal measures. The two most important factors contributing to whitefly/virus epidemics were shown to be pesticide abuse and the use of virus‐infected planting materials. Biological control is only effective in cropping systems with minimal or rational use of insecticides, and should be considered only as a complementary \{IPM\} strategy. Farmer education and technical assistance are considered the most critical steps toward the implementation of sustainable and economically viable \{IPM\} strategies in tropical countries affected by whitefly pests and whitefly‐transmitted viruses.

The developmental time and longevity of fed and unfed adult parasitoids were compared under different temperature and relative humidity combinations. Mean longevity of the parasitoid in absence of hosts was highest (42.2 days) at 15°C and 75 ± 5% \{RH\} and lowest (3.9 days) at 15°C and 45 ± 5% RH.

A. fuscipennis had the longest mean developmental time (65 days) at 15°C and 75 ± 5% \{RH\} and the shortest (23.2 days) at 25°C and 55 ± 5% RH. Combinations of moderate temperature and low relative humidity negatively affected parasitoid longevity. At constant high humidity, an increase of temperature leads to a decrease of longevity. Sex ratio was determined by (a) collecting adults in the field and rearing them to the next generation, (b) exposing different proportions of pairs of parasitoids to whitefly nymphs, and (c) examining the offspring of pairs of parasitoids. Sex ratios of populations collected in the field and reared in the laboratory were strongly female biased. Reproduction of the parasitoid is through thelytokous parthenogenesis. The species carries Wolbachia, the rickettsia that induces thelytoky.

Results show that land speculation has simultaneously increased the profitability of cattle ranching, while slowing down intensification and impeding the adoption of sustainable practices. Intensification occurred because the production gains offered by improved pastures over native grasses were large enough to overcome the negative effect of land speculation on intensification. By contrast, in the Amazon, improved technologies have to overcome the high fertility of newly deforested land. Thus, technology, land speculation and characteristics of the resource base interact in a complex way to determine the speed and nature of intensification. "

The protein, designated ‘finotin’, has broad and potent inhibitory effect on the growth of various important fungal pathogens of plants, namely Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium solani, Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Pyricularia grisea, Bipolaris oryzae and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. It also inhibits the common bean bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli. Moreover, finotin has powerful inhibitory properties against the bean bruchids Zabrotes subfasciatus and Acanthoscelides obtectus. "

This paper focuses on farming systems in the semi-arid areas of Zimbabwe, where biomass production is limited and farmers integrate crop and livestock activities. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is promoted to intensify crop production, emphasizing the retention of surface mulch with crop residues (CR). This paper quantifies the associated potential economic trade-offs and profitability of using residues for soil amendment or as livestock feed, and explores alternative biomass production options. We draw on household surveys, stakeholder feedback, crop, livestock and economic modeling tools. We use the Trade-Off Analysis Model for Multi Dimensional Impact Assessment (TOA-MD) to compare different \{CR\} use scenarios at community level and for different farm types: particularly the current base system (cattle grazing of maize residues) and sustainable intensification alternatives based on a \{CA\} option (mulching using maize residues ± inorganic fertilizer) and a maize–mucuna (Mucuna pruriens) rotation. Our results indicate that a maize–mucuna rotation can reduce trade-offs between \{CR\} uses for feed and mulch, providing locally available organic soil enhancement, supplementary feed and a potential source of income. Conservation Agriculture without fertilizer application and at non-subsidized fertilizer prices is not financially viable; whereas with subsidized fertilizer it can benefit half the farm population. The poverty effects of all considered alternative biomass options are however limited; they do not raise income sufficiently to lift farmers out of poverty. Further research is needed to establish the competitiveness of alternative biomass enhancing technologies and the socio-economic processes that can facilitate sustainable intensification of mixed crop-livestock systems, particularly in semi-arid environments.

Our premise is that if it were possible to characterize the production system in terms of management and the environmental conditions, and if information on the harvested product were collected from a large number of harvesting events under varied conditions, it should be possible to develop data-driven models that describe the production system. These models can then be used to identify appropriate growing conditions and improved management practices for crops that have received little attention from researchers. The analysis and interpretation of commercial production data in the context of naturally occurring variation in environmental and management, as opposed to controlled experimental data, requires novel approaches. Information was available on both variation in commercial production of the tropical fruit, lulo (Solanum quitoense), and the associated environmental conditions in Colombia. This information was used to develop and evaluate procedures for the interpretation of the variation in commercial production of lulo. The most effective procedures depended on expert guidance: it was not possible to develop a simple effective one step procedure, but rather an iterative approach was required. The most effective procedure was based on the following steps. First, highly correlated independent variables were evaluated and those that were effectively duplicates were eliminated. Second, regression models identified those environmental factors most closely associated with the dependent variable of fruit yield. The environmental factors associated with variation in fruit yield were then used for more in depth analysis, and those environmental variables not associated with yield were excluded from further analysis. Linear regression and multilayer perceptron regression models explained 65–70% of the total variation in yield. Both models identified three of the same factors but the multilayer perceptron based on a neural network identified one location as an additional factor. Third, the three environmental factors common to both regression models were used to define three Homogeneous Environmental Conditions (HECs) using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). Fourth, yield was analyzed with a mixed model with the categorical variables of HEC, location, as a proxy for cultural factors associated with a geographic region, and farm as proxy for management skills. The mixed model explained more than 80% of the total variation in yield with 61% associated with the \{HECs\} and 19% with farm. Location had minimal effects. The results of this model can be used to determine the appropriate environmental conditions for obtaining high yields for crops where only commercial data are available, and also to identify those farms that have superior management practices for given environmental conditions.

Current emphasis on increasing resilience to climate change and reducing agricultural greenhouse gasses (GHG) emissions strengthens the support for sustainable agricultural production. In fact, reducing losses in soil fertility, reclaiming degraded lands, and promoting synergistic interaction between crop production and forests are generally seen as good climate change policies. In order for decision-makers to develop long-term policies that address these issues, they must have tools at their disposal that evaluate trade-offs, opportunities, and repercussions of the options considered. In this paper, the authors combine and reconcile the output of three models widely accessible to the public to analyze the impacts of policies that target emission reduction in the agricultural sector. We present an application to Colombia which reveals the importance of considering the full scope of interactions among the various land uses. Results indicate that investments in increasing the efficiency and productivity of the livestock sector and reducing land allocated to pasture are preferable to policies that target deforestation alone or target a reduction of emissions in crop production. Investments in livestock productivity and land-carrying capacity would reduce deforestation and provide sufficient gains in carbon stock to offset greater emissions from increased crop production while generating higher revenues.

This study aimed to quantify the medium-term impact of tillage (conventional and reduced) and crop residue management (retention and removal) on soil and crop performance in a maize–soybean rotation. A replicated field trial was started in sub-humid Western Kenya in 2003, and measurements were taken from 2005 to 2008. Conventional tillage negatively affected soil aggregate stability when compared to reduced tillage, as indicated by lower mean weight diameter values upon wet sieving at 0–15 cm (PT &lt; 0.001). This suggests increased susceptibility to slaking and soil erosion. Tillage and residue management alone did not affect soil C contents after 11 cropping seasons, but when residue was incorporated by tillage, soil C was higher at 15–30 cm (PT*R = 0.037). Lack of treatment effects on the C content of different aggregate fractions indicated that reduced tillage and/or residue retention did not increase physical C protection. The weak residue effect on aggregate stability and soil C may be attributed to insufficient residue retention. Soybean grain yields tended to be suppressed under reduced tillage without residue retention, especially in wet seasons (PT*R = 0.070). Consequently, future research should establish, for different climatic zones and soil types, the critical minimum residue retention levels for soil conservation and crop productivity. "

Site specific information recorded by small-scale producers of the Andean blackberry on their production systems and soils coupled with publicly available meteorological data was used to develop models of such production systems. Multilayer perceptrons and Self-Organizing Maps were used as computational models in the identification and visualization of the most important variables for modeling the production of Andean blackberry. Artificial neural networks were trained with information from 20 sites in Colombia where the Andean blackberry is cultivated. Multilayer perceptrons predicted with a reasonable degree of accuracy the production response of the crop. The soil depth, the average temperature, external drainage, and the accumulated precipitation of the first month before harvest were critical determinants of productivity. A proxy variable of location was used to describe overall differences in management between farmers groups. The use of this proxy indicated that, even under essentially similar environmental conditions, large differences in production could be assigned to management effects. The information obtained can be used to determine sites that are suitable for Andean blackberry production, and to transfer of management practices from sites of high productivity to sites with similar environmental conditions which currently have lower levels of productivity.

Yet efforts to adapt to climate change, as reported in the literature over the last decade and in selected case studies, have not led to substantial rates of implementation of adaptation actions despite substantial investments in adaptation science. Moreover, implemented actions have been mostly incremental and focused on proximate causes; there are far fewer reports of more systemic or transformative actions. We found that the nature and effectiveness of responses was strongly influenced by framing. Recent decision-oriented approaches that aim to overcome this situation are framed within a “pathways” metaphor to emphasise the need for robust decision making within adaptive processes in the face of uncertainty and inter-temporal complexity. However, to date, such “adaptation pathways” approaches have mostly focused on contexts with clearly identified decision-makers and unambiguous goals; as a result, they generally assume prevailing governance regimes are conducive for adaptation and hence constrain responses to proximate causes of vulnerability. In this paper, we explore a broader conceptualisation of “adaptation pathways” that draws on ‘pathways thinking’ in the sustainable development domain to consider the implications of path dependency, interactions between adaptation plans, vested interests and global change, and situations where values, interests, or institutions constrain societal responses to change. This re-conceptualisation of adaptation pathways aims to inform decision makers about integrating incremental actions on proximate causes with the transformative aspects of societal change. Case studies illustrate what this might entail. The paper ends with a call for further exploration of theory, methods and procedures to operationalise this broader conceptualisation of adaptation. "

In the wet and dry seasons, common beans are grown under rainfed conditions, whereas the winter sowing is fully irrigated. The conventional breeding program performs all varietal selection stages solely in the winter season, with rainfed environments being incorporated in the breeding scheme only through the multi environment trials (METs) where basically only yield is recorded. As yield is the result of many interacting processes, it is challenging to determine the events (abiotic or biotic) associated with yield reduction in the rainfed environments (wet and dry seasons). To improve our understanding of rainfed dry bean production so as to produce information that can assist breeders in their efforts to develop stress-tolerant, high-yielding germplasm, we characterized environments by integrating weather, soil, crop and management factors using crop simulation models. Crop simulations based on two commonly grown cultivars (Pérola and \{BRS\} Radiante) and statistical analyses of simulated yield suggest that both rainfed seasons, wet and dry, can be divided in two groups of environments: highly favorable environment and favorable environment. For the wet and dry seasons, the highly favorable environment represents 44% and 58% of production area, respectively. Across all rainfed environment groups, terminal and/or reproductive drought stress occurs in roughly one fourth of the seasons (23.9% for Pérola and 24.7% for Radiante), with drought being most limiting in the favorable environment group in the dry TPE. Based on our results, we argue that even though drought-tailoring might not be warranted, the common bean breeding program should adapt their selection practices to the range of stresses occurring in the rainfed \{TPEs\} to select genotypes more suitable for these environments.

Granule size analysis revealed that fermentation hydrolysed lowland and highland granules by exocorrosion and endocorrosion respectively. This result was corroborated by significantly higher \{RVA\} breakdown and lower intrinsic viscosity in highland clones, reflecting different sensitivity to fermentation. For the first time, amylose contents ranging from 15.7 to 21.7% were correlated with expansion ability (3.0–8.6 mL/g) of sour cassava starch. Therefore the combination of cassava genotypes (mainly amylose content) and post-harvest treatments is key for expansion ability.

We collected diverse biophysical data to allow spatial variability of soil organic carbon and factors contributing to this variation to be determined statistically, and used well established simulation models to interpret the data, predict long-term carbon dynamics and determine the potential for improvements in soil quality and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. The spatial variation in soil organic carbon in the 0–20 cm soil depth was significant across study areas (P &lt; 0.01, 21.6 g kg−1–37.8 g kg−1), and between land-uses (P &lt; 0.05, 27.9 g kg−1 in cropland and 43.0 g kg−1 soil in forestland). In a multiple linear regression model, among the 11 explanatory variables used, four (total nitrogen, shrubs, trees and land use) showed a significant positive effect (P &lt; 0.01), while three (impact of grazing, impact of erosion and clay) showed a significant negative effect (P &lt; 0.01). Simulations using the assumption of steady state to estimate carbon dynamics suggested that plant inputs from croplands are generally lower than grass or shrublands, resulting in build-up of recalcitrant organic matter in shrublands compared to grass or croplands. Erosion results in a decline in both the absolute and relative amounts of carbon in recalcitrant pools, but the more active pools remained unchanged, meaning that the overall activity of soil organic matter is increased when the soil is eroded, and it becomes more difficult to sequester soil carbon. More rapid decrease in soil organic carbon is likely to be due to increased erosion, persistent removal of organic materials, grazing pressures, and higher rate of decompositions in cropland and grazing land-uses. Conversion to shrubland shows high potential to quickly restore eroded soils and build up a pool of recalcitrant soil carbon, suggesting that management of land using periodic 20 year exclosures, preventing cropping and grazing and allowing shrubland succession, could be beneficial in restoring degraded soils. Simulations using a calibration approach, rather than assuming steady state, corroborated these findings, suggesting that after 30 years of current management, croplands will deplete soil organic carbon by 5.6, 7.1 and 7.2 t ha−1, and grasslands by 3.5, 3.9 and 2.7 t ha−1, while shrublands will build-up soil organic carbon by 0.6, 0.1 and 1.3 t ha−1 at study sites. At one study site, forests, will further increase soil organic carbon by 6.7 t ha−1 after 30 years. The significant positive impact of shrubs and trees on soil organic carbon suggests the need to focus on introduction of agroforestry systems in crop and grasslands. "

abstract = "Abstract Improved understanding of soil fertility factors limiting crop productivity is important to develop appropriate soil and nutrient management recommendations in sub-Saharan Africa. Diagnostic trials were implemented in Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria and Tanzania, as part of the African Soils Information Service (AfSIS) project, to identify soil fertility constraints to crop production across various cropping systems and soil fertility conditions. In each country, one to three sites of 10 km × 10 km were included with each site having 12–31 field trials. The treatments tested included a control, an \{NPK\} treatment, three treatments in which the N, P and K nutrients were omitted one at a time from the \{NPK\} treatment, and three treatments in which secondary and micronutrients (Ca, Mg, S, Zn and B) simply referred here as multi-nutrients, manure and lime were added to the NPK. The field trials were conducted for 1–2 seasons; the test crop was maize except in Mali where sorghum was used. Nitrogen was limiting in all sites and generally the most limiting nutrient except in Sidindi (Kenya) and Kontela (Mali) where P was the most limiting. The general pattern in Kiberashi (Tanzania) shows none of the nutrients were limiting. K is mainly limiting in only one site (Mbinga) although incidences of K limitation were seen in almost all sites. Addition of multi-nutrients and manure further improved the yields of \{NPK\} in most sites. Cluster analyses revealed that maize crop in 11% of fields were highly responsive to nitrogen application, 25% (i.e., 21% poor and 4% fertile) ‘non-responsive’ to any nutrient or soil amendment, 28% being ‘low responsive’ and 36% of ‘intermediate response’. This study indicates that constraints to crop production vary considerably even within a site, and that addressing limitations in secondary and micronutrients, and increasing soil carbon can improve response to fertilizers. For sustainable crop production intensification in smallholder farming systems in SSA, there is need to develop management strategies to improve efficiency of fertilizer use and of other inputs, recognizing the site-specific nutrient response patterns at various spatial scales.

abstract = "This study analyzes the dynamics of farmer-to-farmer distribution, the primary means by which new bean varieties spread in Rwanda. Two processes determine the speed of diffusion: the creation of new users through seed distribution and the disappearance of a variety from individual farms (mortality). Small bean plots, modest seed quantities received, environmental stresses and poverty put farmers at risk of losing varieties, even ones they may value. Overall, distribution tends to be both numerically limited and socially restricted. Analysis shows the probability of survival to be correlated with the rate at which farmers distribute seed. The paper presents a demographic model for measuring varietal expansion which takes account of loss as well as gain. Farmer-to-farmer distribution is differentially effective in diffusing varieties; salient factors include the growers' appreciation of the variety, its productivity and harshness of environment. Finally, we outline a diffusion strategy for improving small farmers' access to new varieties, recognizing that adoption is not a one-time affair and that the poorer have particular difficulty in receiving and keeping new cultivars.

DC. cv.-group utilis) is widely promoted in tropical and sub-tropical regions as a green manure cover crop that can reduce weed growth and soil erosion and enhance soil fertility. To provide these benefits, the crop must attain rapid ground cover and develop substantial aboveground biomass. To assist biophysical targeting of the crop to environments that can provide adequate growth conditions, the \{CROPGRO\} model was adapted to simulate velvet bean growth and development. This paper evaluates the performance of the model for phenology, growth, senescence and N accumulation for multiple locations that represent a range of environmental and agronomic management scenarios. Vegetative development, as described by main stem leaf appearance rate, varied linearly with thermal time. Time to flowering showed departures from the linear photoperiod response used in the model. Additional research is required to determine whether the crop is influenced by factors besides photoperiod and air temperature, especially water and nutrient deficits. The linear response to photoperiod did, however, provide reasonable values for partitioning to vegetative, reproductive and senesced materials. Simulation of nitrogen concentration for various plant components matched observed data. Sensitivity analyses evaluating the ability of the crop to provide ground cover, intercept light and develop adequate growth for soil protection and weed suppression indicated that a mean temperature of over 22 °C and a soil moisture holding capacity of at least 100 mm are required. The \{CROPGRO\} model proved to be a reliable decision support tool for guiding analyses of velvet bean response to crop management and environmental conditions. Further research, however, is warranted to improve its predictive capability, especially for phenology. "

Rooting pattern and nodulation were also evaluated. The relative N accumulation curves of the legumes and control (savanna grasses) were studied in a separate experiment. The legumes were established in furrows separated by native savanna in an Oxisol of the Eastern Plains of Colombia to give a density of 5–6 plants m−2. The two fertilizer treatments, (a) a basal fertilizer of micro- and macro-elements including 80 kg P ha−1 and 70 kg K ha−1, and (b) the same fertilizer without P and K, were applied to the legumes at the start of the rainy season one year after establishment. With P:K fertilizer, all legumes derived at least 70% of their nitrogen from the symbiosis (% Ndfa), whereas without P:K both lower values and larger differences in the %Ndfa (44–84 %Ndfa) between species were observed. The greatest effect of P:K on %Ndfa was observed in D. ovalifolium (70 and 44 %Ndfa with and without P:K respectively), but the effect on its yield was relatively small. In contrast, S. macrocephala responded with a large increase in yield (380% with P:K), although it was the only species in which P:K did not have a significant effect on %Ndfa. Total shoot N derived from fixation with P:K fertilizer ranged from 25 kg N ha −1 for D. ovalifolium to 115 kg N ha−1 for P. phaseoloides, with three periods of regrowth over a total of 17 weeks. Without P:K fertilizer, 11–48 kg N ha−1 were derived from fixation. Legume ranking for total N derived from fixation mostly reflected yield differences. However, D. ovalifolium ranked clearly lower for total N from fixation than for yield due to its low %Ndfa and low N concentration. "

Analysis of different land preparation and tillage practices used by farmers in cassava production in Cauca department, Colombia is utilized to develop a model of farmers' decision-making in the choice of tillage techniques. The decision model indicates that manual tillage practices which involve only partial field tillage are a response to relatively fixed constraints, which imply that it may be difficult for farmers facing these constraints to adopt fertilizer technology which requires full field tillage. Variables associated with choice of tillage method are identified and related to implications for experimental evaluation of fertilizer technology and the distribution of benefits from this research. The findings illustrate that diagnostic research on the agro-socioeconomic constraints faced by small farmers can alert researchers to limiting factors which require recognition in the design and testing of agricultural technology, in order to facilitate rapid and effective adoption by a majority of small farmers.

This study sampled soil macrofauna communities across four major land uses present within agricultural landscapes where the Quesungual Slash-and-Mulch Agroforestry System (QSMAS) has been increasingly adopted by smallholder farmers in western Honduras. The four land uses were: secondary forest (F), agroforestry plots of less than two years of age (AF &lt; 2), agroforestry plots of more than 10 years of age (AF &gt; 10), and silvipastoral fields (SP). Transect-based sampling of soil macrofauna using the standard Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility Institute (TSBF) method was employed in both the dry season and wet season. All four land uses sampled in this study harboured diverse, abundant and highly variable soil macrofauna populations. In the dry season, total density of soil macrofauna ranged from 1265 ± 308 individuals m−2 in F sites to 1924 ± 436 individuals m−2 in \{AF\} &lt; 2 sites. In the wet season, total density ranged from 907 ± 294 individuals m−2 in F, to 1637 ± 358 individuals m−2 in \{AF\} &lt; 2. Biomass values followed a similar pattern, ranging from 4.3 ± 1.1 g m−2 to 24.8 ± 8.2 g m−2 in the dry season and from 13.1 ± 3.0 g m−2 to 41.9 ± 11.1 g m−2 in the wet season. In order of decreasing strength of statistical relationship, soil depth, land use and season were all related to some aspects of soil macrofauna density, biomass and community composition. At a broad functional group level, soil macrofauna community composition was very similar across all four land uses. The results suggest that the agricultural practices associated with the ‘Quesungual’ agroforestry system may promote a relatively abundant, diverse soil macrofauna community. The presence of an abundant soil macrofauna community may have important effects on aspects of soil quality that are particularly important to resource-limited smallholder farmers. "

The capital, labour, management and institutional requirements increase when farmers climb the ladder, but the potential gains are also higher. The first step on this ladder are agricultural practices without any financial outlay but with increasing labour demand, such as organic fertilizer use, seed priming, water harvesting and harvesting grains at physiological maturity to improve fodder quality. The next step on the ladder is the use of micro-fertilising, popularly known as microdose, at the rate of 0.3 g \{NPK\} fertilizer per pocket in sorghum and millet. The following step is the development of improved crop/livestock systems characterized by use of higher rates of mineral fertilisers and manure, increasing cowpea density and improved animal fattening. The last step presented on the ladder is the development of more commercially orientated agriculture characterized by development of cash crops, milk production and/or agroforestry systems. Evidences from the field support the observation that farmers intensify their production in a sequential manner similar to the way described in this paper. The technologies presented can facilitate agricultural intensification by reducing the risks and minimising the cost in agricultural production. "

A brief description of the process and a schematic representation of the different steps required at this level are included. The substrate employed was grated fresh cassava roots from several low-cyanide cultivars with a total quantity utilized of approximately 425 kg of cassava per fermentation. The initial concentration of carbohydrates in the culture medium was adjusted to 40 g l−1. The fungus used is characterized by its ability to grow at very low pH (3.5) and reasonably high temperature (45°C), selective growth conditions which appear to obviate the need for sterilization and maintenance of aseptic conditions. The protein yields reported were not as high as obtained in previous small-scale fermentations, with the total crude protein content of the final product averaging &lt; 35% of dry matter. This was partially due to an incomplete utilization of carbohydrates. The quality of the tap water as related to pH of the culture medium might also have had some adverse effect on the growth of the micro-organism. While the protein of the final product was low in sulphur-containing amino acids, particularly methionine, its amino acid profile compared favorably with that of other protein sources. The results obtained to date suggest that single-cell protein (SCP) production from cassava may have potential for practical application in cassava producing areas provided safe operational procedures can be established.

In two food crops in Latin America one principal hypothesis of the authors for the continuation of this yield gap over time is that many successful technologies on the experiment station do not pass a set of reasonable farm level criteria. Farm testing is the logical extension of the research evaluation process once a technology has been identified on the experiment station and regionally tested for adaptation. Farm testing is an especially important component of the research process in developing countries, where communication links between farmers and researchers are weak and farmers often do not have the information or management experience to combine and modify various technology components adapting experiment station or regional trial observations to their owen environments and production systems. The research problems at the farm are different from those at the experiment station or in regional trials so there are important distinctions in design and analysis in the farm trials. The evaluation process developed here identified the technologies later adopted by farmers. For the unsuccessful technologies, information was provided from the farm trials to the breeders and other scientists on further design requirements. The results of the farm trials substantially modifie the recombinations for farmers, which would have been arrived at utilising the results from the experiment station and/or regional trials. "

Disrupting the hardpan could benefit a post-rice crop grown in the dry season, but may increase wet-season percolation and hence can decrease wet-season rice yield. The effect of hardpan disruption on dry-season maize was assessed in three experiments under different irrigation water input conditions (high input under furrow irrigation, low input by increasing irrigation interval, and, in one experiment, with drip irrigation as well); two on a sandy-loam soil and one on a loamy-clay soil. The effect of disruption on subsequent wet-season percolation was measured in two of these experiments. On a loamy-clay soil, the hardpan had a soil mechanical resistance (SMR) of 3.1 \{MPa\} and hardpan disruption had no effect on maize grain yield. On a sandy-loam soil with a hardpan of average peak \{SMR\} of 4.5 MPa, in one year, disruption increased yield by 14% and there was no interaction between hardpan disruption and water input. In the previous year with an average peak hardpan \{SMR\} of 5.2 MPa, however, there was interaction between hardpan disruption and water input: hardpan disruption increased grain yield and water productivity (grain yield per unit water input) by 29% with drip irrigation and by 24% with high water input, but had no significant effect with low water input. Hardpan disruption had no effect on percolation in the following wet season, although it increased percolation by 56–70% in two of the four fields in the first 30 days after transplanting. Consequently, hardpan disruption gave gross benefits 2.7–9.8 times the costs of disruption, with a maize price of US$ 180 t−1, in those situations where it increased maize grain yield. "

Genotypes were evaluated by field trials in a range of environments, by consumer assessment and by measurement of seed size, water absorption capacity (WAC) and cooking time. Backcross generations were evaluated in the field and by measurement of the same seed characters. Most farmers produced beans in monoculture, using bush or semi-climbing cultivars and a single seed type, the most common colour type being cream with red mottles. This is in strong contrast to the production system in many parts of eastern and central Africa, where intercropping, climbing types and seed-type mixtures are common. The BCMV-resistant genotypes had a similar range of flowering dates, maturity dates and canopy heights to locally adapted genotypes, and a similar range of environmental responses with respect to these variables, but were generally small-seeded. Consumers preferred large seeds, and seed colours that were not generally found in the resistant genotypes. However, the bc-3 gene was readily combined with large seed by backcrossing. The resistant genotypes generally had shorter cooking times than the locally adapted genotypes. It is concluded that it will not be difficult to combine \{BCMV\} resistance with the other characteristics required of bean cultivars in Zimbabwe, with the possible exception of seed colour, and that the same is probably true for other production regions in southern Africa.

In agroecosystems, they are often seen as beneficial organisms to crop growth and are actively promoted by farmers and extension agents, yet their contribution to agroecosystem services is uncertain and depends largely on management. The Quesungual slash-and-mulch agroforestry system (QSMAS) of western Honduras has been proposed as a viable alternative to traditional slash-and-burn (SB) practices and has been shown to increase earthworm populations, yet the effect of earthworms on soil fertility and \{SOM\} in \{QSMAS\} is poorly understood. This study examined the role of Pontoscolex corethrurus in \{QSMAS\} by comparing their influence on aggregate-associated \{SOM\} and fertilizer dynamics with their effects under \{SB\} and secondary forest in a replicated field trial. Both the fertilized \{QSMAS\} and \{SB\} treatments had plots receiving additions of inorganic 15N and P, as well as plots with no inorganic N additions. Earthworm populations were manipulated in field microcosms at the beginning of the rainy season within each management treatment via additions of P. corethrurus or complete removal of existing earthworm populations. Microcosms were destructively sampled at harvest of Zea mays and soils were wet-sieved (using 53, 250 and 2000 μm mesh sizes) to isolate different aggregate size fractions, which were analyzed for total C, N and 15N. The effects of management system were smaller than expected, likely due to disturbance associated with the microcosm installation. Contrary to our hypothesis that earthworms would stabilize organic matter in soil aggregates, P. corethrurus decreased total soil C by 3% in the surface layer (0–15 cm), predominantly through a decrease in the C concentration of macroaggregates (&gt;250 μm) and a corresponding depletion of C in coarse particulate organic matter occluded within macroaggregates. Earthworms also decreased bulk density by over 4%, but had no effect on aggregate size distribution. Within the two fertilized treatments, the \{QSMAS\} appeared to retain slightly more fertilizer derived N in smaller aggregate fractions (&lt;250 μm) than did SB, while earthworms greatly reduced the recovery of fertilizer N (34% decrease) in both systems. Although management system did not appear to influence the impact of P. corethrurus on \{SOM\} or nutrient dynamics, we suggest the lack of differences may be due to artificially low inputs of fresh residue C to microcosms within all management treatments. Our findings highlight the potential for P. corethrurus to have deleterious impacts on soil C and fertilizer N dynamics, and emphasize the need to fully consider the activities of soil fauna when evaluating agroecosystem management options.

The effects of a large anecic species, Martiodrilus carimaguensis Jiménez and Moreno, on soil macrofaunal communities were investigated in a natural and a man-made grassland of the Eastern Plains of Colombia. Invertebrates were sampled by a standard hand sorting method at different spatial scales: (i) at the scale of a few centimetres during the course of one year, we compared the dynamics of the density, biomass, diversity and individual weights of macroinvertebrates in earthworm surface casts, in the soil located below casts and in a control soil without casts; (2) at the scale of a few decimetres and at a fixed time, macroinvertebrates were sampled in soil monoliths with different densities of casts on their surfaces. Macroinvertebrates colonised casts 4 and 6 weeks after their formation in the pasture and the savanna, respectively. In the two grasslands, at the spatial scale of the cast, macroinvertebrate density was significantly higher below casts (1660–5310 ind m−2) than in the control soil (400–1700 ind m−2), while no differences were recorded in biomass, richness, diversity and evenness. The presence of casts at the soil surface increased the relative dominance of epigeic populations (+185% to +250%) at the expense of larger endogeic species (−39% to −76%). Individual weights of invertebrates were lower in casts (1.2–5.7 g ind−1) and the underlying soil (8.2–11.1 g ind−1) when compared with the control soil (25.0–39.6 g ind−1). These results were mainly confirmed at the larger spatial scale. Taxonomic richness was positively correlated with the number of casts at the soil surface at the scale of a few decimetres, while diversity was unchanged and evenness decreased. These results were mainly attributed to the creation of new habitats (macropores, galleries) by earthworm activity and to the concentration of litter and soil organic matter in casts. They support the “Nested Biodiversity Hypothesis” according to which soil ecosystem engineers may have determinant effects on the abundance and diversity of other soil organisms. "

It is recognized that maize production practices in the tropics are generally poor. Improved production practices are bound to contribute more to increased yields initially, but as production practices improve, greater breeding effort is required to increase yields and adapt materials to improved practices. Yield potential of tropical maize should be increased by improving grain production efficiency, measured in time and space. Selection for desirable morphological traits, higher harvest index, reduced ASI, increased efficiency of nutrient uptake and utilization, improved stress tolerances, and superior quality traits should all be emphasized in the tropics.

A combination of an optimal level of host–plant resistance based on the natural storage protein arcelin and a larval parasitoid has been suggested as a promising two-component strategy. While a dose–response to arcelin is evident in the bruchid Zabrotes subfasciatus, the effects of different arcelin concentrations on A. obtectus are still virtually unknown, even though they might be important for the success of the proposed integrated control system. The current investigation quantified the effect of different arcelin-based resistance levels of beans on the development of A. obtectus in a series of bioassays. Our findings show that all seven tested bean lines with markedly different levels of arcelin-based resistance against Z. subfasciatus consistently prolonged development of A. obtectus. Results provide clear evidence that arcelin acts as a growth inhibitor on first instar larvae. Furthermore, arcelin affected bruchid female fitness through its effect on body mass, which was significantly reduced on all arcelin-containing bean lines. This study demonstrates that, irrespective of its relative concentration, arcelin holds the potential to affect development of A. obtectus sufficiently to support the proposed two-component integrated pest management system.

Therefore, the value of even a single meal can be crucial for survival. Psyttalia lounsburyi is a parasitoid, and biological control agent, of the olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae. In order to improve our understanding of the basic nutritional ecology of P. lounsburyi and its role in survival we evaluated the effect of a single sucrose meal on the longevity of female and male wasps. We measured the duration of feeding, volume ingested, sucrose consumption, energy content, and longevity of wasps provided with different concentrations of sucrose (0.5, 1, and 2 M) at different times after emergence (0, 1, 2 or 3 days after emergence). Our results showed that longevity was significantly influenced by sucrose concentration and timing of feeding. For females, feeding on sucrose increased the likelihood of survival to varying degrees, ranging from 32.3% to 95.4%, compared to water-only controls. The longest duration of feeding was observed for the highest sucrose concentrations and oldest wasps. The amount of sugar ingested and energy uptake increased, up to a point, as sugar concentration increased. Our results suggest that P. lounsburyi derived greatest benefit from the intermediate concentration (1 M) of sucrose provided 2 or 3 days after emergence. Our study emphasizes the importance of finding balance between increasing longevity and limiting the duration of feeding, and concomitant uptake of nutrients, that is fundamental for survival of the wasp in nature.

This means that single solutions (or ‘silver bullets’) for improving farm productivity do not exist. Yet to date few approaches to understand constraints and explore options for change have tackled the bewildering complexity of African farming systems. In this paper we describe the Nutrient Use in Animal and Cropping systems – Efficiencies and Scales (NUANCES) framework. \{NUANCES\} offers a structured approach to unravel and understand the complexity of African farming to identify what we term ‘best-fit’ technologies – technologies targeted to specific types of farmers and to specific niches within their farms. The \{NUANCES\} framework is not ‘just another computer model’! We combine the tools of systems analysis and experimentation, detailed field observations and surveys, incorporate expert knowledge (local knowledge and results of research), generate databases, and apply simulation models to analyse performance of farms, and the impacts of introducing new technologies. We have analysed and described complexity of farming systems, their external drivers and some of the mechanisms that result in (in)efficient use of scarce resources. Studying sites across sub-Saharan Africa has provided insights in the trajectories of change in farming systems in response to population growth, economic conditions and climate variability (cycles of drier and wetter years) and climate change. In regions where human population is dense and land scarce, farm typologies have proven useful to target technologies between farmers of different production objectives and resource endowment (notably in terms of land, labour and capacity for investment). In such regions we could categorise types of fields on the basis of their responsiveness to soil improving technologies along soil fertility gradients, relying on local indicators to differentiate those that may be managed through ‘maintenance fertilization’ from fields that are highly-responsive to fertilizers and fields that require rehabilitation before yields can improved. Where human population pressure on the land is less intense, farm and field types are harder to discern, without clear patterns. Nutrient cycling through livestock is in principle not efficient for increasing food production due to increased nutrient losses, but is attractive for farmers due to the multiple functions of livestock. We identified trade-offs between income generation, soil conservation and community agreements through optimising concurrent objectives at farm and village levels. These examples show that future analyses must focus at farm and farming system level and not at the level of individual fields to achieve appropriate targeting of technologies – both between locations and between farms at any given location. The approach for integrated assessment described here can be used ex ante to explore the potential of best-fit technologies and the ways they can be best combined at farm level. The dynamic and integrated nature of the framework allows the impact of changes in external drivers such as climate change or development policy to be analysed. Fundamental questions for integrated analysis relate to the site-specific knowledge and the simplification of processes required to integrate and move from one level to the next. "

A breeding program on wheat was started to enhance Zn and Fe concentrations and other essential traits needed in a successful commercial variety. The first set of advanced lines derived from crosses of high yielding wheats with genetic resources possessing high Zn and Fe such as Triticum spelta, landraces and synthetic wheat based on Triticum dicoccon were tested at nine locations in South Asia and Mexico for Zn and Fe concentration, grain yield and other traits. Analyses of variance across locations revealed significant genotypic, environmental and genotype × environment (G × E) effects for grain Zn and Fe concentrations and grain yield. Variances associated with environmental effects were larger than the genotypic and G × E effects for all three traits, suggesting that environmental effects have relatively greater influence. Although G × E interaction was significant, high heritabilities were observed for Zn and Fe concentrations at individual sites and across environments, reflecting non-crossover type of interaction. This trend was confirmed by the high genetic correlations between locations that showed similar ranking of entries across locations, indicating that it is possible to select the best adapted entries with high Zn and Fe concentration. Pooled data across locations showed increments of 28% and 25% over the checks for Zn and Fe. A considerable number of entries exceeded intermediate to full breeding target Zn concentrations, indicating that it is possible to develop Zn-biofortified varieties with competitive yields and other farmer preferred agronomic traits. The positive and moderately high correlation between Zn and Fe concentration suggest good prospects of simultaneous improvement for both micronutrients. "

abstract = "New technologies must be developed in sub-Saharan Africa which are sustainable and economically viable. This paper discusses a methodology for measuring the agricultural sustainability and economic viability of tropical farming systems for new technology evaluation. The approach is based on the concept of interspatial and intertemporal total factor productivity, paying particular attention to valuation of natural resource stock and flows. Agriculture is a sector which utilizes natural resources (e.g. soil nutrients) and the stock and flows of these resources affect the production environment. However, in many cases, the stock of these resources is beyond the control of the farmer and must be accounted for in an agricultural sustainability and economic viability measurement. For example, soil nutrients are removed by crops, erosion or leaching beyond the crop root-zone, or other processes such as volatilization of nitrogen. Agricultural production can also contribute to the stock of some nutrients by leguminous plants such as agroforestry systems. Using a data set available at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, we compute the intertemporal and interspatial total factor productivity indices for four cropping systems in southwestern Nigeria using stock of major soil nutrients as the natural resource stock. Results show that the sustainability and economic viability measures are sensitive to changes in the stock and flow of soil nutrients as well as the material inputs and outputs. Where the contribution of natural resource stock and flows are important (such as in the case of alley cropping), the measures provide markedly different results from conventional \{TFP\} approaches. The advantage of this approach is that interspatial and intertemporal total factor productivity measures are computed using only price and quantity data, thus eliminating the need for econometric estimation.

Under this highly dynamic context, sound conservation planning is needed and one component of effectively prioritising conservation interventions is through the assessment of threats to natural ecosystems. Here we present a continent-wide and spatially explicit threats assessment to natural ecosystems. A conceptual framework is presented which quantifies threat as a function of both the magnitude of the impacts of specific damaging human activities, and the variable response of different ecosystems to those impacts. The framework is then applied on seven different threat layers (accessibility, conversion to agriculture, fires, grazing pressure, infrastructure, oil and gas, recent conversion) to map out and spatially quantify the level of threat expected over the coming 2–5 year period. An aggregate threat layer is calculated, and the threats to major habitat types are evaluated. Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas and Shrublands and Flooded Grasslands and Savannas are found to be under the greatest threat (0.36 and 0.35 aggregate threat respectively), both threatened most by fires (0.96), the former by accessibility (0.72) and the latter by grazing pressure (0.62). Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests are the least threatened of all ecosystems (0.13), closely followed by Montane Grasslands and Shrublands (0.14). Overall, accessibility is shown to be a major issue across much of the continent, and fires are a significant threat in some identified regions. The results are being used by The Nature Conservancy to target conservation efforts in the region, and also to drive policies for threat abatement. Furthermore, the conceptual framework and methodology is applicable to any region and presents a useful means of prioritising conservation interventions across broad geographic regions. "

Drawing evidence from \{SSSAs\} in contexts of political and civil conflict (Zimbabwe and South Sudan), earthquake (Haiti) and drought (Kenya), the article shows that seed systems prove to be relatively resilient, at least in terms of meeting farmers’ planting needs for the upcoming season. Altering crop profiles, making use of multiple delivery channels, and innovating (for example, with new barter mechanisms) all become key, as does mobilizing cross-scale seed supply linkages. However, despite short-term survival, in the medium term, both formal and informal seed systems will have to be transformed to address agro-ecological and farming system challenges, partially shaped by global environmental changes. Key is that formal seed systems will play a catalytic but supporting role, with the onus on resilience response lying within informal systems, and especially with local markets and their traders. Also key is that achieving seed security in fluctuating environments will hinge on developing resilience-linked information systems which put as much weight on helping farmers strategize as on delivering the planting material itself. The article defines seed system resilience, identifies eight principles linked to processes that build such resilience, and makes 15 practical recommendations for enhancing seed system resilience in the short and medium term. Finally, drawing insights from seed systems, processes central for building resilience in other development sectors are highlighted. "

Using species distribution models, we assess possible future changes in the diversity and climatic niche size of an unprecedented number of species for the region. We modeled a broad range of taxa (11,012 species of birds and vascular plants), including both endemic and widespread species and provide a comprehensive estimation of climate change impacts on the Andes. We find that if no dispersal is assumed, by 2050s, more than 50% of the species studied are projected to undergo reductions of at least 45% in their climatic niche, whilst 10% of species could be extinct. Even assuming unlimited dispersal, most of the Andean endemics (comprising ∼5% of our dataset) would become severely threatened (&gt;50% climatic niche loss). While some areas appear to be climatically stable (e.g. Pichincha and Imbabura in Ecuador; and Nariño, Cauca, Valle del Cauca and Putumayo in Colombia) and hence depict little diversity loss and/or potential species gains, major negative impacts were also observed. Tropical high Andean grasslands (páramos and punas) and evergreen montane forests, two key ecosystems for the provision of environmental services in the region, are projected to experience negative changes in species richness and high rates of species turnover. Adapting to these impacts would require a landscape-network based approach to conservation, including protected areas, their buffer zones and corridors. A central aspect of such network is the implementation of an integrated landscape management approach based on sustainable management and restoration practices covering wider areas than currently contemplated.

It has been recognized for its success in producing scientific outputs and real world impacts and as a pioneer in integrated natural resource management (iNRM). Until now, there has been little understanding of the reasons for its success in integrating different perspectives and ways of working. To fill this gap, an on-line consultation involving \{ASB\} researchers was structured following an analytical framework developed by the Initiative on Science and Technology for Sustainability. The structure of the presentation of major results presented in this article also follows that framework, which includes four dimensions of integration (disciplinary, functional, spatial/temporal, and knowledge) and linked challenges of institutional learning and adaptation, fostering appropriate participation, and managing resource and capacity constraints. To lay the foundations for interpreting these insights and to motivate the study, introductory sections present qualitative evidence regarding organizational learning within the consortium (using research hypotheses as indicators) and success in producing integrated results (using a selection of research results as evidence). This report on ASB's experience in integrative science and organizational learning is intended to advance understanding of the scope and limits of a complex international consortium to integrate activities across disciplines, organizations, scales and knowledge systems in order to produce knowledge and policy relevant outputs. ASB's processes and structures have weaknesses as well as strengths.

Moreover, from a methodological perspective, the use of information technology reported in this article proved to be an effective means of triangulating the perceptions of geographically dispersed researchers. In doing so, this web-based consultation provided a medium for reflection by a large ‘virtual team’ on whether words about integration are translated into practice, at least as perceived and self-reported by the scientists who participated. These techniques could be employed for process documentation by other dispersed teams, thereby adding to the stock of information on what works (and what does not) in efforts to put integrative science into practice on a significant scale.

In Ethiopia, intensive mining of soil resources using repeated tillage, complete crop residue removal at harvesting, overgrazing and biomass burning in croplands have aggravated soil degradation. We studied the impact of two \{RCA\} (derdero+ (DER+) and terwah+ (TER+) on long-term soil quality and crop productivity in permanently kept plots in northern Ethiopia 7 years after its inception. The two \{RCA\} practices: (i) DER+ is a bed and furrow planting system, where beds remain unploughed, furrows are tilled once at planting time and 30% of crop residue is retained. (ii) TER+ is ploughed once at planting, furrows are made at 1.5 m intervals, creating fresh broad beds, and 30% crop residue is retained. These \{RCA\} practices were compared against conventional tillage (CT) characterized by a minimum of three tillage operations and complete removal of crop residues. Among the several assessed soil properties, soil organic C (SOC), total soil N, available P, soil microbial biomass C (SMBC), time of ponding, aggregate stability index (SI), consistency index (CI), cone index, air capacity and macroporosity were shown to increase significantly in soils subjected to DER+ planting system compared to CT. On average, crop yields under DER+ and TER+ increased by 30 % and 16 %, respectively, as compared to CT. Thus, from an agro-ecological point of view, adopting improved local practices such as DER+ and TER+ planting systems that employ conservation agriculture principles proved to be sustainable, resource conserving alternatives and incentives should be provided to facilitate larger adoption by farmers in Ethiopia.

Drought, in particular, represents one of the most important natural factors contributing to malnutrition and famine in many parts of the region. The overall impact of drought on a given country/region and its ability to recover from the resulting social, economic and environmental impacts depends on several factors. The economic, social and environmental impacts of drought are huge in \{SSA\} and the national costs and losses incurred threaten to undermine the wider economic and development gains made in the last few decades in the region. There is an urgent need to reduce the vulnerability of countries to climate variability and to the threats posed by climate change. This paper attempts to highlight the challenges of drought in \{SSA\} and reviews the current drought risk management strategies, especially the promising technological and policy options for managing drought risks to protect livelihoods and reduce vulnerability. The review suggests the possibilities of several ex ante and ex post drought management strategies in \{SSA\} although their effectiveness depends on agro-climatic and socio-economic conditions. Existing technological, policy and institutional risk management measures need to be strengthened and integrated to manage drought ex ante and to minimize the ex post negative effects for vulnerable households and regions. A proactive approach that combines promising technological, institutional and policy solutions to manage the risks within vulnerable communities implemented by institutions operating at different levels (community, sub-national, and national) is considered to be the way forward for managing drought and climate variability.

The large demand for palm oil has resulted in a rapid expansion of oil palm cultivation across the globe. Because of the dwindling availability of land in Southeast Asia, most expansion of the industry is expected in Central and South America and sub-Saharan Africa, where land with suitable agro-ecological conditions is available. Using Ghana as a case study, a method for evaluating areas that are both suitable and available for oil palm production is presented. Our assessment used spatial data and \{GIS\} techniques, and showed that areas with suitable climatic conditions (annual average water deficit &lt;400 mm) is about 20% greater than was previously identified. The observed differences are the result of using different methods to determine suitability, and climate change. A major climatic factor limiting suitability for oil palm production in Ghana is the annual water deficit, with the most suitable areas located in the rainforest and semi-deciduous forest zones with higher rainfall in southern Ghana. Opportunities for large-scale oil palm plantation development is limited, however, because of the lack of availability of large and contiguous tracts of land that are required for commercial plantation oil palm development. A feasible strategy for oil palm expansion is therefore smallholder production, which can make use of smaller parcels of land. Alternatively, oil palm production in Ghana can be increased by yield intensification on land already planted to oil palm. This can also reduce the requirement for further land clearance for new plantations to meet the growing demand for palm oil. Such assessments will be essential for guiding government policy makers and investors considering investments in oil palm development. "

This study assessed the drought response of 64 small red-seeded genotypes of common bean grown in a lattice design replicated twice under contrasting moisture regimes, terminal drought stress and non-stress, in Ethiopia during the dry season from November 2014 to March 2015. Multiple plant traits associated with drought were assessed for their contribution to drought adaptation of the genotypes. Drought stress determined by a drought intensity index was moderate (0.3). All the assessed traits showed significantly different genotypic responses under drought stress and non-stress conditions. Eleven genotypes significantly (P ≤ 0.05) outperformed the drought check cultivar under both drought stress and non-stress conditions in seed yielding potential. Seed yield showed positive and significant correlations with chlorophyll meter reading, vertical root pulling resistance force, number of pods per plant, and seeds per pod under both soil moisture regimes, indicating their potential use in selection of genotypes yielding well under drought stress and non-stress conditions. Clustering analysis using Mahalanobis distance grouped the genotypes into four groups showing high and significant inter-cluster distance, suggesting that hybridization between drought-adapted parents from the groups will provide the maximum genetic recombination for drought tolerance in subsequent generations.

Thus, monitoring E. coli concentrations is critical to evaluate current conditions, determine restoration effectiveness, and inform model development and calibration. An often overlooked component of these monitoring and modeling activities is understanding the inherent random and systematic uncertainty present in measured data. In this research, a review and subsequent analysis was performed to identify, document, and analyze measurement uncertainty of E. coli data collected in stream flow and stormwater runoff as individual discrete samples or throughout a single runoff event. Data on the uncertainty contributed by sample collection, sample preservation/storage, and laboratory analysis in measured E. coli concentrations were compiled and analyzed, and differences in sampling method and data quality scenarios were compared. The analysis showed that: (1) manual integrated sampling produced the lowest random and systematic uncertainty in individual samples, but automated sampling typically produced the lowest uncertainty when sampling throughout runoff events; (2) sample collection procedures often contributed the highest amount of uncertainty, although laboratory analysis introduced substantial random uncertainty and preservation/storage introduced substantial systematic uncertainty under some scenarios; and (3) the uncertainty in measured E. coli concentrations was greater than that of sediment and nutrients, but the difference was not as great as may be assumed. This comprehensive analysis of uncertainty in E. coli concentrations measured in streamflow and runoff should provide valuable insight for designing E. coli monitoring projects, reducing uncertainty in quality assurance efforts, regulatory and policy decision making, and fate and transport modeling.

Both, the herbaceous (P. phaseoloides) and tree (C. calothyrsus) leguminous fallows improved soil quality of a nonacidic Typic Kandiudult and a Rhodic kandiudult. The N content of either the coarse (4000–2000 μm) or the medium (2000–250 μm) \{POM\} fraction was increased as compared to the nonleguminous C. odorata fallow. This trend was also found after cropping all fallows. C. odorata fallow is better adapted to improve soil quality in the acidic Typic Kandiudox, than both leguminous fallows. N addition to soil from C. odorata fallow increased maize growth in the pot experiment as well as the weight of coarse \{POM\} (cPOM). P addition to soil from P. phaseoloides fallow had the same effect in the Rhodic Kandiudult, while a more pronounced response to P addition was found in soil from C. odorata fallow in the Typic Kandiudult.

The dynamics of age-structured populations of leaves, shoots, roots, peduncles, and other reproductive organs having numbers and dry matter attributes is simulated by a time-varying distributed delay model with attrition. A modified functional response model from predation theory is used to estimate the daily photosynthates acquisition. Dry matter allocation is simulated by a metabolic pool model. Growth and yield formation of the plant are driven by the computed ratio between carbohydrates supply and demand. Simulation results are compared with four sets of field data. Further, the model has been used to evaluate the effect of drought stress and different levels of available phosphate in the soil. The model is designed for research purposes, to be used as a tool for further studies of the cowpea agro-ecosystem. "

Twenty dry bean lines were evaluated for seed yield in a randomized complete-block design under soil moisture stress and nonstress environments during 1988, 1989 and 1992. Soil moisture stress levels were imposed by altering sowing dates (early vs. late) after the onset of the rainy season. Mean seed yield increased 8 kg ha−1 for each mm of seasonal rainfall that occurred during the growing season. Lines differed in response to soil moisture stress, and their response varied with environments. Six selection indices, including arithmetic mean (AM), geometric mean (GM), drought response index (DRI), susceptibility index (S), response to drought (RD), and percent reduction (PR), were calculated for each line to determine correlations between indices and yields in stress (Ys) and nonstress (Yns) environments. \{AM\} and \{GM\} were the only indices positively correlated with both Ys and Yns. \{AM\} had the largest correlation with Yns (r=0.90) whereas \{GM\} had the largest correlation with Ys (r=0.93). DRI, \{PR\} and S were correlated with Ys (r=0.86, −0.82 and −0.83, respectively) but not with Yns. Conversely, the index \{RD\} was correlated with Yns (r=0.73) but not Ys. The indices \{PR\} and S evaluated change in line performance across environments rather than line performance in either environment. \{GM\} and \{AM\} appear to be the most useful selection indices for identifying high yielding lines for both nonstress (early sown) and stress (late sown) conditions in the Rift Valley, while \{DRI\} has potential for use as a selection criteria only for stress environments.

In this paper we assess the potential of satellite remote sensing and proximal soil sensing to map, predict and monitor \{ADEs\} in land affected by agro-industrial development. We use instruments based on portable x-ray fluorescence (PXRF) and electromagnetic induction (EMI) as well as high-resolution satellite data (Spot 6) for detailed soil surveys at a 10-ha \{ADE\} site now mainly used for soybean production on the Belterra Plateau, Pará, Brazil. We predict the regional occurrence of \{ADE\} in a c. 250 km2 test area centred on the known \{ADE\} site São Francisco using satellite data. Multivariate adaptive regression splines models were parameterised for predictions of soil organic carbon (SOC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), phosphorus (P) and depth of the A horizon in \{ADEs\} from sensor data – both from individual sensors and in sensor combinations. Combining sensors gave the best validation results: the highest modelling efficiencies (E) were 0.70 (SOC), 0.88 (CEC) and 0.74 (for both P and A depth). The most powerful single proximal sensor outputs in the predictions were Sr from the \{PXRF\} data and magnetic susceptibility (MSa) as measured by the \{EMI\} instrument. In the regional satellite based model we located 17 previously unrecorded \{ADE\} sites &gt; 2 ha. Ground control checks showed that 10 out of 11 sites were correctly classified. We conclude that these sensors are useful in studies of \{ADE\} in deforested cropland and provide new opportunities for detailed studies of the archaeological record. "

The density of both pest complexes was found to be related to the height of the sampled leaf within the crop canopy. It was also found that, early in the season, chrysomelid damage was irregularly distributed within an individual field, although, later in the season, this was not so for either insect or disease attack. At the time of farmers' pesticide applications, insect and disease pest density generally varied between farms, suggesting that different farmer control practices are a response to different attack levels. There was evidence that insecticide applications were effective in reducing insect damage, and that foliar fertilizers reduced disease density in a warm, dry area. In a wetter, cooler area where diseases are a more serious problem, however, neither fungicide nor foliar fertilizer applications were shown to affect disease development. "

The Quesungual slash-and-mulch agroforestry system (QSMAS) of western Honduras offers a promising alternative to traditional slash-and-burn (SB) agriculture for the mountainous tropical dry forest zones of Central America, but the overall influence of this system on soils is not fully understood. We examined earthworm populations, soil fertility and soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics under \{QSMAS\} and \{SB\} agriculture, with secondary forest (SF) as a reference. Both \{QSMAS\} and \{SB\} consisted of treatments with and without inorganic fertilizer (N–P–K) additions, resulting in five management treatments, each present on three replicate farms. Baseline soil samples (0–15 cm) were collected prior to forest clearing and establishment of \{QSMAS\} plots in 2003 and in \{SB\} and \{SF\} plots in 2005 to determine initial soil concentrations of C and N. Soils were sampled in 2006 and 2007 for bulk soil C and N and P availability, as well as for aggregate fractionation and determination of C and N within the different aggregate size fractions. Earthworm populations were assessed in July 2007. Earthworm numbers and biomass were higher under \{QSMAS\} than under \{SB\} (13.4 vs. 0.8 g fresh biomass m− 2; respectively). Significant interactions between cropping system and fertilization suggest that \{QSMAS\} increased the availability of added inorganic P, 3 times more under \{QSMAS\} than for SB. Comparisons with SF, indicated that both cropping systems resulted in a dramatic loss of C (average 5 g C kg− 1 soil) since treatment implementation, and that this loss was mainly associated with the disruption of C rich large macroaggregates (&gt; 2000 µm). After taking into account baseline soil C differences between plots, no major differences in total \{SOM\} losses were found between \{QSMAS\} and \{SB\} management. However, earlier establishment of \{QSMAS\} plots suggests that the overall rate of C loss since treatment establishment was lower for \{QSMAS\} than for SB. Results from this study suggest that the Quesungual agroforestry system offers great potential to improve soil fertility and biological health in the region relative to traditional slash-and-burn agriculture.

Residue quality may be a controlling factor for any beneficial interactions. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of different quality organic residues and mineral fertilizer on N cycling under field conditions in Embu, Kenya. We hypothesized that combining low quality residue with mineral N would reduce potential system losses of N by synchronizing N release with plant uptake. Residue treatments consisted of a control (no residue input), high quality tithonia (Tithonia diversifolia) residue (C to N ratio of 13:1) and low quality maize (Zea mays) stover residue (C to N ratio of 42:1) applied at a rate of 1.2 Mg C ha−1. Subplots of each residue treatment received either 0 or 120 kg N ha−1 in a split-application, and maize was cultivated each season. During the 11th growing season of the trial (March–September 2007), we monitored soil mineral N, potential gross mineralization and nitrification rates, and plant N content. Extractable mineral N in the soil profile varied with residue and fertilizer inputs throughout the growing season. The tithonia treatments showed early season N release of 22 kg N ha−1 in the upper 30 cm of the soil profile. The maize + fertilizer treatment displayed an immobilization of 34 kg N ha−1 after the application of N fertilizer. However, the lower mineral N of the maize + fertilizer treatment did not reduce crop N uptake, as mineral N in the other fertilizer treatments was leached from the upper soil (0–60 cm) at 57 d after planting. The interactive effect on crop yield and N uptake of combining residue with fertilizer-N changed from negative to positive as residue quality decreased. The benefit of combining low quality residue with N fertilizer in reducing N losses indicates that this soil fertility management strategy should be adopted in environments subject to high N leaching losses.

In general, the results suggest that individual and household characteristics are important determinants of decision to plant J. curcas and scale-up its adoption.

After 4.5 y, the soil under each cropping system was sampled and analysed for total organic matter, microbial C, N and P content, and mineralization rate of C and N. Microbial biomass C did not vary much among treatments, whereas the N and P contents of the biomass were considerably lower in rice monocrop than in any crop-pasture treatment. Biomass P was also low under native savanna. The contribution of microbial N or P to soil-organic-matter N or P was lowest under the rice monocrop and highest under the grass-legume pasture. Microbial C-to-N ratios fell in ranges commonly reported, but C-to-P ratios were rather wide (34–50), indicating that the microbes may have adapted themselves to the low-P conditions of these soils. The contribution of microbial P to soil-organic-matter P, however, was about the same as usually found in soils of much higher P fertility. As microbial biomass nutrients cycle relatively rapidly and P availability in these strongly P-sorbing soils is low, the microbial biomass may play an important role in supplying P to plants growing in these soils. A similar conclusion was reached for N. The microbial respiration rate per unit of microbial biomass C (qCO2), as determined during an 11-day incubation, was higher under rice-pasture rotations—particularly in the presence of a legume—than under rice monocropping. This suggests that a greater fraction of microbes was active under rice-pasture rotations, probably because of a more continuous and higher input of fresh organic matter. The fraction of organic matter mineralized during the incubation was also highest for the rice-pasture treatments. "

Some 1800 settler families continue to convert forest into pasture in a system based on the slash-and-burn agriculture and dual-purpose cattle production. Trends in carbon emissions and plant species losses during the 20-year history of Theobroma were analyzed by combining observed shifts in land-use types with estimates for the carbon stocks and plant species richness of each of these types. Carbon stocks declined from about 200 t ha−1 in the forest to 28 t ha−1 in the pasture and of 326 plant species encountered in the forest, only 20 remained in pastures (along with 66 species not found in forests). The effects of converting more than 93 000 ha of forest into other uses over 20 years include approximate losses of 14 million tons of C to the atmosphere and substantial losses of plant species. Land use alternatives that would store more C include agroforestry and – given the strong incentives for settlers to convert lands into pasture –improving pasture management or developing silvopastoral systems. Plant species conservation may be improved with proposed ways to add private value to the forest. "

We compiled data from 89 field trials between 1980 and 2004 evaluating natural mite, thrips, and whitefly herbivory in hundreds of cassava genotypes. Highly susceptible genotypes were excluded from subsequent evaluations within one or two trials. Statistical analyses estimating resistance were therefore performed only for genotypes evaluated for a given pest in at least three trials. These analyses revealed potentially-useful genotype variation in resistance to Mononychellus tanajoa (Bondar), Aleurotrachelus socialis Bondar, and Frankliniella williamsi Hood. Based on this variation, we identified 129 potential sources of resistance to F. williamsi, 33 to M. tanajoa, and 19 to A. socialis. Leaf pubescence was positively associated with resistance to the three pests, and root cyanide was negatively associated with resistance to A. socialis.

Single 20-m rows of vetiver grass [Vetiveria zizanioides (L.) Nash], lemon grass [Cymbopogon citratus (DC. ex Nees) Stapf] and guatemala grass [Tripsacum andersonii J.R. Gray] were grown on a 13% slope. Cassava was planted in rows on either side of the grass barriers. Observation pits were dug in the cassava-grass plots and perspex sheets fitted closely to exposed walls. These pits allowed periodic tracing of roots. Root length was recorded in metres either per total of an exposed surface measuring 0.8 (depth) and 1.2 m (width) or measuring 0.2 (depth) × 1.2 m (width). Because of their vertical growth and their weak tendency to branch, the roots of vetiver grass rarely mixed with cassava roots, signifying a largely separate soil exploration by the two plants. In contrast, the profuse vertical and horizontal spread of guatemala grass and cassava roots indicated a joint exploration of soil volume. The cassava-lemon grass system revealed an intermediate pattern. The longest roots per exposed area of 0.2 × 1.2 m were observed for cassava growing on both sides of the vetiver grass barrier, and increasing from 6.0 m in the 0–20 cm profile segment to 7.3 m in the 20–40 cm segment. In contrast, roots of cassava with guatemala grass shortened from 5.4 m in the uppermost profile segment to 3.6 m in the 20–40 cm segment. Vetiver grass exhibited the slowest and steadiest root growth and guatemala grass the fastest. Final total root lengths obtained from the entire exposed soil profile were 7 m for vetiver grass, 16 m for guatemala grass and 17 m for lemon grass. Cassava root growth was very slow initially, but increased 25–28 weeks after grass planting when grass root growth temporarily slowed down as a result of cutback. Final total cassava root lengths obtained from the exposed soil profile were 17, 10 and 10 m in association with the three grasses, respectively. The differences in rooting pattern, root growth dynamics and final root lengths suggest that different degrees of root interaction may have occurred, with possible consequences for soil exploration, and nutrient and water uptake.

In this experiment, 16 cultivars of non-climbing beans, including determinate and indeterminate types, were evaluated in sole crop and in association with bananas for three seasons in 1989 and 1990 to determine if selection of bean cultivars in monoculture can result in genetic progress for the banana-bean association. Cultivar × cropping system interactions were not significant for bean seed yield and the components of yield. Rank correlation coefficients of cultivar seasonal mean yields in monoculture to the overall cultivar mean yields in association were high and significant ranging from 0.50 to 0.84. This was consistent with the lack of cultivar × cropping system interaction. Numbers of pods and seeds per plant were more closely associated with intercrop bean yield than sole-crop yield. The results of this research have shown that evaluation of non-climbing bean genotypes for seed yield in monoculture provides sufficient information to select cultivars efficiently for the banana-bean intercropping system.

Nitrogen fixation was estimated by the 15N dilution technique, using Melinis minutiflora as the reference plant. Phosphorus limited growth and \{N2\} fixation to a greater extent than did potassium. Phosphorus supply increased dry-matter production, on average, by 193%, N concentration in shoot tissue by 10% and percentage of nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) by 15% at 14 weeks after sowing. These increases resulted in 259% more \{N2\} being fixed at 75 kg P ha−1 than at 5 kg P ha−1. In contrast, K supply enhanced dry-matter production by 85% and the amount of \{N2\} fixed by the same proportion. Severe P deficiency quickly led to a strong reduction in nodule weight, whereas K deficiency decreased nodule weight per unit root weight only at later stages of growth. With a supply of 75 kg P ha−1, with or without K, the legumes derived over 87% of their N from the atmosphere. The percentage N derived from the atmosphere of C. macrocarpum was more sensitive to P deficiency (63%Ndfa with 5 kg P ha−1) than that of C. acutifolium (76%Ndfa) at 10 weeks. Phosphorus was considered to have a direct effect on \{N2\} fixation, which would make it necessary to take into account its effect on the symbiosis when screening legumes for tolerance to low soil fertility.

Four contrasting varieties were grown under rainfed conditions for 10 months in the field for two consecutive seasons under four fertilizer treatments. There were three dosages of P fertilizer at 0, 50 and 100 kg P ha−1 with 100 kg \{NK\} ha−1, plus a control with no fertilizer. Sequential harvests that included biomass determination were conducted. Single-leaf gas exchange was monitored by portable infrared gas analysis systems. All varieties showed a significant positive response in total and aerial biomass as well as mean leaf area index (LAI) to P fertilization, at least in the second year. The variety M Col 1684 was the only one that did not significantly respond in terms of dry root yield and number of storage roots to P fertilization over the years. This variety was among the most responsive for peak LAI, number of aerial apices and reproductive organs (flowers and fruits). Yield and storage root number correlated positively with net photosynthetic rates and negatively with reproductive organs. Variety M Col 1684 could not maintain a high harvest index with increasing aerial growth. In contrast, \{CM\} 489-1 balanced aerial growth enhancement with intensive root formation, augmenting root sink strength and yield. It is concluded that yield response to P fertilization depended upon the balance between aerial growth potential of varieties and storage root sink strength. "

Two-year trials with four varieties were conducted in a field low in P with three levels (0, 50 and 100 kg ha−1) of P application. Five sequential harvests (with determination of P uptake) were carried out during each of two growth cycles, and \{VAM\} infection rates of fine roots and root length density in the surface soil layer were measured. In all varieties P uptake increased with P fertilization, and cultivar variation in P uptake was related to differences in fine root length density more than to \{VAM\} infection rates. Uptake efficiency of roots (as uptake rate per unit root length) did not differ among varieties. Phosphorus-use efficiency (as root yield per accumulated P in the whole plant) and patterns of dry matter allocation to roots and shoots were significantly different among varieties. It was concluded that cultivar differences in response to applied P were mainly due to contrasting patterns of dry matter partitioning and P-use efficiency. Adaptation to low-P soils could be enhanced by selection of varieties with high fine-root length density, moderate top growth and stable harvest index. "

The Integrated Soil Fertility Management paradigm recognizes the possible interactive benefits of combining organic residues with mineral fertilizer inputs on agroecosystem functioning. However, these beneficial effects may be controlled by residue quality. This study examines the controls of inputs on N cycling across a gradient of (1) input, (2) residue quality, and (3) texture. We hypothesized that combining organic residue and mineral fertilizers would enhance potential N availability relative to either input alone. Residue and fertilizer inputs labeled with 15N (40–60 atom% 15N) were incubated with 200 g soil for 545 d in a microcosm experiment. Input treatments consisted of a no-input control, organic residues (3.65 g C kg−1 soil, equivalent to 4 Mg C ha−1), mineral N fertilizer (100 mg N kg−1 soil, equivalent to 120 kg N ha−1), and a combination of both with either the residue or fertilizer 15N-labeled. Zea mays stover inputs were added to four differently textured soils (sand, sandy loam, clay loam, and clay). Additionally, inputs of three residue quality classes (class I: Tithonia diversifolia, class II: Calliandra calothyrsus, class III: Z. mays stover) were applied to the clay soil. Available N and \{N2O\} emissions were measured as indicators for potential plant N uptake and N losses. Combining residue and fertilizer inputs resulted in a significant (P &lt; 0.05) negative interactive effect on total extractable mineral N in all soils. This interactive effect decreased the mineral N pool, due to an immobilization of fertilizer-derived N and was observed up to 181 d, but generally became non-significant after 545 d. The initial reduction in mineral N might lead to less \{N2O\} losses. However, a texture effect on \{N2O\} fluxes was observed, with a significant interactive effect of combining residue and fertilizer inputs decreasing \{N2O\} losses in the coarse textured soils, but increasing \{N2O\} losses in the fine textured soils. The interactive effect on mineral N of combining fertilizer with residue changed from negative to positive with increasing residue quality. Our results indicate that combining fertilizer with medium quality residue has the potential to change N transformations through a negative interactive effect on mineral N. We conclude that capitalizing on interactions between fertilizer and organic residues allows for the development of sustainable nutrient management practices. "

A mesocosm experiment was conducted in Embu, central Kenya where 4 Mg C ha−1 of Tithonia diversifolia (high quality), Calliandra calothyrsus (intermediate quality) and Zea mays (maize; low quality) were applied to soil compared to a no-input control. Each treatment was fertilized with 120 kg N ha−1 as urea [(NH2)2CO] or not fertilized. The soils used in the mesocosms were obtained from a three-year old-field experiment in which the same treatments as in the mesocosm were applied annually. No crops were grown in both the mesocosms and the thee-year field experiment. Soil samples were collected at zero, two, five and eight months after installation of the mesocosms and separated into four aggregate size fractions by wet sieving. Macroaggregates were further fractionated to isolate the microaggregates-within-macroaggregates; all soils and fractions were analyzed for \{SOC\} and N. The addition of \{ORs\} increased soil aggregation and whole \{SOC\} and soil N compared to the control and sole N fertilizer treatments. There were no differences among different \{OR\} qualities for whole \{SOC\} or soil N, but maize alone resulted in greater mean weight diameter (MWD), macroaggregate \{SOC\} and N than sole added Calliandra. The addition of N fertilizer only influenced \{SOC\} and soil N dynamics in combination with maize where SOC, soil N and aggregation were lower with the addition of N fertilizer, indicating an increased decomposition and loss of \{SOC\} and soil N due to a faster aggregate turnover after addition of N fertilizer. In conclusion, compared to high quality ORs, low quality \{ORs\} result in greater aggregate stability and a short-term accumulation of macroaggregate \{SOC\} and N. However, the addition of N fertilizers negates these effects of low quality ORs. "

In Colombia, high whitefly populations can reduce crop yields by 79%; and although the farmers intensify the use of insecticides, this practice is highly contaminating, costly and leads to the development of resistance in the insect. An alternative for managing whitefly populations is to develop genetically resistant varieties. Wild parents of Manihot are a useful source of genes against pests for the cultivated species of cassava. Based on prior research that showed the existence of moderate-to-high levels of resistance to A. socialis in Manihot flabellifolia, a wild species of cassava, this study was proposed to characterize this new source of resistance, evaluating the biology and demographics of A. socialis on eight accessions of M. flabellifolia, a susceptible check (CMC-40) and a resistant (MEcu72) check. The averages of A. socialis longevity and fecundity on the accessions were not significantly different to MEcu72, but different from CMC-40 (P &lt; 0.05). Development time was not significantly different, ranging from 35–40 days on accessions and \{MEcu72\} and 33.5 days on CMC-40 (P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, the population growth rate (rm) was significantly lower on the M. flabellifolia accessions, with Fla 61 standing out with a growth rate 98 and 99% less than that obtained on \{MEcu72\} and CMC-40, respectively. Once the resistant levels have been identified to A. socialis on the M. flabellifolia accessions, interspecific crosses of M. esculenta subsp.

However, the available statistical analyses show that the proportion of the population spatial variance that can be ascribed to soil habitat variability is modest. We studied the spatial distribution of two medium-sized endogeic earthworm species (Andiodrilus sp. and Glossodrilus sp.) and the spatial segregation between them. The survey was undertaken in a native savanna and a grass-legume pasture in the Colombian “Llanos”. The presence of spatial dependence in the data (i.e. earthworm counts) was tested using two different approaches: the Spatial Analysis using Distance IndicEs (SADIE) analyses and cross-coregionalization. The \{SADIE\} index allowed for testing the spatial association or dissociation between earthworm counts. The spatial organization of both species was well structured in the natural savanna while they were randomly distributed in the pasture in almost all sampling dates. When the spatial distribution was different from randomness it was always aggregated irrespective of the land-use system. There was no absolute stable spatial pattern in the natural savanna although a general pattern seemed to emerge. On the contrary, no pattern was observed in the pasture. Both species displayed opposite spatial distributions (P &lt; 0.05) that were of different intensity depending on the sampling date. The presence of opposite patches and gaps suggests the presence of a competitive exclusion phenomenon (at least spatial) that deserves further investigations. "

Social physics leads towards finding universal relationships in data on the basis of well-understood and statistically robust methodologies. Recent trends in quantitative geography have focused on empirical, visual, exploratory and local methods to reveal patterns that can subsequently form part of a model specification to design experiments and test hypotheses. The information technology data explosion during the last two decades has increased differences between the social physics and the quantitative geographical paradigms. The view expressed here is that problems in spatial analysis and modelling have been deliberately ignored to date or treated as a special case of aspatial modelling. To continue such a trend would imply that location is not relevant for spatial analysis. This paper reviews misconceptions surrounding the use of spatial data and describes a set of spatial analysis methodologies to permit scale-sensitive and location specific analyses of socio-economic and biophysical data from a range of sources using examples that demonstrate the need for more geographical approaches to inherent geographical problems. The examples illustrate that scale and aggregation artefacts can be observed, accounted for and even used to advantage, new relevant areal units can be designed within \{GIS\} environments, and that system boundaries of complex agro-ecosystems can be automatically derived from the combination of a spatial regression model and a neural classifier.

abstract = "Success in long-term agricultural production in resource-poor farming systems relies on the efficiency with which nutrients are conserved and recycled. Each transfer of nutrients across the farming system provides a risk of inefficiency, and how much is lost at each step depends on the type of farming system, its management practices and site conditions. The aim of this review was to identify critical steps where efficiency of nitrogen (N) cycling through livestock in smallholder crop–livestock farming systems could be increased, with special emphasis on Africa. Farming systems were conceptualised in four sub-systems through which nutrient transfer takes place: (1) livestock: animals partition dietary intake into growth and milk production, faeces and urine; (2) manure collection and handling: housing and management determine what proportion of the animal excreta may be collected; (3) manure storage: manure can be composted with or without addition of plant materials and (4) soil and crop conversion: a proportion of the N in organic materials applied to soil becomes available, part of which is taken up by plants, of which a further proportion is partitioned into grain N. An exhaustive literature review showed that partial efficiencies have been much more commonly calculated for the first and last steps than for manure handling and storage. Partial N cycling efficiencies were calculated for every sub-system as the ratio of nutrient output to nutrient input. Estimates of partial N cycling efficiency (NCE) for each sub-system ranged from 46 to 121% (livestock), 6 to 99% (manure handling), 30 to 87% (manure storage) and 3 to 76% (soil and crop conversion). Overall N cycling efficiency is the product of the partial efficiencies at each of the steps through which N passes. Direct application of plant materials to soil results in more efficient cycling of N, with fewer losses than from materials fed to livestock. However, livestock provide many other benefits highly valued by farmers, and animal manures can contain large amounts of available N, which increases the immediate crop response. Manures also can contribute to increase (or at least maintain) the soil organic C pool but more quantitative information is needed to assess the actual benefits. Making most efficient use of animal manures depends critically on improving manure handling and storage, and on synchrony of mineralisation with crop uptake. Measures to improve manure handling and storage are generally easier to design and implement than measures to improve crop recovery of N, and should receive much greater attention if overall system \{NCE\} is to be improved.

abstract = "The assumed relationship between biodiversity or local richness and the persistence of ‘ecosystem services’ (that can sustain productivity on-site as well as off-site, e.g. through regulation of water flow and storage) in agricultural landscapes has generated considerable interest and a range of experimental approaches. The abstraction level aimed for, however, may be too high to yield meaningful results. Many of the experiments on which evidence in favour or otherwise are based are artificial and do not support the bold generalisations to other spatial and temporal scales that are often made. Future investigations should utilise co-evolved communities, be structured to investigate the distinct roles of clearly defined functional groups, separate the effects of between- and within-group diversity and be conducted over a range of stress and disturbance situations. An integral part of agricultural intensification at the plot level is the deliberate reduction of diversity. This does not necessarily result in impairment of ecosystem services of direct relevance to the land user unless the hypothesised diversity–function threshold is breached by elimination of a key functional group or species. Key functions may also be substituted with petro-chemical energy in order to achieve perceived efficiencies in the production of specific goods. This can result in the maintenance of ecosystem services of importance to agricultural production at levels of biodiversity below the assumed ‘functional threshold’. However, it can also result in impairment of other services and under some conditions the de-linking of the diversity–function relationship. Avoidance of these effects or attempts to restore non-essential ecosystem services are only likely to be made by land users at the plot scale if direct economic benefit can be thereby achieved. At the plot and farm scales biodiversity is unlikely to be maintained for purposes other than those of direct use or ‘utilitarian’ benefits and often at levels lower than those necessary for maintenance of many ecosystem services. The exceptions may be traditional systems where intrinsic values (social customs) continue to provide reasons for diversity maintenance. High levels of biodiversity in managed landscapes are more likely to be maintained for reasons of intrinsic, serependic (‘option’ or ‘bequest’) values or utilitarian (‘direct use’) than for functional or ecosystem service values. The major opportunity for both maintaining ecosystem services and biodiversity outside conservation areas lies in promoting diversity of land-use at the landscape and farm rather than field scale. This requires, however, an economic and policy climate that favours diversification in land uses and diversity among land users. "

This study investigated the effect of 30 kg ha−1 P fertilizer and improved bean cultivars on intercrop yields and bean \{BNF\} (measured by the N-difference method) at two sites with nutrient deficient soils typical of high altitude cropping systems in Malawi. Following farmer practice, maize was the dominant crop of the intercrop and bean a low density `bonus' crop. Phosphorus application to the maize/bean intercrop consistently enhanced maize and bean yields and BNF. Yields of the improved cultivars were about 150% higher than farmer cultivars at both 0 and 30 kg P ha−1. \{BNF\} was increased by about 90% in improved cultivars compared to farmer cultivars, with the exception of one site in 1996/97. A trial conducted at nine sites on-farm was used to evaluate a fertilizer strategy of P (30 kg ha−1) and N (30 kg ha−1) applied to a maize/bean intercrop versus sole maize. Yields and economic evaluation indicated high mean net benefits for an average cost/price scenario for fertilizer application to maize/bean intercrop: net benefit was US$192 ha−1, compared to unfertilized sole maize, net benefit US$62 ha−1. Net benefit for fertilizing sole maize was US$86 ha−1. Fertilizing maize/bean intercrops is a promising technology for smallholder farmers in upland, P-deficient soils, in areas where beans as a sole crop are not valued sufficiently to be fertilized by subsistence farmers.

All crops were grown in replicated plots on 7% slope on a sandy loam soil in Sri Racha, Thailand, during a 4 1/2-year period. Erosion losses associated with each crop were also determined by weighing at monthly intervals the soil sediments that had collected in plastic covered channels at the bottom of each plot. Cassava for root production had the lowest total uptake of major nutrients of all crops except mungbean. The amounts of N and P removed in the harvested plant parts were also much lower than those removed by other crops, while the amount of K removed by cassava was similar to other crops but much lower than pineapple or cassava grown for forage. This latter crop had a very high nutrient uptake and removal, especially that of N, K, Ca and Mg. On an annual basis, soil losses due to erosion were highest in cassava grown for roots, followed by cassava for forage, sugarcane, mungbean, sorghum, peanut, maize and pineapple. Thus, when cassava is grown for root production on slopes, it is likely to cause more erosion than most other crops due to its wide spacing and slow initial canopy development. Cassava farmers should therefore be encouraged to use special management practices that reduce erosion. However, it is unlikely that cassava causes soil degradation by depleting the soil nutrient supply, as N and P removal in the harvested part of the plant was actually lower than, and K removal was similar to that of other crops tested.

Growth analyses, single-leaf gas exchange, and internal leaf anatomy were studied during vegetative growth for 16 lines of common bean (9 Andean and 7 Mesoamerican) at Palmira and Popayan, Colombia, and for 14 lines at Gainesville, Florida, to determine the basis for the smaller \{RGR\} of large-seeded Andean lines. Pooled analyses across sites revealed that RGR, net assimilation rate (NAR), single-leaf carbon exchange rates (CER), specific leaf weight (SLW), specific leaf N (SLN), leaf thickness, and mesophyll-cell surface area per unit leaf area (AmA) exposed to air were all smaller for large-seeded Andean lines than for small-seeded Mesoamerican lines. Relative growth rate was positively correlated (P &lt; 0.10) with \{CEr\} at all three sites.

The association of large cell size with Andean background was the dominant factor responsible for large seed size and rapid \{SGR\} of Andean genotypes.

To test this hypothesis, three field studies were conducted over three consecutive cropping seasons at Kawanda Agricultural Research Institute in Uganda. In the first season, crotalaria biomass was produced in pure stands or in intercrop systems with either common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) or maize (Zea mays L.) as companion crops. Crotalaria was sown at planting and three weeks after planting the food crops. The biomass of early planted crotalaria was mulched, that of late planted crotalaria was incorporated into the soil at planting of the following crop. The first subsequent crop was maize, and the second was either beans (in two seasons) or maize (in one season). In the crotalaria production season, mean yield losses of maize through intercropping with early or late sown crotalaria were 40 and 22%, respectively; the corresponding values for beans were 45 and 14%. In the first cropping season after crotalaria production, the increase in maize grain yield on account of crotalaria averaged 39%; the best response (68% increase) to crotalaria was obtained with early sown sole crotalaria applied as mulch. Major differences in soil mineral nitrogen content among the treatments occurred at the six-leaf stage of maize only. In the second cropping season following crotalaria production, the mean increases in seed yields of beans or maize, due to crotalaria, were 23 and 19%, respectively, indicating a considerable residual effect of crotalaria green manure. The decrease in bulk density, and the increase in water infiltration capacity of the soil suggest that the yield stimulation because of crotalaria not only resulted from the increased nitrogen supply, but also from more favorable soil physical properties. Considering the competitive effect of crotalaria with the food crops and the positive effect on yields of subsequent crops, two options are especially promising: incorporation of crotalaria produced by relay intercropping with beans and mulching of early sown crotalaria produced in pure stands.

Relative growth rate (RGR, g g−1 per day), unit leaf rate (ULR, g m−2 per day), leaf area ratio (LAR, m2 g−1), specific leaf area (SLA, m2 g−1), leaf weight ratio (LWR, g leaf g−1), and rate of ion uptake were calculated for the period between 10 and 20 days after planting. Salinity significantly reduced RGR, ULR, LAR, and \{SLA\} whereas \{LWR\} showed no definite trend. In all species, except in P. filiformis, ULR, but not LAR, was significantly correlated with RGR, indicating that \{ULR\} was an important factor underlying the salinity-induced differences in \{RGR\} among species. In P. filiformis, high salinity reduced SLA, and consequently LAR. The significant correlation of \{SLA\} and \{LAR\} with \{RGR\} suggested that growth components affecting leaf area expansion were the primary factors explaining the inhibition of growth in this species. Increasing salinity progressively decreased leaf water vapor conductance. The rate of \{CO2\} assimilation decreased gradually with salinity, showing significant reductions only at the highest salt level (80 mM NaCl). Approximately two-thirds of the reduction in \{CO2\} assimilation rate at high salinity was attributable to reduced stomatal conductance. In P. filiformis, however, neither stomatal conductance nor \{CO2\} assimilation were affected by salt stress. Leaf water and osmotic potentials declined significantly as stress intensified. However, osmotic adjustment permitted the maintenance of positive turgor throughout the growth period. Salinity had a significant effect on tissue concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl− and on the uptake rate of Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl−. Thus, in addition to the toxic effects of high concentrations of Na+ and Cl− in plant tissue, saline-induced changes in mineral nutrient uptake likely contributed to the reduction of plant growth. It appears that salt tolerance in P. filiformis is associated with Na+ exclusion and organ Na+ compartmentation in roots and stems as well as sustained K+ concentration in leaves and better stomatal control through osmotic adjustment. All other Phaseolus species are Na+ excluders, and maintained turgor-driven extension growth by accumulating Cl− (osmotic adjustment), but subsequent weight gain reductions suggest that this led to ion toxicity.

The objectives of the studies were to investigate the soil nitrogen dynamics and response of maize after different periods of legume growth and in a separate experiment to investigate the effect of inorganic N fertiliser on the maize grown after the selected legumes. In one experiment, the two herbaceous legumes were grown using two rotations—short (12 months) with a single forage harvest and followed by early maize; or long (15 months) with two forage harvests followed by late maize. More N was removed in the S. guianensis forage (140 kg N ha−1) compared to C. macrocarpum (90 kg N ha−1) although more N accumulated in the regrowth after harvest of C. macrocarpum (about 100 kg N ha−1—almost twice that of S. guianensis). Subsequently, the N status of maize plants (estimated using chlorophyll readings) in the first 37 days after sowing was higher for C. macrocarpum. Soil Nmin also tended to be higher after C. macrocarpum (maximum of 70 μg N g−1) compared to S. guianensis (maximum of 50 μg N g−1). This was not consistently reflected in maize grain yields. Under the experimental conditions, nitrogen appeared to be immobilised in the soil during the initial stage of legume decomposition, although this was less pronounced after S. guianensis. In a second experiment, first wet season (early) maize was grown after the same two legume species, and the interaction of preceding legumes with three levels of fertiliser N (0–30–60 kg N ha−1) applied to maize was assessed. Increasing fertiliser N levels had no clear impact on Nmin dynamics. Increased grain yield of maize in response to N addition was measured only after S. guianensis which may have been related to site characteristics. With respect to their potential to contribute to crop-livestock production, the two species differed in that S. guianensis was better with respect to year-round forage production, but C. macrocarpum had a greater effect on the subsequent maize yield. In order to improve the legume N contribution to maize at similar sites, the role of delayed N release during leguminous residue decomposition is emphasised. "

Two experiments with the gas transducer technique were carried out, where each forage mixture was tested either with or without polyethylene glycol in order to be able to identify tannin-related effects (n = 3). In Experiment 1, a stepwise replacement of V. unguiculata by C. calothyrsus (5:0, 4:1, 3:2, 2:3, 1:4, 0:5) at a legume proportion of 1/3 or 2/3 in the mixture was evaluated. Together with two grass-alone and four pure legume treatments this added up to 30 treatments. In Experiment 2, V. unguiculata was gradually replaced by each of the four shrub legumes (3:0, 2:1, 1:2, 0:3) in grass–legume ratios of 2:1, adding up, together with two grass-alone treatments, to 28 treatments. When added alone, V. unguiculata resulted in high fermentative activity as measured by gas production and kinetics as well as low proportion of undegraded crude protein. When V. unguiculata was replaced by the low-tannin C. argentea in Experiment 2, there was no noticeable difference (P&gt;0.05) in fermentative activity. In both experiments, the effect of the substitution of V. unguiculata by tanniniferous shrub legumes resulted in a declining gas production and an increasing proportion of undegraded crude protein (P&lt;0.001). However, the extent of these changes depended on the level of replacement and the shrub legume species (P&lt;0.001). The results of Experiment 2 illustrate that this was the consequence not only of different tannin contents (less adverse effects with L. leucocephala than with C. calothyrsus) but also differences in the chemical properties of the tannins present in these shrub legume species (much less adverse effects with L. leucocephala than with F. macrophylla despite similar tannin contents). Furthermore these results indicate that, once the extent of the effects of a tanniniferous legume is known, one may calculate the maximal level of replacement of a low-tannin legume in a grass diet possible without negative effects on ruminal fermentation. This allows to improve dry season grass-based diets with as few as possible of the expensive and less well growing low-tannin legume. "

In addition, \{SOC\} was quantified for 20-cm depth intervals to 100 cm depths.

Soil samples from 5 and 40 cm depths were incubated at 5 to 34 °C to determine the temperature sensitivity (Q10) of soil respiration. Results showed that \{SOC\} stocks to a soil depth of 1 m were larger at footslope (202 Mg C ha− 1) compared to shoulderslope (44 Mg C ha− 1) positions. Mean annual soil \{CO2\} concentrations were higher at footslope positions, and increased with depth at both shoulder- and footslope positions. Temperature sensitivity of C turnover was similar in topsoil at shoulderslope (Q10 = 2.5) and footslope (Q10 = 2.6) positions; in subsoil (40 cm), however, \{Q10\} was lower at shoulderslope (Q10 = 2.0) than footslope (Q10 = 3.2) positions. Further, shoulderslope subsoil had less non-complexed organic C than footslope subsoil, suggesting that the shoulderslope subsoil was not C saturated and had higher potential for C stabilization. Despite the dissimilar subsoil characteristics at shoulder- and footslope positions, soil surface \{CO2\} effluxes were similar, suggesting low contribution of subsoil C to short-term surface \{CO2\} fluxes at footslope positions.

However, the spatial distribution of root biomass in arable systems remains largely unknown. In this study, we determined the spatial distribution of macro-root and shoot biomass of winter wheat at shoulderslope and footslope positions from four cultivated slopes within an arable field in western Denmark. In addition, soils from the shoulderslope and footslope positions of four slopes were characterized for physical and chemical properties. Root biomass dry matter (DM) was marginally higher (P = 0.06) at footslope (1.2 Mg \{DM\} ha- 1) than at shoulderslope positions (0.9 Mg \{DM\} ha− 1), in particular in the subsoil. Likewise shoot biomass was higher (P = 0.03) at footslope (10.3 Mg \{DM\} ha− 1) compared to shoulderslope (7.1 Mg \{DM\} ha− 1) positions. Soil bulk density increased with depth at shoulderslope positions, but was more variable with depth at footslope positions. Root C was significantly correlated with \{SOC\} in shoulderslope soils (r = 0.98), but not in footslope soils. We conclude that, at shoulderslope positions, \{SOC\} originated mainly from root residues whereas at footslope positions, \{SOC\} was derived from both root residues and likely soil redistribution processes. Management practices that increase C input at shoulderslope positions potentially enhance soil carbon storage and increase crop productivity, which would probably not be the case for C rich footslope soils. These findings imply that models used to simulate or predict C dynamics and crop productivity should consider topography-controlled variations in root C input and \{SOC\} redistribution as well as their effects on soil properties, root growth and crop productivity.

Furthermore, when the aim is to produce realistic scenarios, land-use models should be both spatially and temporally explicit. Using an example of such a model, the conversion of land-use and its effects modelling framework, we explore near-future land-use changes in Central America. Besides a Base and an Optimistic scenario, which assumes yields to approach the present maximum in the region and assumes export and import to increase, focus is on projection of the long-term effects of an extreme event. Scenario assumptions are based on actual data that became available after hurricane Mitch struck the continent. Resulting maps of the Base and Optimistic scenario demonstrate how slow and gradual changes at the national level translate into highly dynamic patterns of land-use change when allocated spatially. Hot-spots of change prove relatively insensitive to changes in income. Particularly land-use change patterns of the most common land-use types, pasture, annual crops, and natural vegetation, differed between both scenarios. The results of the Natural Hazard scenario for Honduras separately as well as for Central America as a whole clearly indicate that the effects of a hurricane on land-use patterns, though initially strong, are likely to largely disappear within a period of 10 years. Concepts from ecology regarding complexity as developed by Holling are used to illustrate the behaviour of the Central American land-use system. Practicabilities for policy makers are indicated, but similar studies and spatially explicit models are needed from sociology and economics to complete our understanding of the long-term effects of an extreme event.

The use of a combination of different natural resources for protecting stored beans from attack by A. obtectus by non-toxic means is considered a promising alternative to the use of traditional chemical insecticides. The seed storage protein arcelin causes sub-lethal effects on the development of A. obtectus that are favorable for biological control. The present study aimed to validate the mutual compatibility between the plant resistance factor arcelin and the biological control candidate D. basalis. Development and performance of D. basalis attacking A. obtectus on beans with different relative arcelin concentrations were investigated in bioassays. The parasitoid accepted hosts on all tested bean lines, irrespective of the relative concentration of arcelin. No indications were found for an effect of arcelin on parasitoid offspring fitness. The parasitoid’s capability to suppress bruchid development was investigated in a follow-up experiment mimicking the temporal complexity of bruchid infestations in the field. Bruchid suppression was significantly higher on arcelin containing bean lines than on arcelin-free cultivars. Our findings demonstrate the potential of the candidate biological control agent D. basalis to contribute to a marked reduction of bruchid emergence in a proposed two-component integrated pest management system.

H. prosopidis had a shorter oviposition period than D. basalis, resulting in a lower lifetime progeny production. To determine the effect of food sources, either honey, sugarcane, or host larvae were offered to the parasitoids. Honey was a suitable food source for all three parasitoids. Honey as a food supplement for the synovigenic species D. basalis and A. calandrae increased their lifetime progeny production through an increase in reproductive lifetime, whereas in the proovigenic species H. prosopidis consumption of honey resulted in a higher number of progeny through an increase in daily oviposition rate rather than an increase in oviposition period.

We studied the effects of a mixed species infestation by cassava mealybug and cassava green mite, Mononychellus tanajoa Bondar, or whitefly, Aleurotrachelus socialis Bondar, on the mealybug pest and its encyrtid parasitoids. Development, distribution and reproduction of the cassava mealybug as well as the post-alighting behavior and reproduction of the two parasitoid species were analyzed in a mixed species infestation as compared to an infestation by cassava mealybug only. Results show that developmental time of cassava mealybug females was altered when an additional herbivore species was feeding on the same plant. The duration of the third larval instar was significantly shorter when cassava green mite was present. In contrast, the duration of this instar was longer when whitefly was present. Reproduction of cassava mealybug was not affected, nor was the ratio of its distribution on the adaxial and the abaxial surface of the cassava leaf. Our findings on altered developmental time of phloem feeding cassava mealybug in mixed species infestations suggest that the desiccation of leaves caused by the cell sap feeding cassava green mite accelerated mealybug development. In contrast, the interaction with the similarly phloem feeding whitefly retarded it. The post-alighting behavior of the specialist parasitoid A. vexans differed between the two mixed species infestations as compared to the infestation with the cassava mealybug only. The preference of females for the adaxial leaf surface observed in the infestation with cassava mealybug only was not found in either of the mixed species infestations. In contrast, the post-alighting behavior of the generalist parasitoid A. coccois was similar in the mixed species infestations as in the infestation by cassava mealybug only. These results indicate a more robust behavior of the generalist, but the altered behavior of the specialist remained without consequences on parasitism rate under the conditions of this study. "

Improvements in transport infrastructure will likely decrease levels of food poverty country-wide but could be most beneficial in the extreme south and in the province of Esmeraldas.

The short term effects of planting basins on crop yields and labour requirements were evaluated in an on-farm experiment over two seasons (2009/2010 and 2010/2011) in Murehwa district, Zimbabwe. The experiment was established on clay (Luvisols) and sandy soils (Lixisols), in two field types; outfields (degraded) and homefields (better managed fields). Fields closest to homesteads (homefields) typically receive most nutrients and preferential management, and are more fertile than outlying fields (outfields), with implications for crop production and nutrient use efficiencies. The fertiliser sub-treatments consisted of (a) no fertiliser (control), (b) 60 kg N + 3 t manure ha−1, (c) 60 kg N ha−1 + 10 kg P ha−1 (SSP) and (d) 60 kg N ha−1 + 20 kg P ha−1 (SSP). In addition, a socio-economic survey was carried out to understand the diversity in resource ownership among farmers and to explore whether there was a relationship with uptake of planting basins. Results showed that field type, nutrient application and season had a significant effect on crop yields (p &lt; 0.001); there was no significant effect of tillage practice. The largest maize grain yield of 5.6 t ha−1 was obtained with a combination of manure (3 t ha−1) and 60 kg N ha−1 under conventional tillage; the equivalent treatment under planting basins yielded 4.6 t ha−1 in the 2009–2010 season. Rainfall was poorly distributed in 2010–2011 season and the same treatment gave the largest grain yield of 1.6 t ha−1 under conventional tillage and 1.2 t ha−1 under no-till planting basins. Land preparation under conventional tillage required 6 man days ha−1 while planting basins construction required 76.5 man days’ ha−1 for the clay soils and 51.5 man days ha−1 for the sandy soils. Weeding in planting basins required 40% more labour compared with conventional tillage (12 man days ha−1) due to greater weed densities associated with early years of no-tillage. Planting basins did not enhance moisture conservation in a the 2010–2011 season when rainfall was poorly distributed as shown by the smaller yields. The increased labour requirements suggested a major impediment to the uptake of planting basins even for farmers without livestock. Farmers differed greatly in resource ownership; four resource groups were identified based on land size, cattle ownership, labour availability and land utilisation. However, the practice of planting basins did not relate to resource ownership due to the incentives provided by the NGOs. Given that planting basins increased the labour burden but not crop yield, and that incentives cannot go on forever, widespread adoption by smallholder farmers seems unlikely. "

Our aim was to elucidate these linkages by examining the effect of pasture degradation on the contents and forms of P contained within aggregate size classes and macroaggregate fractions (collectively referred to as soil structural components). We conducted a study on nine farms in a deforested part of the Colombian Amazonia, each farm with degraded and productive Brachiaria spp. pastures. Topsoil (0–10 cm) samples were separated by wet-sieving into aggregate size classes, and macroaggregates were further separated into occluded fractions. Soils and structural components were analyzed for concentrations of total P, available P (extracted using anion exchange resins), NaOH–EDTA extractable organic and inorganic P, and enzyme-hydrolyzable organic P (simple monoester-like, DNA-like, myo-inositol hexakisphosphate-like) in the NaOH–EDTA extracts. Degraded pasture soils had significantly fewer large macroaggregates and more microaggregates, both with significantly lower organic P concentrations (in mg P kg− 1 of structural component) than those in productive pasture soils. At the same time, total and extractable inorganic P concentrations in bulk soil and structural components did not differ between pasture types, suggesting a shift from organic to non-extractable P upon degradation. Soils under productive pastures contained 37% more organic P than degraded pasture soils (in mg P kg− 1 soil), mainly in large macroaggregates. The organic P concentrations were strongly correlated with C concentrations across all soil structural components, suggesting similar stabilization mechanisms for organic P and C. In bulk soil and most structural components, around 60% of organic P was enzyme-hydrolyzable. The lower contents of all enzyme-hydrolyzable as well as enzyme-stable organic P in degraded vs. productive pasture soils indicate a reduction of all organic P classes during pasture degradation. The large macroaggregates and, in particular, microaggregates occluded within this fraction were identified as an important site for organic P storage. Our results highlight a linkage between soil structure and organic P, both of which can play an important role in maintaining the productivity of pastures established on highly weathered soils. "

Drought and low soil fertility, especially phosphorus and nitrogen (N) deficiencies, are major limitations to bean yield in smallholder systems. Beans can derive part of their required N from the atmosphere through symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF). Drought stress severely limits \{SNF\} ability of plants. The main objectives of this study were to: (i) test and validate the use of 15N natural abundance in grain to quantify phenotypic differences in \{SNF\} ability for its implementation in breeding programs of common bean with bush growth habit aiming to improve SNF, and (ii) quantify phenotypic differences in \{SNF\} under drought to identify superior genotypes that could serve as parents. Field studies were conducted at CIAT-Palmira, Colombia using a set of 36 bean genotypes belonging to the Middle American gene pool for evaluation in two seasons with two levels of water supply (irrigated and drought stress). We used 15N natural abundance method to compare \{SNF\} ability estimated from shoot tissue sampled at mid-pod filling growth stage vs. grain tissue sampled at harvest. Our results showed positive and significant correlation between nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) estimated using shoot tissue at mid-pod filling and %Ndfa estimated using grain tissue at harvest. Both methods showed phenotypic variability in \{SNF\} ability under both drought and irrigated conditions and a significant reduction in \{SNF\} ability was observed under drought stress. We suggest that the method of estimating Ndfa using grain tissue (Ndfa-G) could be applied in bean breeding programs to improve \{SNF\} ability. Using this method of Ndfa-G, we identified four bean lines (RCB 593, \{SEA\} 15, \{NCB\} 226 and \{BFS\} 29) that combine greater \{SNF\} ability with greater grain yield under drought stress and these could serve as potential parents to further improve \{SNF\} ability of common bean.

We carried out a pot experiment using three contrasted acid soils from southern Cameroon with the following main objectives: i) to assess the main soil causal factors of different maize (Zea mays L.) growth response to applied P and ii) to statistically model soil quality variation across soil types as well as their relationships to dry matter production. The soils used are classified as Typic Kandiudox (TKO), Rhodic Kandiudult (RKU), and Typic Kandiudult (TKU). Analysis of variance, regression, and principal component analyses were used for data analysis and interpretation. Shoot dry matter yield (DMY) was significantly affected by soil type and P rate with no significant interaction. Predicted maximum attainable \{DMY\} was lowest in the \{TKO\} (26.2 g pot−1) as compared to 35.6 and 36.7 g pot−1 for the \{RKU\} and TKU, respectively. Properties that positively influenced \{DMY\} were the levels of inorganic NaHCO3-extractable P, individual basic cations (Ca, Mg, and K), and pH. Their effects contrasted with those of exchangeable Al and C/N ratio, which significantly depressed DMY. Principal component analysis yielded similar results, identifying 4 orthogonal components, which accounted for 84.7% of the total system variance (TSV). Principal component 1 was identified as soil nutrient deficiency explaining 35.9% of TSV. This soil quality varied significantly among the studied soils, emerging as the only soil quality which significantly (P &lt; 0.05) correlated with maize growth. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th components were identified as soil organic matter contents, texture, and HCl-extractable P, respectively. "

Seven variables (rivers, elevation, annual precipitation, soil suitability for agriculture, population density, paved roads, and unpaved roads), were identified as potential deforestation drivers. The variables were converted into spatially explicit layers of continuous data and divided into a 9 km2 grid. A multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine variable significance. Distance to paved and unpaved roads were strongly associated with deforestation, followed by distance to rivers, annual precipitation and elevation. All significant variables were negatively correlated with deforestation. Variables excluded from the model were population density and soil suitability for agriculture, suggesting that the influence of population density on forest clearing across the study area was not significant, and that deforestation activities were undertaken regardless whether soils are suitable for agriculture or not. Based on the linear regression analysis, the significant variables were selected and added to the Land Change Modeler in order to project primary forest coverage by 2025. The modeling results predict extensive deforestation along the Aguaytia River and at the forest/non-forest interface along the paved highway. The rate of primary forest removal is expected to increase from 4783 ha y−1 (for the 2007–2014 period) to 5086 ha y−1 (for the 2015–2025 period). A preliminary survey questionnaire conducted to explore deforestation intentions by farmers in the region, partly confirmed the overall deforestation trends as projected by the model. "

To address this issue, we evaluated the influence of common agricultural management practices (cropping and livestock systems) vs. the Quesungual slash-and-mulch agroforestry system (QSMAS) on diverse parameters of soil quality and function. We then used this information to identify soil invertebrate bioindicators that represent key aspects of soil quality (chemical fertility, physical properties, aggregate morphology, and biological functioning). In February of 2011 soil sampling was conducted on six hillside farms near the town of Somotillo in western Nicaragua to assess soil properties and the abundance and diversity of soil macrofauna within four management systems: (1) QSMAS, based on maize production, (2) traditional maize cropping system with few trees (TC), (3) silvopastoral system with low tree density (SP), and (4) secondary forest (SF), used as a reference. The conversion of forest to agriculture demonstrated the greatest impact of management in this study. For example, \{SF\} presented significantly higher diversity of soil invertebrate taxonomic groups than either \{TC\} or \{SP\} (P &lt; 0.03), and demonstrated the lowest level of soil compaction, significantly less than \{SP\} (P &lt; 0.05). Additionally, \{SF\} demonstrated the highest value of soil quality according to a synthetic indicator that integrates chemical, physical and biological aspects of soil quality. Although overall soil quality under \{QSMAS\} was lower than SF, this system demonstrated the highest abundance (number of individuals) of soil macrofauna, and appeared to at least partially mitigate the negative consequences of forest conversion on soil functioning. Using the Indicator Value Index, which ranks species according to their specificity and fidelity across sites, along with farmer consultation we found seven indicator taxa of soil quality that could greatly facilitate future evaluation of land management impacts by farmers and technicians in the region. We suggest that the methodology applied is robust and adaptable to diverse agroecological contexts and would allow for more rapid responses to evolving land use issues as they arise. "

Because it is now recognised that \{SOM\} tightly controls many soil properties and major biogeochemical cycles its status is often taken as a strong indicator of fertility and land degradation. Nonetheless the building of the \{SOM\} concept has not been easy. A reason for this is that the \{SOM\} concept is the product of interdisciplinary cognitive production as well as of a cultural moving context. Historically, three periods involving \{SOM\} in relation to cropping sustainability can be distinguished. (1) Until 1840, some still believed that plant dry matter was mainly derived from uptake of matter supplied by SOM, which was termed humus at that time. Agriculturists who believed this based the management of cropping systems fertility on the management of humus, i.e. through organic inputs. In 1809 Thaër proposed a “Humus Theory” that remained very influential for 30 years, as well as a quantified assessment of the agro-ecological and economic sustainability of farming systems. (2) From the 1840s to the 1940s, Liebig's “mineral nutrition theory”, progressive abandonment of recycling of nutrients between cities and country, and breakthroughs in the processes of fertilizer industry paved the way for intensive mineral fertilization as a substitute for organic practices. Although understanding of \{SOM\} and soil biological functioning was improving it had little impact on the rise of new mineral-based cropping patterns. (3) Since the 1940s, \{SOM\} has been gaining recognition as a complex bio-organo-mineral system, and as a pivotal indicator for soil quality and agro-ecosystems fertility. This has resulted from: (a) methodological and conceptual breakthroughs in its study, leading to significant scientific developments in characterising the role of humus as an ecosystem component; (b) a growing societal demand for the assessment of the environmental cost of intensification in modern agricultural practices, which has led to growing interest in organic farming, agroforestry, conservation tillage, and the use of plant cover; (c) investigation of the potential of \{SOM\} as a sink for greenhouse gas carbon in response to concerns about global climate change. In summary the interest in \{SOM\} over time, both from the viewpoint of scientific concept and that of field practices, can be described by a sine curve. Its definition and the recognition of its functions have gained both much from the combination of holistic and reductionist approaches and from the progressive amplification of the scale at which it has been considered.

Participatory research methods have developed as a way to help researchers better target their work towards the needs and constraints of specific stakeholder groups. Participatory research may also strengthen the capacity of participants to initiate a continuous process of innovation. The capacity of farmers and other end users of technologies to innovate may be particularly important in poor, marginal environments where conditions are highly variable. This paper assesses the impact of using participatory methods in three agricultural research projects which have a natural resource management focus. Mixed methods are used to assess technological, economic, human, and social impacts and the cost implications of incorporating beneficiaries into the research process. User participation was found to influence priorities and practices within and beyond the specific projects studied. Participation led to more relevant technologies and greater economic impacts, especially when participation was early in the research process. Impacts on farmer capacity were high when farmers worked intensively with researchers over a period of time. Use of participatory methods changes research costs. When farmers took over tasks that were previously done by researchers, some of the research costs were transferred to farmers. When participatory methods were combined with conventional on-farm research, there were also start-up costs, because researchers and farmers needed to learn new research methods. However these additional one-time costs were not significant in terms of total research costs. "

Of particular interest are ontogenetic and edaphic effects on A. senegal performance in natural populations. Our research objectives were to investigate the effect of tree age and site phosphorus conditions on (1) tree N2-fixation and (2) soil N and C dynamics in natural stands of A. senegal var. senegal, Baringo District, in the Rift Valley, Kenya. Sites consisted of A. senegal saplings (9 months) and mature A. senegal trees (7 years) along an edaphic gradient of soil P availability. A single-tree neighborhood approach was employed using a two by two factorial design: site conditions [high and low soil P contents] and tree age class [juvenile and mature]. Soil (N and C pools and fluxes) and plant metrics were quantified. A soil transfer experiment was also employed to confirm age and site effects on soil N mineralization. On the high soil P site, A. senegal had significantly lower foliar (15N levels than neighboring non-leguminous species (Balanites aegyptiaca), while foliar δ15N values in A. senegal on the low P site exhibited no significant difference with our reference plant, B. aegyptiaca. Across P sites, B. aegyptiaca had similar foliar δ15N values. These results indicate that the rate of N2-fixation of A. senegal trees, as determined with foliar 15N natural abundance methodology, increased with increasing soil P availability in these natural populations. However, N2-fixation rates declined with age. Although soil texture and soil \{CO2\} efflux did not differ between sites or across ages, soils under mature A. senegal at the high P site exhibited significantly greater total N content and total C content in comparison to soils at the low P site and under juvenile plants. Furthermore, under mature A. senegal trees, soil N mineralization rates were significantly greater as compared to under saplings. Soil transplants confirmed that soil microbial activity may be stimulated under mature trees as N mineralization rates were 2–3 fold greater compared to under A. senegal saplings. Our findings suggest that tree age and soil P availability are important factors in the nitrogen budget of natural populations of A. senegal, determining N2-fixation rates, and potentially influencing soil total N and C pools and soil mineral N. This study provides information regarding the adaptation of A. senegal under differing edaphic conditions thus increasing accuracy of management support for A. senegal populations as productive agroforests.

Our study concerned an experience of participatory improvement of tortillero sorghum for low-input cropping systems in northern Nicaragua. It set out to compare the effect of two breeding schemes simultaneously managed on-station and on-farm. Two synthetic populations were used as sources of genetic variability. The study was designed to distinguish between three “selection modes”: farmers’ selection on-farm (FoF), breeder’ selection on-station (BoS) and breeder's selection on-farm (BoF). After two selection cycles, we found that FoF selection reduced phenotypic variability as much as BoS selection. In general, BoS selection produced higher-yielding lines under the target on-farm conditions. But FoF selection was more effective in promoting lines with higher values for an index of agronomic suitability (IAS), expressing a better balance between earliness, plant height, grain size and yield. Such genotypes might cope more easily with local environmental constraints and farmers’ preferences. BoF selection did not prove to be effective for either yield or IAS. This research shows the need for close collaboration between farmers and breeders as well as complementarities between the selection phases managed on-farm and on-station, to make breeding for difficult environments fully efficient.

Minimum tillage was compared with regular tillage and vegetative barriers (leucaena and Napier) with no barriers. Maize and soybean yields were greater with than without vegetative barriers, except with Napier barriers when minimum tillage was practiced where strong root competition occured. Cumulatively for the four cropping seasons, Napier barriers with regular tillage conserved most soil (72%) followed by Napier with minimum tillage (53%). The least soil (1%) was conserved for minimum tillage without barriers and leucaena barriers were intermediate in decreasing soil erosion. The highest positive marginal rate of returns (MRRs) were realized under leucaena barriers with regular tillage (2.09) followed by Napier with regular tillage (1.32). Minimum tillage without barriers had the lowest positive \{MRRs\} (0.08). Future increase in the price of key inputs would have greater depressive effect on the \{MRRs\} of Napier barriers with regular tillage than leucaena barriers with regular tillage. Minimum tillage without barriers was inefficient in soil conservation particularly when rainfall was intense and had poor MRRs. Leucaena barriers conserved less soil than Napier barriers but were more economically attractive, demonstrating a clear trade-off between soil erosion that is likely to impact crop yields in the long-term and short-term economic benefits. Napier barriers with regular tillage present a win–win scenario due to efficient soil conservation and attractive economic returns provided future prices of labour and Napier cuttings remain stable.

A study was initiated to investigate the effects of minimum tillage and vegetative barriers on soil and water conservation and crop yield. There were two tillage practices; minimum and regular tillage and two vegetative barriers; ‘leucaena’ consisting of leguminous trees (Leucaena trichandra), and ‘Napier’ consisting of Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) in addition to a control without barriers. Maize and soybean crops were planted in rotation in the terraces between the barriers. Soil moisture content was measured near the barriers and at the centre of the terraces. Vegetative barriers impeded run-off and controlled soil loss. There was a positive linear relationship between soil loss and rainfall for Napier grass barriers. For leucaena barriers, soil loss increased quadratically with rainfall. At the onset of rainfall, soil water content increased for all tillage and barrier practices. With more rainfall, soil water content increased marginally without barriers while with barriers there was continued soil water build-up. At the end of the wet period and across tillage practice, the soil contained 43% more water near leucaena barriers compared with no barriers and 20% more at the centre of the terrace. For Napier barriers, the soil water content was 60% more near barriers and 30% more at the centre of the terrace. Without barriers, the soil water content was 10% more with regular rather than minimum tillage. At the cessation of rainfall, soil water declined in all tillage and barrier treatments. At the centre of the terraces and across barriers, soil water reduction compared with no barriers was 10% less for minimum tillage and 24% more for regular tillage. Nearer barriers, the soil water reduction (relative to regular tillage without barriers) for leucaena barriers was 56% less with minimum tillage and 77% less with regular tillage. Conversely with Napier barriers, there was stronger water reduction with minimum (116%) than regular tillage (102%). At the centre of the terraces and across vegetative barriers, the upper soil layers (&lt;60 cm) retained more water compared with deeper layers for minimum than regular tillage over the dry period. Near barriers but between tillage and barriers treatments, leucaena barriers extracted more water from deeper soil layers (&gt;60 cm) independent of tillage practice. In contrast, Napier barriers extracted more water from the upper end of the profile, especially with minimum tillage. Napier barriers with minimum tillage suppressed maize row-grain yields (relative to regular tillage without barriers) by 26% over a distance of 3 m along the barrier–crop interface. Maize yield suppression for Napier barriers with regular tillage was less pronounced (occurring over a distance of 1.5 m) and improved maize crop performance at the centre of the terraces increased overall row grain yields by 14% relative to regular tillage without barriers. Soybean yields with Napier barriers were suppressed over a distance of 0.5 m in the barrier–crop interface. Maize and soybean yield suppression with leucaena barriers for the different tillage practices was less pronounced, and improved crop performance at the centre of terraces consistently compensated for any yield reductions at the barrier–crop interface. Between tillage and barriers treatments, the degree of yield suppression was related to the water use pattern of the vegetative barriers, and more severe with Napier than with leucaena barriers, particularly with minimum tillage. A possible strategy for successful introduction of a combination of minimum tillage and the vegetative barriers into water deficient highland regions would include leucaena barriers with minimum tillage due to less competition for water between barriers and companion crops. Napier barriers with minimum tillage do not combine well due to strong competition for available water between the barriers and crops, even when intensely harvested. "

Resource flows and farm nutrient balance studies were carried out in eastern Uganda to ascertain the movement of organic resources and nutrients in and out of the farm system during a participatory learning and action research (PLAR) process. The resource flows were transformed into nutrient flows and partial nutrient balances were calculated using the Resource Kit computer package. Results of a farmers’ soil fertility management classification at the start of the \{PLAR\} intervention in 1999 revealed that 3% of the farmers were good soil fertility managers (class I), 10% were average soil fertility managers (class II) and 87% were poor soil fertility managers (class III). The results indicate that the net farm nutrient balances in kg ha−1 per season for all the nutrients [nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)] were negative for both the good and the poor soil fertility managers. Class 1 farm balances irrespective of the season, were however more negative than those of class 3 farms. For the long rains seasons (LR 2000, 2001 and 2002), the average net farm nutrient balances for N, P, and K for class I farms were −5.0, −0.6 and −8.0 kg ha−1 year−1, while for the short rains seasons (SR 2000 and 2001), the nutrient balances were −3.5, −0.5 and −6.0 kg ha−1 year−1, respectively.

In this paper we used the term aestivation to refer to the inactivity of populations at any time of the year. Several strategies found in some tropical earthworm species are given in this article. The results were obtained in detailed studies of earthworm communities conducted in savannas of Colombia and Mexico, several Mexican pastures and some Miombo-derived agroecosystems in Tanzania. Although all species built aestivation chambers in which they coiled up at certain periods of the year, different patterns of aestivation were found: two Neotropical species were found inside a plastered mucus sphere while two other species did not form any mucus sphere but layered the end of the gallery with several faecal blocks, and one African species created an aestivation chamber with large sand grains that adhered to the earthworm, preventing it from touching the surface of the chamber's walls. A detailed description and drawings of the aestivation chambers of five earthworm species are given plus a complete analysis of the mechanistic processes that determine this behavioural pattern for one anecic species from Colombia. The onset of aestivation differed in adults and juveniles for two glossoscolecid tropical species, i.e. Glossodrilus n. sp. and Martiodrilus carimaguensis, a native anecic earthworm from the tropical lowlands of Colombia which undergoes diapause by burrowing deep into the soil during late rainy season, while immature individuals enter into this phase four months earlier. Relationships between the aestivation period and the addition of new segments in earthworms have been established by several authors. In this study there was no relationship for the only species studied in more detail. "

Conventionally, one legume line is intercropped between each pair of maize lines. This study evaluated the potential of a modified two-by-two staggered arrangement (MBILI) to increase crop yields and economic benefits in two sites in Central Kenya with contrasting soil fertility levels during 7 consecutive seasons. Common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) were grown as legume intercrops. The \{MBILI\} system resulted in increased maize yields in both sites, and increased cowpea yields in the poor site. In the fertile site, using beans as an intercrop was most profitable, and the \{MBILI\} system increased net benefits by 40%, relative to the conventional system. In the poor site, groundnut and cowpea were better adapted, and the \{MBILI\} system increased net benefit by 12–37%. Positive effects of the \{MBILI\} system were most pronounced in the poor site, but occurred independent of soil fertility level. Rainfall amounts and distribution varied widely, but the \{MBILI\} system increased yields both under conditions of ample and inadequate rainfall. N balances were negative with beans and groundnut, but neutral with cowpea as the intercrop. A modest N fertilizer application is therefore essential to sustain yields in the long term, especially when beans or groundnuts are intercropped. In conclusion, the \{MBILI\} system, when combined with adjusted nutrient inputs, resulted in superior and robust improvements in crop yields and economic benefits, relative to the conventional intercropping system.

However, the survival of some of these wild plant species could be threatened because of climate change. We used current and projected future climate data for ∼2055, and a climate envelope species distribution model to predict the impact of climate change on the wild relatives of peanut (Arachis), potato (Solanum) and cowpea (Vigna). We considered three migrational scenarios for modeling the range shifts (unlimited, limited, and no migration). Climate change strongly affected all taxa, with an estimated 16–22% (depending on migration scenario) of these species predicted to go extinct and most species losing over 50% of their range size. Moreover, for many species, the suitable areas become highly fragmented. Arachis were the most affected group, with 24–31 (depending on the migration scenario) of 51 species projected to go extinct and their distribution area on average reduced by 85–94%, depending on the migration scenario, over the next 50 years. The number of patches was predicted to decrease by 19% under the no migration scenario or increase by 4% assuming unlimited migration. Patch size decreased by 55–60%. For Solanum, 7 (no migration) to 13 (unlimited migration) of 108 species were predicted to go extinct, and their range sizes were reduced by approximately 38–69%. The number of patches was predicted to decrease by 34% (no migration) or increase 7% (unlimited migration) and patch size decreased by 20 (unlimited migration) to 37% (no migration). In terms of species extinction, Vigna was the least affected of the three groups, losing no species (unlimited migration) to 2 species (no migration) of the 48 species in the genus. The mean range size was predicted to decrease by 65% (no migration) or increase 8% (unlimited migration), with 8–41 of the 48 species losing more than 50% of their current geographic range. The number of Vigna patches increased by 12–115%, but the size of those patches shrunk by 51–59%. Our results suggest that there is an urgent need to identify and effectively conserve crop wild relatives that are at risk from climate change. While increased habitat conservation will be important to conserve most species, those that are predicted to undergo strong range size reductions should be a priority for collection and inclusion in genebanks.

To address this issue, we examined linkages between soil organic matter (SOM), aggregation, and phosphorus (P) dynamics by comparing productive vs. degraded pastures in the deforested Amazon Basin of Colombia. Paired plots of productive (dominated by planted Brachiaria spp.) vs. degraded pasture were identified on nine farms in the Department of Caquetá and sampled during the rainy season of 2011. Aboveground pasture biomass production and nutrient content were measured. Surface soils (0–10 cm) were also fractionated by wet sieving, and C, 13C, N and P contents were analyzed for the bulk soil and various aggregate size classes. Productive pastures yielded more than double the aboveground biomass compared to degraded pastures (during a 35 day regrowth period following cutting), with over 60% higher N and P contents in this material. Similar trends were observed for the standing litter biomass and nutrient contents. Soil aggregate stability was found to differ between pasture types, with a mean weight diameter of 3590 vs. 3230 μm in productive vs. degraded pastures, respectively. Productive pastures were found to have 20% higher total soil C and N contents than degraded pastures. While there was no difference in total P content between pasture types, organic P was found to be nearly 40% higher in soils of productive vs. degraded pastures. Differences in total \{SOM\} between pasture types were largely explained by a higher C content in the large macroaggregate fraction (&gt;2000 μm), and more specifically in the microaggregates (53–250 μm) occluded within this fraction. These findings confirm the role of microaggregates within macroaggregates as a preferential site for the physical stabilization of SOM, and furthermore, suggest that it may serve as a useful diagnostic fraction for evaluating management impacts on \{SOM\} in tropical pasture systems. Similar to trends observed for C and N, total P content was 25% higher in the microaggregates within large macroaggregates of productive vs. degraded pasture soils. This correspondence between C and total P contents in large macroaggregate fractions, along with elevated levels of organic P in productive pastures, suggests that this P is likely in an organic form and that there is a close link between soil structure, \{SOM\} dynamics and the maintenance of organic P in these soils. Given the potential relevance of organic P for efficient P cycling in these soils, our findings offer critical new insight for the management of \{SOM\} and aggregate-associated P pools in tropical pasture systems.

abstract = "Abstract Nicaragua has already experienced substantial climate change, in part due to a loss of one half of its forest cover in the last half-century. In this study, we assess the extent to which historical climate trends have contributed to stagnating yields for maize (Zea mays) and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), the two main staple crops in the country. We first analyze 40 years of historical weather data throughout Nicaragua to estimate trends, and assess the extent to which these trends correlate with spatial deforestation patterns. Then, we create a regression model linking department-level maize and bean yields with seasonal weather conditions, and use the model to estimate the impact of historical climate trends on yields. Regressions are run for yields on both harvested and sown area, with the latter accounting for the effect of complete crop losses. Results confirm strong warming trends throughout the country, with daytime temperatures in deforested areas warming at more than double the rate of global averages in the tropics. Decreases in rainfall frequency are also seen almost everywhere, along with an earlier end to the rainy season. Regression model results show, as expected, that red bean is a highly temperature-sensitive crop, and that maize is more water-limited than bean due to its longer seasonal duration. Warming temperatures and less frequent rainfall have led to drought-related losses for both crops in the main commercial production areas, while heavier rains at planting and harvest have also negatively affected yields, especially for bean. Moreover, reduced precipitation in December and January has negatively impacted production for bean in the commercially important apante, or dry season, on the humid Atlantic side of the country. In these areas, however, substantial model uncertainty remains for maize, with an alternative model formulation showing substantial benefits from drier and sunnier conditions. At an annual, national scale, beans have been more affected by climate trends since 1970 than maize, with −5% yield declines per decade on harvested area for bean and −4% for maize, and −12% and −7% yield declines respectively on sown area (with the alternative model showing gains for maize). Climate adaptation responses include government efforts to limit bean exports to control consumer prices, a switch from red to black bean for commercial sales and export, and area expansion and migration for bean in order to maintain production levels.

The results indicated that \{RCTLR9\} cDNA contains 3141 bp. It encodes 1047 amino acids containing 16 typical structures of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) including an LRRTYP, \{LRRCT\} and a motif involved in \{PAMP\} binding was identified at position 240–253 amino acid. Broad expression of \{RCTLR9\} was found in larval, juvenile and adult stages irrespective of the tissues. In larval stage, \{RCTLR9\} mRNA expression decreased at 5 d and then increased at 10 dph. At juvenile stage cobia, the expression was significantly high (p &lt; 0.05) in spleen and intestine compared to gill, kidney, liver and skin. However, at adult stage, the significant high expression was found in gill and intestine. Cobia challenged with P. damselae subsp. piscicida showed significant increase in \{RCTLR9\} expression at 24 h post challenge in intestine, spleen and liver, while in kidney the expression was peak at 12 h and later it decreased at 24 h.

abstract = "Abstract Cassava mosaic disease (CMD), caused by different species of cassava mosaic geminiviruses (CMGs), is the most important disease of cassava in Africa and the Indian sub-continent. The cultivated cassava species is protected from \{CMD\} by polygenic resistance introgressed from the wild species Manihot glaziovii and a dominant monogenic type of resistance, named CMD2, discovered in African landraces. The ability of the monogenic resistance to confer high levels of resistance in different genetic backgrounds has led recently to its extensive usage in breeding across Africa as well as pre-emptive breeding in Latin America. However, most of the landraces carrying the monogenic resistance are morphologically very similar and come from a geographically restricted area of West Africa, raising the possibility that the diversity of the single-gene resistance could be very limited, or even located at a single locus. Several mapping studies, employing bulk segregant analysis, in different genetic backgrounds have reported additional molecular markers linked to supposedly new resistance genes. However, it is not possible to tell if these are indeed new genes in the absence adequate genetic map framework or allelism tests. To address this important question, a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map of cassava was developed through genotyping-by-sequencing a bi-parental mapping population (N = 180) that segregates for the dominant monogenic resistance to CMD. Virus screening using \{PCR\} showed that \{CMD\} symptoms and presence of virus were strongly correlated (r = 0.98). Genome-wide scan and high-resolution composite interval mapping using 6756 \{SNPs\} uncovered a single locus with large effect (R2 = 0.74). Projection of the previously published resistance-linked microsatellite markers showed that they co-occurred in the same chromosomal location surrounding the presently mapped resistance locus. Moreover, their relative distance to the mapped resistance locus correlated with the reported degree of linkage with the resistance phenotype. Cluster analysis of the landraces first shown to have this type of resistance revealed that they are very closely related, if not identical. These findings suggest that there is a single source of monogenic resistance in the crop's genepool tracing back to a common ancestral clone. In the absence of further resistance diversification, the long-term effectiveness of the single gene resistance is known to be precarious, given the potential to be overcome by \{CMGs\} due to their fast-paced evolutionary rate. However, combining the quantitative with the qualitative type of resistance may ensure that this resistance gene continues to offer protection to cassava, a crop that is depended upon by millions of people in Africa against the devastating onslaught of CMGs.

The approach discusses possible cropping system improvements and alternatives in terms of crop combinations, external mineral supply, additional crops, and the potential for breeding staples in order to enhance their nutritional balance while maintaining or improving the sustainability and dietary, agronomic, and societal acceptability of the system. The conceptual framework calls for attention first to balancing crop nutrition that in nearly every case will also increase crop productivity, allowing sufficient staple to be produced on less land so that the remaining land can be devoted to more nutrient‐dense and nutrient‐balancing crops. Once this is achieved, the additional requirements of humans and animals (vitamins, selenium, and iodine) can be addressed. Case studies illustrate principles and strategies.

We evaluated soil nutrient concentration, soil acidity and soil organic matter status under natural Chromolaena fallow, fallow without Chromolaena (where Chromolaena was removed by hand), and planted Pueraria fallow in three different sites with different soil physico-chemical properties in southern Cameroon. Human population pressure is high and fallow length is short in the northern site, while an intermediate position and the contrary were observed in the central and southern sites, respectively. The highest nutrient concentrations (Ca2+ and Mg2+), and effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) were found in the sandy clayey soils in the northern site. The lowest Al saturation and soil acidity were noticed in the sandy soils in the central site, while in the clayey soils in the southern site the lowest nutrient concentration, ECEC, and the highest soil acidity and Al saturation were found. Pueraria decreased soil acidity and increased nutrient concentration relative to Chromolaena in the northern site. The beneficial effects of Pueraria on soil acidity and nutrient concentration became less pronounced in the central site and were absent in the southern site. In the northern and central sites, the highest maize yield was observed under Pueraria, showing the responsiveness of maize to N. In the soils of the southern site with the smaller weight (&lt;1.50 mg per g of soil) of particulate organic matter (POM) (53–4000 μm) and greater chemical constraints (high soil acidity and Al saturation), higher in N content in medium (250–2000 μm) and fine (53–250 μm) \{POM\} was found under Pueraria compared to natural fallow. N content in medium \{POM\} under Pueraria was greater by 47% compared to the natural fallow. The N content in fine \{POM\} under Pueraria was greater by 59% relative to the natural fallow. In the southern site, chemical constraints induced very low maize yields under all fallow types. It appears that \{POM\} quality, i.e. N content, was more important for maize than \{POM\} quantity, i.e. weight, while groundnut and cassava were more sensitive to \{POM\} quantity. Pueraria have a beneficial ecological and environmental sustainability in the soil with low acidity, while Chromolaena seems to be more sustainable than Pueraria in the acidic soils. However, crop yields found in this study were low. Maize yield was lower than 2000 kg ha−1, groundnut grain dry matter yield was lower than 600 kg ha−1 and cassava was lower than 400 tuber dry matter kg ha−1. Therefore, to attain, highest productivity levels it is necessary to combine fallow management (primarily planted such as Pueraria which can increase N content even where there are chemical constraints or soil degradation) with the use of fertilisers (organic and mineral).

Economic liberalization resulted in disengagement of the State in favor of the private sector and engendered a new behavior pattern among cocoa farmers. This study focuses on the constraints inherent in the acquisition and application of pesticides for cocoa growing on small farms in the tropical rainforest areas of southern Cameroon. Over 50% of farmers use chemical pesticides, but the high cost and lack of availability in rural areas are cited, respectively by 65% and 55% of cocoa farmers as major constraints by users of pesticides. Only 21% of cocoa farmers buy their pesticides in the village. Fungicides are the main pesticide used to control Phytophthora megakarya, but farmers do not apply the recommended application rate so production is low. Some farmers form groups to circumvent production problems, while some use plant extracts. To increase production it is essential to improve safe practices in the purchase, transportation; storage, handling and application of pesticides and promote integrated pest management in southern Cameroon.

While some empirical studies examine the conditions catalysing the successful formation of cooperatives, quantifications of the net benefits, i.e., difference between revenues and costs, of cooperation and how farmers divide these net benefits are scarce. Therefore, we develop a quantitative framework to analyse and allocate net benefits in a cooperative production agreement. The framework allows for cooperative exchange of several types of resources and the production of multiple products. Linear programming provides insight into optimal production levels, both for individual and cooperating farmers, and gives optimal revenue levels. A transaction cost function is used to account for costs of cooperation, such as meeting costs, moral hazard and free ridership of labour use and the risks of farmers defaulting from the agreement. Transaction costs are likely to increase with the number of households participating, the total cropping area and the heterogeneity of resources of the cooperating farmers. Therefore, we introduce a measure of heterogeneity in the resources for each cooperative. Finally, cooperative game theory is used to generate fair divisions of the net benefits in a cooperative. This framework may be used to give additional explanations to the findings in empirical studies on cooperatives. We illustrate this with an empirical example from northern Nigeria. It is found that cooperation between farmers sharing complementary resources gives the highest revenues. Next, we illustrate the effects of two different transaction cost functions. For reasonable assumptions on these functions, cooperation remains economically attractive. Nevertheless, larger and more diverse coalitions are not always the most beneficial, while the returns in some small coalitions are negative, possibly impeding the formation of cooperatives in some locations.

The patterns of grazing areas were classified into three main categories in the study area, namely, (1) harvested barley fields in summer, (2) a combination of both harvested barley fields and rangeland from summer to autumn, and (3) rangeland from autumn to spring. Changes in grazing area were regulated mainly by the time of barley harvesting, the scantiness and/or richness of feed resources in harvested barley fields and on rangeland, water pounds and cold weather in the rainy season, and governmental policy. The main feed resources were barley straw and stubble in summer, a combination of barley stubble and native plants on the rangeland from summer to autumn, native plants on the rangeland or cotton residue in autumn, supplementary feeding of barley grain and straw in winter, and native plants on the rangeland in spring. The subsistence systems of rangeland grazing and cultivation activities competed with each other for land use, but compensated for each other in feed supply for small ruminants throughout the year. From the viewpoint of grazing management throughout the year, integrated land use between rangeland and cultivated fields is an inevitable system in the study area. The contents of feed resources in the study area are still very simple, mainly because of the possibility of only barley cultivation by rainwater and the vast unarable mountainous rangeland. Information about the characteristics and the system analysis of the flock management in the study area could offer important information for sustainable land use planning in dry mountainous areas of northern Africa and western Asia.

Second-instar Aphis craccivora Koch and Megalurothirps sjostedti Trybom nymphs, and third-instar M. vitrata larvae, all from laboratory colonies, were treated with various concentrations of one of the control agents separately or combined. Daily mortality was recorded for five days (A. craccivora and M. sjostedti nymphs) or fourteen days (M. vitrata) and the larval and pupal development as well as adult emergence were assessed. Combination of MaviMNPV resulted in a significantly higher larval mortality in M. vitrata than treatment with either virus or botanical insecticide alone at the corresponding concentrations. Larvae of M. vitrata infected with MaviMNPV and treated with botanical oils died sooner than those infected with only one control agent. Combinations of MaviMNPV and botanical oils produced additive or synergistic effects. No evidence of antagonistic effects was noted. In field experiments, the application of botanical insecticide and MaviMNPV either alone or in combination was effective in reducing insect abundance over the four weeks, and preventing yield loss. In the first field season, where the M. vitrata population was higher, the combination of the virus and either of the botanical pesticides induced significantly higher yields than spraying chemical insecticide. Application of MaviMNPV in combination with J. curcas and A. indica oil has proven to induce consistent MaviMNPV infection in M. vitrata populations. The combined application of MaviMNPV and botanical oils is discussed in the context of integrated pest management. "

Index descriptors based on the combination of two characteristics were calculated. Despite the significant (P&lt;0.05) influence of the environment and the genotype-by-environment interaction, most of the variation was significantly affected by the specific genotype of the Musa accessions. The most productive cultivars were the Cavendish bananas and the giant French plantains (&gt;30 t ha−1 year−1). Five phenotypic correlations were common to all known taxonomic Musa groups. Short-cycling cultivars showed early flowering, whereas tall cultivars had wide plant girth and many leaves. The number of fruit per bunch was significantly associated with the number of hands (or nodal clusters of fruit). The most important component of yield potential was bunch weight in all Musa cultivars, and days to harvest only in the dessert bananas derived from interspecific crosses of M. acuminata. Index descriptors may be useful for selection of traits that are difficult to score or that show a high coefficient of variation. Short Musa cultivars may be selected by calculating the index of pseudostem condensation. A low value of pseudostem condensation (&lt;9 cm leaf−1) was characteristic of known dwarf plantain and banana cultivars. "

They are vegetatively propagated using suckers or tissue culture plants and grown almost as perennial plantations. These are prone to the accumulation of pests and pathogens, especially viruses which contribute to yield reduction and are also barriers to the international exchange of germplasm. The most economically important viruses of banana and plantain are Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV), a complex of banana streak viruses (BSVs) and Banana bract mosaic virus (BBrMV). \{BBTV\} is known to cause the most serious economic losses in the “Old World,” contributing to a yield reduction of up to 100% and responsible for a dramatic reduction in cropping area. The \{BSVs\} exist as episomal and endogenous forms are known to be worldwide in distribution. In India and the Philippines, \{BBrMV\} is known to be economically important but recently the virus was discovered in Colombia and Costa Rica, thus signaling its spread into the “New World.” Banana and plantain are also known to be susceptible to five other viruses of minor significance, such as Abaca mosaic virus, Abaca bunchy top virus, Banana mild mosaic virus, Banana virus X, and Cucumber mosaic virus. Studies over the past 100 years have contributed to important knowledge on disease biology, distribution, and spread. Research during the last 25 years have led to a better understanding of the virus–vector–host interactions, virus diversity, disease etiology, and epidemiology. In addition, new diagnostic tools were developed which were used for surveillance and the certification of planting material. Due to a lack of durable host resistance in the Musa spp., phytosanitary measures and the use of virus-free planting material are the major methods of virus control. The state of knowledge on BBTV, BBrMV, and BSVs, and other minor viruses, disease spread, and control are summarized in this review. "

This is due in large part to the long and diverse list of devastating plant viruses transmitted by these vectors. Open-field production provides many challenges to manage these viruses and in many cases adequate management has not been possible. Diseases caused by whitefly-transmitted viruses have become limiting factors in open-field production of a wide range of crops, i.e., bean golden mosaic disease in beans, tomato yellow leaf curl disease in tomato, cassava mosaic disease and cassava brown streak disease in cassava, and cotton leaf crumple disease in cotton. While host resistance has proven to be the most cost-effective management solution, few examples of host resistance have been developed to date. The main strategy to limit the incidence of virus-infected plants has been the application of insecticides to reduce vector populations aided to some extent by the use of selected cultural practices. However, due to concerns about the effect of insecticides on pollinators, consumer demand for reduced pesticide use, and the ability of the whitefly vectors to develop insecticide-resistance, there is a growing need to develop and deploy strategies that do not rely on insecticides. The reduction in pesticide use will greatly increase the need for genetic resistance to more viruses in more crop plants. Resistance combined with selected \{IPM\} strategies could become a viable means to increase yields in crops produced in open fields despite the presence of whitefly-transmitted viruses. "

abstract = "Abstract It has been widely recognized that food security depends on the sustainable use and provisioning of ecosystem services. The goal of this paper is to present an overview of the scientific literature on ecosystem services and food security, with a major focus on case studies of farming communities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, in order to answer the following research questions: (1) does ecosystem services research generate knowledge that helps to address the major imperatives of food security?, and (2) are the multiple linkages between ecosystem services and food security analyzed or assumed in research? The results of the study highlighted that food utilization, access and stability, which are the major food security challenges in the world, remained under-investigated. There is a major bias on food availability in relation to crop production, and most articles assumed that food security would improve by increasing crop productivity, but this hypothesis remained largely untested. Other research blind-spots were co-production, trade-offs and off-site effects of ecosystem services in relation to food security, gender and cultural services. The study concludes that ecosystem services research needs to improve efforts to generate knowledge that helps to address the main imperatives of food security. "

Conservation Agriculture (CA) has been promoted to achieve this goal, based on three principles: minimum tillage, soil surface cover, and diversified crop rotations. \{CA\} originated in regions where fertilizer is commonly used and crop productivity is high, ensuring an abundance of crop residues. By contrast, crop yields are generally low in \{SSA\} and organic residues in short supply and farmers face competing demands for their use. Since minimal tillage without mulch commonly results in depressed yields, the use of fertilizer to enhance crop productivity and organic residue availability is essential for smallholder farmers to engage in CA. This is especially true since alternative ways to increase organic matter availability have largely failed. A case study from Kenya clearly demonstrates how fertilizer increases maize stover productivity above thresholds for minimal initial soil cover required for initiating \{CA\} (about 3 tonne ha−1). We conclude that strategies for using \{CA\} in \{SSA\} must integrate a fourth principle – the appropriate use of fertilizer – to increase the likelihood of benefits for smallholder farmers. "

Multiregional multiseasonal on-farm trials using benomyl, thiram and the insecticide endosulfan, reduced the severity of seed-borne diseases and beanfly and increased yields of diverse varietal bean mixtures by 25% in regions above 1400 m in elevation. Combined treatments increased bean yields 17% and 35%, respectively, in the September and March seasons. Seed treatments with endosulfan alone increased yields by 17% in multiseasonal multiregional trials, through yield increases in the March season, but not in the September season, owing to low beanfly pressure. Yield increases from endosulfan applications alone occurred in regions below an elevation of 1700 m. A presowing seed treatment of benomyl, thiram and endosulfan was effective over the broadest range of conditions. Seed treatments can reduce farmers' risk of damage from multiple diseases and beanfly, thus substantially increasing on-farm bean productivity; they are effective without promoting genetic erosion of the diverse bean varietal mixtures used by local farmers in the Great Lakes region of Africa, as can occur with genetic replacement strategies.

The objective of this study was to determine if afforestation with Pinus caribaea Morelet (PI) influenced soil acidification by comparing the metal status of the soil solid phase and the course of metal concentrations in soil solution during one rainy season with those under natural savanna vegetation (Cerrado, CE). Surface soil samples (0–0.15 m) from three spatially disconnected plots in \{CE\} and \{PI\} were sequentially extracted. At each plot, soil solution at 0.15, 0.3, 0.8, 1.2, and 2 m depth and in \{PI\} additionally litter leachate were collected between October 1997 and April 1998. Extracts and soil solution were analyzed for Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Si, and Zn concentrations, soil solution also for pH and electrical conductivity (EC). Total concentrations in soil solid phase ranged between 94 000 and 155 000 mg kg−1 (Al), 29 and 39 (Ca), 21 and 31 (Cu), 44 000 and 61 000 (Fe), 91 and 141 (K), 21 and 29 (Mg), 28 and 57 (Mn), 73 and 94 (Na), and 13 and 21 (Zn).

There were no significant differences in concentrations and partitioning between \{CE\} and PI. At the beginning of the rainy season (October to December), metal concentrations in soil solution were 2–5 times larger and more variable than between December and April because of the mineralization of organic matter which accumulated during the dry season. Metal concentrations in \{CE\} soil solution between December and April were extremely small at all depths (Al: not detected (n.d.)–3.26 μmol l−1, Ca: 2.8–11.7, K: 0.9–6.7, Mg: 0.7–8.3, Mn: n.d. −0.14, Na: 5.5–40.1, Zn: 0.13–1.02). Up to 1.2 m soil depth, soil solution pH was significantly lower in \{PI\} than in CE. Concentrations of Ca, K, Mg, and Na were up to two times larger than in CE, those of Mn and Al 9 and 60 times, respectively. Whereas the soil solid phase did not show significant differences in metal concentrations and partitioning, the soil solution composition clearly indicated enhanced acidification in PI.

Physical seed parameters have previously been reported to impede penetration by neonate bruchid larvae into dry beans. However, those parameters could also affect parasitoid performance. In addition, other plant traits such as chemical seed parameters have the potential to contribute to bruchid suppression but may influence food processing. We characterized 22 bean lines in regard to physical attributes, such as seed coat thickness and cotyledon strength, and tested 10 selected lines for potential correlated effects on bruchid survival and parasitoid efficiency. Bean lines expressing the natural seed storage protein arcelin and arcelin-free cultivars were compared regarding their hydration kinetics. Bioassay results showed that increasing seed coat thickness and cotyledon strength did not reduce bruchid penetration into the seeds, indicating that the survival of neonate bruchid larvae does not depend on their individual capability to pierce a seed. Introduction of parasitoids yielded only few parasitoid offspring, but resulted in increased post-penetration mortality of bruchids in samples with arcelin containing bean lines. This finding is discussed in the context of host feeding. Comparisons of hydration kinetics of arcelin containing and arcelin-free beans yielded no significant differences in water absorption rate and hydration capacity. The present work corroborates earlier evidence that the natural storage protein arcelin is a promising component for integrated storage systems and demonstrates that it does not detectably alter the cooking quality of dry beans.

Therefore, topsoil samples of loamy and clayey Cerrado Oxisols under crop, pasture and reforestation were fractionated using a wet-sieving procedure to obtain the distribution of water-stable aggregates and compared to samples from natural savanna. The results were correlated to organic and inorganic soil compounds to identify the main aggregating agents and discussed in relation to changes in the pore-size distribution of the soils. Clayey soils showed a significantly higher macro-aggregation than loamy soils. Compared to natural savanna, macro-aggregation was clearly reduced at the crop sites, whereas aggregation of soils under pasture and reforestation was only slightly affected. In both the clayey and the loamy soils, bonding of polysaccharides was the main aggregating agent. In the clayey soils, liming was also very important for disaggregation by weakening the electrostatic forces between positively and negatively charged soil compounds, whereas in the loamy soils, binding of macro-aggregates by roots was significant. The introduction of crop–pasture rotations was therefore proposed to take advantage of the strong rooting and polysaccharide production of pastures. Management-induced disaggregation strongly affected the pore-size distribution by compacting the soils. Thereby, macro-porosity was reduced and the amount of meso-pores was increased, while micro-porosity was unaffected from management and only differed between the two substrates. Considering the low pore space at plant-available matrix potentials typical of Cerrado Oxisols, the increase might be important for annual crops during the frequent dry spells in the rainy season. "

The three main systems tested after 2 years of upland rice cultivation were grass-alone pasture (Brachiaria dictyoneura), green manure (Crotalaria juncea), and maize (Zea mays). Native savanna treatment was used as a control. Intensive disc harrowing improved macroporosity values of 0–5 cm soil layer up to 59% for grass-alone pasture system compared to native savanna. Disc harrowing significantly reduced bulk densities for pasture and green manure systems compared to the native savanna in the 0–5 cm soil layer. Intensive disc harrowing significantly improved volumetric moisture content of green manure and maize systems at 5–10 cm soil depth. The distribution of biologically, moderately and sparingly available P, organic P and total P varied under green manure, maize and grass-alone pasture systems. Two passes of disc harrow per year were sufficient for grass-alone pasture, while maize showed greater aboveground production and nutrient acquisition at 8 passes of disc harrow per year. The maize and green manure cropping systems were better than the grass-alone pasture system at separating the effect of increased number of disc harrow passes on soil physical and chemical characteristics.

This study was conducted in an Andean hillside environment to determine how the local organic manuring and tillage practices influence the development of soil crusting and sealing, and the extent to which these practices influence soil water infiltration. The aim of this study was to identify treatments that prevented superficial soil structural constraints, i.e. treatments which maintain infiltration and therefore reduce potential soil erosion and run-off. Treatment results were measured with a pocket penetrometer and a mini-rain simulator on nine different cropping systems, mainly based on cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), from February to November 2000 and 2001. The cropping systems were laid out on a Ferrallic Cambisol, an acid, vulcanically influenced soil of the Andean region. In both cropping cycles, treatments with chicken manure application developed superficial soil crusts during the dry season. For a treatment manured with 8 t ha−1 chicken manure, this crust meant an increase in penetration resistance from 2.3 kg cm−2 in April 2000 to 16.2 kg cm−2 in July 2000. The change in superficial soil structure created a notable reduction in final infiltration from 92 to 42.2 mm h−1. A minimum tillage treatment which displayed the highest penetration resistance during the dry periods of up to 46.4 kg cm−2 presented no restricting effects on soil water intake (76.2 mm h−1 final infiltration in 2000) due to an optimal aggregate development during 10 years of consecutive conservation practice. Measurements of penetration resistance and infiltration showed that soil conserving treatments, such as minimum tillage and crop rotations, improved the physical soil status and prevented soil crusting developing along with its negative effects on infiltration. These methods can therefore be strongly recommended to farmers. "

On average, farmers adopted 3.25 different Striga control options from a basket of six “best bets”. Resource-poor and -medium farmers were more likely to adopt than resource-rich ones. Adopting farmers enjoyed livelihood improvements, largely through selling \{ISC\} soybean. Women in most adopting households benefited through selling food products based on soybean. Adoption of \{ISC\} can be attributed to four factors: (1) farmer-field-school-type training that explained how the technologies worked; (2) incorporation of at least one technology in the \{ISC\} package that gave quick benefits to sustain farmer interest in adopting and learning other components whose effects took longer to become evident; (3) allowance for farmer experimentation and adaptation to local conditions; and, (4) use of a monitoring and evaluation component that identified and incorporated farmer modifications to continually improve the \{ISC\} package. These principles are likely to be valid for research and extension approaches for similar integrated natural resource management (INRM). Impact pathway evaluation methodology used for the evaluation helped give the project a greater impact focus; helped design and reporting of the evaluation; and, by identifying early adoption pathways, has provided a firm basis for any future ex post impact assessment of \{ISC\} in Northern Nigeria.

The improved pastures were Brachiaria humidicola, and Brachiaria decumbens, either in monoculture or in combination with native legumes. The age of the treatments was 30 years for degraded pasture and 10 or 15 years for each of the improved pastures. Carbon fractions were Total C, Oxidizable C, and Non-Oxidizable (stable) C. Stocks were compared using a fixed soil mass base. The degraded pasture in the flat landscape was abandoned and dominated by weeds, while that in the sloping area was overgrazed. The latter had much lower C stocks than the former. B. humidicola monoculture had the highest stocks both in flat and sloping areas, while the effect of the other three treatments varied. C replacement based on δ13C indicated that after 30 years, the degraded pasture still contained more than 50% forest-derived C in its topsoil. The fraction in the topsoil that is not replaced roughly coincides with the Stable C fraction. δ13C values suggest that the changes in carbon stocks ascribed to differences in land use may be – at least partially – inherited from the previous land use, thus confusing the interpretation of land use effects. Nevertheless, the introduction of improved pastures on degraded grassland is a feasible alternative of land use both for carbon sequestration and as an attractive economic alternative to farmers. "

We compared the contents of Total C, Oxidizable C and Non-Oxidizable (stable) C in four different land use systems, namely Monoculture (Brachiaria grassland), Association (Brachiaria + Arachis pintoi), Forage Bank (a mixture of forage tree species), and Natural Regeneration of the pasture in both a flat area and a sloping one. The Degraded Pasture was the reference. Results showed that in the sloping area all treatments have higher Total Carbon stocks than the Degraded Pasture, while three of the treatments significantly increased the stocks of Non-Oxidizable C. In the flat landscape, only the Association significantly increased Total C stocks. Plowing and fertilization cause significant increases in Oxidizable carbon and decreases in Non-Oxidizable carbon. This effect needs further research, as C stability will influence equilibrium stocks. In the sloping area, improved pastures and fodder bank rapidly increased Total Carbon contents and stocks, with increases as large as10 ton.ha−1 yr−1. In the Traditional Fodder Bank, which showed the largest increase, this is partially due to the application of organic manure. Surprisingly, also C stocks under Natural Regeneration were significantly higher than under the original Degraded Grassland. This increase was fully due to Non-Oxidizable Carbon, which is difficult to explain. Stable isotope analysis indicated that under improved grassland, especially Brachiaria monoculture, up to 40% of the original C in the upper 10 cm was replaced in 3.3 years. "

This laboratory study investigated mechanisms of biological soil macroaggregation by two different earthworm species (Apporectodea caliginosa (Savigny) and Allolobophora chlorotica (Savigny) and two plant species (Trifolium pratense, Plantago lanceolata L.), in isolation and in all possible combinations.

The largest departure from the control signal was observed with T. pratense whereas earthworms and P. lanceolata specific signals were less contrasted. Macroaggregates formed in the presence of more than one ecosystem engineers had mixed signals showing that several actors had participated in their construction. This means that roots and earthworms did not produce macroaggregates in isolation and rather added their effects in building structures of mixed origins. Further studies based on the present methodology will tell us more on below ground behaviors of ecosystem engineers and their interactive building of soil habitats. "

abstract = "In soils, P, S, and Mo occur organically bound or as oxyanions. In Oxisols, oxyanions may be strongly sorbed due to the high positive surface charge. The objective of this work was to compare chemical fractions of P, S, and Mo in differently used Oxisols with similar properties in an on-farm experiment. Soil samples (0–0.15 m) were taken from three replicate plots of each of conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) maize–soybean and conventional tillage sugarcane (SC) cropping systems, degraded (DP) and productive pastures (PP), Eucalyptus (EU) and Pinus reforestations (PI), and native savannah (CE). The samples were sequentially extracted with (1) 0.5 M NaHCO3, (2) 0.1 M NaOH, (3) 1 M HCl, (4) hot concentrated HCl, and (5) concentrated HClO4/HNO3. In the extracts, inorganic (Pi) and total P, S, and Mo were determined. Organic P (Po) was calculated as total P−Pi. Total concentrations were 333–567 mg P kg−1, 231–284 mg S kg−1, and 3.2–3.9 mg Mo kg−1. The most important fractions in all studied systems were the NaOH fraction for P (38–49% of total P), the HClO4/HNO3 fraction for S (27–35% of total S) and the concentrated \{HCl\} fraction for Mo (86–90% of total Mo). The proportion of the more easily extracted NaHCO3+NaOH fractions decreased along the line S&gt;P&gt;Mo. Fertilisation increased plant-available P and S fractions in \{CT\} and \{NT\} whereas recalcitrant fraction (concentrated \{HCl\} and HClO4/HNO3) remained unchanged. The Pi/Po ratios in \{NT\} and \{CT\} were higher than in \{CE\} because fertiliser P mainly accumulated in inorganic P fractions. The pasture soil had lower P concentrations indicating export by grazing. Thus, 12–20 years of land use had marked effects on P, smaller ones on S, and almost none on Mo concentrations and chemical fractions. "

Bulk soil samples and particle-size separates from clayey and loamy Oxisols under crop, pasture, and reforestation sites were compared with the natural Cerrado savanna in order to characterise texture and treatment effects on \{SOM\} and to follow the alterations of organic compounds in the different particle-size fractions. The analyses included an assessment of SOM, particulate organic matter (POM), polysaccharides, lignin oxidation products (VSC-lignin), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of different particle-size fractions. The amounts of SOM, polysaccharides, and VSC-lignin were clearly higher in the clayey soils due to the increasing stabilisation of organic substances to the clay fraction. Conversely, the amounts of \{POM\} were comparable between the substrates resulting in a higher proportion of labile organic matter, and thus an overall greater lability of the loamy soils. Continuous cropping and reforestation with pine led to a clear reduction of \{SOM\} contents, whereas pasture and eucalyptus reforestation might have increased both the amount and quality of \{SOM\} in relation to the Cerrado control. The analysis of particle-size separates showed the decline of lignin and plant-derived polysaccharides from the sand to the clay fraction, and an accumulation of microbially metabolised polysaccharides in the clay fraction, suggesting that humification and mineralisation of organic matter in Cerrado soils follow along a biogeochemical gradient similar to that of temperate soils and climates.

Negative nutrient balances at farm scale or at larger scales are very often presented as proof that soil fertility is at stake in SSA. However, nutrient balances at plot and farm section scale are not always negative. In areas with large nutrient stocks, short-term nutrient mining is fully acceptable. Fertilizer use continues to face considerable controversy in SSA. In this paper, we demonstrate that fertilizers rarely damage the soil; that fertilizers are being used in SSA, often with favourable value-to-cost ratios; and that fertilizers do not cause eutrophication in SSA. Rock phosphates are abundantly present in \{SSA\} but most are poorly soluble. Adding these phosphates to compost heaps does not enhance the short-term availability of their P. Although organic inputs are essential soil amendments besides fertilizer, organic inputs alone cannot sustain crop production due to limitations in their quality and availability. Organic resources can also potentially stimulate harmful pests and diseases. Legumes are often advocated as important sources of organic matter but not all legumes fix nitrogen, require inoculation, or are a source of free nitrogen, as even green manures require land and labour. Certain grain legumes with high N harvest indices do not improve soil fertility, but remove net amounts of N from the soil. These myths need correction if we are to harness the role of science in the overall goal of assisting farmers to address the acute problems of poor soil fertility for smallholder farmers in SSA. "

This need has become more critical as governments in developing countries downsize expenditure on extension services and donors demand impact from their investments. This paper outlines a flexible computer-based farm-household model designed to assist researchers, extension workers, and policy makers. The model allows the user to define specific production options and resource constraints under different socio-economic and biophysical settings. Model application in different regions has proven its flexibility to capture and analyze a variety of production systems. When used with site-related input data and effective dialogue on the results among researchers, extensionists, and farmers, the model can be a useful tool for participatory research and extension. "

Hence, agricultural change is an immensely complex process, with a high degree of non-linearity. However, current ‘best practice’ economic evaluation methods commonly used in the \{CGIAR\} system ignore complexity. In this paper we develop a two-stage monitoring, evaluation and impact assessment approach called impact pathway evaluation. This approach is based on program-theory evaluation from the field of evaluation, and the experience of the German development organization \{GTZ\} (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit GmbH). In the first stage of this approach, a research project develops an impact pathway for itself, which is an explicit theory or model of how the project sees itself achieving impact. The project then uses the impact pathway to guide project management in complex environments. The impact pathway may evolve, based on learning over time. The second stage is an ex post impact assessment sometime after the project has finished, in which the project's wider benefits are independently assessed. The evaluator seeks to establish plausible links between the project outputs and developmental changes, such as poverty alleviation. We illustrate the usefulness of impact pathway evaluation through examples from Nigeria and Indonesia. "

This has stimulated efforts to augment the value of \{SF\} to farmers to induce them to increase the area in SF. The objective of this paper was to document the regeneration of \{SF\} in slash-and-burn agriculture and to develop policy and technological recommendations for conserving forest cover on small farms and improve farmer welfare. The dynamics of \{SF\} in slash-and-burn farming were studied by investigating changes in the role of \{SF\} with frontier development. Farm survey data from a colonist settlement area in the Peruvian Amazon were analyzed by using a recursive econometric model. Results confirmed that substantial areas of \{SF\} exist on slash-and-burn farms during the first few decades after settlement. As a result, over a third of the farm area is under forest cover. This implies that deforestation in slash-and-burn farming may be less than previously believed. Soil recuperation is the most important reason for the existence of \{SF\} in slash-and-burn agriculture. During the relatively early stages of frontier development studied in this paper, fallow periods increased over time as site productivity declined, giving rise to secondary forests. Pastures lowered forested areas on farms and appear to impede the regeneration of SF. Commercial exploitation of \{SF\} products was minimal and declines with frontier development. The conclusions show that improved short-rotation fallows may recuperate the soil at the expense of forest cover, particularly in areas where most of the forest cover consists of SF. This conflict could be resolved by technologies that enrich \{SF\} and reinforce its multiple functions, including soil recuperation. Reduction of extensive cattle ranching may be a more effective way to conserve forest cover in slash-and-burn farming than technologies for shortening fallow periods. A ‘quantum leap’ in the benefits of forested land will be required if increases in forest cover are to be compatible with farmer welfare. This is likely to require innovative approaches, such as commercialization of the environmental services of forests. The results of this research could potentially shift efforts to control deforestation away from slash-and-burn farmers, thus reducing the perceived conflict between forest conservation and the livelihood of poor people.

The refrigerant and second fluid flows in heat exchangers are approximated by a cascade of Continuous Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTRs). This model is quite flexible since a unique structure is used for the evaporator and the condenser models according to different boundary conditions. This is due to the use of a switching procedure between different configurations based on a phase stability test that is designed to ensure the continuity of the system simulation. An analytical thermodynamic model of the refrigerant based on an equation of state is used. Good agreement between simulation results and experimental data is achieved. "

The concentration of ABA, sugars (sucrose, glucose, and fructose), proline, and potassium salts (K-salts) were determined in mature and expanding leaves. \{ABA\} content increased under water deficit, consistent with a putative role in regulating solute accumulation, and thus OA. The extent of osmotic adjustment, although modest, was higher in young folded leaves than in mature leaves. K-salts were the major contributors to total osmolyte concentration in both mature and expanding leaves, accounting for approximately 60% of osmotic potential. The concentration of K-salts increased in response to water stress and was positively correlated with the extent of OA. In contrast, total sugars (sucrose + glucose + fructose) decreased during water deficit, showing a negative correlation with OA. Although the concentration of proline in mature leaves increased in response to water stress its contribution to the total change in osmotic potential was insignificant. Thus, in the current study, cassava used K-salts as its primary osmolyte, and did not substantially adjust its osmotic solute concentration during the 6-day water deficit.

The objectives of this study were to identify advanced lines of common bean with superior seed yield under drought, and to identify plant traits that could serve as selection criteria for evaluating drought resistance. Seventy-eight advanced inbred lines (genotypes) were generated by single seed descent and evaluated with the two parents (ICA Bunsi, a white pea bean variety and \{SXB\} 405, a breeding line) and a standard check (Awash melka) under drought and irrigated field conditions in 2008 and 2009 at Melkassa, Ethiopia. Seed yield, seed number per m2, pod number per m2 and 100 seed weight were reduced by 65%, 34%, 29% and 12%, respectively under drought stress compared to irrigated conditions. Two genotypes (G87, G80) had better drought yield compared with a standard check, and several also responded to irrigation. Pod harvest index (PHI; [dry weight of seed/dry weight of pod at harvest] × 100) was reduced in sensitive genotypes and increased in resistant genotypes under drought stress conditions indicating the importance of remobilization of photosynthates from pod wall to seed. Principal component analysis indicated that the first component including five traits (grain yield, seed number per m2, pod number per m2, 100 seed weight and PHI) explained 35.7% of the total variation under drought stress. Correlations of \{PHI\} with yield (0.43***) and fair heritability (0.48) in drought suggest that \{PHI\} would be an effective selection criterion for identifying genotypes with improved drought resistance. Correlated gain in drought yield from selection for \{PHI\} would be greater than direct yield selection, due to much better heritability of PHI, and would also contribute to irrigated yield. "

abstract = "Summary Macroaggregation is a highly dynamic attribute of soils that is claimed to have a significant impact on their ability to store C and conserve nutrients. A major obstacle to the description and modelling of macroaggregate dynamics, and of the associated processes, is an almost complete ignorance of the real origin of the different types of aggregates found in soils, their turnover times and positions in the soil matrix. We present here a general methodological approach in which the origin of aggregates separated according to visual criteria could be determined by comparing their specific organic matter signatures assessed by Near Infrared Spectrometry (NIRS) to signatures of biogenic structures produced by soil ecosystem engineers (invertebrates and roots) living in the same soil. Macroaggregates and other soil components were separated visually from samples taken at 61 locations regularly distributed across a watershed in Nicaragua and representing crops, pastures, forests, coffee plantations and fallows. Coinertia analyses among soil macroinvertebrate communities and the matrix of soil morphological variables showed highly significant relationships. In Amazonian forest patches and pastures from the state of Pará in Brazil, 75 different types of biogenic structures were collected at the soil surface and on tree trunks, and analysed by the \{NIRS\} spectral method. Significant differences among the different types of structures allowed grouping according to their broad phylogenetic origin with large interspecifc differences. In a field experiment conducted at the same site, soils previously under pastures were planted in 16 possible combinations of four plant species, in a fully randomized design replicated three times in different sites. Surface casts of the earthworm species Andiodrilus pachoensis and soil macroaggregates separated by our visual technique had significantly different spectral signatures depending on the location of the plot and the composition of plant cover. However, the comparison of \{NIRS\} signatures of soil macroaggregates and casts suggested that Andiodrilus pachoensis was not responsible for the production of the biogenic aggregates that comprised a large proportion on the soil volume in this soil.

We found that earthworm casts had higher levels of organic hydroxide P than surrounding soils, whereas fertilization increased inorganic hydroxide P. Inorganic P was increased by fertilization, and organic P was increased by earthworm gut passage and/or selection of ingested materials, which increased available P (sum of resin and bicarbonate fractions) and moderately available P (sum of hydroxide and dilute acid fractions), and P fertilizer application and land-use increased available P. The use of a modified sequential P fractionation produced fewer differences between earthworm casts and soils than were expected. We suggest the use of a condensed extraction procedure with three fractions (Available P, Moderately Available P, and Resistant P) that provide an ecologically based understanding of the P availability in soil. Earthworm casts were estimated to constitute 41.0, 38.2, and 26.0 kg ha−1 of total available P stocks (sum of resin and bicarbonate fractions) in the agroforestry system, pasture, and secondary forest, respectively.

Germination in the pathogenic isolates was inhibited to a greater extent than in the weakly pathogenic isolates, especially on \{CIAT\} 136. Antagonistic activity of these bacteria appeared to be based in antibiotic production to which the weakly pathogenic isolates were less sensitive. The weakly pathogenic C. gloeosporioides isolates appear to have evolved as highly competitive saprophytes competing with pathogenic isolates.

Moreover, despite recognition of the necessity to incorporate a multi-scale analysis, scale dependencies are normally not considered during validation. In this paper, a multi-scale land use change modelling framework, conversion of land use and its effects (CLUE), is calibrated for Costa Rica and validated at five spatial resolutions for Honduras and Costa Rica. Both countries experienced locally very strong actual land use changes. Calibration runs show that the model is very sensitive to changes in the autonomous development parameter, which defines the influence of the finest resolution. Validation results are very satisfactory for both countries. Especially, changes in major land use types are reproduced with the model. Changes in localised land use types are more difficult to project. The magnitude of gains and magnitude of losses are slightly underestimated in all cases. The multi-scale validation demonstrates that results improve strongly, and exponentially, with decreasing spatial resolution. Strong reduction of the number of observations results in a correlation between actual and modelled changes that approximates the perfect value of 1. The study demonstrates that the \{CLUE\} modelling framework can reproduce changes as they took place in Central America in the 1970s and 1980s, and shows how conclusions can differ depending on the scale at which validation is performed.

Density and biomass of this species were significantly much higher in the introduced pastures compared with the savanna (ANOVA, P&lt;0.01). Evidence of vertical migration during the year was observed, while it is active in the topsoil during the beginning of the rainy season, it enters in a true diapause to withstand adverse environmental conditions before the onset of the dry period, being adults the last to enter into this phase (after reproduction period). Martiodrilus n. sp. seemed to select food substrates with high organic contents since casts produced in the two systems had significantly higher total C and total N contents than the bulk soil. Besides, C content also increased significantly during ageing of casts (+100%), possibly because of \{CO2\} fixation processes, accumulation of dead roots and/or macrofaunal activities. The effects of earthworm activities on soil and cast seed banks were revealed in another experiment. The composition of the above standing vegetation was relatively closer to that of the cast seed bank than that of the soil seed bank. The results obtained in this study support the general knowledge of how earthworms can affect soil fertility and plant growth. Martiodrilus n. sp., through the production of casts affects the availability and nature of both the spatial and trophic resource in soil. This species certainly belongs to the functional group of “ecosystem engineers”, as it affects the availability of some resources for other organisms through the production of physical biostructures. The next step in research should be directed now to test whether Martiodrilus n. sp. is a keystone species within the soil community or not. "

Farmers often plant mixtures of cassava cultivars, while bush-beans or maize are traditionally grown as cassava-intercrops. The objectives of this study were: (a) to determine if cassava or overall production can be improved by planting cassava cultivar mixtures or intercropping, (b) to assess the influence of soil properties on the dry matter production of cassava production systems, (c) to verify if soil cover can be increased by growing cultivar or species mixtures. On-farm trials were conducted at four locations in typical hillside environments with slopes up to 55% in the Southwest of Colombia from 1996 to 1998. Two cassava varieties contrasting in plant architecture (early branching variety, rich in apices versus erect, late branching variety, poor in apices) were grown as pure stands, as a variety mixture and each intercropped independently with upland rice or Canavalia brasiliensis. Rainfall during the trial period was only 76% of the long term average due to the ‘El niño’ phenomenon. The cassava cultivars produced tuber yields of 9.0 and 7.5 t ha−1 \{DM\} when planted in cultivar pure stands. Cassava growth and biomass production increased with increasing size of water stable aggregates and soil N content and decreased with increasing soil bulk density. In the cassava cultivar mixture, competition changed the pattern of biomass allocation, leading to a significantly lower harvest index compared to the mean of the pure stands (−6%). Intercropped C. brasiliensis significantly reduced cassava harvest index (−13%; mean of cassava/C. brasiliensis mixtures compared to mean of pure stands) as well as cassava (−53%) and total biomass production (−24%), while differences were not statistically significant in the cassava–rice systems probably because of the poor performance of rice. The strong reduction in cassava tuber yield in the cassava/C. brasiliensis systems was due to competition for water between cassava and the intercrop, aggravated by the lack of rain. The percentage of soil cover was slightly higher in all mixed cropping systems compared to the pure stands. In contrast to the mixture concept which seeks to increase productivity and soil cover compared to monocropping, the mixed cropping systems used in the studies in Rio Cabuyal reduced cassava tuber yield and total biomass production of the cropping systems compared to the cassava cultivar monocrops. When total soil cover was improved compared to the cassava cultivar pure stands it was paralleled by reductions in terms of cassava tuber yield. "

Soil fertility management was given low priority in the face of high HIV/AIDS prevalence although it is a critical resource for meeting basic needs. Findings show that HIV/AIDS poses a significant and complex threat to the already deficient soil fertility management practices among smallholders. The disease's synergistic relation with poverty increases the stress on soil fertility management. It destructs local social structures and households by taking away resource persons, overburdening traditional insurance systems, and obliterating any modest capital and labour useful for soil fertility management that has been accumulated by the household. There is need for robust soil fertility policy-action frameworks that can be sustained under the limiting conditions of affected households and that can mitigate HIV/AIDS impacts amidst high poverty.

Experiments in the laboratory with the same soil confirmed that (i) it would fix 20% of applied K, (ii) periods of moist incubation at 25°C produced release of K at rates equivalent to 1.8 kg K ha−1 per 7 days, and (iii) this rate of release was increased to 2.1 kg K ha−1 per 7 days by drying the soil to 1–2% moisture and subsequently re-wetting it. X-ray diffraction analysis suggests that hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite (HIV) is responsible for this behaviour.

While \{OR\} quality may influence \{SOC\} and N stabilization within aggregates, the simultaneous addition of N-fertilizers may enhance \{OR\} decomposition resulting in loss of SOC. A mesocosm study was conducted on a clayey soil at Embu and a sandy soil at Machanga in central Kenya to determine the influence of soil texture, \{OR\} quality and N-fertilizer on aggregation, \{SOC\} and N. Tithonia diversifolia (high quality), Calliandra calothyrsus (medium quality) and Zea mays (maize; low quality) residues, natural abundance or labeled with 15N, were applied to soil at an equivalent rate of 4 Mg C ha−1 compared to no input control. Each treatment was fertilized with 120 kg 14N or 15N ha−1 as (NH2)2CO, or not fertilized. Soil samples were collected at installation of the mesocosms (start), and 8 months after installation (end). Soils were separated into different aggregate size fractions by wet sieving and macroaggregates were further fractionated to isolate microaggregates-within-macroaggregates. Total soil and aggregate fractions were analyzed for \{SOC\} and N. On average, 20% and 70% of \{SOC\} and N was in the macroaggregates in the sandy and clayey soils, respectively. There were no differences among \{OR\} quality in both soils but in the clayey soil all \{ORs\} resulted in greater \{SOC\} and N than in the control. However, proportions of OR-derived N in the macroaggregates, mostly in the microaggregates-within-macroaggregates were greater with sole applied maize in the clayey soil. The addition of N-fertilizer together with maize stover reduced soil N, macroaggregate N, and OR-derived N in the microaggregate and silt and clay fractions within macroaggregates compared to when maize was applied alone. In the sandy soil, Calliandra resulted in greater OR-derived N than Tithonia in the coarse particulate organic matter (cPOM; i.e., 5% compared to 2% of N applied). Thus, the greater polyphenol concentration in Calliandra likely slowed its decomposition compared to that of Tithonia. In addition, greater proportions of N and residue-derived N in the macroaggregates were observed in the coarse \{POM\} in the sandy soil whereas in the clayey soil it was in the microaggregates-within-macroaggregates. We conclude that the preservation of OR-derived N is affected by the chemical recalcitrance of the residues in sandy soils, whereas macroaggregate protection, and not \{OR\} quality, is the major factor in clayey soils.

Here we show that a specific set of soil conservation practices called conservation farming (CF) using planting basins and hand hoes disseminated on 280 farms in Zambia on average failed to increase maize yields compared to traditional farming (TF). Average grain yield was low with 1.2 t ha−1, but variation between farms was large with a variance of 32% for CF, ranging in individual farms from 0.02 to 2.8 t ha−1. Yields on farms that declared to practice \{CF\} were more constrained by inappropriate management (P &lt; 0.001 of multiple stepwise regression; 13% of total variability) such as lack of early planting and insufficient weeding (25% of total variability explained by management) than by site or climatic conditions. In contrast, yields under \{TF\} varied the most (26%) based on the amount and types of inputs. \{CF\} practices increased maize yields at rainfall below 1000 mm yr−1, and in valley bottoms possibly due to the water-collecting properties of the planting basins, but decreased yields in lower slope and valley positions of higher rainfall regions above 1000 mm yr−1 likely due to waterlogging. Observed management constraints in comparison to site or soil conditions highlight the critical importance of training needed to make complex interventions such as \{CF\} successful in areas where means and infrastructure are insufficient to provide farmers with external inputs.

Macromolecular features, crystallinity, granule sizes, and thermal properties of these starches were compared. The structure of cassava amylopectin was not modified by the waxy mutation and waxy cassava starch exhibited properties similar to the ones of waxy maize starch. Waxy cassava and maize show similar M ¯ w and R ¯ G of amylopectin (between 408 × 106 g mol−1 and 520 × 106 g mol−1; 277–285 nm, respectively), whereas waxy potato amylopectin has lower M ¯ w and R ¯ G . On the contrary, the higher-amylose mutations induced by gamma rays radiation in cassava, modified deeply the branching pattern of amylopectin as well as the starch characteristics and properties: M ¯ w and R ¯ G decreased, while branching degree increased. These modifications resulted in changes in starch granule ultrastructure (e.g. decreased starch crystallinity), a weak organized structure, and increased susceptibility to mild acid hydrolysis. The distinctive properties of the new cassava starches demonstrated in this article suggest new opportunities and commercial applications for tropical sources of starch. "

The main objective of this experiment was to measure the genotype × cropping system (G × CS) interaction for yield and selected agronomic traits of climbing beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) grown as sole crop and intercropped with two morphologically contrasting maize (Zea mays L.) cultivars. A secondary objective was to identify the most efficient and productive bean–maize intercrop combinations. Seven climbing bean genotypes were grown as sole crop and intercropped with two maize varieties, \{BH\} 140 (Mix. 1) and Guto (Mix. 2), in a factorial arranged Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications at Bako Agricultural Research Center in western Ethiopia. Main effects due to genotype and cropping system (except days to flowering) were significant for all bean traits considered. The genotypes × cropping system interaction terms were also significant for the number of seeds per pod, 100-seed weight, harvest index and seed yield. While bean seed yield significantly correlated with the number of seeds per pod (in Mix. 1) and with harvest index (in both mixtures), positive and significant correlations occurred with the number of pods per plant and 100-seed weight under sole cropping system. The correlation between bean seed yields of Mix. 1 and Mix. 2 and between Mix. 2 and sole crop were positive and significant. No such relationship was found between Mix. 1 and sole crop. The results suggest that selection of suitable climbing bean cultivars for intercropping with maize varieties predominantly grown in the area should be made under the associated culture of the two crops. Intercropping contributed to a significant reduction in seed yield of the bean genotypes due mainly to its adverse effects on the numbers of pods per plant and seeds per pod. The index tLER1 identified most bean–maize genotype combinations of Mix. 2 as biologically more efficient system than Mix. 1. On the other hand, tLER2 values of more than 1.00 for all treatments of Mix. 2 demonstrated higher overall productivity of the intercrop system when the bean genotypes were grown in association with a late-maturing and high yielding maize hybrid \{BH\} 140.

Fields closest to homesteads (homefields) typically receive most nutrients and are more fertile than outlying fields (outfields), with implications for crop production and nutrient use efficiencies. Maize yields following application of 100 kg N ha−1 and different rates and sources of P were assessed on homefields and outfields of smallholder farms in Zimbabwe. Soil organic carbon, available P and exchangeable bases were greater on the homefields than outfields. In each of three experimental seasons, maize yields in homefield control plots were greater than in the outfields of farms on a granitic sandy and a red-clay soil. Application of mineral N significantly increased maize yields on homefields in the first season (2.1–3.0 t ha−1 on the clay soil and 1.0–1.5 t ha−1 on the sandy soil) but the effects of N alone were not significant on the outfields due to other yield-limiting factors.

Manure application gave greater yields (3–4 t ha−1) than \{SSP\} (2–3 t ha−1) in the sandy homefield and in the clayey outfield. Maize did not respond significantly to N, dolomitic lime, manure and P on the sandy outfield in the first and second seasons. In the third season, manure application (∼17 t manure ha−1 year−1) on the sandy outfield did result in a significant response in grain yields. Apparent P recovery in the first season was 55–65% when P was applied at 10 kg ha−1 on the clayey homefield (SSP), clayey outfield (SSP and manure) and sandy homefield (manure) with apparent P recovery less than 40% when P was applied at 30 kg ha−1. On the sandy outfield, P recovery was initially poor (&lt;20%), but increased in the successive seasons with manure application. In a second experiment, less than 60 kg N ha−1 was required to attain at least 90% of the maximum yields of 2–3 t ha−1 on the sandy homefield and clayey outfield. N use efficiency varied from &gt;50 kg grain kg−1 N on the infields, to less than 5 kg grain kg−1 N on the sandy outfields. Apparent N recovery efficiency by maize was greatest at small N application rates with P applied. We conclude that blanket fertilizer recommendations are of limited relevance for heterogeneous smallholder farms. Targeted application of mineral fertilizers and manure according to soil type and past management of fields is imperative for improving crop yields and nutrient use efficiencies. "

Large variability in dry matter (DM) production (5–586 and 2–272 g plant−1 in the maximum and minimum rainfall periods, respectively), in vitro \{DM\} digestibility (IVDMD, 307–543 g kg−1) and crude protein content (169–237 g kg−1) was measured.

An exploratory cafeteria grazing trial showed that F. macrophylla was palatable in the minimum but not consumed in the maximum rainfall period. Further morphological studies on inflorescence characteristics of herbarium specimens and molecular marker studies are warranted to clarify the taxonomic status (subspecies or varieties) of the four morphotypes identified. Further development, such as palatability studies with a selected set of accessions, can make Flemingia a valuable feed alternative. "

Forage samples were incubated in batch cultures together with rumen fluid and digestion medium in order to model rumen fermentation dynamics in vitro. In Experiment 1, graded levels (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/g of forage dry matter (DM)) of purified condensed tannins (CT) obtained from four tanniniferous tropical shrub legumes, Flemingia macrophylla, Leucaena leucocephala and two provenances of Calliandra calothyrsus (San Ramón and Patulul), were added to a CT-free mixture of the grass Brachiaria humidicola and the herbaceous legume Vigna unguiculata. The statistical models used for data evaluation included the two main effects (origin and level of CT) and their interaction. Apart from dose-dependent effects (P&lt;0.001) there were clear plant-specific effects (mostly P&lt;0.001) in fermentation dynamics, in vitro \{DM\} degradation and apparent degradation of N-containing compounds. Tannins from C. calothyrsus had the most pronounced effects on fermentation dynamics and nutrient degradation, followed by F. macrophylla and L. leucocephala. Within C. calothyrsus, \{CT\} from the provenance San Ramón suppressed asymptotic gas production and \{DM\} degradation to a larger extent (P&lt;0.05) than \{CT\} from the provenance Patulul. Low addition (25 mg/g DM) of \{CT\} from C. calothyrsus was only slightly detrimental while high \{CT\} levels (75 and 100 mg/g DM) had clearly negative effects on asymptotic gas production and \{DM\} degradation. In a first incubation in Experiment 2, the grass in mixtures with foliage of the different tanniniferous shrub legumes was incubated with graded levels of polyethylene glycol (PEG) corresponding to 0/3, 1/3, 2/3 and 3/3 of the contents of \{CT\} in these mixtures. In a second incubation, all mixtures based on tanniniferous shrub legumes and mixtures containing non-tanniniferous shrub legumes (Cratylia argentea, Desmodium velutinum) or a herbaceous legume (V. unguiculata) were tested without \{PEG\} and with 80 g/kg supplementary PEG. In general, addition of \{PEG\} had no effect (P&gt;0.05) on fermentation parameters in non-tanniniferous legumes. With tanniniferous species, response curves in fermentation parameters were mostly non-linear reaching a plateau at a PEG:CT-ratio between 1:3 and 2:3. One exception was that undegraded dietary N decreased (P&lt;0.05) with increasing \{PEG\} addition until the highest level. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that to a large extent the effects of CT-rich plants on in vitro ruminal fermentation can be explained by the specific \{CT\} properties. Furthermore, apart from binding CT, \{PEG\} seems to have no major side-effects on ruminal fermentation, and for most fermentation variables and species, \{PEG\} supplementation equivalent to the \{CT\} content in the forage mixtures seems sufficient to prevent negative effects of \{CT\} on fermentation parameters.

Five agropastoral treatments (maize monoculture—MMO, maize–soybean rotation—MRT, maize–soybean green manure rotation—MGM, native savanna control—NSC and maize-agropastoral rotation—MAP) under two tillage systems (no till-NT and minimum tillage-MT) were investigated. The effects of \{NT\} and \{MT\} on \{SOM\} and P fractions as well as maize grain yield under the five agropastoral treatments were evaluated. Results showed that soil total C, N and P were generally better under no-till as compared to minimum-tilled soils. While P fractions were also generally higher under no-till treatments, \{SOM\} fractions did not show any specific trend. Seven years after establishment of the long-term ley farming experiment (5 years of conventional tillage followed by 2 years alternative tillage systems), \{MT\} resulted into moderately higher maize grain yields as compared to NT. The \{MGM\} rotation treatment had significantly higher values of maize yield under both tillage systems (4.2 Mg) compared to the \{NSC\} (2.3 Mg ha−1). Results from this study indicate that the rotational systems (maize–soybean green manure and maize-pastures) improved the soil conditions to implement the no-till or minimum tillage systems on Colombian savanna oxisol.

When the diffuser is a perforated panel with lobed orifices (Meslem et al. 2010), the optimization of jet induction consists in improving the orifice’s geometry, the spacing between orifices and their arrangement on the panel. In this study, the flow field of a turbulent twin cross-shaped jet is investigated numerically using the standard k-ε model, the Shear Stress Transport (SST) k-ω model and the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM). The results are compared with \{PIV\} measurements. The objective is to assess their capability and limitations to predict the significant features of twin jet flow when the flow is numerically resolved through a lobed diffuser. It is shown that the k-ε and \{RSM\} models are more appropriate for predicting potential jet core length, the change in jet centreline streamwise velocity, and flow expansion in the symmetry plane of the twin jet flow. However, these models overestimate the overall flow expansion and the jet volumetric flow rate. The \{SST\} k-ω model seems more appropriate for the prediction of such dynamic integral quantities. A high level of turbulent kinetic energy predicted by the k-ε and \{RSM\} models in the near field of jets is probably the reason for this overestimation of jet induction. The \{SST\} k-ω model would appear to be the most appropriate tool for optimizing orifice design, orifice to orifice spacing and relative orifice orientation on a perforated panel diffuser. "

As a result of the increasing demand and low availability of alternative resources, \{CR\} became an essential resource for household activities, especially for livestock keeping; a major livelihood element of smallholder farmers in the developing world. Farmers’ decisions on \{CR\} use are determined by farmers’ preferences, total crop production, availability of alternative resources and demand for CR. Interaction of these determinants can result in pressures and trade-offs of \{CR\} use. Determinants, pressures and trade-offs are shaped by the specific socio-economic and agro-ecological context of these mixed farms. The objective of this paper is to provide a comparative analysis of the determinants of \{CR\} use and to examine some options to cope with pressures and trade-offs in 12 study sites across Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Drawing on socio-economic data at household and village level, we describe how cereal intensification and livestock feed demand influence use, pressures and trade-offs of \{CR\} use across study sites, specifically cereal residue. Our results show that in low cereal production and livestock feed demand sites, despite a low demand for \{CR\} and availability of alternative biomass, pressures and trade-offs of \{CR\} use are common particularly in the dry season. In sites with moderate cereal production, and low–moderate and moderate livestock feed demand, alternative biomass resources are scarce and most residues are fed to livestock or used to cover household needs. Subsequently, pressures and potential trade-offs are stronger. In sites with low cereal production and high livestock feed demand, pressures and trade-offs depend on the availability of better feed resources. Finally, sites with high cereal production and high livestock feed demand have been able to fulfil most of the demand for CR, limiting pressures and trade-offs. These patterns show that agricultural intensification, better management of communal resources and off-farm activities are plausible development pathways to overcome pressures and trade-offs of \{CR\} use. Although technologies can largely improve these trends, research and development should revisit past initiatives so as to develop innovative approaches to tackle the well-known problem of low agricultural production in many smallholder mixed systems, creating more sustainable futures.

Field experiments were carried out on a Vertisol and a Nitisol for 2 years to study the effect of zero tillage, minimum tillage, conventional tillage, and broad bed furrows (BBF) on the yield of tef (Eragrostis tef Zucca). No significant differences in tef biomass and grain yields were observed between the treatments on both soils in the first year. In Nitisol in the second year, yield was lower in the zero tillage treatment as compared to the other treatments. No difference in yield was observed between single plough, conventional, and BBF. On Vertisol, the yields were higher in \{BBF\} as compared to the other treatments. The yields on Vertisol were 1368, 1520, 1560 and 1768 kg ha−1 for the zero tillage, minimum tillage, conventional tillage and \{BBF\} treatments respectively. More than twice as much grass weed was observed on zero tillage treatment as compared to the \{BBF\} treatment on both soils. Zero tillage gave the lowest gross margin on both soils whereas \{BBF\} gave the highest gross margin. The gross margin on Nitisols for the zero tillage and \{BBF\} treatments were −108 and 1504 Birr/ha respectively and corresponding numbers for the Vertisol were 520 and 1924 Birr ha−1. On Vertisol there were no significant difference in gross margin between minimum tillage and conventional tillage. Minimum tillage is an interesting option on Vertisols, particularly for female-headed households as it reduces the tillage cost. It may also improve overall productivity of the farming system because it allows partial replacement of oxen with cows and reduces soil erosion. "

An additional trial with C. ambrosioides from different collections and with plants at different stages of development revealed considerable variations in the efficacy of the treatment.

A programme of research was carried out linking institutes in Africa, the \{UK\} and South America, to identify possible resistance sources in cassava to the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci. The South American genotype \{MEcu\} 72 and several Ugandan cassava landraces including Ofumba Chai, Nabwire 1 and Mercury showed good levels of resistance to B. tabaci. Field and screen-house experiments showed that all of the improved, high-yielding cassava mosaic disease (CMD) resistant cassava genotypes assessed were highly susceptible to B. tabaci and supported high populations of all life stages. These data support the hypothesis that the continuing high populations of cassava B. tabaci in Uganda are due, in part, to the widespread adoption of CMD-resistant cassava varieties during the \{CMD\} pandemic. They also show that the whitefly, Aleurotrachelus socialis, resistance present in the South American cassava genotypes could have broader applicability in the Old World. "

The frying process was described as two stages involving inner vaporization of mainly high available water, which can be transported inside the material, at temperature around the boiling point and inner vaporization of “bound” water at higher temperature depending on water desorption equilibrium. During the first stage, drying rate was controlled by the serial association of both diffusive and convective thermal resistances. During the second stage, temperature gradients decreased and the core temperature followed the corresponding boiling curve (water desorption curve against boiling temperature). Oil uptake depended on the thermal history of the product, characterized by its final water content. Apparent elasticity modulus and color changes were similar for a same final water content. Boiling curves and core temperature measurement are therefore proposed as a means of predicting the development of chip quality during frying. "

To test this hypothesis, we compared C, N, P, and S concentrations and forms in soil solid phase and soil solution under Pinus (PI) and natural savanna vegetation (Cerrado, CE). We sampled the 0–0.15, 0.15–0.3, 0.3–0.8, 0.8–1.2, and 1.2–2 m soil depth layers of Oxisols from three spatially separated plots under \{CE\} and PI; at each plot, soil solution at 0.15, 0.3, 0.8, 1.2, and 2 m soil depth and under \{PI\} additionally below the organic layer was collected during two rainy seasons (21 October–28 April 1997/1998 and 1998/1999). Under PI, the organic layer stored more C (24.5 t ha−1), N (2.6 t ha−1), P (140 kg ha−1), and S (261 kg ha−1) than under \{CE\} (1.2 t C ha−1, 23 kg N ha−1, 1.2 kg P ha−1, 2.3 kg S ha−1). No significant difference in C, N, P, and S concentrations between \{CE\} and \{PI\} in the surface horizons of the mineral soil (C: 20.7–23.4 g kg−1, N: 1.2–1.5 g kg−1, P: 0.16–0.26 g kg−1, S: 0.18–0.21 g kg−1) was observed. However, at 1.2–2 m soil depth C and organic N (Norg) concentrations were significantly higher under \{PI\} (C: 6.9 g kg−1, Norg: 0.54 g kg−1) than under \{CE\} (C: 6.4 g kg−1, Norg: 0.41 g kg−1). C/P and C/S ratios in soil solid phase decreased with increasing soil depth under \{CE\} and PI, those of C/Norg only under PI, leading to narrower C/Norg ratios under \{PI\} (12.9) than under \{CE\} (15.6) at 1.2–2 m soil depth. The result indicated enhanced N transport to the subsoil under PI. Total organic C concentrations (TOC) in the soil solution were similar under \{CE\} and \{PI\} and throughout the mineral soil. Under PI, \{TOC\} concentrations decreased sharply between the litter leachate (30 mg C l−1) and 0.15 m soil depth (5 mg C l−1) indicating strong \{TOC\} sorption onto the surface mineral soil. Total N concentrations in the soil solution were 11–23 times higher under \{PI\} than under CE. Organic N concentrations also decreased between the litter leachate and 0.15 m soil depth under \{PI\} but NO3− concentrations increased from the litter leachate to 1.2 m soil depth and decreased between 1.2 and 2 soil depth, probably due to enhanced anion sorption at 2 m soil depth. No S and P was detectable in any solution sample. Higher C, N, and S storages and higher N availability under \{PI\} indicated that \{PI\} forests improve C, N, P, and S supply for plants in subsequent cultures and may therefore be considered sustainable with respect to organically bound nutrients.

Here, a three-dimensional conceptual framework of ‘power as domination’ is applied to the \{UNFCCC\} adaptation regime. We argue that this ‘power-over’ framing is an important lens through which to view adaptation, a field dominated by ‘power-to’, capacity-based constructs. The framework distinguishes between power-over manifesting through decision-making, agenda setting and preference shaping. Through a literature review we demonstrate that first and second dimension behavioral views of power-over fail to account for the subtle ways in which the interests and preferences of smallholder farmers are unknowingly shaped and restricted within the regime. Potential sources of third dimension preference shaping power are explored in a survey with high-level decision makers involved in National Adaptation Plans (NAP) development in seven countries. The results suggest that several inter-related features of the international agriculture adaptation regime collectively contribute to the shaping of interests and preferences of smallholders: prevailing discourses of uncertainty and the perceived limited capacity of smallholders; the resulting privileged status of ‘expert’ decision makers; the predominance of neoliberal development rationalities; and systemic biases resulting from the nation state as the principle unit of \{UNFCCC\} negotiation. These forces lie beyond the explanatory scope of first and second dimensions of power-over and help to explain why stakeholder engagement in adaptation decision making remains superficial in nature and why adaptation responses in agriculture can be considered ‘common and non-differentiated’. We argue for increased awareness of third dimension manifestations and impacts of power in adaptation literature to facilitate the improved participation of marginalized stakeholders in \{UNFCCC\} and domestic adaptation decision making forums, to increase the diversity of adaptation options available to smallholders, and ultimately, to improve the attribution of responsibility for adaptation outcomes.

At the centre of these changes are smallholder coffee producers, responsible for 80% of global coffee production. Although rural households are known to depend on more than agricultural production alone, the literature on specialty coffee and certification has rather narrowly focused on coffee income and production. In this study, broader impacts are explicitly taken into account. Household income was decomposed into categories corresponding to specific income-generating activities and coffee income was broken down into price, yield and area effects. Results show that coffee certification encourages farmers to specialise in coffee production, increasing coffee income but not total household income, at least not in the short run. The time and effort required to attain the higher coffee income offered by certified production means farmers have to give up other activities. This substitution effect cancels out the income effect, such that there is no increase in total household income. The lack of an effect on total household income suggests the return to the additional labour effort required for certified coffee production is not higher than in other activities, questioning the benefits of certification for small-scale producers.

The chiller was built using brazed plate heat exchangers in all its components, including the absorber and the generator. A test campaign was carried out varying the thermal load in the chilled water circuit and keeping the hot and cooling water temperatures constant. Part-load curves of the thermal and electrical coefficients of performance were obtained, plotted and compared with data from the literature on small capacity absorption chillers with conventional working pairs, namely ammonia/water and water/lithium bromide. The experimental results showed that to achieve a higher electrical coefficient of performance at part-load operation, it was much more convenient to use an ON-OFF control than to modify the hot water temperature. Furthermore, using a simple ON-OFF control strategy, the behaviour of the new absorption chiller was more agile and responded more quickly. The part-load curve of the electrical coefficient of performance was obtained by adjusting the experimental data to the shape of the curve proposed in the standard prEN-14825:2011 for air-to-water chillers. The Cc coefficient was 0.7985 matching the value obtained dividing the remaining electrical consumption measured during the \{OFF\} half cycles by the total energy consumption generated. "

However, reports of substantial yield increases and phenotypic changes resulting from \{SRI\} management have been challenged on various grounds in the scientific literature. The debate has been among the most contentious in recent agronomic forums, although it has been receding in recent years as evidence continues to accumulate. This paper reviews information now available in the scientific literature that supports the multiple agronomic, plant physiologic, and soil microbiologic foundations for the reported \{SRI\} performance, and discusses how these effects are becoming even more relevant in the context of changing climates.

The \{PLAR\} process was also used to improve the participatory skills and tools of research and extension personnel to support this process. The farming systems of the area were characterised for socio-economic and biophysical conditions that included social organisations, wealth categories, gender, crop, soil, agro forestry and livestock production. Farmers identified soil fertility constraints, their indicators, and causes of soil fertility decline, and suggested strategies to address the problem of soil fertility decline. Soil fertility management diversity among households indicated that most farmers were not carrying out any improved soil fertility management practices, despite previous research and dissemination in the area. Following the diagnosis stage and exposure visits to other farmer groups working on integrated soil fertility projects, the farmers designed 11 experiments for on-farm testing. One hundred and twenty farmers then chose, for participatory technology development, sub-sets of these 11 experiments, based on the major agricultural constraints and the potential solutions identified and prioritised by the farmers. Quantitative and qualitative results from the testing, farmer evaluation and adaptation, training, dissemination strategies and socio-economic implications of these technologies are discussed. "

The goal of this research was to assess the extent to which farmers have incorporated their observations of native species and ecological processes into farm management practices in a hillside agroforestry system of western Honduras. The system incorporates slash-and-mulch of native vegetation (rather than slash-and-burn cultivation, which was widely practiced in the area before 1990), and the retention of trees within cropping fields. Information on farmer knowledge was elicited primarily through semi-structured interviews with 20 farmers. Farmers interviewed distinguish several local soil types on the basis of soil texture, colour, structure and stone content, with each soil type having varying suitability for the major crops grown in the district (maize, beans, sorghum and pasture). The most highly valued tree species are those that fulfil multiple economic and agricultural functions, including having a positive influence on soil quality through decomposition, nutrient cycling, and provision of soil cover. In particular, species with small, fine leaves that gave dappled shade (rather than solid shade) and decomposed rapidly were preferred. Farmers named 16 commonly recognised, distinct soil macrofauna taxa. The most detailed knowledge on the relationship between soil fauna and soil quality was held on taxa considered to have either beneficial or harmful effects on farming activities, such as earthworms and beetle larvae. Farmers had complex understanding of the influence of fire on soils, vegetation, crop yield and soil biota over various lengths of time, which may have been gained through a combination of first-hand experience, interaction with agricultural extension workers, and information gained from other farmers. It is likely that local ecological knowledge of the effect of different species on soil quality, the interactions among species, and the role of vegetation in maintaining agricultural productivity and landscape integrity, is an important component of the adoption and success of the agroforestry system.

Changes in soil pH, total nitrogen (Ntot), organic carbon (Corg), water soluble carbon (WSC), microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) and nitrogen (Nmic) were measured under different cropping systems. Cropping sequence has no significant (P &gt; 0.05) effect on soil pH and Corg, while \{WSC\} increased significantly when maize followed \{IT\} 96D-724 (100%), SAMPEA-7 (95%), \{TGx\} 1448-2E (79%) and SAMSOY-2 (106%) compared with continuous maize. On average, legume rotation caused 23% increase in Ntot relative to continuous maize. The Cmic and Nmic values were significantly affected by cropping sequence. The highest values were found in legume–maize rotation and the lowest values were found in fallow–maize and continuous maize. On average, Cmic made up to 4.8% of Corg and Nmic accounted for 4.4% of Ntot under different cropping systems. Maize grain yield increased significantly following legumes and had strong positive correlation with Cmic and Nmic suggesting that they are associated with yield increases due to other rotation effects. Negative correlation of grain yield with Cmic:Nmic and Corg:Ntot indicate that high C:N ratios contribute to nitrogen immobilization in the soil and are detrimental to crop productivity. The results showed that integration of grain legumes will reverse this process and ensure maintenance of soil quality and maize crop yield, which on average, increased by 68% and 49% following soybean and cowpea, respectively compared to continuous maize.

The use of mineral N fertilizer was found to be profitable with economically optimal rates of 40 and 80 kg N ha−1 for more intensively managed homestead fields and less intensively managed bush fields respectively. Agronomic N use efficiency varied from 21 to 37 kg grain kg−1 N for the homestead fields and from 15 to 49 kg grain kg−1 N in the bush fields. Simulated grain yield for homestead fields at 40 kg N ha−1 application was equal to yield for bush fields at 80 kg N ha−1. Water use efficiency generally increased with increased mineral N rate and was greater for the homestead fields compared with the bush fields. Grain yield per unit of cumulative evapo-transpiration (simulated) was consistently higher compared with yield per unit of cumulative precipitation for the season, probably because of runoff and deep percolation. In the simulation experiment, grain yield variability was less with mineral N application and under higher soil fertility (organic matter) condition. Application of mineral N reduced variability in yield from a \{CV\} of 37 to 11% in the bush farm and from 17 to 7% in the homestead fields. The use of mineral fertilizer and encouraging practices that retain organic matter to the soil provide a more sustainable system for ensuring crop production and hence food security. "

We used on-farm data on manure excreted and manure management, experimental results, literature and fuzzy logic to model losses during manure storage. The model was used to analyse N cycling efficiency (NCE) within smallholder farms in western Kenya. Simulations showed that manure management during collection and storage had a large effect on the efficiency of C and nutrient retention. Differences in \{NCE\} between farmers of different wealth classes arose due to differences in resource endowment. For poorer farmers, large N losses occur at all stages of manure recycling. Urinary-N losses occurred on all farms but their impact on \{NCE\} for poor and medium-class farmers was larger due to the smaller amount of N recycled. With current management the poor farmer recovered &lt; 1 kg N y− 1 in composted manure from 15 kg N y− 1 excreted. Improved manure storage had little effect on increasing overall \{NCE\} for the poor farmer due to large losses before storage. For the wealthier farmer improvement of manure storage increased \{NCE\} and allowed recycling of 30% of N excreted (ca. 30 kg N y− 1) with small investment in infrastructure. Covering manure heaps with a polythene film reduced mass and N losses considerably. For the poor to increase overall NCE, investment in cattle housing and recycling of urinary-N is required. Increasing cattle numbers or improved feeding would have a larger effect on manure availability but this is constrained by feed scarcity and investment capacity. The absolute amounts of N recycled (1–6, 4–17 and 7–18 kg N y− 1 for poor, medium and wealthier farmers) were small compared with maize N demand (&gt; 50 kg N ha− 1), but significant given the small farm sizes (0.1–1.1 ha). Although absolute amounts of N recycled with improved manure management may have little immediate impact on crop productivity, manure is often the only input available. Manure provides other nutrients for crops and maintains soil organic matter — both vital to guarantee efficient use of fertiliser N — which justifies the search for interventions to assist farmers make better use of manure.

Recent studies demonstrated the association of a plethora of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) with yam, soil microorganisms crucial for natural soil fertility. Thus, inoculation of yam with \{AMF\} could help reverse declining yields, above all in soils with a strong loss of \{AMF\} diversity due to agricultural land use intensification. In a pot experiment, we studied the impact of indigenous and exotic \{AMF\} isolates on growth performance of micro-propagated white yam plantlets (Dioscorea rotundata, cv.TDr89/02461). Pots were inoculated with single spore derived isolates of Glomus etunicatum, originating from tropical environments in West Africa, South America and Asia and, for comparison, also with three isolates of other \{AMF\} species from temperate Europe. In addition, isolates of nine \{AMF\} species originating from sub-Saharan West Africa and three commercial \{AMF\} were compared. Six of the 11 isolates of G. etunicatum from the tropics increased yam tuber growth compared with non-mycorrhizal controls, whereas the European \{AMF\} species tended to be less efficient but led to an increased tuber phosphorus concentration. The African isolates of G. mosseae, G. hoi, G. etunicatum, Acaulospora scrobiculata and A. spinosa generally led to increased tuber growth compared with non-mycorrhizal controls, while isolates of G. sinuosum and Kuklospora kentinensis did not. Our study indicates that inoculation of micro-propagated yam plantlets with selected indigenous \{AMF\} could potentially constitute a sustainable measure to boost yam productivity again in degraded African soils.

Millsp.] is a versatile, stress-tolerant, and nutritious grain legume, possessing traits of value for enhancing the sustainability of dry sub-tropical and tropical agricultural systems. The use of crop wild relatives (CWR) in pigeonpea breeding has been successful in providing important resistance, quality, and breeding efficiency traits to the crop. Current breeding objectives for pigeonpea include increasing its tolerance to abiotic stresses, including heat, cold, drought, and waterlogging. Here we assess the potential for pigeonpea \{CWR\} to be further employed in crop improvement by compiling wild species occurrence and ex situ conservation information, producing geographic distribution models for the species, identifying gaps in the comprehensiveness of current germplasm collections, and using ecogeographic information to identify \{CWR\} populations with the potential to contribute agronomic traits of priority to breeders. The fifteen prioritized relatives of pigeonpea generally occur in South and Southeast Asia to Australia, with the highest concentrations of species in southern India and northern Australia. These taxa differ considerably among themselves and in comparison to the crop in their adaptations to temperature, precipitation and edaphic conditions. We find that these wild genetic resources are broadly under-represented in ex situ conservation systems, with 80% of species assessed as high priority for further collecting, thus their availability to plant breeders is insufficient. We identify species and highlight geographic locations for further collecting in order to improve the completeness of pigeonpea \{CWR\} germplasm collections, with particular emphasis on potential traits for abiotic stress tolerance.

One such approach integrates biophysical modeling with economic modeling to explore the combined effects of climate stresses and future socioeconomic trends, thus providing a more accurate picture of how agriculture and the food system may be affected in the coming decades. We review and analyze the literature on this structural approach and present a case study that follows this methodology, explicitly modeling drought and heat tolerant crop varieties. We show that yield gains from adoption of these varieties differ by technology and region, but are generally comparable in scale to (and thus able to offset) adverse effects of climate change. However, yield increases over the projection period are dominated by the effects of growth in population, income, and general productivity, highlighting the importance of joint assessment of biophysical and socioeconomic drivers to better understand climate impacts and responses.

Survival at 2 years was 73.5% at Bacalar, 72% at Noh Bec, but only 20% after 6 months for several replicates at Zoh Laguna.

For both villages smallholder capacity for future \{REDD\} + project adoption was found to require reinforcement to guarantee local feasibility of \{REDD\} + projects. Possibilities to encourage already in use agroforestry systems under a \{REDD\} + scheme are discussed.

Moreover, each flower type was characterized as specially associated with two \{RAPD\} bands. \{UPGMA\} dendrograms based on \{RAPD\} and \{AFLP\} data, showed the majority of the cultivars from flower type I and flower type \{II\} clustering together. Finally 101 \{RAPD\} markers and 220 \{AFLP\} markers were used to construct a neighbor-joining dendrogram. This showed that the 37 cultivars could be classified into six distinct clusters, between which the similarity coefficient was as low as 0.00–0.55, even though the cultivars were morphologically very similar. The remaining two cultivars namely ‘Smathers’ and ‘Maltby’ were found genetically very distant from the other cultivars in RAPD, \{AFLP\} or combined \{RAPD\} and \{AFLP\} based dendrograms.

Rice (Oryza spp.) is a promising crop for farming in floodplains because of its high adaptability to a wide range of water environments. On the other hand, there is great variation in soil fertility and water availability even in a small area within a floodplain. Hence, we evaluated 27 rice genotypes in four fields in three years in a floodplain of the Northern Region of Ghana to investigate genotype × environment (G × E) interactions for rice yield and to identify stable, high-yielding genotypes. The genotypes consisted of O. sativa, O. glaberrima and New Rice for Africa (NERICA), and many were selected for their reported submergence resistance because of the anticipated submergence damage in the floodplain. There were large variations in yield, which ranged from 0.14 to 5.35 t ha−1 depending on the location within a floodplain, genotype and year, and there were significant genotype, environment and G × E interaction effects on yield, accounting for 24.8%, 20.2%, and 28.2%, respectively, of the total variation. The results suggested that selection of suitable location with high soil fertility and low risk of submergence is necessary to achieve high yield in a floodplain. In addition, early sowing would be effective high-yielding crop management, which reduced the risk of submergence-induced damage just after sowing and secured sufficient growth duration to achieve high yield. Genotype \{IR42\} showed the highest average yield among environments, but its yield stability was low. On the other hand, several genotypes including Amankwatia, a local aromatic cultivar adapted to irrigated and lowland environments, and IRBL9-W[RL], a blast-tolerant variety containing the Sub1 gene for submergence tolerance, showed high, stable yield. To put these results to practical use in other floodplain areas in West Africa, physiological mechanisms causing G × E interaction for rice yield should be further studied. "

The study has identified TiO2/Fe3O4's bactericidal effect to marine fish pathogen (Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida BCRC17065) in seawater. The \{SEM\} photo reveals the surface destruction in bacteria incubated with blue \{LED\} irradiated TiO2/Fe3O4. The result of this study indicates that 1) TiO2/Fe3O4 acquires photocatalytic activities in both the freshwater and the seawater via blue \{LED\} irradiation, 2) higher photocatalytic activities appear in solutions of higher TiO2/Fe3O4 mole ratio, and 3) photocatalytic activity decreases as salinity increases.

By comparing baseline and policy scenario results from two integrated assessment partial equilibrium models TIAM-ECN and \{GCAM\} and two general equilibrium models Phoenix and MEG4C, we provide an indication of future developments and dynamics in the Colombian energy system. Currently, the carbon intensity of the energy system in Colombia is low compared to other countries in Latin America. However, this trend may change given the projected rapid growth of the economy and the potential increase in the use of carbon-based technologies. Climate policy in Colombia is under development and has yet to consider economic instruments such as taxes and abatement targets. This paper shows how taxes or abatement targets can achieve significant \{CO2\} reductions in Colombia. Though abatement may be achieved through different pathways, taxes and targets promote the entry of cleaner energy sources into the market and reduce final energy demand through energy efficiency improvements and other demand-side responses. The electric power sector plays an important role in achieving \{CO2\} emission reductions in Colombia, through the increase of hydropower, the introduction of wind technologies, and the deployment of biomass, coal and natural gas with \{CO2\} capture and storage (CCS). Uncertainty over the prevailing mitigation pathway reinforces the importance of climate policy to guide sectors toward low-carbon technologies. This paper also assesses the economy-wide implications of mitigation policies such as potential losses in \{GDP\} and consumption. An assessment of the legal, institutional, social and environmental barriers to economy-wide mitigation policies is critical yet beyond the scope of this paper. "

We previously reported \{AChE\} in Zea mays L. might be related to gravitropism based on pharmacological study using an \{AChE\} inhibitor. Here we clearly demonstrate plant \{AChE\} play an important role as a positive regulator in the gravity response of plants based on a genetic study. First, the gene encoding a second component of the ACh-mediated signal transduction system, \{AChE\} was cloned from rice, Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica cv. Nipponbare. The rice \{AChE\} shared high homology with maize, siratro and Salicornia AChEs. Similar to animal and other plant AChEs, the rice \{AChE\} hydrolyzed acetylthiocholine and propionylthiocholine, but not butyrylthiocholine. Thus, the rice \{AChE\} might be characterized as an \{AChE\} (E.C.3.1.1.7). Similar to maize and siratro AChEs, the rice \{AChE\} exhibited low sensitivity to the \{AChE\} inhibitor, neostigmine bromide, compared with the electric eel AChE. Next, the functionality of rice \{AChE\} was proved by overexpression in rice plants. The rice \{AChE\} was localized in extracellular spaces of rice plants. Further, the rice \{AChE\} mRNA and its activity were mainly detected during early developmental stages (2 d–10 d after sowing). Finally, by comparing \{AChE\} up-regulated plants with wild-type, we found that \{AChE\} overexpression causes an enhanced gravitropic response. This result clearly suggests that the function of the rice \{AChE\} relate to positive regulation of gravitropic response in rice seedlings. "

Using data from Indonesia, we show that the choice of a forest definition can have a large impact on estimates of deforestation and forest degradation areas, on assessment of drivers of deforestation and on the development of a REL. The total area of deforestation between 2000 and 2009 was 4.9 million ha when using the \{FAO\} definition, 18% higher when using a ‘natural forest definition’ and 27% higher when using the national definition. Using the national and natural forest definitions, large areas (&gt;50%) were classified as shrubland after deforestation. We used regression models to predict future deforestation. Deforestation was much better predicted than degradation (R2 of 0.81 vs. 0.52), with the natural forest definition giving the best prediction. Apart from historical deforestation and initial forest cover, gross domestic product and human population were important predictors of future deforestation in Indonesia. Degradation processes were less well modeled and predictions relied on estimates of historical degradation and forest cover. "

Many tropical forests are exploited both commercially for timber and by forest-dependent communities for non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Divergences between these two uses may have significant implications for forest-dependent livelihoods. This article gathers existing examples of conflicts and complementarities between selective logging and non-timber uses of forest from the livelihood perspective. Additionally it draws on three case studies from Brazil, Cameroon and Indonesia to examine by what mechanisms, and to what extent, logging impacts forest resources of livelihood importance, as well as to consider how factors such as logging regime and forest management system may mediate such influences. By doing so we aim to shed further light on a relatively unacknowledged issue in tropical forest management and conservation. Four specific mechanisms were identified; conflict of use and the indirect impacts of logging being those most commonly implicated in negative effects on livelihood-relevant NTFPs. Eighty two percent of reviewed articles highlighted negative impacts on \{NTFP\} availability. Examples of positive impacts were restricted to light demanding species that respond to the opening of forest structure and typically represent a small subset of those of livelihood value. Despite considerable impacts on livelihoods, in all three case studies we found evidence to support the potential for enhanced compatibility between timber extraction and the subsistence use of NTFPs. Drawing on this evidence, and findings from our review, we make specific recommendations for research, policy and management implementation. These findings have significant implications for reconciling timber and non-timber uses of tropical forests. "

The hyperspectral data were gathered for shrubs, grasses, weeds, and agricultural crop species from the four ecoregions of African savannas using a 1-nm-wide hand-held spectroradiometer but was aggregated to 10-nm-wide bandwidths to match the first spaceborne hyperspectral sensor, Hyperion. After accounting for atmospheric widows and/or areas of significant noise, a total of 168 narrowbands in 400–2500 nm was used in the analysis. Rigorous data mining techniques consisting of principal component analysis (PCA), lambda–lambda \{R2\} models (LL R2M), stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA), and derivative greenness vegetation indices (DGVI) established 22 optimal bands (in 400–2500 nm spectral range) that best characterize and classify vegetation and agricultural crops. Overall accuracies of over 90% were attained when the 13–22 best narrowbands were used in classifying vegetation and agricultural crop species. Beyond 22 bands, accuracies only increase marginally up to 30 bands. Accuracies become asymptotic or near zero beyond 30 bands, rendering 138 of the 168 narrowbands redundant in extracting vegetation and agricultural crop information. Relative to Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) broadbands, the best hyperspectral narrowbands provided an increased accuracy of 9–43% when classifying shrubs, weeds, grasses, and agricultural crop species.

For this purpose, Hyperion, ALI, IKONOS, and ETM+ data were acquired for southern Cameroon, a region considered to be a representative area for tropical moist evergreen and semi-deciduous forests. Field data, collected in near-real time to coincide with satellite sensor overpass, were used to (1) quantify and model the biomass of tree, shrub, and weed species; and (2) characterize forest land use/land cover (LULC) classes. The study established that even the most advanced broadband sensors (i.e., ETM+, IKONOS, and ALI) had serious limitations in modeling biomass and in classifying forest \{LULC\} classes. The broadband models explained only 13–60% of the variability in biomass across primary forests, secondary forests, and fallows. The overall accuracies were between 42% and 51% for classifying nine complex rainforest \{LULC\} classes using the broadband data of these sensors. Within individual vegetation types (e.g., primary or secondary forest), the overall accuracies increased slightly, but followed a similar trend. Among the broadband sensors, \{ALI\} sensor performed better than the \{IKONOS\} and ETM+ sensors. When compared to the three broadband sensors, Hyperion narrowband data produced (1) models that explained 36–83% more of the variability in rainforest biomass, and (2) \{LULC\} classifications with 45–52% higher overall accuracies. Twenty-three Hyperion narrowbands that were most sensitive in modeling forest biomass and in classifying forest \{LULC\} classes were identified and discussed. "

A continuous maize production system was compared with crop sequence systems, in which maize followed a grain legume (cowpea, soybean), cover crop (mucuna, pigeon pea) or a bush fallow. Compared to the continuous maize cropping system, maize in the crop sequence with legume and fallow systems had significantly higher leaf and stem nitrogen content at 35 and 63 days after planting (DAP), respectively. Differences in K and P at 35 and 63 DAP, and of N in stem and grain at harvest were not significant. Maize in the rotation systems had 1.5–2 times more borers per plant compared to the continuous maize production systems, particularly at the early stages of maize growth. At 63 DAP, larval mortalities were 1.4–1.5 higher in rotation systems than in the continuous maize system. As a result, dead-hearts and tunnel length did not vary significantly among treatments. In the insecticide protected plots, when comparing with the maize–maize cropping system, average grain yields were increased by 15.1–24.6% and 30.3–42.5% in crop sequences of grain legumes with maize and cover crops fallow systems, respectively. However, grain yield losses due to borers were 1.9–3.1 times higher in the continuous maize production system than in the crop sequences of grain legumes with maize and 4.5–11.1 times higher compared to maize after cover crops. It is concluded that an increased nutritional status of the plants lead to an increase in borer attacks at the early stage of plant growth, but also to improved plant vigour, resulting finally in a net benefit for the plant and grain yield.

Nonetheless, recent research shows that degradation continues at alarming rates. In this paper we address an important challenge faced by protected area management, namely, the design of a cost-effective incentive scheme that balances local demand for subsistence non-timber forest products against conservation interests. Using primary data collected from 369 randomly selected farm-households we combine a farm-household classification with mathematical programming in order to estimate the opportunity costs of conserving the Kakamega Forest and restricting access to non-timber forest product resources. We validate our model and analyze the impact of changes in major economic frame conditions on our results before we derive recommendations for an improved protected area management in the study region. Our findings suggest that a more flexible approach to determining the price of recently established forest product extraction permits would greatly enhance management efficiency without significantly compromising local wellbeing.

abstract = "Abstract Ongoing increases in the human population necessitate that rice will continue to be a critical aspect of food security for the twenty-first century. While production must increase in the coming decades to meet demand, such increases will be accompanied by diminished natural resources and rising production costs that will alter how rice is grown and managed. Such resource constraints are the impetus for the ongoing transition from traditional flooding and transplanting to direct-seeded rice (DSR). However, such a transition can result in an increase in pest pressures, especially weeds. Rice production can be particularly vulnerable to weed competition, with significant yield losses (i.e., &gt;50%) occurring. Among pernicious weeds, weedy (red) rice (Oryza sativa L.) is increasingly recognized as a major constraint in achieving maximum yield in DSR. Weedy rice is congeneric to crop rice with phenotypic similarity; hence, its ability to negatively influence qualitative and quantitative aspects of production is substantial. As rice will continue to serve as a cornerstone for future food security and sustainability, a comprehensive assessment of weedy rice impacts associated with increasing adoption of \{DSR\} is both timely and critical. In this chapter, we examine the biological basis for the competitive ability of weedy rice, including its evolution, ecophysiology, and genetics; quantify spatial–temporal shifts in its distribution and spread; and emphasize and outline a number of regional and global management strategies for its detection and control. Lastly, a number of critical research areas are suggested that deserve additional scrutiny with respect to weedy rice management. "

The technology has been disseminated through different pathways each of which might have different uptake enhancement capabilities. This study was concerned with how different dissemination pathways impacted on farmers’ time to adoption while controlling the effects of selected socio-economic and regional factors. This assessment was necessary in order to recommend which dissemination pathway or combination of pathways that could provide an effective dissemination strategy that speed up adoption, while ensuring continued practice of the technology. Data were analyzed using a parametric (Weibull) functional form to specify time to adoption from the first date of a farmer being aware of the technology. The findings indicate positive duration dependence and a positive rate of change in the adoption process. Field days (FD) had the highest effect on the speed of uptake, followed by Farmer Teachers (FT). Other variables that accelerated adoption were education, household size and high-income level. Gender, Tropical Livestock Units (TLUs), group membership, and district dummy variables had delaying effects on the adoption process. The findings suggest the need to fast track the scale up and uptake of \{PPT\} through pathways which allow for interactive information sharing and learning as exemplified through farmer teachers and field days.

This study evaluated effects of different arable land-use systems on soil aggregation and associated composition and total diversity of bacteria and fungi. For this purpose, 5- and 3-year-old field trials were selected, two in sub-humid (orthic Acrisols and oxidic Ferralsols) and one in semi-arid (chromic Cambisol) region in Kenya. The treatments included combinations of tillage (conventional tillage [CT] and reduced tillage [RT]), crop residue management (0 and 2 t ha−1 maize stover) and cropping systems (continuous maize, maize–soybean intercropping and rotation) in the sub-humid sites, and of different tillage (CT, no-till and tied-ridging) and organic fertilization management (manure and crop residue) in semi-arid Kenya. The innovativeness of this study is the research in tropical soils where the concept of aggregate hierarchy is not generally accepted yet. The results showed that aggregate mean weight diameter (MWD) at 0–15 cm depths had increased from 19 to 34% under \{RT\} relative to \{CT\} management (P &lt; 0.05). Crop residue additions also significantly increased \{MWD\} by 22% at the top 5 cm (P &lt; 0.01) compared to treatments without residue in oxidic Ferralsols. At all the three sites, tillage resulted in greatest shifts of bacterial and fungal community composition, while cropping system had largest positive effect on the total microbial diversity indices. Total microbial diversity indices as well as \{MWD\} were higher in soybean–maize intercropping systems than under rotation or continuous maize cropping. Changes in total bacterial diversity related inversely to changes in the amount of free silt + clay, while fungal diversity related inversely to the contents of soil macro-aggregates &gt;2 mm (P &lt; 0.05). We conclude that \{RT\} plus supply of organic resources and intercropping are best strategies to increase total diversity of soil bacteria and fungi and improve soil structure in these tropical soils.

A combination of models was used to analyse land use and labour allocation strategies for optimizing income for wealthy (2.5 ha with eight cattle) and poor (0.9 ha without cattle) farms in Murewa, Zimbabwe. Trade-offs between profitability, labour use and partial nutrient balances were also evaluated for alternative resource management strategies. Farm data were captured using the Integrated Modelling Platform for Mixed Animal-Crop Systems (IMPACT), which was directly linked to the Household Resource use Optimization Model (HROM). \{HROM\} was applied to optimize net cash income within the constraints specific to the households. Effects of alternative nutrient resource management strategies in crop and milk production were simulated using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and \{RUMINANT\} models, respectively, and the output evaluated using HROM. The poor farm had a net income of US$ 1 yr−1 and the farmer relied on selling unskilled labour to supplement her income. The poor farm’s income was marginally increased by US$18 yr−1 and the soil nitrogen (N) balance was increased from 6 to 9 kg ha−1 yr−1 by expanding groundnut production from the previous 5–25% of the land area. Further increases in area allocated to groundnut production were constrained by lack of labour. On the poor farm, maize production was most profitable when cultivated on a reduced land area with optimal weeding. The wealthy farm had a maize-dominated cropping system that yielded a net cash balance of US$290 yr−1, mainly from the sale of crop produce. Net income could be increased to US$1175 yr−1, by re-allocating the 240 hired labour-days more efficiently, although this reallocation substantially reduced partial soil N and phosphorus (P) balances by 74 kg N ha−1 and 11 kg P ha−1, respectively, resulting in negative nutrient balances. Few opportunities existed to increase productivity and income of the smallholder farms without inducing negative nutrient balances. On the wealthy farm, groundnut was the least profitable crop; shifting its production to the most fertile field did not improve income unless the groundnut residues were fed to lactating cows. The analysis carried out in this paper highlights the need to develop practical technological recommendations and development interventions that consider farm resource endowment (land, fertilizers, manure and labour), variability in soil fertility within farms and competing resource use options.

Genetic improvement of the crop is hindered by very low seed set and poor seed germination. The objective of this study was to compare seed set, seed quality and embryo rescue rates of hybrid seeds obtained from 20 East African highland banana cultivars crossed with a fertile diploid species, Musa acuminata spp. burmannicoides ‘Calcutta 4’, as a male parent. There was great variation in seed set, seed quality and in vitro embryo germination rates among the cultivars. Although 72% (range = 47–88%) of the seeds appeared normal externally characterized by black hard integuments, only 59% (range = 35–81%) contained embryos, of which 9% (range = 0–22%) germinated. This study demonstrated that hard-seededness alone does not signify the presence of an embryo and should not be regarded as a measure of seed fertility in East African highland bananas. Cultivars ‘Entukura’, ‘Enzirabahima’ and ‘Kabucuragye’ of the ‘Nfuuka’ clone set were superior in terms of seed set, presence of seeds with embryos and culturability of embryos. These cultivars are recommended as female parents for a crossing program in the improvement of East African highland bananas. The low embryo rescue rates suggest that hybrid seeds derived from East African highland banana possess factors that cause high embryo abortion. This may be ascribed to endosperm breakdown, which can release toxins. "

The same model simulates the mass number dynamics of each plant or animal species in each patch and the movement of animals between patches. Movement is based on species specific supply–demand relations. The pathogen mortality rate is a simple function of rainfall intensity. The within-patch species composition, their initial densities, and the initial values of edaphic variables may be assigned stochastically. Sensitivity, graphical and multiple linear regression analyses are used to summarize the effects of spatial and resource heterogeneity on species dynamics. Important plant level effects on higher trophic levels are demonstrated, and recommendations are made as to the appropriate model for different ecological studies. "

However, their utilisation is hampered by a lack of systematic conservation which in turn is due to a lack of clarity over their identity. We used gene pool and taxon group concepts to estimate \{CWR\} relatedness for 173 priority crops to create the Harlan and de Wet inventory of globally important \{CWR\} taxa. Further taxa more remotely related to crops were added if they have historically been found to have useful traits for crop improvement. The inventory contains 1667 taxa, divided between 37 families, 108 genera, 1392 species and 299 sub-specific taxa. The region with the highest number of priority \{CWR\} is western Asia with 262 taxa, followed by China with 222 and southeastern Europe with 181. Within the primary gene pool, 242 taxa were found to be under-represented in ex situ collections and the countries identified as the highest priority for further germplasm collection are China, Mexico and Brazil.

Flavi and the level of aflatoxin contamination in 91 maize samples from farms and markets in Nigeria and Ghana. Aspergillus spp. were recovered from 61/91 maize samples and aflatoxins \{B1\} and/or \{B2\} occurred in 36/91 samples. Three samples from the farms also contained aflatoxin \{G1\} and/or G2. Farm samples were more highly contaminated than were samples from the market, in terms of both the percentage of the samples contaminated and the level of mycotoxin contamination. One-hundred-and-thirty-five strains representative of the 1163 strains collected were identified by using a multilocus sequence analysis of portions of the genes encoding calmodulin, β-tubulin and actin, and evaluated for aflatoxin production. Of the 135 strains, there were 110 – Aspergillus flavus, 20 – Aspergillus tamarii, 2 – Aspergillus wentii, 2 – Aspergillus flavofurcatus, and 1 – Aspergillus parvisclerotigenus. Twenty-five of the A. flavus strains and the A. parvisclerotigenus strain were the only strains that produced aflatoxins. The higher contamination of the farm than the market samples suggests that the aflatoxin exposure of rural farmers is even higher than previously estimated based on reported contamination of market samples. The relative infrequency of the A. flavus \{SBG\} strains, producing small sclerotia and high levels of both aflatoxins (B and G), suggests that long-term chronic exposure to this mycotoxin are a much higher health risk in West Africa than is the acute toxicity due to very highly contaminated maize in east Africa.

Both percent fruit occupation and abundance of A. guerreronis and N. paspalivorus varied across sampling months as well as among coconut plantations and fruit age classes. Both parameters peaked in the middle of the rainy season and at the end of the dry season.

The two species reached their peak abundance (1512 A. guerreronis and 2.3 N. paspalivorus per fruit) on 3 months-old fruits. Peak percent fruit occupation by A. guerreronis (∼70%) occurred after 4.3 months, which was ∼0.7 months earlier than that by N. paspalivorus (∼22%). Difficulties encountered by the predators in accessing the area beneath the perianth on the very young fruits allowed A. guerreronis a head-start in population build-up leading to strongly diverging population curves as a function of fruit age (higher population increase compared to N. paspalivorus). Protecting the very young fruits from A. guerreronis colonization should be a key issue for developing successful control strategies of this pest. "

Microbes play a pivotal role both in the process of soil fertility restoration and in nutrient acquisition by the crops. Here we ask the question how the duration of fallow affects the composition of indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities and their contribution to maize nutrition and growth, in acidic, low P soils of southern Cameroon. This question has been addressed in a bioassay where soils collected from continuously cropped fields, short-term fallows dominated by Chromolaena odorata and long-term fallows (secondary forests) have been sterilized and back- and cross inoculated with living soils from the different land-use systems. Particular microbes larger than the pore size of the filter paper (mainly the fungi including the AMF) contained in the cropped and short-fallowed soils caused greater growth and P uptake stimulations to the maize as compared to the forest soil. By using molecular profiling, we demonstrated a shift in the composition of \{AMF\} communities along a gradient of fallow duration, changing from dominance by Rhizophagus in the forest fallow soil, to dominance by Claroideoglomus under cropland. Our results contradict the hypothesis that deterioration of quality of root symbiotic communities would be responsible for a rapid yield decline following deforestation, and indicate a positive feedback of cropping on mycorrhizal functioning under conditions of shifting agriculture in tropical Africa.

Results indicated that the leaf laminas were poor candidates for shoot induction whereas the petioles showed potential for adventitious shoot production at frequencies of 2.8–11.1% in two of the cultivars tested. Stem nodal segments were the most responsive among the three as shoots formed directly following the \{TDZ\} treatment at frequencies of 16.7–41.7% depending on the cultivar. When comparing the effectiveness of different cytokinins to induce shoot proliferation on stem nodal segments, it was found that the 0.5 and 1 mg l−1 of kinetin (Kn) and 6-benzyladenine (BA) treatments resulted in higher shoot formation percentages compared to the 0.5 and 1 mg l−1 of \{TDZ\} treatments in two of the three cultivars. Furthermore, more shoots were produced on \{BA\} than on Kn-supplemented media in all the three cultivars. Shoots derived from the 0.5 mg l−1 of \{BA\} treatment can be induced to root following one month incubation with 0.1–1 mg l−1 of indole-3-butyric-acid (IBA). The rooted shoots showed 100% survival after acclimatization in the greenhouse.

However, most of the women are satisfied with the different cultivars of plantain available in urban markets, and with their general quality characteristics respective to the final use. Finally, the study found that most women consider that chemical fertilisers have a negative impact on plantain quality. The second part of the paper analyses prices, preferences, and consumption habits of urban households regarding the main starchy products. Plantain and yam are actually the most expensive products in terms of price per energy unit (kcal), compared to rice, cassava or maize. Plantain is the preferred staple for most households, but a higher level of consumption is constrained by family budgets.

A disadvantage of traditional \{GE\} is that it tends to select the most significant input variables and may become trapped in a local optimum. The \{IGE\} adequately manages the large input dimensionality by incrementally expanding the search depth. From three \{IGE\} runs, we extracted four significant input variables from 15 input variables, including watershed chemical loads, precipitation, inflow, and outflow, and expressed them appropriately in a sophisticated mathematical manner with accepted complexity. The IGE-derived equation yields the optimal predictive capability, especially for peak total phosphorous (TP) values, compared to traditional multilinear regression (MLR) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) models. The sensitivity analyses reconfirm the effectiveness of the selected variables in the nonlinear mathematical equations. Although \{BPNN\} and \{IGE\} demonstrate similar performances, we preferred the latter because of its transparency in providing a formula with measurable parameters. After obtaining the IGE-derived model, a Macro-evolutionary Genetic Algorithm (MEGA) was applied to enhance searching efficiency and genetic diversity during optimization, and subsequently deduced the reduction rates of \{TP\} loads from various input sources to achieve the water quality requirement of the reservoir. This practice benefits the reservoir management by revealing the forcing functions that are manageable to prevent reservoir eutrophication. "

The initial focus on the pathological effects usually accompanying infection by viroids soon shifted to their molecular features—they are circular molecules that fold upon themselves adopting compact secondary conformations—and then to how they manipulate their hosts to be propagated. Replication of viroids—in the nucleus or chloroplasts through a rolling-circle mechanism involving polymerization, cleavage and circularization of \{RNA\} strands—dealt three surprises: (i) certain \{RNA\} polymerases are redirected to accept \{RNA\} instead of their \{DNA\} templates, (ii) cleavage in chloroplastic viroids is not mediated by host enzymes but by hammerhead ribozymes, and (iii) circularization in nuclear viroids is catalyzed by a \{DNA\} ligase redirected to act upon \{RNA\} substrates. These enzymes (and ribozymes) are most probably assisted by host proteins, including transcription factors and \{RNA\} chaperones. Movement of viroids, first intracellularly and then to adjacent cells and distal plant parts, has turned out to be a tightly regulated process in which specific \{RNA\} structural motifs play a crucial role. More recently, the advent of \{RNA\} silencing has brought new views on how viroids may cause disease and on how their hosts react to contain the infection; additionally, viroid infection may be restricted by other mechanisms. Representing the lowest step on the biological size scale, viroids have also attracted considerable interest to get a tentative picture of the essential characteristics of the primitive replicons that populated the postulated \{RNA\} world.

A long-term \{CA\} field trial located on an acid, weathered soil in western Kenya was evaluated for effects of reduced tillage and residue retention on P availability. Reduced tillage and residues were hypothesized to increase soil aggregation, and as a result, reduce P sorption potential, increase labile and organic P (Po), and stimulate phosphatase activities. After 9 years (18 cropping seasons), residue management had no effect on soil aggregate mean weight diameter (MWD), soil P fractions, or phosphatase potential activities. However, reduced tillage increased soil \{MWD\} and labile soil P stocks at 0–15 cm depth. Total P was greater at 0–15 cm depth under reduced tillage, but not for 0–30 cm depth, indicating stratification of P under reduced tillage. Increases in total P at 0–15 cm depth were correlated with maximum P sorption (Pmax sorption), whereas labile P increased with \{MWD\} and Po stocks. Reduced tillage also decreased pH and increased Pmax sorption, but these properties were not correlated. Despite a positive association of \{MWD\} and Po, weak or no changes were observed for Po and phosphatase activities, nor were there management effects on soil C stocks. Low residue retention rates (2 t maize residue yr−1) and relatively small improvements in soil structure due to reduced tillage were likely insufficient to yield changes in Po. Fertilizer P inputs at recommended rates (60 kg P ha−1 per season) may have also muted treatment effects on organic P cycling, though phosphatase activities were positively correlated with inorganic P fractions. The reduced tillage component of \{CA\} offers some improvements in P availability in weathered soils of western Kenya. However, relatively low soil available P across treatments suggests that \{CA\} with P fertilization may not be an optimal P management strategy for weathered soils in this region. "

The results indicated that Cephalantheropsis is monophyletic, while both Phaius and Calanthe are polyphyletic. In Phaius, a total of three species, P. flavus, P. columnaris, and P. takeoi, were segregated to form a new genus, Paraphaius. In Calanthe, subgenus Preptanthe and sect.

This systematic loss of soil carbon (C) is mainly attributed to the loss of physically protected SOC. The Rothamsted Carbon model (RothC) does not include a description of the processes of physical protection of \{SOC\} and so losses of C during continuous cultivation of previously uncultivated land are not likely to be accurately simulated. Our results show that in the first years following deforestation, RothC does not capture the fast drop in forest derived soil C. However, the model does satisfactorily simulate the changes in \{SOC\} derived from the following crops. Uncertainty in input data and accounting for erosion, does not explain the underestimation of decomposition after deforestation by RothC. A simple approach to increase decomposition by multiplying rate constants is evaluated. This approach needs high multiplication rates and leads to an overestimation of plant input values to sustain \{SOC\} equilibrium levels. However, the ability of RothC to simulate changes in the forest derived \{SOC\} can be greatly improved with an implementation of a simple approach to account for \{SOC\} dynamics due to the loss of physically protected C. This approach implements a new soil carbon pool into RothC which represents the labile but protected carbon fraction which builds up under minimally disturbed land uses, and which loses its protection once the soil is disturbed. The new pool is calibrated using 13C natural abundance analysis in conjunction with soil fractionation. "

Casts deposited in the soil by this species have been estimated at several tonnes per hectare per year. The physical and chemical processes occurring in these casts have never been studied. In this study, we compared the dynamics of water content (WC), total C (Ctot), and available N (Navail) contents, and the distribution in size of aggregates in ageing below-ground casts of this species and in the bulk soil. In a native herbaceous savannah and a sown grass/legume pasture (Brachiaria humidicola, Arachis pintoi, Desmodium ovalifolium and Stylosanthes capitata), fresh surface casts were experimentally injected into artificial burrows of 1 cm Ø and 10 cm depth and sampled at different dates during a total period of 120 days. The injection procedure used resulted in a 34% decrease in \{WC\} of the casts from the sown pasture and reduced the mean mass diameter (MMD) of the aggregates of casts from the savannah by 19%. Other properties were not significantly affected by the procedure. For injected casts in both grasslands, \{MMD\} and Ctot were stable during cast ageing while \{WC\} and Navail were initially at levels several times higher than the bulk soil and decreased to similar bulk soil values with ageing. The Ctot was twice and one third higher in casts compared with the bulk soil in the pasture and the savannah, respectively. Overall means for cast \{MMD\} (8.3 and 7.4 mm) were twice as high as those in the bulk soil (3.8 mm) in the savannah and the pasture, respectively. However, \{MMD\} was not significantly different between the casts and the bulk soil in two occasions in the pasture. Available nitrogen (Navail) in injected casts was initially greater than bulk soil levels, reaching maximum levels just after injection (116 and 93 mg kg−1) and remained significantly greater during 1–2 weeks, in the savannah and the pasture, respectively. In conclusion, the tonnes of casts deposited in the soil profile by Martiodrilus sp. each year are likely to contribute greatly to plant nutrition and to the regulation of the soil structure. For each anecic earthworm species, the ecological impact of its below-ground casts is likely to be as important as its surface casts. "

abstract = "Field data have suggested that under P-deficient conditions, legumes supplied with phosphate rock (PR) increase P acquisition by a subsequent maize crop compared to direct application of \{PR\} to maize. This study assessed the mechanism of this positive rotational effect in terms of soil P availability using a greenhouse trial with large volume (74 l) containers. The rotation effect was analysed in relation to \{PR\} application, previous legume growth and incorporation of the legume residues. Velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens) and maize were grown in a representative Acrisol from the Nigerian Northern Guinea savannah (NGS). All soils were applied with sufficient urea to exclude N-effects in the rotations. In a first season, velvet bean and maize responded similarly to \{PR\} application, and P uptake by both crops increased by 45%. The soil total labile P quantity (E-value) and P concentration in soil solution ( P solution 31 ) after plant growth were increased by PR-application only in soils previously grown by velvet bean, suggesting enhanced \{PR\} solubilisation in the legume-grown soils. In the subsequent season, grain yields and P uptake of a maize crop following velvet bean were twice as large compared to maize following a first maize crop. This residual effect of velvet bean was even significant in treatments without PR-application, although both maize and velvet bean withdrew similar amounts of P during the first season and no differences in soil P availability were observed. Furthermore, legume residue incorporation in soils previously grown by maize did not affect yields or P uptake of the subsequent maize crop, while it significantly increased the E-value and P solution 31 during the first 7 weeks in the second season. As such, the positive rotational effects of velvet bean were larger than predicted by soil P availability measures. Maize yield significantly increased with increasing plant P concentration among all treatments. However, the rotational effect was unrelated to internal P concentration: significantly larger yields were obtained for maize following velvet bean than for maize following maize at identical internal P. This suggested the presence of another growth-limiting which is counteracted by the previous velvet bean growth. In conclusion, our results confirmed that the introduction of a legume supplied with \{PR\} into a maize-based cropping system increases yield and P-uptake by a subsequent maize crop, compared to maize following a first maize crop supplied with PR. These stimulations, however, went beyond improved P nutrition. Results strongly suggested that the legume in the rotation system has other positive, possibly soil-microbiological effects which enhance maize growth and production. "

This paper introduces all of these areas of progress, with more detail being found in the subsequent papers in the special issue. Remaining scientific challenges are discussed, and a distinction is developed between projection- and utility-based approaches to agro-climate ensemble modelling. Recommendations are made regarding the manner in which uncertainty is analysed and reported, and the way in which models and data are used to make inferences regarding the future.

This study used both qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate farmers’ perceptions regarding threats to livelihoods in southern Zambia and south-western Zimbabwe. While farmers report changes in local climatic conditions consistent with climate variability, there is a problem in assigning contribution of climate variability and other factors to observed negative impacts on the agricultural and socio-economic system.

Day-to-day decisions have implications for the sustainability of their farming system, implying multiple trade-offs between short- and long-term objectives that have biophysical and socio-economic dimensions. We show that inverse modelling techniques can be used effectively for optimisation and trade-offs analysis of farming systems. By combining the multi-objective shuffled complex evolution metropolis algorithm and a crop/soil dynamic simulation model we were able to select farming strategies that resulted in the best possible trade-offs between different farming objectives. This integrated analytical tool allows optimisation of farmers’ goals similar to linear programming, but an advantage over linear programming is that the proposed method takes into account a wider spectrum of biophysical processes including their interactions and feedbacks. Tradeoffs between resource productivity, use efficiency and conservation in relation to different patterns of resource allocation were analysed for a maize-based, simplified case study farm from western Kenya (2.2 ha – comprising fields of poor, medium and high soil fertility), under three scenarios of financial liquidity to invest in labour and inputs (2000, 5000 and 10,000 \{KSh\} ha−1; 75 \{KSh\} = 1 US$). The maximum farm-scale maize production achieved was larger when financial resources increased. However, increasing maize yields above a certain threshold by applying mineral fertilisers was associated with larger N losses by leaching, runoff and soil erosion; such threshold was 2.7 t grain ha−1 for the scenario of no financial limitations (10,000 \{KSh\} ha−1). N losses at farm scale fluctuated between 36 and 54 kg N ha−1 season−1, while the maximum maize yields achieved were around 3.4 t grain ha−1. Soil losses by erosion increased abruptly beyond a certain maize yield (e.g. 1.8 t grain ha−1 for the 2000 \{KSh\} ha−1 scenario), while the minimum rate of soil loss differed between financial scenarios. Investments in hiring labour were prioritised over fertiliser use to obtain the greatest yields and the allocation of available resources favoured the more fertile fields. This inverse modelling exercise allowed us to analyse trade-offs between different farmers’ objectives and to compare potential resource allocation strategies to achieve them. The set of strategies to achieve different goals was more numerous and variable when the conditions were less conducive for farming. This questions the validity of the prevailing model of extension/communication, based on generalised recommendations for resource-poor farmers in Africa. "

Field observations also suggest that a large part of such variability is concomitantly caused by poor agronomy. To understand the interaction between soil fertility (S factors) and management decisions (M factors) affecting crop variability, we combined field research conducted in western Kenya (Vihiga, Kakamega and Teso districts; rainfall: 1600, 1800 and 1200 mm, respectively) with explorations using the simple dynamic crop/soil model for dynamic simulation of nutrient balances, previously tested for the region. Field measurements indicated within-farm differences in average maize grain yields of 48% (2.7 vs. 1.4 t ha−1) in Vihiga and of 60% (1.5 vs. 0.6 t ha−1) in Teso, between fields that were close and far from the homestead, respectively. Extreme values ranged widely, e.g. between 4.9 and 0.3 t ha−1 for all the farms surveyed in Vihiga, where the average farm size was 0.6 ha. Maize grain yields tended to increase with increasing contents of soil C, total N, extractable P and exchangeable bases. However, the negative relationship between S factors and distance from the homestead was not as strong as expected, and yield variability was better explained by multiple regression models considering M factors such as planting date, plant density, resource use and weed infestation (40–60% across sites). Then, we analysed the variation in resource (cash, labour, N) use efficiency within farms of different resource endowments with the aid of the simulation model. N balances at plot scale varied from ca. +20 to −18 kg ha−1, from −9 to −20 kg ha−1 and from −16 to −18 kg ha−1 for the different fields of the high, medium and low resource endowment case-study farms, respectively. Labour productivities ranged between ca. 10 and 38 kg grain man-day−1 across field and farm types. The results indicate the need of considering within farm heterogeneity when designing soil fertility management interventions. Resource use efficiency was strongly affected by soil quality. As farmers invest more effort and resources in the more productive and less risky fields, the interaction between S and M factors leads to farmer-driven resource use efficiency gradients within smallholder farms.

abstract = "Adding a dynamic, temporal dimension to the calculation of nitrogen balances is proposed as an alternative approach to assessing the impact of crop and soil management decisions on the establishment of farmer-induced soil fertility gradients within smallholder African farms. A simulation model that operates at field scale (DYNBAL-N: \{DYnamic\} simulation of Nutrient BALances) was used to understand the mechanisms leading to differences in resource use efficiency within a farm. We focused on N balances and use efficiencies, as the advantages of increasing the complexity of the calculations by considering the dynamics of the system (relative to the widely-used static approach) are expected to be large for a highly mobile nutrient such as N. The model was tested against a wide range of maize yield data (0.2–3.4 t ha−1) from on-farm measurements undertaken in western Kenya (Vihiga, Kakamega and Teso districts), producing reasonably accurate predictions (r2 = 0.72). Simulation scenarios were selected by considering multiple sources of variability affecting the N balances for typical households in Shinyalu, western Kenya, using field data collected by means of interviews, participatory resource flow mapping, soil sampling and laboratory analysis. The simulation results indicated that the use efficiencies of the biophysical resources radiation, water and N varied across the different fields of the farms, strongly affected by management decisions and soil fertility status. N balances varied between −38.0 and 21.9 kg N ha−1 for the different crop and soil management scenarios. The main N flows explaining the magnitude and the sign of the N balances were N removal by harvest, and N losses by leaching (2.3–18.3 kg ha−1) and by soil erosion (0.6–14.9 kg ha−1). Different options for soil fertility management (N fertilisation rates, manure applications) were then explored for different field types within a farm using the model. The use efficiency of the N applied as mineral fertiliser varied between 15.2 and 48.4 kg grain kg−1 applied N for different crop and soil management scenarios. The results illustrated the advantages of including the temporal dimensions and considering the spatial variability in the calculation of nutrient balances, when realistic scenarios are analysed. These results also indicated that nutrient balances at field scale are of limited value as indicators of resource use efficiency, and that nutrient stocks and corresponding crop yields need to be taken into account.

Both soils had been subject to at least 18 years of cultivation and had lost up to 90% of the original labile (CL) and 85% of the total carbon (CT). For the rainfed rice cropping systems of northeast Thailand, a system is described in which small applications of leaf litter from locally grown trees are applied annually to rice paddy soils prior to transplanting. Annual applications of 1500 kg ha−1 of leaf litter from different locally grown shrubs for five seasons resulted in increases in rice grain yield in 1997 of between 20 and 26% above the no-leaf litter control. Nutrient balances, determined by the difference between the inputs (fertilizer and added leaf litters) and outputs (grain and straw), indicated net positive balances of up to 457 kg N ha−1, and 60 kg P ha−1, after five seasons of leaf litter applications. Sulfur and potassium balances resulted in net deficits of up to −13 kg S ha−1 and −52 kg P ha−1, where no leaf litter was applied and rice straw was removed following harvest. Soil carbon (C) concentrations increased significantly only where higher fertilizer rate and rice stubble retention were combined. The poor management of fertilizers and crop residues, and excessive cultivation has also resulted in large soil fertility losses in the grain growing areas of Eastern Australia. After five wheat and two legume/fallow crops, negative N balances of up to −303 kg ha−1 were calculated for the treatments where wheat stubble was not retained and bare fallow leys were used. The balance of nutrients such as K, which are contained in larger proportions in stubble, were found to be up to −362 kg ha−1 on the straw-removed treatments and up to +29 kg ha−1 on the straw-retained treatments. Forage legume leys resulted in short term increases in \{CL\} and the carbon management index (CMI). Sustainable farming systems require that crop yields are stable through the maintenance of soil fertility and the balance of nutrients in the system. Increases in soil C levels require sustained periods of balanced fertilization and residue retention. "

abstract = "To guide soil fertility investment programmes in sub-Saharan Africa, better understanding is needed of the relative importance of soil and crop management factors in determining smallholder crop yields and yield variability. Spatial variability in crop yields within farms is strongly influenced by variation in both current crop management (e.g. planting dates, fertilizer rates) and soil fertility. Variability in soil fertility is in turn strongly influenced by farmers’ past soil and crop management. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative importance of soil fertility and crop management factors in determining yield variability and the gap between farmers’ maize yields and potential yields in western Kenya. Soil fertility status was assessed on 522 farmers’ fields on 60 farms and paired with data on maize-yield and agronomic management for a sub-sample 159 fields. Soil samples were analysed by wet chemistry methods (1/3 of the samples) and also by near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (all samples). Spectral prediction models for different soil indicators were developed to estimate soil properties for the 2/3 of the samples not analysed by wet chemistry. Because of the complexity of the data set, classification and regression trees (CART) were used to relate crop yields to soil and management factors. Maize grain yields for fields of different soil fertility status as classified by farmers were: poor, 0.5–1.1; medium, 1.0–1.8; high, 1.4–2.5 t ha−1. The \{CART\} analysis showed resource use intensity, planting date, and time of planting were the principal variables determining yield, but at low resource intensity, total soil N and soil Olsen P became important yield-determining factors. Only a small group of plots with high average grain yields (2.5 t ha−1; n = 8) was associated with use of nutrient inputs and good plant stands, whereas the largest group with low average yields (1.2 t ha−1; n = 90) was associated with soil Olsen P values of less than 4 mg kg−1. This classification could be useful as a basis for targeting agronomic advice and inputs to farmers. The results suggest that soil fertility variability patterns on smallholder farms are reinforced by farmers investing more resources on already fertile fields than on infertile fields. \{CART\} proved a useful tool for simplifying analysis and providing robust models linking yield to heterogeneous crop management and soil variables.

abstract = "An improved understanding of soil fertility variability and farmers’ resource use strategies is required for targeting soil fertility improving technologies to different niches within farms. We measured the variability of soil fertility with distance from homesteads on smallholder farms of different socio-economic groups on two soil types, a granite sand and a red clay, in Murewa, northeast Zimbabwe. Soil organic matter, available P and \{CEC\} decreased with distance from homestead on most farms. Soil available P was particularly responsive to management, irrespective of soil type, as it was more concentrated on the plots closest to homesteads on wealthy farms (8–13 mg kg−1), compared with plots further from homesteads and all plots on poor farms (2–6 mg kg−1). There was a large gap in amounts of mineral fertilizers used by the wealthiest farmers (&gt;100 kg N and &gt;15 kg P per farm; 39 kg N ha−1 and 7 kg P ha−1) and the poorest farmers (&lt;20 kg N and &lt;10 kg P per farm; 19 kg N ha−1 and 4 kg P ha−1). The wealthy farmers who owned cattle also used large amounts of manure, which provided at least 90 kg N and 25 kg P per farm per year (36 kg N ha−1 and 10 kg P ha−1). The poor farmers used little or no organic sources of nutrients. The wealthiest farmers distributed mineral fertilizers evenly across their farms, but preferentially targeted manure to the plots closest to the homesteads, which received about 70 kg N and 18 kg P per plot (76 kg N ha−1 and 21 kg P ha−1) from manure compared with 23 kg N and 9 kg P per plot on the mid-fields (26 kg N ha−1 and 10 kg P ha−1), and 10 kg N and 1 kg P per plot (and ha−1) on the outfields. Crop allocation on the homefields was most diversified on the wealthiest farms where maize was allocated 41% of the area followed by grain legumes (24%) and paprika (21%). Maize was allocated at least 83% of the homefields on farms with less access to resources. All the farmers invariably applied nutrients to maize but little to groundnut. Maize grain yields were largest on the homefields on the wealthy farms (2.7–5.0 t ha−1), but poor across all fields on the poor farms (0.3–1.9 t ha−1). Groundnut grain yields showed little difference between farms and plots. N and P partial balances were largest on the wealthy farms, although these fluctuated from season to season (−20 to +80 kg N per farm and 15–30 kg P per farm; average 21 kg N ha−1 and 8 kg P ha−1). The partial balances on the wealthy farms were largest on the homefield (20–30 kg N and 13 kg P per plot; &gt;26 kg N ha−1 and &gt;13 kg P ha−1), but decreased to 10–20 N and 6–9 kg P per plot (&lt;20 kg N ha−1 and 13 kg P ha−1) in mid-fields and −7 to +10 kg N and −1 to +1 kg P per plot (&lt;10 kg N ha−1 and &lt;2 kg P ha−1) in the outfields. N and P balances differed little across plots on the poor farms (−2 to +4 kg per plot; −5 to +4 kg ha−1) due to limited nutrients applied and small off-take from small harvests. This study highlights the need to consider soil fertility gradients and the crop and nutrient management patterns creating them when designing options to improve resource use efficiency on smallholder farms.

Soil data are often unavailable, particularly for many locations in the tropical and subtropical regions. If little or nothing is known about the soil profile for a particular location, a soil database can be used to estimate some of its parameters, based on a comparison with other soils from the same region. The \{WISE\} database is one of the most comprehensive soil databases, with samples well distributed in the World. The resulting soil profile can then be used as input parameters for a model to simulate growth, development and yield for one or more crops for this location. With multiple profiles available for many soil classes, it is possible to obtain an indication about the range of values for each soil parameter and then conduct an uncertainty analysis with respect to the model's response to this range. All soil profiles have been geo-referenced, and can thus be linked to the digital version of the FAO-UNESCO soil map of the world. We describe the methods used to convert the soil profile database, discuss the variability of key soil variables by soil class, illustrate how the database can be used, and conclude with recommendations for further work to improve the database for biophysical modeling applications.

A dynamic and robust nutrient management approach such as site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) will be essential to increase yields and optimize profits while maintaining the productivity of these intensive cropping systems. \{SSNM\} has increased yield and profit in rice, maize, and wheat in major cropping systems in Asia; but, crop advisors have found it complex and difficult to implement in the field. Nutrient Expert (NE) was developed to provide crop advisors with a simpler and faster way to use SSNM. \{NE\} enables crop advisors to develop \{SSNM\} recommendations using existing site information. Nutrient Expert for Hybrid Maize (NEHM) increased yield and profit of farmers in Indonesia and the Philippines. In Indonesia, \{NEHM\} increased yield by 0.9 t ha−1, which increased profit by US$ 270 ha−1 over farmer’s fertilizer practice (FFP). Compared with FFP, \{NEHM\} recommendations reduced fertilizer P (−4 kg ha−1), increased fertilizer K (+11 kg ha−1), and did not significantly change fertilizer N. In the Philippines, \{NEHM\} increased yield by 1.6 t ha−1 and profit by US$ 379 ha−1 compared with FFP. Compared with FFP, \{NEHM\} gave higher rates of all three nutrients (+25 kg N ha−1, +4 kg P ha−1, and +11 kg K ha−1), which substantially increased fertilizer costs (US$ 64 ha−1) but still increased profit by about six times the additional investment in fertilizer. \{NE\} accounts for the important factors affecting site-specific recommendations, which makes it a suitable starting point for developing nutrient management tools to reach more users.

Predictions for southern Africa suggest a general decrease in total seasonal rainfall, accompanied by more frequent in-season dry spells that will significantly impact crop and livestock production, and hence economic growth in the region. The hardest hit will be the rural poor in the drier areas, where crop failure due to drought is already common and chronic food emergencies afflict the region in most years. Lessons can be learnt on how the rural poor currently cope with the vagaries of climate and these can be used to help them adapt their current production systems to the future threats of further climate change. But this assumes the institutions that work towards the economic empowerment of the rural poor have the requisite skills to understand their current coping strategies and how adaptation can be facilitated. A new initiative led by Midlands State University and the Zambian Meteorological Office proposes that improving the ability of institutions that train the ‘Future Change Agents’, who will subsequently support smallholder communities in adapting their agricultural practices to current climate variability, is the first step in building adaptive capacity to cope with future climate change. The capacity of African scientists, regional organizations and decision-makers in dealing with the issues of climate change and adaptation will be enhanced on a continuing basis, and the impacts of their agricultural development programs improved.

The incidence of the 1/29 translocation was analyzed in four Bolivian Creole cattle breeds and the Brahman Yacumeño population, as well as on four farms with phenotypical Creole-type cattle. In 259 (164 dams and 95 sires) Bolivian Creole cattle, 10.42% of the individuals demonstrated the 1/29 translocation, with a variation from 0 to 28.20% between the breeds. In contrast, 43 (19 dams and 24 sires) Yacumeño Brahman and the Creole-type cattle did not show the centric fusion. The highly significant differences between Creole cattle breeds in relation to the incidence of 1/29 translocation could be a consequence of factors such as founder group, genetic drift, and selection. The low frequency observed in the Saavedreño Creole dairy cattle might be explained by its breeding under a more intensive system, and selection according to milk yield and fertility traits. Finally, no relation between acrocentric Y chromosomes and 1/29 translocation was observed. "

We investigated the influence of planting density on nutrient mass fractions and nutrient imbalance indices in bananas under small-scale, low-input systems using the compositional nutrient diagnosis (CND) approach. Boundary line functions were developed to identify yield limiting factors and quantify their contribution to the yield gap. Soil, plant, yield and water data were collected in plant density experiments conducted in three contrasting agro-ecological sites of Rwanda (i.e. Kibungo low rainfall with medium soil fertility, Rubona high rainfall but low soil fertility and Ruhengeri high rainfall with high soil fertility). Effects of site × cultivar and site × density on bunch yield were significant (p &lt; 0.05). Annual yields (t ha−1 yr−1) ranged from 6.1 to 9.2 at Kibungo, 9.5 to 21.5 at Rubona and 7.0 to 25.0 at Ruhengeri. Similar trends were registered for the above ground dry matter yield. \{CND\} indices showed that K, Mg and P were the most deficient elements in areas with low inherent soil fertility (Kibungo and Rubona). The yield gap analysis also confirmed that K was the most limiting factor, contributing to a predicted yield gap of 55.3% at Kibungo while P and Mg collectively contributed to a 35% yield gap at Rubona. An increase in plant density resulted in an increase in average yield gap from 45.6 to 70.2% at Kibungo, whilst the average yield gap decreased significantly with increases in plant density from 47.5 to 30.2% at Rubona and 76.6 to 53.7% at Ruhengeri. The study confirmed that soil fertility is a more limiting factor than water, but both \{CND\} norms and boundary line analysis showed that predicted yield gaps seem to be higher for plant density than soil fertility. Therefore, plant density management is an entry point to optimize yield of East African highland bananas. "

The objective of this study was to understand the farming system, and to evaluate the suitability of maize–legume intercropping to alleviate the biophysical and socio-economic constraints faced by smallholder farmers in Ruaca and Vunduzi villages, central Mozambique. To achieve this we characterised the farming systems and measured grain yields, rainfall infiltration, economic returns and acceptability of maize–legume intercrops under different N and P application rates. Two intercropping strategies were tested: (a) an additive design of within-row intercropping in which legume was intercropped with alternating hills of maize within the same row; maize plant population was the same as sole crop maize, and (b) a substitutive design with distinct alternating rows of maize and legume (local practice). Fertiliser treatments imposed on all treatments were: (i) no fertiliser, (ii) 20 kg P ha−1, (iii) 20 kg P ha−1 + 30 kg N ha−1, and (iv) 20 kg P ha−1 + 60 kg N ha−1. Intercrops were relatively more productive than the corresponding sole crops; land equivalent ratios (LER) for within-row intercropping ranged between 1.1 and 2.4, and between 1.0 and 1.9 for distinct-row intercropping. Average maize yield penalty for intercropping maize and pigeonpea in the within-row was small (8%) compared with 50% in the distinct-row design; average (season × fertiliser) sole maize yield was 3.2 t ha−1. Intercropping maize and cowpea in within-row led to maize yield loss of only 6%, whereas distinct-row intercropping reduced maize yield by 25% from 2.1 t ha−1 of sole maize (season × fertiliser). Cowpea yield was less affected by intercropping: sole cowpea had an average yield of 0.9 t ha−1, distinct-row intercropping (0.8 t ha−1) and the within-row intercropping yielded 0.9 t ha−1. Legumes were comparatively less affected by the long dry spells which were prevalent during the study period. Response to N and P fertiliser was weak due to poor rainfall distribution. In the third season, maize in rotation with pigeonpea and without N fertiliser application yielded 5.6 t ha−1, eight times more than continuous maize which was severely infested by striga (Striga asiatica) and yielded only 0.7 t ha−1. Rainfall infiltration increased from 6 mm h−1 to 22 mm h−1 with long-term maize–legume intercropping due to a combination of good quality biomass production which provided mulch combined with no tillage. Intercropping maize and pigeonpea was profitable with a rate of return of at least 343% over sole maize cropping. Farmers preferred the within-row maize–legume intercropping with an acceptability score of 84% because of good yields for both maize and legume. Intercropping increased the labour required for weeding by 36% compared with the sole crops. Farmers in Ruaca faced labour constraints due to extensification thus maize–pigeonpea intercropping may improve productivity and help reduce the area cultivated. In Vunduzi, land limitation was a major problem and intensification through legumes is amongst the few feasible options to increase both production and productivity. The late maturity of pigeonpea means that free-grazing of cattle has to be delayed, which allows farmers to retain crop residues in the fields as mulch if they choose to; this allows the use of no-tillage practises. We conclude that maize–legume intercropping has potential to: (a) reduce the risk of crop failure, (b) improve productivity and income, and (c) increase food security in vulnerable production systems, and is a feasible entry point to ecological intensification.

abstract = "Abstract Rising incomes and changing dietary requirements are swiftly transforming maize (Zea mays L) in Southeast Asia from a food staple into an important industrial commodity. Increased maize production is required to meet rising demands, but additional production should come from the sustainable intensification of existing farmlands to minimize the undesirable effects of agriculture on the environment. We hypothesize that maize yields, profit, and N use efficiencies can be significantly increased through site-specific nutrient management (SSNM), thereby reducing yield gaps in the region. Through a combined approach of simulation modeling and on-farm research in at least 65 sites in 13 major maize-producing domains across Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines from 2004 to 2008, we were able to (a) quantify maize yield gaps and yield responses to fertilizer application, (b) evaluate the agronomic and economic performance of SSNM, and (c) evaluate the incremental profitability of \{SSNM\} in various production and grain and fertilizer price scenarios. The average exploitable yield gap between the attainable yield and current farmers’ yield in Southeast Asia was about 0.9 t ha−1. Yield responses to fertilizer application across the region followed the order N &gt; &gt;P &gt; K. Yield response to N was higher in irrigated sites than in rainfed sites (6 t ha−1 versus 2 t ha−1), while P and K fertilizer responses were similar across production systems (&lt;2 t ha−1). Yield with \{SSNM\} was 1.0 t ha−1 (+13%) higher than the current farmers’ fertilizer practice (FFP) measured in the same cropping seasons. Yield increases were associated with a 10% decrease in the average N rate, but with increased application of K at sites where the previous K rates were low. Average N use efficiency increased by 42%, mainly by adjusting the rates and timing of N application to the stages of crop development. Across all sites and seasons, profitability increased by US$167 ha−1 per crop, which was equivalent to15% of the total average net return. Opportunities for achieving higher income over the \{FFP\} (≥US$100 ha−1 season) were greatest in highly favorable rainfed environments; less favorable rainfed areas were vulnerable to unfavorable market prices. We conclude that \{SSNM\} has the potential to close existing yield gaps in the maize production systems of Southeast Asia by improving yield, nutrient use efficiency, and profitability. "

Aphis fabae incidence was lower on beans intercropped with densely planted maize, with strong interaction effects of spacing and maize growth. In trapping studies in the field, more alate aphids were caught above maize canopies than above the bean crop level. Glasshouse test with A. fabae alates showed that, when maize plants were densely planted, few aphids penetrated the maize canopy to reach and colonize bean plants; fewer plants were therefore infested by the aphid. The results show that maize spacing and size are vital factors influencing A. fabae infestation on beans in bean/maize intercrops. "

The first maize planting (Old maize) was carried out 3 weeks earlier than beans, while the second planting (Young maize) was done simultaneously with beans.

Aphid colonies on beans were also smaller, and there was reduced aphid damage to beans in the intercrops. However, whereas bean yield loss from aphid attack was less than 3.5% in all intercrop situations, yield loss from competition by maize was very high, being up to 98% when beans were intercropped with early-planted maize at 0.5-m row spacing. Yields of intercropped maize planted at row spacings of 0.5, 1.5 and 2.0 m were also depressed.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the impact of climate change on the persistence of the natural populations of these species at their actual locations in order to take appropriate conservation measurements. A common approach to assess the impact of climate change on species natural distributions is climate envelope modeling (CEM). \{CEMs\} suggest significant impacts of climate change on the natural distribution of the two pine species, but their predictions contain considerable uncertainty related to the adaptive ability of tree populations to withstand future climate conditions. We assessed the adaptive ability of the two pine species based on the evaluations of provenance trials and used the results of these field trials to validate \{CEM\} impact assessment studies on provenance collection sites in the wild. The two pine species performed well in a wide range of climates, including conditions that were recorded by \{CEM\} as unsuitable for natural pine occurrence. The climate conditions where the two pine species naturally occur are predicted to become in the future more similar to the present climate of some areas where they are successfully established in field trials. These findings suggest that these pine species are in their natural habitat better adapted to climate change than \{CEM\} predicts. For the most vulnerable species, P. tecunumanii, human disturbances such as fragmentation from urbanization and conversion to agriculture that are occurring today are more urgent threats requiring action compared to the threat from climate change.

Alternative agricultural practices have been promoted to reduce the use of expensive mineral fertilizers and to restore and sustain soil fertility. The use of mineral fertilizer combined with organic inputs (such as crop residues) and different cropping systems (cereal–legume association or rotation) have been particularly promising. Impacts of these agricultural practices on soil communities have been widely studied, yet little is known on the effect on more specific groups such as rhizobia. A field trial was set up in Chuka (Kenya) to assess the impact of different cropping systems (maize and soybean in intercropping, rotation or monocropping) combined with N fertilization and residues application on the genetic diversity of promiscuous soybean rhizobia during two seasons. Soybean yields were severely reduced by moisture stress and the association with maize compared to mono-legume and rotation systems. Nodulation was generally low but was positively affected by residues application. Diversity of native rhizobia was very low (Shannon indices H′ &lt; 0.8) across the experiment and was not affected by the treatments. Only 5 \{IGS\} profiles were obtained after \{RFLP\} analysis and all isolated rhizobia were identified as Bradyrhizobium elkanii. The distribution of the different \{IGS\} groups within the experiment was more affected by season and residues application than by cropping system and nitrogen fertilizer application. These results suggest a limited population and a low diversity of indigenous rhizobia, and emphasize the need of alternative managements to increase and sustain soybean yields in Central Kenya. "

One field study and two laboratory/incubation studies were performed in a natural herbaceous savanna and a Brachiaria decumbens and Pueraria phaseoloides pasture. In the laboratory, experiment pots were prepared containing soil collected from the respective field paddock's topsoil. Total P content was higher in earthworm casts than in the surrounding soil in field samples, 50% in native savanna soil and more than 100% in pasture soil. In casts produced under laboratory conditions this increase was relatively low (10–20%). Under field conditions, almost without exception, all P fractions were increased in casts relative to the original soil (corresponding to the increase in total P content), being relatively greater in the labile inorganic P fractions. In addition, samples from the natural savanna showed that pH of casts was higher (5.2) than that of soil (4.6) in both field and laboratory samples. Except in the native savanna under field conditions, the phosphatase activity was reduced in casts by 16.7 to 44%.

The degradation rate shows a linear dependence with the concentration of pollutants (up to 350 mg PCE/N m3) for the PTR, but the degradation was negligible for the PFR. The degradation rate was enhanced by accelerating the chlorine radicals’ formation (by adding \{HCl\} in catalytic quantity in the air flow or by \{PCE\} over-heating). In these conditions, the oxidation rate constant of \{PCE\} in the \{PFR\} was about five times higher than that in the PTR, although the mass of catalyst involved in the \{PFR\} was about 10 times lower and the contact time was about a 1000 times shorter than that of the PTR. Thus, the catalyst is globally more efficiently used in the PFR, as the mass transfer is not limiting. As a result, a degradation mechanism of PCE, involving the generation of free chlorine radicals, as the first limiting step, has been confirmed. "

Here, we quantify the magnitude and study the origin of farmer-induced, within-farm soil fertility gradients as affected by biophysical and socio-economic conditions, and investigate farmers’ perceptions of such heterogeneity. Farm transects, participatory resource flow mapping, farmers’ classification of land qualities, and soil sampling for both chemical and spectral reflectance analyses were performed across 60 farms in three sub-locations (Emuhaia, Shinyalu, Aludeka) representing the variability found in the highlands of western Kenya. Differences between the various field types of a farm were observed for input use (e.g. 0.7–104 kg N ha−1), food production (e.g. 0.6–2.9 t \{DM\} ha−1), partial C (e.g. −570 to 1480 kg ha−1) and N (e.g. −92 to 57 kg ha−1) balances and general soil fertility status, despite strong differences across sub-locations. Concentration of nutrients in the home fields compared with the remote fields were verified for extractable P (e.g. 2.1–19.8 mg kg−1) and secondarily for exchangeable K (e.g. 0.14–0.54 cmol(+) kg−1), on average, whereas differences for soil C and N were only important when considering each individual farm separately. Farmers managed their fields according to their perceived land quality, varying the timing and intensity of management practices along soil fertility gradients. Fields classified by them as poor were planted later (up to 33.6 days of delay), with sparser crops (ca. 30% less plants m−2) and had higher weed infestation levels than those classified as fertile, leading to important differences in maize yield (e.g. 0.9 versus 2.4 t ha−1). The internal heterogeneity in resource allocation varied also between farms of different social classes, according to their objectives and factor constraints. Additionally, the interaction of sub-location-specific socio-economic (population, markets) and biophysical factors (soilscape variability) determined the patterns of resource allocation to different activities. Such interactions need to be considered for the characterisation of farming system to facilitate targeting research and development interventions to address the problem of poor soil fertility. "

Causes of variability in soil fertility management at different scales of analysis are both biophysical and socio-economic. Such heterogeneity is categorised in this study, which quantifies its impact on nutrient flows and soil fertility status at region and farm scales, as a first step in identifying spatial and temporal niches for targeting of soil fertility management strategies and technologies. Transects for soil profile observation, participatory rural appraisal techniques and classical soil sampling and chemical analysis were sampled across 60 farms in three sub-locations (Emuhaia, Shinyalu, Aludeka), which together represent much of the variability found in the highlands of western Kenya. Five representative farm types were identified using socio-economic information and considering production activities, household objectives and the main constraints faced by farmers. Soil fertility management and nutrient resource flows were studied for each farm type and related to differences in soil fertility status at farm scale. Farm types 1 and 2 were the wealthiest; the former relied on off-farm income and farmed small pieces of land (0.6–1.1 ha) while the latter farmed relatively large land areas (1.6–3.8 ha) mainly with cash crops. The poorest farm type 5 also farmed small pieces of land (0.4–1.0 ha) but relied on low wages derived from working for wealthier farmers. Both farm types 1 and 5 relied on off-farm earnings and sold the least amounts of farm produce to the market, though the magnitude of their cash, labour and nutrient flows was contrasting. Farms of types 3 and 4 were intermediate in size and wealth, and represented different crop production strategies for self-consumption and the market. Average grain yields fluctuated around 1 t ha−1 year−1 for all farm types and sub-locations. Grain production by farms of types 4 and 5 was much below annual family requirements, estimated at 170 kg person−1 year−1. Household wealth and production orientation affected the pattern of resource flow at farm scale. In the land-constrained farms of type 1, mineral fertilisers were often used more intensively (ca. 50 kg ha−1), though with varying application rates (14–92 kg ha−1). The use of animal manure in such small farms (e.g. 2.2 t year−1) represented intensities of use of up to 8 t ha−1, and a net accumulation of C and macronutrients brought into the farm by livestock. In farms of type 5, intensities of use of mineral and organic fertilisers ranged between 0–12 kg ha−1 and 0–0.5 t ha−1, respectively. A consistent trend of decreasing input use from farm types 1–5 was generally observed, but nutrient resources and land management practices (e.g. fallow) differed enormously between sub-locations. Inputs of nutrients were almost nil in Aludeka farms. Both inherent soil properties and management explained the variability found in soil fertility status. Texture explained the variation observed in soil C and related total N between sub-locations, whereas P availability varied mainly between farm types as affected by input use. "

Important yield variability has been reported at different scales, reflecting the intensity and spatial distribution of growth-limiting and growth-reducing factors. Maize yield estimation represents a valuable tool to assess within-farm variability in soil fertility through crop performance. The objective of this study was to develop mathematical relationships between plant morphological attributes and grain yield of tropical maize genotypes, based on plant allometric characteristics. These models were used to estimate maize yields and the estimates were validated against independent data collected from experimental and farmers’ fields in western Kenya. Three commercial hybrids and three local varieties were considered. Multiple linear regression models including plant height and either ear length or ear diameter as explanatory variables, and simple linear regressions including only plant height, were the most accurate to estimate both total aboveground biomass and grain dry matter yields per plant (r2: 0.76–0.91). Average values for the harvest index ranged between 0.34 and 0.42, varying with the total aboveground biomass produced per plant. Yield estimations on ground area basis for farmers’ fields were acceptably accurate. Plant height measurements can be easily taken at any moment after maize flowering and used in simple models to estimate maize yield. This approach proved also a valuable tool to discuss yield variability with farmers. "

The experiments were complete factorials and included different levels of Si, phosphorus (P) and cultivars. Sources of Si tested included both calcium metasilicate and slag. Lime was applied to equalize lime value and Ca levels across treatments. Silicon significantly reduced all observed rice diseases. Leaf blast severity and neck blast incidence were reduced from about 26% and 53% in non-amended plots to 15% in Si-amended plots. Leaf scald severity was reduced from 42% to 6% in Si-amended plots, while grain discoloration was reduced from 4.2 to 1.0 in Si-amended plots. Si application increased rice yields by about 40% on all three soils. A residual effect was also noted on both, the reduction of disease development and yield increase. By amending these soils with Si, a very effective and potentially sustainable method for upland rice production and management of rice diseases appears available. "

Data was collected on crop management aspects, pests and diseases, and soil and plant tissue samples analyzed for nutrient contents. Bunch yields were higher near homesteads (29.8 t ha−1 yr−1) than at mid-distance (26.8 t ha−1 yr−1), or far away 20.2 t ha−1 yr−1. Yields were much higher than previously reported (11–14 t ha−1 yr−1) in Kenya. Both soil and tissue K levels were higher near and mid-distance, than far from the homestead. Gradients of soil pH, total N, available P and Organic carbon were found, being higher near the homestead, while Mg and Ca were lowest near the homesteads. K was the most deficient nutrient, with tissue K index (IK) decreasing when moving away from the homesteads. P and Ca deficiencies were also observed. Resource-poor farmers’ soils were higher in exchangeable K and Mg, pH, and total N, and supported higher mat densities compared to resource-endowed farmers’ farms.

The objective of this study was to assess the Al resistance of open pollinated tropical maize cultivars, from widely differing origin, and their diallel crosses based on callose formation as a physiological marker, and study the inheritance and combining ability for Al resistance. Fifteen maize cultivars from 4 maize breeding programmes and their 105 crosses were grown under controlled environmental conditions in a growth chamber and treated without or with 25 μM Al at pH 4.3. After 12 h of Al treatment, callose contents of 1 cm root apices were determined. There was a significant genotypic variation in callose formation under Al stress. Furthermore, diallel analysis indicated a significant general combining ability (GCA) but not specific combining ability (SCA), indicating that Al resistance is mainly controlled by additive genes. In general, Al-resistant cultivars showed favourable \{GCA\} effects while the sensitive cultivars had unfavourable \{GCA\} effects clearly indicating the dominant role of Al-resistant cultivars in the development or improvement of Al-resistant maize varieties. Moreover, a relatively high heritability (h2 = 0.7) was obtained for Al resistance in nutrient solution. Aluminium resistance as revealed by callose content in Al-treated root apices was positively correlated to the relative grain yield of the same crosses evaluated across five tropical environments. In addition, strong genetic correlation was observed as \{GCA\} of callose formation in nutrient solution closely correlated with \{GCA\} of yield on acid soils. These findings suggest that Al-induced callose formation is a powerful tool to enhance the breeding of maize cultivars with superior adaptation to acid and Al-toxic soils. "

Radiation exposure was produced with an \{HPK\} 125 W lamp and the standard TiO2 Degussa P-25 was used as the photocatalyst. Firstly, the impact of photocatalysis and photochemistry on the cultivability of bacterial cells was investigated. UV-A radiation resulted in low deleterious effects on bacterial cultivability but generated colonies of size smaller than average. UV-C photocatalysis demonstrated a greater efficiency than UV-A photocatalysis in altering bacterial cultivability. From a cultivability point of view only, UV-C radiation appeared to be the most deleterious treatment. A rapid epifluorescence staining method using the LIVE/DEAD Bacterial Viability Kit was then used to assess the modifications in bacterial membrane permeability. UV-A radiation did not induce any alterations in bacterial permeability for 420 min of exposure whereas only a few minutes of exposure to UV-C radiation, with the same total radiance intensity, induced total loss of permeability. Moreover, after 20 and 60 min of exposure to UV-C and UV-A photocatalysis respectively, all bacteria lost their membrane integrity, suggesting that the bacterial envelope is the primary target of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated at the surface of TiO2 photocatalyst. These results were further confirmed by the formation of malondialdehyde (MDA) during the photocatalytic inactivation of bacterial cells and suggest that destruction of the cell envelope is a key step in the bactericidal action of photocatalysis. The oxidation of bacterial membrane lipids was also correlated with the monitoring of carboxylic acids, which can be considered as representatives of lipid peroxidation by-products. Finally, damages to bacterial morphology induced by UV-C photocatalysis and photochemistry were investigated through Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Bacterial cells were observed on microscopy pictures at exposure durations corresponding to a loss of cultivability. After 90 min of exposure to UV-C radiation, bacterial cells showed little alteration of their outer membrane whereas they suffered deep deleterious damages under UV-C photocatalysis exposure. "

abstract = "Resources for crop production are often scarce in smallholder farming systems in the tropics, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Decisions on the allocation of such resources are often made at farm rather than at field plot scale. To handle the uncertainty caused by both lack of data and imperfect knowledge inherent to these agricultural systems, we developed a dynamic summary model of the soil–crop system that captures essential interactions determining the short- and long-term crop productivity, while keeping a degree of simplicity that allows its parameterisation, use and dissemination in the tropics. Generic, summary functions describing crop productivity may suffice for addressing questions concerning trade-offs on resource allocation at farm scale. Such functions can be derived from empirical (historical) data or, when they involve potential or water-limited crop yields, can be generated using process-based, detailed crop simulation models. This paper describes the approach to simulating crop productivity implemented in the model \{FIELD\} (Field-scale Interactions, use Efficiencies and Long-Term soil fertility Development), based on the availability of light, water, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, and the interactions between these factors. We describe how these interactions are simulated and use examples from case studies in African farming systems to illustrate the use of detailed crop models to generate summary functions and the ability of \{FIELD\} to capture long-term trends in soil C and crop yields, crop responses to applied nutrients across heterogeneous smallholder farms and the implications of overlooking the effects of intra-seasonal rainfall variability in the model. An example is presented that evaluates the sensitivity of the model to resource allocation decisions when operating (linked to livestock and household models) at farm scale. Further, we discuss the assessment of model performance, going beyond the calculation of simple statistics to compare simulated and observed results to include broader criteria such as model applicability. In data-scarce environments such as SSA, uncertainty in parameter values constrains the performance of detailed process-based models, often forcing model users to ‘guess’ (or set to default values) parameters that are seldom measured in practice. The choice of model depends on its suitability and appropriateness to analyse the relevant scale for the question addressed. Simpler yet dynamic models of the various subsystems (crop, soil, livestock, manure) may prove more robust than detailed, process-based models when analysing farm scale questions on system design and resource allocation in SSA.

In this study, we investigate the ability of the \{FASSET\} model to analyze differences in the magnitude of \{N2O\} emissions due to soil, climate and management factors in cereal-based cropping systems. Forage maize was grown in a conventional dairy system at Mabegondo (NW Spain) and wheat and barley in organic and conventional crop rotations at Foulum (NW Denmark). These two European sites represent agricultural areas with high and low to moderate emission levels, respectively. Field trials included plots with and without catch crops that were fertilized with either mineral N fertilizer, cattle slurry, pig slurry or digested manure. Non-fertilized treatments were also included. Measurements of \{N2O\} fluxes during the growing cycle of all the crops at both sites were performed with the static chamber method with more frequent measurements post-fertilization and biweekly measurements when high fluxes were not expected. All cropping systems were simulated with the \{FASSET\} version 2.5 simulation model. Cumulative soil seasonal \{N2O\} emissions were about ten-fold higher at Mabegondo than at Foulum when averaged across systems and treatments (8.99 and 0.71 kg N2O-N ha−1, respectively). The average simulated cumulative soil \{N2O\} emissions were 9.03 and 1.71 kg N2O-N ha−1 at Mabegondo and at Foulum, respectively. Fertilization, catch crops and cropping systems had lower influence on the seasonal soil \{N2O\} fluxes than the environmental factors. Overall, in its current version \{FASSET\} reproduced the effects of the different factors investigated on the cumulative seasonal soil \{N2O\} emissions but temporally it overestimated emissions from nitrification and denitrification on particular days when soil operations, ploughing or fertilization, took place. The errors associated with simulated daily soil \{N2O\} fluxes increased with the magnitude of the emissions. For resolving causes of differences in simulated and measured fluxes more intensive and temporally detailed measurements of \{N2O\} fluxes and soil C and N dynamics would be needed. "

In Experiment 1, using the in vitro gas-transducer technique, various tannin-rich forage legumes were supplemented alone or in combination with the tannin-free legume Vigna unguiculata to a tropical grass diet. In Experiment 2, six growing lambs fed temperate grass or grass–legume diets were supplemented with 0 or 25 g of Acacia mearnsii tannins/kg dietary dry matter. In Experiment 1, supplementation of the grass with tannin-rich legumes (i.e. Calliandra calothyrsus or Flemingia macrophylla) alone did not increase the supply with degradable protein compared to the pure grass diet, and suppressed apparent ruminal protein degradability. By contrast, V. unguiculata clearly increased amount and proportion of rumen-degradable protein in the diet. When combined with V. unguiculata, the tannin-rich legumes could be used in proportions of up to 10% of the complete diet without affecting protein degradation rate. In Experiment 2, tannin supplementation decreased ruminal ammonia concentration and resulted in a shift in N excretion from urine to faeces without affecting body N retention. This shift in N excretory pattern is of practical relevance because urinary N is prone to ammonia emission during manure storage and application. These results confirm that tannin-rich legumes suppress ruminal protein degradability and suggest that dietary tannin supplementation can be useful in mitigating potential gaseous N emissions from animal excreta.

abstract = "The spatial variability in crop yields commonly observed in smallholder farms of sub-Saharan Africa is often caused by gradients of declining soil fertility with increasing distance from the homestead. This heterogeneity means that recommendations based on regional soil surveys are of limited value. The variability in soil qualities within farms must be considered when designing management strategies, and their feasibility analysed by integrating results at the farm livelihood scale. For this purpose, we have developed the model FARMSIM, a dynamic bio-economic model for analysis and exploration of trade-offs in resource and labour allocation in heterogeneous smallholder farms. Focusing on farm-scale strategies, the approach to simulation of soil and crop processes in \{FARMSIM\} (the sub-model FIELD) is designed to be simple, but to keep the necessary degree of complexity to capture heterogeneity in resource use efficiencies. To test our approach, the sub-model \{FIELD\} was calibrated against chronosequences of woodland clearance in three agroecological zones of Zimbabwe (with soil textures of 3, 10, 35% clay), and used to simulate: (i) the creation of soil fertility gradients, and (ii) different strategies of N, P and manure applications to maize and soyabean rotations in homefields and outfields of smallholder farms on clayey and sandy soils. The results of the simulation of management strategies were tested against on-farm experimental data from Murewa, Zimbabwe. The model produced satisfactory predictions (r2: 0.6–0.9) of long-term changes in soil organic C, of crop responses to N and P and of nutrient use efficiencies across a wide range of yields and different field types. This demonstrated the broad applicability of the model despite the sparse data required for initialisation. However, the model results were less accurate in predicting crop responses to N and P applications in the outfields on sandy soils. Experimental evidence indicated yield limitation by Ca and Zn deficiencies in highly depleted outfields on sandy soils, which were not included mechanistically in the current version of FIELD. Repeated applications of 16 t ha−1 year−1 of manure allowed larger responses to applied N and P after 3 years of experimentation; such a corrective effect of manure was simulated to be due to improved N and P recovery efficiencies in the model. In combination with the experimental data, the simulation results suggested that soil fertility gradients affect nutrient use efficiencies, operating mostly on the efficiencies of nutrient capture rather than conversion. A typology of fields according to the type of management interventions needed is introduced, based on a generic application of \{FIELD\} with this parameterisation. "

Although large amounts of seeds were present in casts (163.65, 156.84 and 60.36 seeds per 100 g of dry casts in the savanna, the old and young pastures, respectively), germination rates were 3–40 times lower than in the surrounding soil, likely due to degradation during the gut transit. The number of viable seeds present in casts was 0.40, 7.46 and 1.99 seeds per 100 g of dry casts in the savanna, the old and young pastures, respectively. Species composition of viable seeds was quite different in casts compared to soil, probably because of selective seed ingestion by earthworms. Viable seeds deposited in surface casts each year represented 0.65%, 16.17% and 8.24% of the total viable seed bank of the soil, in the savanna, the old and young pastures, respectively. In the savanna and the old pasture, species composition in casts was more similar to the vegetation than species composition in the soil was. This may indicate that ingested seeds that survive gut transit have a greater chance to germinate than those of the soil seed bank, providing vegetation cover is sufficiently opened to enable germination processes. Thus, casts may be considered as a regeneration niche for plant species, and earthworm activity a factor that enhances, in some cases, the expression of the soil seed bank in the standing vegetation.

Defaunation suppressed methanogenesis by 43% over all diets (P&lt;0.05), and the effect of S. saponaria on methane was more pronounced in defaunated (29%) versus faunated rumen fluid (14%). When related to organic matter apparently fermented, differences relative to the control diet persisted (P&lt;0.05), but methane release per unit of fibre degraded did not differ between the S. saponaria diet and the control diet. This study demonstrated that supplementation with S. saponaria is effective against ruminal methanogenesis, but that this was not exclusively an effect of the associated depression in protozoal count.

Initial inoculation of plants with products was done at the acclimatization phase and subsequently at the potting phase. Survival of inoculated plantlets was recorded at the end of the acclimatization phase, 8 weeks after deflasking. Effect of products on growth was evaluated as ability to enhance height and girth of pseudostem, leaf length, leaf width, number of functional leaves and root and shoot biomass yield. The efficacy of products on survival of plants at hardening was variable and dependent on soil type. Inoculation with Bacillus enhanced survival of plants in the Vertisol, mycorrhiza and Trichoderma inoculation in the Rhodic Ferralsol and mycorrhiza in the Humic Nitisol and conventional media. Performance of inoculated plants was dependent on soil type. Application of Bacillus based products significantly increased plant growth (leaf length, leaf width, plant height, shoot dry weights) in the Vertisol and Rhodic Ferralsol in the nursery phase. Application of multiple species mycorrhiza and Trichoderma under field conditions significantly increased plant growth (apparent volume and leaf surface area) in the Vertisol by over 100% and 25% compared to the control and conventional practice respectively. Mycorrhizal colonization was not significantly affected by product inoculation. However, higher percentages of colonization were observed with Bacillus inoculation in the Vertisol and by mycorrhizae and Trichoderma in the Rhodic Ferralsol compared to the non-inoculated controls. Results demonstrate that tissue cultured bananas can benefit from application of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Trichoderma and Bacillus to improve survival and growth during the nursery phase as well as enhance plant performance under field conditions. The effect of microorganisms-based commercial inoculants is however dependent on soil type and the stage of plant development. "

Bradyrhizobium sp. (TGx) populations were generally low, and significantly less than that of the cowpea bradyrhizobial populations in 57% of the samples. Population sizes of less than 10 cells g−1 soil were common as these were detected in at least 43% of the soil samples. B. japonicum (Clark) occurred in higher population densities in research sites compared to farmers’ fields. Bradyrhizobium sp. (TGx) populations were highly correlated with biotic but not abiotic factors. The frequent incidence of low Bradyrhizobium sp. (TGx) populations is unlikely to support optimum \{BNF\} enough for high soybean yields while the presence of B. japonicum (Clark) in research fields has the potential to compromise the selection pressure anticipated from the indigenous Bradyrhizobium spp. (Vigna) populations. Bradyrhizobium isolates could be placed in four symbiotic phenotype groups based on their effectiveness on a \{TGx\} soybean genotype and the North American cultivar Clark IV. Symbiotic phenotype group \{II\} isolates were as effective as B. japonicum strain \{USDA110\} on both soybean genotypes while isolates of group \{IV\} were effective on the \{TGx\} soybean genotype but not on the Clark IV. The group \{IV\} isolates represent a unique subgroup of indigenous bradyrhizobia that can sustain high soybean yields when available in sufficient population densities. "

Earthworms tended to exhibit contagious distribution in both land use systems and a multivariate relationship appeared between the size of the earthworm and aggregation indices employed. Land use had no significant effect on the spatial distribution of earthworms. Earthworms belonging to different ecological categories and from diverse sizes were spatially distributed in patches of several tens of meters. Semivariograms reflected, occasionally, the size of these patches, although, no spatial structure was perceived at some dates. This might be due to the intersample distance employed (10 m) so that changing the scale of observation could reflect unseen patterns. In this study our purpose was first to determine the strength of spatial aggregation in some Neotropical earthworm species and then to observe the movement of population patches at the scale of the studied area.

The experiment was conducted using a rumen simulation technique (RUSITEC) (n = 8). The partial replacement of V. unguiculata by any tanniniferous shrub decreased (P&lt;0.05) ammonia concentration in the fermenter fluid and apparent fibre degradation. However, the decrease was more pronounced with C. calothyrsus and F. macrophylla than with L. leucocephala. Apparent degradation of organic matter and \{CP\} decreased (P&lt;0.05) when V. unguiculata was partially replaced by C. calothyrsus or F. macrophylla, but not (P&gt;0.05) when L. leucocephala was included.

The factors evaluated included cultivation site (fertile mollisol with pH 7.8 and bimodal rainfall vs. infertile oxisol with pH 5.0, high Al saturation and unimodal rainfall) and different levels of mineral fertilisation. In vitro ruminal degradability, \{CT\} concentration and properties were affected by cultivation site or fertiliser application or both. In Calliandra and Flemingia, the \{CT\} concentration showed a trend (P &lt; 0.1) to be higher at the site with the infertile soil. This was consistent with the increased (P &lt; 0.001) astringency of \{CT\} extracts found in Calliandra when plants were cultivated at this site. In Flemingia, however, astringency was reduced (P &lt; 0.001) on the infertile soil. There were certain effects of the cultivation site on the anthocyanidin profile of \{CT\} from Calliandra and Flemingia, but these were relatively small and could not explain the differences in astringency observed between sites. Fertilisation did not affect (P &gt; 0.05) total \{CT\} concentration in Calliandra and Flemingia but clearly increased (P &lt; 0.01) astringency of the \{CT\} extracts. This suggests that not only \{CT\} concentration but also properties of \{CT\} may be affected by cultivation site and fertilisation. Leucaena did not grow on the infertile soil and site effects could therefore not be evaluated in this species. Fertilisation did not affect (P &gt; 0.05) \{CT\} concentration and astringency of \{CT\} extracts of Leucaena but reduced (P &lt; 0.05) the cyanidin proportion in CT. Cultivation site affected several variables describing fermentation dynamics. Foliage of the legumes grown on the infertile soil exhibited lower (P &lt; 0.05) gas production rates. Dry matter degradation was lower (P &lt; 0.001) and the proportion of dietary N remaining undegraded after in vitro incubation was higher (P &lt; 0.001) when Calliandra was grown on the infertile compared to the fertile soil. The present results indicate that the cultivation site may affect the feeding value of CT-containing legumes. Fertilisation could not compensate the negative effects of the cultivation site on \{CT\} properties and ruminal nutrient degradation. Selecting appropriate cultivation sites (with higher soil fertility) may contribute to improve the feeding value of certain tanniniferous tropical shrub legumes. "

Its vegetative propagation through stem cuttings has many advantages, but deleteriously it means that pathogens are passed from one generation to the next and can easily accumulate, threatening cassava production. Cassava-growing continents are characterized by specific suites of viruses that affect cassava and pose particular threats. Of major concern, causing large and increasing economic impact in Africa and Asia are the cassava mosaic geminiviruses that cause cassava mosaic disease in Africa and Asia and cassava brown streak viruses causing cassava brown streak disease in Africa. Latin America, the center of origin and domestication of the crop, hosts a diverse set of virus species, of which the most economically important give rise to cassava frog skin disease syndrome. Here, we review current knowledge on the biology, epidemiology, and control of the most economically important groups of viruses in relation to both farming and cultural practices. Components of virus control strategies examined include: diagnostics and surveillance, prevention and control of infection using phytosanitation, and control of disease through the breeding and promotion of varieties that inhibit virus replication and/or movement. We highlight areas that need further research attention and conclude by examining the likely future global outlook for virus disease management in cassava. "

The goal of this study was to analyze \{SOC\} sequestration options in cropping systems of the Northern Guinea Savanna of West Africa. An 11-year experiment from the region, which consisted of 56 cropping system treatments that combined various crop rotation sequences with various input levels and an additional treatment of native grass fallow, was analyzed. Rotations included one or more of: sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.), maize (Zea mays L.) and native grass fallow. Inputs were defined by whether or not the plots were plowed and the addition of soil amendments (N, nitrogen; P, phosphorous; K, potassium; D, dolomite; CR, crop residues; CP, compost and ME, manure). Plots were moldboard plowed before seeding, except fallows, which were not plowed. Soil organic carbon in select treatments and residue yields from all cropped treatments were analyzed. The slope parameters from the regression analysis of \{SOC\} in the continuous fallow treatment were not significantly different from zero (P &gt; 0.05), suggesting \{SOC\} (0.53% after 11 years) was at steady state in this treatment. Rotation and input significantly affected \{SOC\} (P &lt; 0.05), but interaction effects were not significant. After 11 years, the cropped rotation with the greatest \{SOC\} was sorghum-fallow (0.46%), which was significantly greater (P &lt; 0.05) than \{SOC\} in other the rotations measured: continuous cotton (0.36%), continuous sorghum (0.35%), and cotton–maize–sorghum (0.33%). For the input levels, addition of P, K, and \{ME\} gave the greatest \{SOC\} (0.44%) after 11 years of cropping, which was significantly greater (P &lt; 0.05) than \{SOC\} from the N, P, K and D (0.37%), no input (0.32%) and N, P and K (0.34%) treatments. In addition, \{SOC\} with inputs of N, P, K and D (0.37%) was significantly greater than \{SOC\} with no input (0.32%).

These were rotating sorghum and fallow, and amending the soil with mineral P, K, and \{ME\} or N, P, K and D.

Therefore, we evaluated the effects of long-term tillage and residue management on \{SOC\} dynamics in a Chromic Luvisol (red clay soil) and Areni-Gleyic Luvisol (sandy soil) in Zimbabwe. At the time of sampling the soils had been under conventional tillage (CT), mulch ripping (MR), clean ripping (CR) and tied ridging (TR) for 9 years. Soil was fully dispersed and separated into 212–2000 μm (coarse sand), 53–212 μm (fine sand), 20–53 μm (coarse silt), 5–20 μm (fine silt) and 0–5 μm (clay) size fractions. The whole soil and size fractions were analyzed for C content. Conventional tillage treatments had the least amount of SOC, with 14.9 mg C g−1 soil and 4.2 mg C g−1 soil for the red clay and sandy soils, respectively. The highest \{SOC\} content was 6.8 mg C g−1 soil in the sandy soil under MR, whereas for the red clay soil, \{TR\} had the highest \{SOC\} content of 20.4 mg C g−1 soil. Organic C in the size fractions increased with decreasing size of the fractions. In both soils, the smallest response to management was observed in the clay size fractions, confirming that this size fraction is the most stable. The coarse sand-size fraction was most responsive to management in the sandy soil where \{MR\} had 42% more organic C than CR, suggesting that \{SOC\} contents of this fraction are predominantly controlled by amounts of C input. In contrast, the fine sand fraction was the most responsive fraction in the red clay soil with a 66% greater C content in the \{TR\} than CT. This result suggests that tillage disturbance is the dominant factor reducing C stabilization in a clayey soil, probably by reducing C stabilization within microaggregates. In conclusion, developing viable conservation agriculture practices to optimize \{SOC\} contents and long-term agroecosystem sustainability should prioritize the maintenance of C inputs (e.g. residue retention) to coarse textured soils, but should focus on the reduction of \{SOC\} decomposition (e.g. through reduced tillage) in fine textured soils.

Bio-economic evaluation of farmers’ perceptions of viable farms in western Kenya. Agric. Syst. 90, 243–271]: one in which high productivity is achieved through optimising crop-livestock interactions. We selected four case study crop-livestock farms of different resource endowment (Type 1–4 – excluding the poorest farmers, Type 5, who do not own livestock) and quantified all relevant physical flows through and within them. With this information we parameterised a dynamic, farm-scale simulation model to investigate (i) current differences in resource use efficiencies and degree of crop-livestock interactions across farm types; and (ii) the impact of different interventions in farm Types 3 and 4 on producing the desired shifts in productivity towards the ideal farm. Assuming no resource constraints, changes in the current farm systems were introduced stepwise, as both intensification of external input use (fertilisers and fodder) and qualitative changes in the configuration of the farms (i.e. changing land use towards fodder production, improving manure handling and/or changing cattle breeds). In 10-year simulations of the baseline, current scenario using historical weather data the wealthiest farms Type 2 achieved food self-sufficiency (FSS) in 20% of the seasons due to rainfall variability, whereas the poorer Type 4 only achieved \{FSS\} in 0 to 30% of the seasons; soil organic C decreased during the simulations at annual rates of −0.54, −0.73, −0.85 and −0.84 t C ha−1 on farms of Type 1–4, respectively; large differences in productivity and recycling efficiency between farm types indicated that there is ample room to improve the physical performance of the poorer farms (e.g. light and water use efficiency was 2–3 times larger on wealthier farms). Simulating different intensification scenarios indicated that household \{FSS\} can be achieved in all farm types through input intensification, e.g. using P fertilisers at rates as small as 15 kg farm−1 season−1 (i.e. from 7 to 28 kg ha−1). Increasing the area under Napier grass from c. 20 to 40% and reducing the area of maize, beans and sweet potato in farms of Type 3 and 4 increased their primary productivity by c. 1 t ha−1 season−1, their milk production by 156 and 45 L season−1, respectively, but decreased the production of edible energy (by 2000 and 250 \{MJ\} ha−1 season−1) and protein (by 20 and 3 kg ha−1 season−1). By bringing in a more productive cow the primary productivity increased even further in Farm Type 3 (up to 5 t ha−1 season−1), as did milk production (up to c. 1000 L season−1), edible energy (up to c. 10,000 \{MJ\} ha−1 season−1) and protein (up to c. 100 kg ha−1 season−1). The impact of livestock management on the recycling of nutrients and on the efficiency of nutrient use at farm scale can be large, provided that enough nutrients are present in or enter the system to be redistributed. An increase in N cycling efficiency through improved manure handling from 25 to 50% would increase the amount of N cycled in the case study farms of Type 1 and 2 by only ca. 10 kg season−1, and only 1–2 kg season−1 in Type 3 and 4. The various alternatives simulated when disregarding resource constraints contributed to narrow the productivity and efficiency gaps between poorer and wealthier farms. However, the feasibility of implementing such interventions on a large number of farms is questionable. Implications for system (re-)design and intensification strategies are discussed. "

Sorokin (strain \{CIAT\} 224) at different inoculum rates on the mortality of fourth instar nymphs of Cyrtomenus bergi Froeschner (Hem.: Cydnidae) were evaluated under laboratory and greenhouse conditions. Initially, the in vitro effects of three different concentrations of Confidor 350 \{SC\} or one concentration of its blank formulation on the vegetative growth of M. anisopliae were studied. In all tests on potato dextrose agar (PDA), significantly greater colony sizes than in the untreated control were recorded when M. anisopliae was cultured in the \{PDA\} medium amended with the insecticide and/or its blank formulation. Subsequently, C. bergi nymphal mortality was assessed in sand bioassays. A significantly higher C. bergi nymphal mortality was recorded in all experiments when M. anisopliae was applied in combination with imidacloprid compared to the fungus alone, and a synergistic interaction between the two agents was found throughout the entire experiments. Applications of M. anisopliae (1E+07 conidia/g sand) in combination with 1.05 μg imidacloprid/g sand resulted in 88.1% of C. bergi nymphal mortality compared to 39.5% when the fungus was applied alone at the same dosage, 20 days after application. The lower dosage of imidacloprid not only enhanced the efficacy of the pathogen but also lead to a reduced quantity of inoculum needed to cause high levels of nymphal mortality. 81.2% mortality was recorded 25 days after application of 1E+06 conidia/g sand and a lower dosage of imidacloprid, which was not significantly different to the mortality achieved using 1E+05 conidia/g sand and the same lower dosage. Interactions between M. anisopliae and imidacloprid were predominantly additive at low dosages of the fungus and synergistic at dosages greater than 1E+06 conidia/g sand. Combined applications of M. anisopliae and a lower dosage of imidacloprid also resulted in high mortality of C. bergi nymphs when the treatment was applied to a native Colombian soil under greenhouse conditions. Fifteen days after application, the interaction between M. anisopliae and imidacloprid was synergistic, and 30 days after the application of the treatments nymphal mortalities of 88.3 and 85% were recorded in sterile and non-sterile soil, respectively, compared to 70.8 and 41.7% in the two soil types following a sole application of M. anisopliae.

We analysed the impact of the private use of crop residues by individual farmers on crop and livestock productivity at three scales: the field, farm, and village. We collected data in the village of Koumbia, located in the Sudanian region of Burkina Faso. Three types of farmers were identified: resource-poor farmers, predominantly livestock farmers, and resource-rich farmers. The trade-offs between different uses and users of cereal crop residues at the three scales were analysed through field surveys and a simple model of biomass flows. We considered current communal use practices and two alternative scenarios of private cereal crop residue use: (i) for composting (fertility scenario) and (ii) as fodder (fodder scenario). Our analysis of current practices confirmed that farmers left around 80% of cereal crop residues on their fields. Soil fertility for cereal production therefore could be improved through crop residue management at the farm scale. We also found that communal grazing benefited farmers with high numbers of livestock. Maize grain production at the farm scale was improved in both of the simulated scenarios. Yet these scenarios had a negative impact on fodder self-sufficiency at the village scale, and on the N balance of the savannah-derived rangelands. The negative impact was greater in the fertility scenario than the fodder stock scenario. Increasing cereal productivity at the farm scale cannot be achieved without considering the trade-offs involved at the village scale. Changes in practices will require negotiations between the different types of farmers involved. Participatory innovation platforms with discussion support tools like the model presented in our study can facilitate such negotiations. "

In this study, we distinguished between farms with low and high levels of infestation at the time of harvest. A single introduction of the parasitoid D. basalis (five males and five females per kg bean seeds) in the first week following harvest resulted in weevil eradication on four farms with a low level of initial infestation. Suppression of the weevil population on the three farms with a high level of initial infestation depended on the developmental stage of the weevil population at harvest time. When weevil larvae were present as early instars, parasitoids reduced weevil populations by 88–97%. Control was ineffective in beans containing later weevil instars at time of harvest. The results show that biological control of the bean weevil by its natural enemy D. basalis under on-farm conditions can be quite successful. The effectiveness can be further improved by harvesting beans as early as possible. "

Such strategies form part of flexible farm management, an ability that may prove very valuable in the face of future climate change and market dynamics. The generally low productivity of African smallholder farming systems is usually addressed by research and development institutions by a variety of solutions for improving farm performance. However, changes to the system may affect the flexibility of farms and thus their ability to cope with variability. We quantified the added value of being flexible and how this flexibility is affected by technical changes, such as composting and cattle fattening recurrently proposed and promoted by research and development institutions and projects. The study was conducted in two villages of the agro-pastoral area of Burkina Faso, where livestock, cereals and cotton are the main farming activities. A whole-farm simulation model was developed based on information gathered during focus group meetings with farmers and detailed individual monitoring of farmers' practices. The model simulates farmers' decision rules governing the management of the cropping and livestock farm components, as well as crop and livestock production and farm gross margin. Using the existing decision rules, current farm performance was simulated by assessing the cereal balance, the fodder balance and the whole farm gross margin. Then, by comparing the mean and the coefficient of variation of these indicators resulting from (a) the existing decision rules (baseline scenario) and (b) a set of less flexible rules (rigid scenario), the added value of flexible management was revealed. The adoption of composting practices allowed a slight increase in gross margin associated with a decrease in its between-year variability in comparison with conventional practices. Cattle fattening only led to a higher gross margin in the years with high rainfall and low input prices when no management practices were used to limit dependence on external input. This kind of technical change thus requires increased management agility by farmers to deal with climatic and economic variability. We conclude that assessing the impact of technical interventions not only in terms of productivity but also in terms of changes in flexibility is useful for a better understanding of potential adoption of technical changes.

Using a case study approach and assuming limited conservation resources, this approach is applied to calculate the maximum diversity which can be conserved based on a clustering of cacao species (Theobroma cacao L.). A conservation budget allocation model applied across a set of ten clusters and nine subclusters of cacao, together with the use of alternative diversity and risk measures, allowed for an evaluation of a range of potential conservation outcomes. Alternative risk measures generally resulted in the allocation of conservation funds to the same priority clusters of cacao (Criollo and Curaray). However, the use of the number of locally common alleles as an alternative to the original Weitzman diversity measure produced a markedly different result, prioritising the Purús cluster in Western Amazonia. The Curaray cluster was highly prioritised under both diversity measures, indicating its distinctiveness relative to both the Criollo and Purús clusters. We conclude that the Weitzman approach can indeed allow diversity comparisons to be made between the outcomes of different \{PGR\} conservation strategies, although subjective decisions regarding the choice of diversity and risk measures remain.

The combined use of organic residue and fertilizer inputs is advocated for its positive effects on short-term nutrient supply, but the effect of the integrated use on long-term stabilization of soil organic C and N is still unclear. We conducted a 1.5-y soil incubation experiment with maize (Zea mays) residue and urea fertilizer to examine the stabilization of C and N in four Sub-Saharan African soils differing in texture (sand, sandy loam, clay loam, and clay). The inputs were enriched with 13C and 15N in a mirror-labelling design to trace the fate of residue-C and N, and fertilizer-N in combination. We hypothesized that combining inputs would enhance the stabilization of C and N relative to either input alone across a range of soil textures. The treatments were destructively sampled after 0.25, 0.5, and 1.5 y to assess input-derived C and N stabilization in soil macro- and microaggregate fractions. The combination treatment had a significant but small (2% of residue-applied C) increase in residue-C stabilized in the total soil after 0.25 y, but this increase did not persist after 0.5 and 1.5 y. While combining residue and fertilizer decreased the amount of residue-N stabilized within 53- to 2000-μm sized soil aggregates (e.g., 7% less at 1.5 y), it increased the stabilization of fertilizer-N at all sampling times (e.g., 20% more at 1.5 y). The increased amount of fertilizer-N stabilized was significantly greater than the amount of residue-N lost in the combined input treatments in the three finer textured soils at 1.5 y, indicating an interactive increase in the stabilization of new N. Our results indicate that combining residue with fertilizer inputs can increase the short-term stabilization of N, which has the potential to improve soil fertility. However, benefits to N stabilization from combining organic residues and fertilizer seem to be less in coarser-textured soils. "

The field-scale outputs were extrapolated to the areas encompassed by the different conservation practices at the watershed scale. The speculative estimations are presented as percentage reductions compared to the baseline scenario. When single conservation practices were implemented, reductions were 39% for sediment, 7% for TP, and 24% for SN-Tile. In contrast, losses of \{DRP\} and \{SN\} increased by 5% and 57%, respectively.

The objective of this study was to assess differences in resource endowment, crop productivity and crop residue management in selected sites in southern Africa. Three sites were selected along a gradient of intensification of crop production; Murehwa, Zimbabwe and Ruaca and Gorongosa, central Mozambique. Murehwa and Ruaca have mixed crop-livestock systems with more intensive crop production in Murehwa. Gorongosa is predominantly crop based with small livestock that do not impact on crop production. A combination of land size and cattle ownership was the major attribute that defined wealth status among farmers in mixed crop-livestock systems whereas land size and labor availability were important under crop-based extensification systems. Farm systems were more diverse where livestock was more important. The wealthiest farmers (resource group—RG1) in Murehwa produced an average of 2.2 t ha−1 maize crop residues, and productivity decreased with decrease in resource ownership with the poorest (RG4) achieving only 0.8 t ha−1. In Ruaca 1.3 and 0.5 t ha−1 was produced by \{RG1\} and \{RG4\} respectively, whereas in Gorongosa 0.4 and 0.2 t ha−1 was produced by \{RG1\} and RG4. These crop residues are insufficient to achieve the minimum threshold of soil cover (30%) required for the practice of conservation agriculture. However, they can provide sufficient feed to sustain livestock of \{RG1\} farmers in Murehwa for 63 days and 54 days for \{RG2\} farmers. In Ruaca, they can feed cattle for 37 days for \{RG1\} and 17 days for \{RG2\} farmers. The product of livestock × population density determined the extent and manner in which crop residues are used. The population density limited the extent of the grazing area, increased grazing frequency and reduced the grazing quality leading to the need to supplement animal feed with crop residues. Farmers preferentially allocate crop residues to livestock where labor is available. The crop residues fed to animals allow farmers to increase manure quantity and quality which explains the major differences in crop productivity between the different resource groups. In the absence of cattle, crop residues are burned before the cropping season to facilitate land clearance. In conclusion, land size, cattle ownership and labor availability largely define the intensity of crop production and the fate of crop residues on smallholder farms in southern Africa. "

Results show that process combination leads to an enhancement of pollutant degradation compared to the separate systems even at high flow rate (250 m3 h−1). Synergy factor due to this association ranged from 1.10 to 1.17. Furthermore, \{CO2\} selectivity has significantly improved when comparing the combined system to that with plasma alone. Moreover, we note that adding a photocatalyst in the discharge zone leads to a reduction of ozone and \{CO\} formation compared to plasma process alone. Based on this investigation, a methodology of scaling up the combined system was proposed. Indeed, as a practical application, an industrial reactor has been developed and tested for treating a real pollution from animal quartering centers.

Jinhwang were investigated. Fruit was harvested at five stages i.e., 50, 80, 110 and 140 days after anthesis (DAA). Several changes in the fruits were analyzed. The physical parameters like the fruit weight, width and length increased throughout the growth. In turn, fruit firmness, titratable acidity (TA) and starch accumulation increased during the initial growth stage and later then decreased during maturity. Total soluble solids (TSS) tended to decrease throughout fruit development. Respiration rate and ethylene production were higher at 50 \{DAA\} compared to other growth stages. Sucrose accumulation occurred later in the fruit development, however fructose was the dominant of the soluble sugars. Starch accumulation was related to the reduction of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), acid invertase (AI) and neutral invertase (NI) activities, whereas sucrose synthase activity was increased. Moreover, the \{AI\} and \{NI\} are the dominate enzymes that plays a major role in sugar accumulation and quality of mango fruit. Therefore, mango fruit should be harvested after physiological maturity at 110 DAA, when the fruit reach the optimum size, weight and starch content including maximum value of firmness, TSS, fructose content, minimum value of TA, low respiration rate and the lowest of ethylene production.

In this article, we investigate the future trajectory of \{AFOLU\} \{GHG\} emissions in Latin America, with and without efforts to mitigate, using a multi-model comparison approach. We find significant uncertainty in future emissions with and without climate policy. This uncertainty is due to differences in a variety of assumptions including (1) the role of bioenergy, (2) where and how bioenergy is produced, (3) the availability of afforestation options in climate mitigation policy, and (4) \{N2O\} and \{CH4\} emission intensity. With climate policy, these differences in assumptions can lead to significant variance in mitigation potential, with three models indicating reductions in \{AFOLU\} \{GHG\} emissions and one model indicating modest increases in \{AFOLU\} \{GHG\} emissions.

We discuss methods for data integration. In general, household determinants explain more variation than environmental factors, perhaps partly due to more error-prone measurement at the community level. Among individual children, some measures of agricultural capacity are related to lower incidence of child hunger, while among regions, measures relating to urbanness and population density show a stronger relationship.

Only a very small percentage of genetic variability has been used in crop breeding programs. Traditionally, \{F1\} plants are used to backcross to the adapted lines or populations. An alternative approach is to backcross the \{F2\} individuals selected for agronomic acceptability. Our objective was to determine whether selection before backcross would lead to more progenies with both high yield and acceptable levels of agronomic performance than direct backcross without selection. To test the feasibility of the proposed approach, we conducted parallel experiments in which two exotic sorghum accessions were crossed to two adapted sorghum parents and further backcrossing was conducted with either \{F1\} or selected \{F2\} plants. Fifty random \{S1\} families were evaluated in three test environments. Although selection before backcross resulted in a higher frequency of families with maturity equal to or earlier than those of the adapted parents, no consistent changes in grain yield and plant height were observed between populations with and without selection. Similar results were found with either an inbred or a population as the recurrent parents. Given these findings and the extra generation required, we do not recommend selection before backcross in the process of introgression of exotic germplasm. "

Wild food plants are important elements of biodiversity in rice fields and are critical components to the subsistence of poor farmers. The spatial and seasonal distribution of wild food plants were analysed across different sub-systems occurring within paddy ecosystems in two adjacent rice farming villages in Kalasin, Northeast Thailand. Data were collected in 102 sampling sites corresponding to seven sub-systems including tree rows, mounds, field margins, shelters, ponds, pond margins and levees. Frequency of occurrence and absolute abundance were quantified for each species in the two seasons of two years, and data on uses of wild food plant species were collected through focus group discussions. A total of 42 species from 28 botanical families were reported, and one third of these have been classified as weeds of rice by other authors. Results show that species abundance, frequency of occurrence and diversity varied seasonally and spatially within paddy rice ecosystems. Higher diversity indexes were observed in the monsoon in most sub-systems. The most diverse sub-systems in the monsoon were shelters, mounds and pond margins, and tree rows and mounds in the dry season. Field margins, ponds and levees presented lower diversity, but are habitat of aquatic species important for the local diet, such as Ipomoea aquatica and Marsilea crenata. The herbs Lobelia sp. and Glinus oppositifolius, classified as rice weeds, were most abundant species in the dry season and frequently consumed. Leucaena leucocephala, of which the roots, leaves and fruits are commonly consumed as vegetable, was the most abundant tree in most sub-systems. More than half of the species were specific to one or two sub-systems due to particular niche requirements. Three quarters of wild food plant species had additional uses besides food; with ten different types of use and multiple use categories occurring in the different sub-systems. This study highlights that the development of more productive lowland rice systems may jeopardize the diversity of wild food plant species in the rice landscape, which is important for the food security of the rural poor.

Phylum-level analysis of the hyper-thermal compost revealed drastic changes of the sludge structures (each relative abundance) from Firmicutes (average 47.8%), Proteobacteria (average 22.3%), and Bacteroidetes (average 10.1%) to two main phyla including Firmicutes (73.6%) and Actinobacteria (25.0%) with less Proteobacteria (∼0.3%) and Bacteroidetes (∼0.1%). Furthermore, we determined the predominant species (each relative abundance) of the hyper-thermal compost including Firmicutes related to Staphylococcus cohnii (13.8%), Jeotgalicoccus coquinae (8.01%), and Staphylococcus lentus (5.96%), and Actinobacteria related to Corynebacterium stationis (6.41%), and found that these species were not predominant in wastewater sludge. In contrast, we did not observe any common structures among eight other composts produced, using the hyper-thermal composts as the inoculums, under thermophilic conditions from different materials. Principle coordinate analysis of the hyper-thermal compost indicated a large difference in bacterial community structures from material sludge and other composts. These results suggested that a distinct bacterial community structure was formed by hyper-thermal composting. "

We compare two carbon tax scenarios with a business-as-usual scenario of anticipated future energy demand. In the short term, with carbon prices reaching around $15/tCO2 by 2030, most models agree that the reduction in consumer spending, as a proxy for welfare, is limited to about 0.3%. By 2050, at carbon prices of $165/tCO2, there is much more divergence in the estimated impact on consumer spending as well as \{GDP\} across models and regions, which reflects uncertainties about technology costs and substitution opportunities between technologies. We observe that the consequences of increasingly higher carbon prices, in terms of reduced consumer spending and GDP, tend to be fairly linear with the carbon price in our \{CGE\} models. However, the consequences are divergent and nonlinear in our econometric model, that is linked to an energy system model that simulates step-changes in technology substitution. The results of one model show that climate policy measures can have positive effects on consumer spending and GDP, which results from an investment stimulus and the redistribution of carbon price revenues to consumers.

This approach generates large datasets with thousands of simulated crop yield data. Such datasets potentially provide new information but it is difficult to summarize them in a useful way due to their structural complexities. An associated issue is that it is not straightforward to compare crops and to interpolate the results to alternative climate scenarios not initially included in the simulation protocols. Here we demonstrate that statistical models based on random-coefficient regressions are able to emulate ensembles of process-based crop models. An important advantage of the proposed statistical models is that they can interpolate between temperature levels and between \{CO2\} concentration levels, and can thus be used to calculate temperature and [CO2] thresholds leading to yield loss or yield gain, without re-running the original complex crop models. Our approach is illustrated with three yield datasets simulated by 19 maize models, 26 wheat models, and 13 rice models. Several statistical models are fitted to these datasets, and are then used to analyze the variability of the yield response to [CO2] and temperature. Based on our results, we show that, for wheat, a [CO2] increase is likely to outweigh the negative effect of a temperature increase of +2 °C in the considered sites. Compared to wheat, required levels of [CO2] increase are much higher for maize, and intermediate for rice. For all crops, uncertainties in simulating climate change impacts increase more with temperature than with elevated [CO2]. "

However, its higher composition of reducing sugars (i.e., glucose and fructose), which inhibit sucrose crystallization, hinders the production of sugar from high yield sugarcane. Under the conventional integrated sugar–ethanol manufacturing system, high biomass yield causes only the increase of ethanol production because of the increase in unrecovered sugar after extraction, which represents a failure in resolving the competition. The technology presented here is the world's first to solve this problem via selective ethanol fermentation using Saccharomyces dairenensis, an unconventional yeast that ferments only reducing sugars and leaves sucrose untouched. A laboratory-scale test using sugarcane juices with a high composition of reducing sugars (100 g kg−1) resulted in a sucrose crystal yield increase from a single extraction, from 16.2 to 65.1%, by introducing selective fermentation. The second extraction, from the molasses, which was enabled by the lowered residual reducing sugar composition, further enhanced the total sugar crystal yield (up to 83.4%). A simulation of the application of this technology in the U.S.A. revealed that both sugar and ethanol production were enhanced, whereas sugar production declined by the mere adoption of high yield cultivar, even with the increase in sugarcane yield.

Viral \{DNA\} was successfully extracted from cards stored at room temperature for 9 months. The diversity of 127 \{MSV\} isolates was analysed by PCR-generated RFLPs. Six representative isolates having different \{RFLP\} patterns and causing either severe, moderate or mild disease symptoms, were chosen for amplification from \{FTA\} cards by bacteriophage ϕ29 \{DNA\} polymerase using the TempliPhi™ system. Full-length genomes were inserted into a cloning vector using a unique restriction enzyme site, and sequenced. The 1.3-kb \{PCR\} product amplified directly from FTA-eluted \{DNA\} and used for \{RFLP\} analysis was also cloned and sequenced. Comparison of cloned whole genome sequences with those of the original \{PCR\} products indicated that the correct virus genome had been cloned and that no errors were introduced by the ϕ29 polymerase. This is the first successful large-scale application of \{FTA\} card technology to the field, and illustrates the ease with which large numbers of infected samples can be collected and stored for downstream molecular applications such as diversity analysis and cloning of potentially new virus genomes.

In this paper we implement the Rapid Appraisal of Agricultural Innovation Systems (RAAIS) as a diagnostic tool to identify specific and generic entry points for innovations to address parasitic weeds in rain-fed rice production in Tanzania. Data were gathered across three study sites in Tanzania where parasitic weeds are eminent (Kyela, Songea Rural and Morogoro Rural districts). The results demonstrate that in Tanzania, weeds in general and parasitic weeds in particular receive little attention in agricultural research, training and education curricula. Crop protection policies mainly focus on the control of (insect) pest and diseases and there is relatively little attention for weed prevention, which is essential for addressing parasitic weed problems effectively. Specific entry points for innovation include increasing awareness of parasitic weed problems among farmers, extension and crop protection officers and policymakers. In regions where awareness is relatively high, participatory research approaches can provide a basis for developing locally adapted parasitic weed management strategies. Generic entry points for innovation include enhanced collaboration and interaction between stakeholders across different levels, for example in multi-stakeholder platforms. This can provide the basis for developing and implementing coherent policy and development strategies to address structural constraints in the agricultural system, including the promotion of clean local seed systems, investments in physical and knowledge infrastructure development, adequate backstopping of agricultural extension officers, agribusiness training for farmers, quality control of agricultural inputs, timely access to agricultural inputs, and improved access to markets for farmers. Together the specific and generic entry points can strengthen the innovation capacity of Tanzania's agricultural system to address parasitic weed problems, as well as other complex agricultural problems.

Research efforts to improve farm productivity increasingly focus on resource interactions and trade-offs operating at farm-scale. Farm-scale models that integrate summary models of the various subsystems (crops, livestock, household) are proposed to analyse the complexity of management systems. NUANCES-FIELD is a summary model of the crop/soil system that calculates seasonal crop production based on resource availability, capture and utilization efficiencies. A detailed mechanistic crop growth model, APSIM, was used to generate parameters and variables that can be introduced as descriptive functions in NUANCES-FIELD. To such end, we first parameterized and tested \{APSIM\} based on several field experiments carried out on different soil types in western Kenya farms where nitrogen and/or phosphorus were applied. The model was further configured to generate nitrogen and phosphorus response curves as a function of soil condition (carbon content, clay content, phosphorus-sorption characteristics) and the effects of alternative weed management scenarios in relation to labour availability. Nitrogen, phosphorus and rainfall capture efficiencies ranged between 0.22–0.85 kg kg−1, 0.05–0.29 kg kg−1 and 0.10–0.53 mm mm−1, respectively, depending on soil nutrient and physical conditions. Variation in the integrated seasonal fraction of radiation intercepted (intFRINT) with plant density was adequately described by the function y = 0.058x + 0.11 within a range of 1.5–5.5 maize plants per m2. Investigation of weed management using the \{APSIM\} model identified a weed-free period of at least five weeks from maize emergence for minimum yield loss from weed–crop competition. The simulation exercises confirmed that resource-use efficiencies sharply decrease on moving from relatively fertile fields ‘close’ to the homestead towards degraded ‘remote’ fields within the same farm, giving impetus to expedite the search for better targeted management strategies for spatially-heterogeneous farms.

Over the past 30 years rapid land use change in this area has substantially reduced wildlife habitat. Tsetse control operations are often blamed for this. In this study, we quantify this change for the Dande Communal Area, Mbire District, of the Mid-Zambezi Valley and analyse the contribution of three major potential drivers: (1) increase in human population; (2) increase in cattle population (and the expansion of associated plough-based agriculture), and; (3) expansion of cotton farming. Although direct effects of land use change on wildlife densities could not be proven, our study suggests that the consequences for elephant and buffalo numbers are negative. All three of the above drivers have contributed to the observed land use change. However, we found farmland to have expanded faster than the human population, and to have followed a similar rate of expansion in cattle sparse, tsetse infested areas as in tsetse free areas where cattle-drawn plough agriculture dominates. This implies the existence of a paramount driver, which we demonstrate to be cotton farming. Contrary to common belief, we argue that tsetse control was not the major trigger behind the dramatic land use change observed, but merely alleviated a constraint to cattle accumulation. We argue that without the presence of a cash crop (cotton), land use change would have been neither as extensive nor as rapid as has been observed. Therefore, conservation agencies should be as concerned by the way people farm as they are by population increase. Conserving biodiversity without jeopardising agricultural production will require the development of innovative technological and institutional options in association with policy and market interventions.

As a consequence, pesticide overuse remains rampant in many cropping systems, while in others, a complete lack of safe, affordable and effective pest control options leaves farmers vulnerable in face of herbivore attack. In this study, we describe the current status of \{CBC\} research in a wide variety of agro-production systems outside North America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Western Europe. We summarize information on (1) a variety of \{CBC\} themes related to natural enemy biology and ecology, (2) factors that either disrupt or enhance natural enemy efficacy, and (3) field evaluation of \{CBC\} schemes. A total of 390 CBC-related literature records from 53 different crops were considered. Most records were from China, Brazil, or Cuba, while no \{CBC\} references were found from several developing countries. \{CBC\} research primarily focused on habitat management, with 71 records on general habitat manipulation and 80 records on the effects of inter-or cover-crops on natural enemy abundance or efficacy. The effects of deliberate modification of disturbance regimes, through alterations in pesticide use or tillage, on natural enemies were well-characterized in many cropping systems. For each of the \{CBC\} themes, research progress was assessed and opportunities were identified to translate current findings into practical solutions. On a crop level, most research was targeted at rice, maize and cotton. No \{CBC\} records were found for key staple crops such as yams, taro, sago or breadfruit; fruits such as papaya, pineapple and avocado; or forage crops. Also, millet, lentils, barley and plantain, all crops grown mainly in the developing world, received limited \{CBC\} research attention. \{CBC\} research has been done on myriad arthropod pests, including species with high levels of insecticide resistance such as Chilo suppressalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) and Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). However, almost 70% of pests with high incidence of insecticide resistance have been overlooked. Lastly, we contrast country-specific \{CBC\} research advances with the national level of insecticide use and importation, and identify lucrative opportunities for countries to save funds through targeted research investment. Based upon our delineation of the current status of CBC, we indicate potential for well-orchestrated regional research projects to pursue higher levels of \{CBC\} integration into current pest management schemes. This work constitutes a first step in drawing a roadmap for developing-world research that provides local farmers with safe, low-cost means to control damaging insect pests, safeguard harvests and secure their livelihoods.

Farmers selected preferred varieties and explained their reasons (criteria) for making the selections. Seven promiscuous varieties had better yields than a local one. Farmers’ selection criteria fell into three broad categories relating to yield, appearance and labour. Selection criteria were not primarily aimed to improve soil fertility.

Following a review of the watershed management literature, and brief program and methodological overviews, the paper explores in detail the concepts of “participation” and “integration” in watershed management. Conceptual and methodological dimensions of the terms are discussed in the context of a watershed implementation process, clarifying how “watershed issues” are defined by local users, how “stakeholders” are defined with respect to those issues, and how participation and integration may be operationalized in practice. Data are selectively chosen from different pilot sites to illustrate how concepts underlying watershed management have been refined, and methods improved. It is clear that “participation” in problem diagnosis and program implementation must move beyond community-level fora to socially-disaggregated processes and explicit management of trade-offs to diverse groups. Secondly, integration does not come about through implementation of parallel interventions, but rather through an explicit analysis of potential trade-offs and synergies of interventions to diverse system components, and strategies to define and reach systems-level goals. Each approach requires attention to ways to optimize returns to diverse social groups and system components while minimizing negative spin-offs. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications for agricultural research and development in the eastern African region. "

In addition to classic macroscopic variables we also monitored some leaf-level cellular processes involved in protein turnover. Both biochar and earthworms significantly increased shoot biomass production. However, biochar had a higher effect on the number of leaves (+87%) and earthworms on leaf area (+89%). Biochar also significantly increased the leaf turnover. At the cellular level, biochar but not earthworms enhanced protein catabolism by an increase in leaf proteolytic activities. This could be related to the increased expression of three of the six genes tested related to protein catabolism, one serine protease gene OsSP2 (+24%), one aspartic acid protease gene, Oryzasin (+162%) and one cysteine protease gene OsCatB (+257%). Furthermore, biochar also enhanced the expression level of two genes linked to protein anabolism, coding for the small and large subunits of rubisco (+33% and +30%, for rbcS and rbcL, respectively), the most abundant protein in leaves. In conclusion, our data gives evidence that biochar increased rice biomass production through increased leaf protein turnover (both catabolism and anabolism) whereas earthworms also increased rice biomass production but not through changes in the rate of protein turnover. We hypothesize that earthworms increase nitrogen uptake at a low cost for the plant through a simultaneous increase in mineralization rate and root biomass, probably through the release in the soil of plant growth factors. This could allow plants to accumulate more biomass without an increase in nitrogen metabolism at the leaf level, and without having to support the consecutive energy cost that must bear plants in the biochar treatment.

We aimed to test the hypothesis that ancient raised fields were “re-engineered” by non-human soil organisms, leading to their maintenance against erosion. In a raised-field landscape in a seasonally flooded coastal savanna of French Guiana, we characterized the distribution of soil macroinvertebrates (ants, termites, earthworms) and plant roots between ancient raised fields (in this site, circular mounds) and inter-mound areas and between dry and wet seasons, and quantified the influence of these organisms on soil physical properties and texture. Social insect colonies were highly concentrated in mound soils; their density and species richness were maintained across seasons. Biomass of plant roots was higher in mounds than in inter-mound areas. Adult earthworms were inactive in deep soil layers during the dry season, becoming active at the surface of mounds during the wet season. Combined engineering activities of these organisms in the soil of ancient raised fields led to the accumulation of stable macroaggregates and pores, which should reduce the redistribution of fine soil particles between mounds and inter-mounds caused by erosion. Since their abandonment, and perhaps before, raised fields have attracted a diverse and abundant community of soil engineers that enhance the stability of mound soils, allowing their maintenance against erosion.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term (up to nine years) impacts of nutrient management strategies and their local feasibility on crop productivity, soil fertility status and rainfall infiltration on two contrasting soil types and different prior management regimes in Murehwa, Zimbabwe. The nutrient management strategies employed in the study were: a control with no fertiliser, amendments of 100 kg N ha−1, 100 kg N + lime, three rates of manure application (5, 15 and 25 t ha−1) in combination with 100 kg N ha−1, and three rates of P fertiliser (10, 30 and 50 kg P ha−1) in combination with 100 kg N, 20 kg Ca, 5 kg Zn and 10 kg Mn ha−1. Maize grain yields in sandy soils did not respond to the sole application of 100 kg N ha−1; manure application had immediate and incremental benefits on crop yields on the sandy soils. A combination of 25 t ha−1 manure and 100 kg N gave the largest treatment yield of 9.3 t ha−1 on the homefield clay soils, 6.1 t ha−1 in the clay outfield, 7.6 t ha−1 in the homefield and 3.4 t ha−1 in the eighth season. Yields of the largest manure application on the sandy outfields were comparable to yields with 100 kg N in combination with 30 kg P, 20 kg Ca, 5 kg Zn and 10 kg Mn ha−1 in the homefields suggesting the need to target nutrients differently to different fields. Manure application improved rainfall infiltration in the clay soils from 21 to 31 mm h−1 but on the sandy soils the manure effect on infiltration was not significant. Despite the large manure applications, crop productivity and \{SOC\} build-up in the outfield sandy soils was small highlighting the difficulty to recover the fertility of degraded soils. The major cause of poor crop productivity on the degraded sandy soils despite the large additions of manure could not be ascertained. The current practice of allocating manure and fertiliser to fields closest to homesteads exacerbates land degradation in the sandy outfields and increases soil fertility gradients but results in the most harvest for the farm. On clay soils, manure may be targeted to outfields and mineral fertiliser to homefields to increase total crop productivity. Farmers who owned cattle in the study site can achieve high manure application rates on small plots, and manure application can be rotated according to crop sequences. Consistent application of manure in combination with mineral fertilisers can be an effective option to improve crop yield, \{SOC\} and moisture conservation under smallholder farming conditions. Combined manure and mineral fertiliser application can be adapted locally as a feasible entry point for ecological intensification in mixed crop–livestock systems. "

We hypothesise that substitution of triple super phosphate (TSP) fertiliser with farmyard manure (FYM) and its localised application in the planting row increases the agronomic use efficiency (AE) of the P fertiliser applied. Field experiments were conducted during the 2009 long rains (LRs) and short rains (SRs) at three sites (Sega, Bokoli and Teso) located in western Kenya, to assess (i) the effect of concentrating \{FYM\} in different areas of the planting rows, (ii) \{FYM\} and \{TSP\} applications at different substitution rates and (iii) the effect of \{FYM\} and \{TSP\} additions and/or their combinations on soil pH, available P, maize yields, \{AE\} and economic benefits. Treatments included substituting \{TSP\} by \{FYM\} at 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% of the 26 kg P ha−1 recommended rate. Further, 13 kg P ha−1 \{FYM\} was either applied to 100% of planting area (i.e. broadcast) or localised in only 50% or 25%, of the planting area of the maize row. Results show that \{FYM\} and \{TSP\} combinations increased maize grain yields by over 200% in Sega, 90–150% in Teso and 20–50% in Bokoli relative to the control. The \{AE\} largely depended on the relative fertility of the soils but increased with an increase in \{FYM\} in the substitutions. Soil pH and available P were improved by \{FYM\} applications only in the second season (2009 SRs). Maximising P from \{FYM\} in the substitutions increased net benefits by over 33% with gross benefit cost ratios &gt; 4.5 $ $−1 relative to sole \{TSP\} application at 26 kg P ha−1. Concentrating \{FYM\} in 25% of the planting area gave over 32% increases in net benefits relative to broadcast. This study confirms that it is possible to reduce the quantity of \{FYM\} if it is applied only in the planting row but its profitability largely depends on the quality of the material selected. "

The “Push–Pull” technology (“PPT”) has been described as an appropriate innovative technology capable of addressing these constraints. The technology involves intercropping maize with Desmodium and planting Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) around the intercrop, but in the current study a modified \{PPT\} was used and Napier grass was not included. Field trials were conducted in two locations in western Kenya during 4 subsequent seasons to test the hypothesis that maize yield, the degree of Striga suppression and economic benefits of intercropping maize with Desmodium are affected by: (i) the related biomass production by different Desmodium species and (ii) the cutting regime of the Desmodium. Maize was intercropped with Desmodium uncinatum (Jacq.) DC, cv Silverleaf or Desmodium intortum (Mill.) Urb. cv Greenleaf, and treatments with sole maize (with and without urea) were included for comparison. To eliminate phosphorus (P) deficiency, all treatments received basal P. The first two Desmodium cutting events were fixed at land preparation i.e. at the start of every season, and 4 weeks later, following the recommended practice, while the third cutting was varied and conducted at 9, 12 or 18 weeks after planting maize. Maize yield in the Desmodium–maize intercropping system was only higher than sole maize without urea from the third season. This implies that when P is not limiting inclusion of Desmodium spp. into the maize cropping system would provide a substitute for inorganic N fertilizers to enhance crop growth and yield after Desmodium becomes well established. Cumulative maize grain yield over the four seasons with the D. intortum and D. uncinatum intercrops were 6.3 and 7.0, and 10.9 and 11.6 t ha−1 in Busia and Siaya, respectively, and significantly higher than or comparable to a maize monocrop (5.8 and 11.8 t ha−1). Average net benefits from Desmodium intercropping over the four seasons were increased by 1290 and 918$ ha−1 relative to the maize monocrop in Busia and Siaya, respectively. Biomass yields were significantly higher for D. intortum than for D. uncinatum. Varying the time of the third Desmodium cutting had little effect on Desmodium biomass yields or maize grain yields in Busia, while in Siaya, D. intortum biomass yields were highest when cut at 12 weeks after planting. In the Desmodium intercropping systems, Striga counts were reduced by 95% in Busia and by 65–90% in Siaya with higher reductions when Desmodium was cut at 18 weeks after planting. In summary, the use of \{PPT\} provides robust and high economic benefits to smallholder farmers in western Kenya. The use of D. uncinatum with the third cutting at 18 weeks after planting is recommended, but can be modified according to the need for fodder without much effect on maize yield or revenue. "

On-station field experiments were conducted in three contrasting agro-ecological sites of Rwanda (Kibungo low rainfall with medium soil fertility, Rubona high rainfall with low soil fertility and Ruhengeri high rainfall with high soil fertility) to explore germplasm × environment interactions. Five different plant densities (plants ha−1): 1428, 2500, 3333, 4444 and 5000 and two cooking (“Ingaju”, “Injagi”) and one beer (“Intuntu”) cultivars were investigated. The effect of plant density on plant performance (growth and yield) over two cropping cycles in low input systems was determined. The effects of site × cultivar and site × density interactions on yield traits were significant (p &lt; 0.05). Annual yield increased with increasing plant density but strongly depended on agro-ecological site (from 6.1 to 9.2 t ha−1 yr−1 at Kibungo, 9.5 to 21.5 t ha−1 yr−1 at Rubona and 7.0 to 25.0 t ha−1 yr−1 at Ruhengeri). Yields of beer cultivars increased with density, but those of cooking cultivars decreased. Maximum yields were attained at 4444 plants ha−1 at Kibungo and Rubona whilst yields increased linearly beyond this level at Ruhengeri. Crop cycle duration was prolonged with increasing plant density. Relationships between bunch yield, the total above ground dry matter yields and soil chemical properties suggest that nutrient deficiencies were larger at Kibungo (e.g. K) and Rubona (e.g. K, P, Ca and Mg) compared with Ruhengeri, where yield correlated significantly with leaf area index (LAI). \{LAI\} increases up to 4, where 95% of solar radiation was intercepted by the crop canopy, indicating that increasing the \{LAI\} above 4 would have little effect on production. Evaporation was much greater at lower rainfall areas (e.g. Kibungo) and accompanied by negative annual water deficit (−135 mm yr−1) than at high rainfall areas (e.g. Ruhengeri) with positive water surplus (382 mm yr−1). Growing degree days from planting to bunch harvest were higher at Kibungo (3675 °C days) but much less at the Ruhengeri cooler site (1729 °C days), implying temperature is not restrictive at Ruhengeri. This study showed that the optimal density for bananas depends on water availability, soil fertility and cultivar, which serves as an entry point to maximize yield potential for the East African smallholder farmers rather than using a uniform blanket recommended density. We suggest that agronomic optimal plant density is lower (&lt;4444 plants ha−1) in low rainfall (&lt;1000 mm yr−1) and less fertile areas but seem to be higher (&gt;5000 plants ha−1) in areas with high fertility which receive high rainfall (&gt;1300 mm yr−1).

A major portion of this reactive-N, applied as fertilizer to crops, leaks into the environment with cascading negative effects on ecosystem functions and contributes to global warming. Natural ecosystems use multiple pathways of the N-cycle to regulate the flow of this element. By contrast, the large amounts of N currently applied in agricultural systems cycle primarily through the nitrification process, a single inefficient route that allows much of the reactive-N to leak into the environment. The fact that present agricultural systems do not channel this reactive-N through alternate pathways is largely due to uncontrolled soil nitrifier activity, creating a rapid nitrifying soil environment. Regulating nitrification is therefore central to any strategy for improving nitrogen-use efficiency. Biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) is an active plant-mediated natural function, where nitrification inhibitors released from plant roots suppress soil-nitrifying activity, thereby forcing N into other pathways. This review illustrates the presence of detection methods for variation in physiological regulation of BNI-function in field crops and pasture grasses and analyzes the potential for its genetic manipulation. We present a conceptual framework utilizing a BNI-platform that integrates diverse crop science disciplines with ecological principles. Sustainable agriculture will require development of production systems that include new crop cultivars capable of controlling nitrification (i.e., high BNI-capacity) and improved agronomic practices to minimize leakage of reactive-N during the N-cycle, a critical requirement for increasing food production while avoiding environmental damage.

It is actively promoted by international research and development organisations, with such strong advocacy that critical debate is stifled. Claims for the potential of \{CA\} in Africa are based on widespread adoption in the Americas, where the effects of tillage were replaced by heavy dependence on herbicides and fertilizers. \{CA\} is said to increase yields, to reduce labour requirements, improve soil fertility and reduce erosion. Yet empirical evidence is not clear and consistent on many of these points nor is it always clear which of the principles of \{CA\} contribute to the desired effects. Although cases can be found where such claims are supported there are equally convincing scientific reports that contradict these claims. Concerns include decreased yields often observed with CA, increased labour requirements when herbicides are not used, an important gender shift of the labour burden to women and a lack of mulch due to poor productivity and due to the priority given to feeding of livestock with crop residues. Despite the publicity claiming widespread adoption of CA, the available evidence suggests virtually no uptake of \{CA\} in most \{SSA\} countries, with only small groups of adopters in South Africa, Ghana and Zambia. We conclude that there is an urgent need for critical assessment under which ecological and socio-economic conditions \{CA\} is best suited for smallholder farming in SSA. Critical constraints to adoption appear to be competing uses for crop residues, increased labour demand for weeding, and lack of access to, and use of external inputs. "

Di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) was compared to manure, ashes, combinations of those, 1/2 Tithonia 1/2 \{DAP\} (TD) and no input. 1/3rd of the labour was saved when placing seeds in trenches as compared to individual holes without losing significant grain yield. Broadcasting requires 1/9th of the planting time while losing only 15% grain. 5% grain was lost by weeding once instead of twice, while saving 36% of the time. The time saved at planting can be more productively invested in collecting inputs. Plots without input yielded 537 kg ha−1 grain and 642 kg ha−1 biomass in 2006. Inputs increased both grain and biomass yields significantly with 27–51%, without significant difference between local and mineral inputs (with exception of TD).

Fertilizers were applied at rates of 0N–50P–600K, 150N–50P–600K, 400N–0P–600K, 400N–50P–0K, 400N–50P–250K and 400N–50P–600K kg ha−1 yr−1. In addition 60Mg–6Zn–0.5Mo–1B kg ha−1 yr−1 was applied to all treatments, with the exception of the control plots which received no fertilizer. Fresh bunch mass and yield increased with successive cycles. Yield increases above the control ranged from 3.1 to 6.2 kg bunch−1 (average bunch weight for all treatments 11.5 kg bunch−1) and 2.2–11.2 Mg ha−1 yr−1 (average yield for all treatments 15.8 Mg ha−1 yr−1) at Kawanda, compared with 12.4–16.0 kg bunch−1 (average bunch weight for all treatments 14.7 kg bunch−1) and 7.0–29.5 Mg ha−1 yr−1 (average yield for all treatments 17.9 Mg ha−1 yr−1) at Ntungamo. The limiting nutrients at both sites were in the order K &gt; P &gt; N. Potassium, N and P foliar nutrient mass fractions were below previously established Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) norms, with the smallest K mass fractions observed in the best yielding plots at Ntungamo. Total nutrient uptakes (K &gt; N &gt; P) were higher at Ntungamo as compared with Kawanda, probably due to better soil moisture availability and root exploration of the soil. Average N, P and K conversion efficiencies for two crop cycles at both sites amounted to 49.2 kg finger \{DM\} kg−1 N, 587 kg finger \{DM\} kg−1 P and 10.8 kg finger \{DM\} kg−1 K. Calibration results of the model \{QUEFTS\} using data from Ntungamo were reasonable (R2 = 0.57, \{RMSE\} = 648 kg ha−1). Using the measured soil chemical properties and yield data from an experiment at Mbarara in southwest Uganda, the calibrated \{QUEFTS\} model predicted yields well (R2 = 0.68, \{RMSE\} = 562 kg ha−1). We conclude that banana yields can be increased by use of mineral fertilizers, but fertilizer recovery efficiencies need to improve substantially before promoting wide-scale adoption. "

Little is known about the interactive effects of soil fertility management and soil macrofauna diversity on soil aggregation and \{SOM\} dynamics in tropical arable cropping systems. A study was conducted in a long-term trial at Kabete, Central Kenya, to investigate the effects of organic inputs (maize stover or manure) and inorganic fertilizers on soil macrofauna abundance, biomass and taxonomic diversity, water stable aggregation, whole soil and aggregate-associated organic C and N, as well as the relations between these variables. Differently managed arable systems were compared to a long-term green fallow system representing a relatively undisturbed reference. Fallowing, and application of farm yard manure (FYM) in combination with fertilizer, significantly enhanced earthworm diversity and biomass as well as aggregate stability and C and N pools in the top 15 cm of the soil. Earthworm abundance significantly negatively correlated with the percentage of total macroaggregates and microaggregates within macroaggregates, but all earthworm parameters positively correlated with whole soil and aggregate associated C and N, unlike termite parameters. Factor analysis showed that 35.3% of the total sample variation in aggregation and C and N in total soil and aggregate fractions was explained by earthworm parameters, and 25.5% by termite parameters. Multiple regression analysis confirmed this outcome. The negative correlation between earthworm abundance and total macroaggregates and microaggregates within macroaggregate could be linked to the presence of high numbers of Nematogenia lacuum in the arable treatments without organic amendments, an endogeic species that feeds on excrements of other larger epigeic worms and produces small excrements. Under the conditions studied, differences in earthworm abundance, biomass and diversity were more important drivers of management-induced changes in aggregate stability and soil C and N pools than differences in termite populations.

Effects on degradation in ruminal fluid and ruminal fluid followed by incubation in HCl/pepsin were evaluated using a modified two-step in vitro method.

There was a 25–63% reduction in \{CP\} degradation in the rumen due to the addition of CT. The extent of the effect was dependent on the \{CT\} source (P&lt;0.001). Depending on \{CT\} source, an increase in \{CT\} concentration also reduced (P&lt;0.001) total \{DM\} and \{CP\} degradation (ruminal fluid+HCl/pepsin) by 24–73% and 16–55%, respectively. The proportion of incubated \{CP\} which was not degraded in ruminal fluid (estimated rumen escape CP) but degraded in HCl/pepsin increased by 18 and 412% depending on \{CT\} source and \{CT\} concentration (P&lt;0.001). The highest increase was observed with \{CT\} from C. calothyrsus and the lowest with \{CT\} from L. leucocephala. HCl/pepsin degradability of rumen escape \{CP\} was also reduced with \{CT\} addition by 10 and 82% depending on \{CT\} concentration and source (P&lt;0.001). In ruminal fluid, \{CT\} from L. leucocephala seemed to have less effect on degradation of soybean meal than \{CT\} from F. macrophylla and C. calothyrsus. In contrast, when HCl/pepsin was added to soybean meal, the complexes formed between \{CP\} and \{CT\} from L. leucocephala were more resistant to degradation than those formed with the other CT. This suggests that \{CT\} from L. leucocephala were less effective in increasing degradable rumen escape \{CP\} than \{CT\} from either C. calothyrsus or F. macrophylla. "

Marker‐trait associations have been established for a diverse array of traits in these crops, and research on marker/quantitative trait loci (QTL) validation and refinement is increasingly common. Researchers are now routinely using candidate gene‐based mapping and genome‐wide linkage disequilibrium and association analysis in addition to classical \{QTL\} mapping to identify markers broadly applicable to breeding programs. Marker‐assisted selection (MAS) is practiced for enhancing various host plant resistances, several quality traits, and a number of abiotic stress tolerances in many well‐researched crops. Markers are also increasingly used to transfer yield or quality‐ enhancing \{QTL\} alleles from wild relatives to elite cultivars. Large‐scale MAS‐based breeding programs for crops such as rice, maize, wheat, barley, pearl millet, and common bean have already been initiated worldwide. Advances in “omics” technologies are now assisting researchers to address complex biological issues of significant agricultural importance: modeling genotype‐by‐environment interaction; fine‐mapping, cloning, and pyramiding of QTL; gene expression analysis and gene function elucidation; dissecting the genetic structure of germplasm collections to mine novel alleles and develop genetically structured trait‐based core collections; and understanding the molecular basis of heterosis. The challenge now is to translate and integrate this knowledge into appropriate tools and methodologies for plant breeding programs. The role of computational tools in achieving this is becoming increasingly important. It is expected that harnessing the outputs of genomics research will be an important component in successfully addressing the challenge of doubling world food production by 2050. "

Innovative integrated technologies have been developed: the ‘push–pull’ system (intercropping with Desmodium and surrounded by Napier grass), soybean and Crotalaria rotations, and imidazolinone-resistant (IR) maize seed. In 12 demonstration trials in four villages in Siaya and Vihiga districts (Kenya) and two villages in Busia (Uganda) in 2003 and 2004, 504 farmers evaluated all cropping systems and a mono-cropped continuous maize, each cropped with \{IR\} or local maize, and supplemented or not with fertilizer, totaling 16 treatments. Farmers evaluated all treatments for yield, resistance to Striga and stem borer, improvement of soil fertility, and provided an overall evaluation score, using an ordered scale of 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). Data were analyzed using ordinal regression, estimating log odds ratios. The results show significant preferences for all treatments over the control. Push–pull with \{IR\} and fertilizer had the highest log odds ratio (2.93), so the odds of farmers preferring this treatment are 18.7 times the odds that farmers prefer the control. The odds ratios for the other push–pull combinations were generally highest (9–15), followed by the rotation systems with Crotalaria (3.5–7.0), and soybeans, especially with \{IR\} maize and fertilizer (odds ratio of 5.7). In mono-cropping systems, \{IR\} maize was only appreciated in combination with fertilizer, and then only in 2004. Push–pull and Crotalaria were more appreciated in 2004 than in 2003. Farmers in Vihiga had a stronger preference for push–pull, and those in Busia for soybean rotations. Significant differences among farmers were observed, but the effects were small. Women appreciated push–pull more than men, while other technologies were gender-neutral. Older farmers were more likely to prefer push–pull and Crotalaria with fertilizer. Livestock ownership was not found to have an effect on technology preferences. Measured yield, stem borer and Striga infestation all had significant but small effects, although their inclusion did not eliminate the treatment effects, indicating that other factors are still important. \{OLS\} of the scores for different criteria on the overall score shows yield to be the most important criterion (coefficient of 0.40), followed by soil fertility enhancement (0.25) and Striga resistance (0.13). Labor saving (0.09) and stem borer resistance (0.03) are relatively minor criteria. This research shows that scoring and analysis with ordinal regression is a convenient way to solicit and analyze farmers’ preferences for new technologies, with wide applicability in farming systems and participatory research. Its application here shows that farmers like the new technologies, especially push–pull, but that there are substantial differences between years, sites and farmers. The use of this method can be very helpful to define and focus further research and formulate specific and targeted recommendations for agricultural extension. "

To ensure the generation of reproducible bioaerosols in real operating conditions of Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems and their homogeneous coating on filters, a reactor with an optimal geometry was developed. The bacterial aerosol was generated from standardised bacterial suspensions and the Gram-negative bacterial model Escherichia coli was used as the experimental organism. The bioaerosol was characterised in terms of particle size distribution, reproducibility and stability over time. The coating of aerosolised cells on the filters was then studied. The total number of aerosolised E. coli cells was different from the amount of cultivable bacterial cells extracted from filters, probably resulting from the stress of the aerosolisation process. Damages to the outer membrane of E. coli cells were clearly observed through \{SEM\} and epifluorescent microscopy analysis. The influence of important physical parameters in the reactor-aerosolisation duration, frontal velocity and relative humidity- on the amount of aerosolised cells coated on filters were also investigated. Finally, the effects of UV-A or UV-C radiation were assessed on aerosolised microorganisms coated on \{HEPA\} photocatalytic filters and on photocatalytic or non-photocatalytic filters containing activated charcoal. The \{HEPA\} photocatalytic filters demonstrated a better disinfection efficiency with full damages of the aerosolised bacterial cells, probably resulting from an optimal contact between TiO2 coating and the microorganisms. In contrast, the use of filters with activated charcoal resulted in the apparition of an inactivation threshold that could be attributed to the penetration of aerosolised cells within the activated charcoal layer and the absence of contact with the photocatalyst. However, UV-C photocatalysis was able to inactivate faster and, at the same time, mineralise biological pollutants than UV-A. "

Immediately after the coating of spores on filters, exposure to both types of \{UV\} radiation induced the appearance of an inactivation threshold for long durations of exposure probably resulting from the presence of Aspergillus niger spores inside the activated charcoal layer. The use of a thin photocatalytic filter without activated charcoal demonstrated a better disinfection efficiency with total inactivation of the spores, due to an optimal contact between spores and TiO2 coating. The effects of \{UV\} radiation were then assessed on spore germination for both types of filters. The inactivation of spores in illuminated photocatalytic filters resulted in an irreversible inhibition of the fungal germination under UV-A or UV-C radiation. In contrast, fungal spores were able to germinate in non-photocatalytic filters despite previous exposure to both types of \{UV\} radiation. The monitoring of ergosterol amounts, the major sterol of fungal membranes, corroborated these results. Finally, UV-A or UV-C radiation exposure of filters after spore germination had a lesser disinfection efficiency than experiments whereby spores had just been applied onto the filters, due to the absence of contact between the biological pollutants and the photocatalyst coating. Our results thus demonstrated the interest to use photocatalytic filters ensuring optimal contact between pollutants and TiO2 coating to lead to a total inactivation of fungal spores in filters of \{HVAC\} systems.

Crop production intensification is required to produce more food per unit area of land, while rebuilding soil fertility. We explored the impact of reallocation of limited resources on crop productivity across farms of different resource endowment in central Mozambique. The results suggested that decreasing the cropped area and concentrating resources (fertiliser, manure and labour within the farmers’ means) to smaller fields can increase total farm maize production for poor as well as relatively richer farmers in central Mozambique, but that the fertility of the retained and abandoned land is important for the overall outcome. Concentrating resources to smaller areas would in most cases also lead to increased concentrations of soil organic carbon (SOC), indicating positive effects on soil fertility and crop productivity in the long term. However, this apparently does not apply when only fertiliser is used and if harvest residues and weeds are removed or burnt. Organic inputs are thus also required, such as retention of crop residues, and applications of manure if available can further increase SOC. The study has revealed that sustainable intensification or crop production requires that multiple constraints be addressed simultaneously. Success of crop intensification options will also depend on proper targeting to different farm types as well as variability in soil fertility. Differences in resource ownership and bio-physical circumstances lead to different opportunities for individual farmers even within the same area. While targeted interventions for individual farmers might not be feasible, targeting defined farmer/endowment groups may be a sustainable pathway to increase productivity. Although smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have limited assets, the study revealed opportunities to increase crop productivity without substantial capital inputs, but more efficient use and targeting.

Retention on the soil surface of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% of the maize stover yield produced per farm, and the use of the remainder as animal feed was quantified over a 12 year period for four farm types in Murehwa, Zimbabwe. Retaining 100% maize residues in the field led to an annual loss of on average 68 and 93 kg body weight per animal for cattle on farms of the relatively wealthiest farmers (Resource Group, RG1) who had most land and cattle and \{RG2\} respectively), and is therefore unsustainable for livestock production. There was an increase in grain yield of 1.6 t farm−1 and 0.7 t farm−1 for \{RG1\} and \{RG2\} respectively. Farmers without cattle (RG3 and RG4) may have a greater incentive for retaining their crop residues but they have to invest labour to keep the residues during the dry season. However, improved crop productivity for these farmers is limited by lack of access to fertiliser. The current practice of allocating all crop residues to animals results in average gross margin of US$7429 and US$4037 for \{RG1\} and \{RG2\} farmers respectively. Our results showed that from an economic perspective, it is logical that farmers prioritise the sustenance of cattle with crop residues over soil fertility management. We conclude that at current productivity levels, farmers who own cattle have limited scope to allocate crop residues for soil cover as it leads to significant loss in animal production and economic value.

This article reports the discovery of five new sources of \{WS\} which were compared with commercial (CC) and high amylose (HA) cassava starches (19.9 and 30.2% amylose, respectively). Waxy starch gels were considerably clearer and had higher solubility and swelling power than those from CC. Pasting temperature and peak viscosity in \{WS\} were higher (68.5 °C and 1149 cP) than in \{CC\} (64.2 °C and 993 cP). No retrogradation or syneresis could be detected in refrigerated gels or after freeze/thaw cycles in any \{WS\} gel. Average λmax for WS, \{CC\} and \{HA\} were 540.2, 591.3 nm, and 607.0 nm, respectively. Amylopectins from \{WS\} displayed M ¯ w between 271 × 106 and 551 × 106 g mol−1, R ¯ G ranged between 229 and 298 nm and νG values ranged between 0.38 and 0.40 (between the sphere and the random coil).

The corrected average number of glucosyl units in a linear chain averaged 21.2 in \{WS\} and 23.1 in CC. Amylopectins from \{WS\} showed a slightly more branched structure (average 4.8%) than in \{CC\} (average 4.3%), but lower than in \{HA\} (7.0%). \{WS\} exhibited larger average granule size (15.9 μm) compared with \{CC\} (14.3 μm).

But \{YP\} has stagnated at about 10 Mg ha−1 since the Green Revolution. We present a survey of researchers’ current top yields across different environments and countries, experimentally investigate YP-related traits and radiation use efficiency (RUE) of 12 elite materials, and use a simple model to explore traits that would raise the yield ceiling. The survey indicated that maximal grain yield is between 5 and 12 Mg ha−1 depending on radiation during flowering and grain filling. The experiments conducted in several environments in the Philippines indicated that (1) different morphologies in terms of panicle number and size and leaf size lead to similar \{YP\} due to trait–trait compensation, and (2) differences in \{RUE\} are partly attributable to variation in terminal senescence which is strongly environment dependent. Simulations thus focused on post-floral physiological processes, namely dynamics of light interception, carbon assimilation and maintenance burden. Scenarios of different degree of stay-green indicated that terminal senescence is essential to limit N requirements and maintenance burden, but partial stay-green would strongly benefit \{RUE\} and YP, particularly if accompanied with increased leaf photosynthetic capacity. The need to increase pre-floral C and N reserves for grain filling is discussed, resulting in a concept to refine current ideotypes such as IRRI’s New Plant Type and China’s Super Hybrid Rice. In conclusion, current best tropical breeding products do not have higher \{YP\} than some varieties dating 30–40 years, and new concepts are needed in rice breeding. Breeding for such plants should be done under high N inputs. "

To assess these changes we conducted eight participatory mapping activities and convened 22 focus group discussions. We focused the analysis on two types of change: (1) changes in the location of ecosystem services provisioning areas and (2) changes in the stock of ecosystem services. The focal ecosystem services include services such as provision of food, raw materials and medicinal resources. Results from the study show that in the past two decades the demand for food and raw materials has intensified and, as a result, locations of provisioning areas and the stocks of ecosystem services have changed. We found anecdotal evidence that these changes correlate well with socio-economic factors such as greater need for income generation, change in livelihood practices and consumption patterns. We discuss the use of participatory mapping techniques in the context of marginalized and data-poor regions. We also show how this kind of information can strengthen existing ecosystem-based management strategies used by indigenous peoples in the Colombian Amazon. "

Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric analysis revealed 24 and 33 fungal metabolites in kunu-zaki and pito respectively, and their cereal inputs. Among the metabolites were 12 mycotoxins (alternariol, alternariolmethylether, beauvericin, deoxynivalenol, enniatin A and B, fumonisin \{B1\} (FB1), \{FB2\} and FB3, fusaproliferin, moniliformin and zearalenone). Mycotoxin levels were higher in the maize-based kunu-zaki (&lt;LOQ–123 μg/kg) and its cereal ingredients (0.1–31,200 μg/kg) than in the sorghum-based pito (&lt;LOQ–5 μg/kg) and its cereal base (1.2–85 μg/kg) respectively.

The \{UDON\} was isolated during dry and wet seasons, or during spring, summer, and autumn. The proportion of \{UDON\} present as humic substances, which was estimated as the DAX-8 adsorbed fraction, ranged from 47 to 91%, with larger values in the Sarawak than at the other sites. The yield of hydrolyzable amino acid N ranged 1.24 to 7.01mg g− 1, which correlated positively to the total N content of \{UDOM\} and tended to be larger in the order of Florida &gt; Hokkaido &gt; Sarawak samples. X-ray photoelectron \{N1s\} spectra of \{UDON\} showed a strong negative correlation between the relative abundances of amide/peptide N and primary amine N. The relative abundances of amide/peptide N and primary amine N in the Sarawak samples were smaller (70–76%) and larger (20–23%) respectively compared to those (80–88% and 4–9%) in the Florida and Hokkaido samples. Assuming terminal amino groups and amide N of peptides as major constituents of primary amine N and amide/peptide N, respectively, the average molecular weight of peptides was smaller in the Sarawak samples than that in the Florida and Hokkaido samples. Seasonal variations in \{UDON\} composition were scarce in the Sarawak and Florida samples, whereas the distribution of humic substance-N and nonhumic substance-N and compositions of amino acids and N functional groups showed a clear seasonality in the Hokkaido samples. While aromatic N increased from spring to autumn, contributions from fresh proteinaceous materials were also enhanced during autumn, resulting in the highest N content of \{UDOM\} for this season. "

The panicle weight (PW), PW/total plant weight (PW/TW), number of fertile spikelets (FS), and FS/total number of spikelets per panicle (FS/TS) of the \{INLs\} increased, while the culm weight (CW) and panicle number (PN) decreased. Most \{INLs\} produced more dry matter in the \{UP\} than in the \{IL\} culture. The \{INLs\} were clustered into three groups (A–C) according to their traits in the \{UP\} culture, and four groups (I–IV) according to their traits in the \{IL\} culture. They were then sorted into six groups (A-I, A-II, B-II, B-III, C-III, and C-IV) according to the relationships between culture conditions. The \{INLs\} of group A-II had increased panicle length (PL), PW, PW/TW, FS, and TS, and these traits were stable in both \{IL\} and \{UP\} culture. In the other groups, the trait values changed with the conditions and season. Association analyses using trait phenotype and genotype data of \{SSR\} markers detected 166 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for 10 traits, distributed on all chromosomes except 3 and 10. Of these, 81 \{QTLs\} for DH, CL, PL, CW, PW, PW/TW, PN, FS, TS, and FS/TS were newly detected. The \{INLs\} were characterized under different conditions, and dramatic trait modifications in \{IR64\} rice were associated with these QTLs, through introgression from the donor cultivars. Thus, these \{INLs\} and \{QTLs\} will be useful in genetic studies to identify the gene(s) that modified IR64, and as breeding materials for genetic improvement of Indica-type cultivars. "

Thus, it is essential to increase the efficiency in using water to ensure crop productivity. Quantifying crop water use (WU; i.e. actual evapotranspiration) is a critical step towards this goal. Here, sixteen wheat simulation models were used to quantify sources of model uncertainty and to estimate the relative changes and variability between models for simulated WU, water use efficiency (WUE, \{WU\} per unit of grain dry mass produced), transpiration efficiency (Teff, transpiration per kg of unit of grain yield dry mass produced), grain yield, crop transpiration and soil evaporation at increased temperatures and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations ([CO2]). The greatest uncertainty in simulating water use, potential evapotranspiration, crop transpiration and soil evaporation was due to differences in how crop transpiration was modelled and accounted for 50% of the total variability among models. The simulation results for the sensitivity to temperature indicated that crop \{WU\} will decline with increasing temperature due to reduced growing seasons. The uncertainties in simulated crop WU, and in particularly due to uncertainties in simulating crop transpiration, were greater under conditions of increased temperatures and with high temperatures in combination with elevated atmospheric [CO2] concentrations. Hence the simulation of crop WU, and in particularly crop transpiration under higher temperature, needs to be improved and evaluated with field measurements before models can be used to simulate climate change impacts on future crop water demand.

Acetate addition was found to drastically increase the activities of key enzymes involved in the acetate uptake (phosphate acetyltransferase and CoA transferase), acetone formation (acetoacetate decarboxylase), and butanol formation (butanol dehydrogenase) pathways. Subsequently, supplementation of acetate during acidogenesis and early solventogenesis resulted in a significant increase in \{ABE\} production. To establish an efficient \{ABE\} production system using acetate as a co-substrate, several shot strategies were investigated in batch culture. Batch cultures with two substrate shots without pH control produced 14.20 g/L butanol and 23.27 g/L \{ABE\} with a maximum specific butanol production rate of 0.26 g/(g h). Furthermore, pH-controlled (at pH 5.5) batch cultures with two substrate shots resulted in not only improved acetate consumption but also a further increase in \{ABE\} production. Finally, we obtained 15.13 g/L butanol and 24.37 g/L \{ABE\} at the high specific butanol production rate of 0.34 g/(g h) using pH-stat co-feeding method.

Agricultural production is highly vulnerable even to 2C (low-end) predictions for global mean temperatures in 2100, with major implications for rural poverty and for both rural and urban food security. Agriculture also presents untapped opportunities for mitigation, given the large land area under crops and rangeland, and the additional mitigation potential of aquaculture. This paper presents a summary of current knowledge on options to support farmers, particularly smallholder farmers, in achieving food security through agriculture under climate change. Actions towards adaptation fall into two broad overlapping areas: (1) accelerated adaptation to progressive climate change over decadal time scales, for example integrated packages of technology, agronomy and policy options for farmers and food systems, and (2) better management of agricultural risks associated with increasing climate variability and extreme events, for example improved climate information services and safety nets. Maximization of agriculture's mitigation potential will require investments in technological innovation and agricultural intensification linked to increased efficiency of inputs, and creation of incentives and monitoring systems that are inclusive of smallholder farmers. Food systems faced with climate change need urgent, broad-based action in spite of uncertainties. "

Innovation capacity in the agricultural system is studied by analysing (1) constraints within the institutional, sectoral and technological subsystems of the agricultural system, and (2) the existence and performance of the agricultural innovation support system. \{RAAIS\} combines multiple qualitative and quantitative methods, and insider (stakeholders) and outsider (researchers) analyses which allow for critical triangulation and validation of the gathered data. Such an analysis can provide specific entry points for innovations to address the complex agricultural problem under study, and generic entry points for innovation related to strengthening the innovation capacity of agricultural system and the functioning of the agricultural innovation support system. The application of \{RAAIS\} to analyse parasitic weed problems in the rice sector, conducted in Tanzania and Benin, demonstrates the potential of the diagnostic tool and provides recommendations for its further development and use.

Conservative behavior along the salinity gradient of \{DOC\} and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) has often been observed in estuaries from their freshwater end-member (salinity = 0) to the ocean (salinity = 35). While the oligo/meso-haline (salinity &lt; 10) tidal zone of upper estuaries has been suggested to be more complex and locally influenced by geomorphological and hydrological features, the environmental dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the environmental drivers controlling its source, transport, and fate have scarcely been evaluated. Here, we investigated the distribution patterns of \{DOC\} and \{CDOM\} optical properties determined by \{UV\} absorbance at 254 nm (A254) and excitation–emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) along the lower salinity range (salinity &lt; 10) of the oligo/meso-haline zone for three distinct wetland-influenced rivers; namely the Bekanbeushi River, a cool-temperate river with estuarine lake in Hokkaido, Japan, the Harney River, a subtropical river with tidally-submerged mangrove fringe in Florida, USA, and the Judan River, a small, acidic, tropical rainforest river in Borneo, Malaysia. For the first two rivers, a clear decoupling between \{DOC\} and \{A254\} was observed, while these parameters showed similar conservative behavior for the third. Three distinct EEM-PARAFAC models established for each of the rivers provided similar spectroscopic characteristics except for some unique fluorescence features observed for the Judan River. The distribution patterns of \{PARAFAC\} components suggested that the inputs from plankton and/or submerged aquatic vegetation can be important in the Bekanbeushi River. Further, \{DOM\} photo-products formed in the estuarine lake were also found to be transported upstream. In the Harney River, whereas upriver-derived terrestrial humic-like components were mostly distributed conservatively, some of these components were also derived from mangrove inputs in the oligo/meso-haline zone. Interestingly, fluorescence intensities of some terrestrial humic-like components increased with salinity for the Judan River possibly due to changes in the dissociation state of acidic functional groups and/or increase in the fluorescence quantum yield along the salinity gradient. The protein-like and microbial humic-like components were distributed differently between three wetland rivers, implying that interplay between loss to microbial degradation and inputs from diverse sources are different for the three wetland-influenced rivers. The results presented here indicate that upper estuarine oligo/meso-haline regions of coastal wetland rivers are highly dynamic with regard to the biogeochemical behavior of DOM. "

Method A total of 240 V. cholerae El Tor, \{O1\} strains, isolated from patients with cholera in Thailand during two different periods, i.e. 1999–2000 (200 strains; 193 Ogawa and 7 Inaba) and 2001–2002 (40 strains; all Inaba), were analyzed for the presence of virulence genes, namely ctxA, ctxB, zot, ace, toxR, tcpA, hlyA, nanH and ninT by PCR. For ribotyping, genomic \{DNA\} segments of the 240 strains and 10 reference V. cholerae strains isolated before 1999 from Thailand and elsewhere were digested with BglI endonuclease, subjected to a 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted onto a nylon membrane and probed with enzyme-labeled Escherichia coli rRNA. The \{DNA\} bands were visualized by autoradiography. Results Genes encoding the A and B subunits of CT, Zot, Ace, ToxR, TcpA, HlyA, NanH and NinT could be amplified from all of the 10 V. cholerae \{O1\} reference strains and from 239 of the 240 studied isolates. One Inaba isolate of 2001–2002 gave only amplicons of toxR and hlyA. For ribotyping, the 10 reference strains revealed six different patterns designated A to F. None of the 240 strains isolated in Thailand during the two periods had the A–C, E and F ribotypes. The isolates of 1999–2000 revealed ribotype D and three other ribotypes, designated G, H and I. The majority of the isolates of 2001–2002 showed ribotype G. The remaining showed other new ribotypes, J and K. Conclusions The clinical V. cholerae isolates of two epidemics from Thailand showed a sustained appearance of one epidemic V. cholerae clone, and a constant, but gradual and minor change in the genetic constituent of the other V. cholerae strains as indicated by the change of the ribotypes of the strains in the two study periods. Moreover, we found that a V. cholerae strain which cannot produce CT, Zot, Ace, TcpA, NanH and NinT can still cause symptomatic cholera. "

The PfPrx-1 showed the highest identity at amino acid level to the type \{II\} Prx among the currently known six subfamilies of mammalian Prx. The sequence identity between the PfPrx-1 and the previously reported 1-Cys Prx of P. falciparum (PfPrx-2), which corresponded to mammalian type \{VI\} Prx, was 25%. This suggests that the parasite possesses two Prx subfamilies. The PfPrx-1 showed significant sequence similarities with those of 2-Cys peroxiredoxins of plants in the \{BLASTX\} search. This may reflect the consequences of a genetic transfer from an algal endosymbiont to the parasite nucleus during evolution. The recombinant PfPrx-1 protein (rPfPrx-1) was expressed as a histidine fusion protein in Escherichia coli and purified with Ni chromatography. The rPfPrx-1 existed as dimers under non-reducing conditions and dissociated into monomers in the presence of dithiothreitol. The PfPrx-1 protein also exists as a dimer in the parasites themselves. The reduction of the oxidized enzyme by the donation of electrons from E. coli thioredoxin (Trx)/Trx reductase system was demonstrated in its reaction with H2O2, using the rPfPrx-1 protein. These results suggested that the PfPrx-1 can act as a terminal peroxidase of the parasite Trx system. An elevated expression of the PfPrx-1 protein seen in the trophozoite, the stage with active metabolism, suggests an association of the parasite Trx system with its intracellular redox control. "

The objective of this paper is to identify institutional and political constraints and opportunities for innovation to address parasitic weed problems in rice. Constraints and opportunities for innovation were studied across three nested systems: the parasitic weed control system, the crop protection system, and the agricultural system. Multi-stakeholder workshops, interviews and surveys were held to gather data on key constraints faced by different stakeholder groups across three parasitic weed infested study sites in both Tanzania and Benin. The results demonstrate that in both countries, the majority of institutional and political constraints relate to the functioning of the broader crop protection and agricultural systems and not specifically to parasitic weeds. Although differences were observed between the two countries and the different stakeholder groups, the majority of constraints perceived by the stakeholders were caused by a lack of capabilities and resources and a limited access to credit. Awareness raising of parasitic weed problems among farmers, extension and crop protection officers at the local level, combined with improved input and service supply and enhanced agricultural education and training curricula at the national level, were identified as important elements for improvement. More structural collaboration between key stakeholder groups is expected to contribute to a better recognition of agricultural problems, like that of parasitic weeds in rice, and a more timely identification of feasible solutions.

First morning urine samples were analyzed and urinary biomarker levels correlated with mycotoxin levels in foods consumed the day before urine collection. A total of eight analytes were detected in 61/120 (50.8%) of studied urine samples, with ochratoxin A, aflatoxin \{M1\} and fumonisin \{B1\} being the most frequently occurring biomarkers of exposure. These mycotoxin biomarkers were present in samples from all age categories, suggestive of chronic (lifetime) exposures. Rough estimates of mycotoxin intake suggested some exposures were higher than the tolerable daily intake. Overall, rural consumer populations from Nasarawa were more exposed to several mixtures of mycotoxins in their diets relative to those from Kaduna as shown by food and urine biomarker data. This study has shown that mycotoxin co-exposure may be a major public health challenge in rural Nigeria; this calls for urgent intervention. "

Illumination was produced with a \{HPK\} 125 W lamp and suspended TiO2 Degussa P-25 was used as the photocatalyst, absorbing all the incident UV-A radiations. The impact of the photocatalyst on the bacteria was investigated by monitoring cell cultivability, cell wall integrity and nucleic acid stability. The contact of TiO2 particles with bacteria in the dark increased the bacterial sensitivity to membrane-perturbing agents, suggesting an increase in outer membrane permeability. In contrast, the contact between SiO2 particles, with an average particle size similar to that of TiO2 P-25, and bacteria did not induce any alteration of the cell permeability. The TiO2 deleterious action on the envelope integrity continued during the UV-A radiations exposure. Impacts on bacterial permeability precede the total loss of cultivability. After 2.5 h of photocatalytic treatment at 3.45 mW/cm2, bacteria were no longer cultivable on their standard growth medium. However, some of them could become cultivable again under specific environmental conditions appropriate to their survival. These resilient bacteria exposed again to UV-A photocatalysis were more resistant to the treatment. Some chemical by-products released during photocatalytic inactivation of the bacteria were also monitored. The appearance of oxamic and oxalic acids as well as ammonium cations, sulfate and nitrate anions were observed. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to study the morphological damages to E. coli structure during the photocatalytic inactivation of the microorganisms. After 1.5 h of treatment, bacteria showed disorganized membrane structures, while bacteria were still visible although they were no longer cultivable after a longer exposure time. These results were correlated with damages of nucleic acids at in vivo level. An analysis by electrophoresis revealed that bacterial \{DNA\} and \{RNA\} molecules completely disappeared after 7 h of photocatalytic treatment. "

However, a thorough functional assessment of biochar effect on plant growth and resource allocations is so far missing. Moreover, earthworms and biochar increase mineral nutrient availability through an increase in mineralization and nutrient retention respectively and are likely to interact through various other mechanisms. They could thus increase plant growth synergistically. This hypothesis was tested for rice in a greenhouse experiment. Besides, the relative effects of biochar and earthworms were compared in three different soil treatments (a nutrient rich soil, a nutrient poor soil, a nutrient poor soil supplemented with fertilization). Biochar and earthworm effects on rice growth and resource allocation highly depended on soil type and were generally additive (no synergy). In the rich soil, there were both clear positive biochar and earthworm effects, while there were generally only positive earthworm effects in the poor soil, and neither earthworm nor biochar effect in the poor soil with fertilization. The analysis of earthworm and biochar effects on different plant traits and soil mineral nitrogen content, confirmed that they act through an increase in nutrient availability. However it also suggested that another mechanism, such as the release in the soil of molecules recognized as phytohormones by plants, is also involved in earthworm action. This mechanism could for example help explaining how earthworms increase rice resource allocation to roots and influence the allocation to grains. "

Decomposer efforts in nutrient acquisition should be related to imbalances in resource stoichiometry. 3 A 21 year old experimental plantation of monospecific plots of trees with leaves of contrasting chemistry was used to test four hypotheses: (i) soil and litter nutrient stoichiometry (C, N, P) are linked; (ii); soil enzyme activity ratios and stoichiometry are linked; (iii) earthworms’ tissue stoichiometry does not depend on soil and litter stoichiometry (homeostasis); (iv) earthworm density is dependent upon phosphorus availability, the most limiting nutrient in soils at this site, and, to a lesser extent, to nitrogen availability. 4 We found (i) no relationship between litter and soil stoichiometry, (ii) microbial activity was linked to soil stoichiometry, (iii) earthworms showed strict homeostasis in their tissue and (iv) earthworm abundance increased with P availability. 5 We discuss the mechanisms that might lead to these patterns.

Non-parametric statistics were used and included \{SADIE\} analysis and partial Mantel test, in addition to geostatistics (semi-variograms) and correlogram computation. Our results indicated that the spatial distribution of earthworms was characterized by areas of presence (patches) and absence (gaps), although the general pattern was random at the scale of this study (&lt;5 m), while soil physico-chemical characteristics showed a clumped spatial distribution. Contrary to previous results reported for the nearby savanna, a significant spatial association was found for two competing endogeic species Andiodrilus sp. and Glossodrilus sp. in the GF. Semi-variograms of soil environmental factors were adjusted to model families most commonly used (spherical and linear), and correlograms for earthworms showed significant positive and negative spatial autocorrelation for lag distances &lt;15 m and &gt;30 m, respectively. Partial Mantel test revealed specific significant relationships between soil variables and some species. The earthworm community of the \{GF\} displayed a random structure in a spatially clumped soil environment, and our results suggested that spatial distribution observed for some species could be the result of preferential selection of soil environmental factors. In other words, soil heterogeneity contributed to the formation of population patches for some earthworm species. The variability of suitable sites (resource availability patchiness) exerted an influence in the spatial distribution of earthworms at the scale used in this study, and we identified the spatial scale at which both environmental heterogeneity could influence and express earthworm impact on soil properties.

Conditions required for its successful colonization of new plots are still not understood since some areas can be invaded while others, sometimes in the vicinity, are not. We kept newly hatched P. corethrurus in a wide range of Amazonian soils where population densities had been previously evaluated. We identified soil conditions that best sustain survival, soil ingestion and growth of P. corethrurus in controlled laboratory conditions and checked if presence/absence in the field was consistent with laboratory observations. While pH and Ca influenced survival; Mg and C content were the greatest determinants for growth and C:P, Mg and clay contents determined soil ingestion rates. Soil ingestion and growth rate were correlated. There were no differences in earthworm soil ingestion rates between invaded and non-invaded soils. However, growth rate and survival were higher in soils from invaded sites than in soils from non invaded sites, indicating that soil quality may play a role in the invasion process. We identified two cases where P. corethrurus did not occur: (1) unfavourable soil texture and chemical properties, but also some areas with and (2) favourable soil texture and chemical properties but no invasion. Other parameters, like vegetation cover (grass or trees), soil structure and compaction, soil hydrologic processes or biotic resistance of native earthworm communities could potentially also be key elements for understanding why P. corethrurus populations occur in some sites and not in others.

The impact of the conversion of native ecosystems into extensive or intensive pastures on soil macrofauna were assessed with a standardised methodology in two neotropical phytogeographical regions, i.e. a tropical savanna area (Eastern Plains of Colombia) and a tropical rain forest area (Brazilian Amazon). In the savanna area, extensive cattle ranching only led to a slight enhancement of earthworm populations and to short-term fire-induced decreases of macrofaunal density. In intensive pastures, the initial taxonomic richness and composition of soil macrofauna were maintained, while native earthworm biomass was strongly increased. This may be explained by the similar mesologic conditions between these systems (similar vegetation structure) and by the higher quality of the organic inputs in the pastures (roots, litter and cattle faeces). Increased macrofaunal activity with a high taxonomic diversity is expected to have positive impacts on the sustainability of pastures in Colombian savannas. In the Amazon basin, slashing and burning of the forest for intensive pasture establishment resulted in more dramatic effects on native macrofauna. Taxonomic diversity was particularly strongly affected. Native earthworm species were largely depleted at the expanse of exotic peregrine species like, e.g. Pontoscolex corethrurus. These results are probably bound to the deep environmental changes that follow the conversion of forest into grassland ecosystems. Such modifications of macrofaunal communities are known to have potential negative effects on soil functioning and on the sustainability of agropastoral systems in this area. "

abstract = "In communal areas of \{NE\} Zimbabwe, feed resources are collectively managed, with herds grazing on grasslands during the rainy season and mainly on crop residues during the dry season, which creates interactions between farmers and competition for organic resources. Addition of crop residues or animal manure is needed to sustain agricultural production on inherently poor soils. Objectives of this study were to assess the effect of village-level interactions on carbon and nutrient flows, and to explore their impact on the long-term productivity of different farm types under climate variability. Crop and cattle management data collected in Murewa Communal area, \{NE\} Zimbabwe was used together with a dynamic farm-scale simulation model (NUANCES-FARMSIM) to simulate village-level interactions. Simulations showed that grasslands support most cattle feed intake (c. 75%), and that crop residues produced by non-cattle farmers sustain about 30% of the dry season feed intake. Removal of crop residues (0.3–0.4 t C ha−1 yr−1) from fields of non-cattle farmers resulted in a long-term decrease in crop yields. No-access to crop residues of non-cattle farmers increased soil C modestly and improved yields in the long-term, but not enough to meet household energy requirements. Harvest of grain and removal of most crop residues by grazing cattle caused a long-term decline in soil C stocks for all farm types. The smallest decrease (−0.5 t C ha−1) was observed for most fertile fields of cattle farmers, who manure their fields. Cattle farmers needed to access 4–10 ha of grassland to apply 3 t of manure ha−1 yr−1. Rainfall variability intensifies crop–livestock interactions increasing competition for biomass to feed livestock (short-term effect) or to rehabilitate soils (long-term effect). Prolonged dry seasons and low availability of crop residues may lead to cattle losses, with negative impact in turn on availability of draught power, affecting area under cultivation in consecutive seasons until farmers re-stock. Increasing mineral fertiliser use concurrently with keeping crop residues in fertile fields and allocating manure to poor fields appears to be a promising strategy to boost crop and cattle productivity at village level. The likelihood of this scenario being implemented depends on availability of fertilisers and decision of farmers to invest in rehabilitating soils to obtain benefits in the long-term. Adaptation options cannot be blind to what occurs beyond field and farm level, because otherwise recommendations from research and development do not fit the local conditions and farmers tend to ignore them.

This paper proposes a categorisation of household diversity based on a functional typology of livelihood strategies, and analyses the influence of such diversity on current soil fertility status and spatial variability on a sample of 250 randomly selected farms from six districts of Kenya and Uganda. In spite of the agro-ecological and socio-economic diversity observed across the region (e.g. 4 months year−1 of food self-sufficiency in Vihiga, Kenya vs. 10 in Tororo, Uganda) consistent patterns of variability were also observed. For example, all the households with less than 3 months year−1 of food self-sufficiency had a land:labour ratio (LLR) &lt; 1, and all those with \{LLR\} &gt; 1 produced enough food to cover their diet for at least 5 months. Households with \{LLR\} &lt; 1 were also those who generated more than 50% of their total income outside the farm. Dependence on off/non-farm income was one of the main factors associated with household diversity. Based on indicators of resource endowment and income strategies and using principal component analysis, farmers’ rankings and cluster analysis the 250 households surveyed were grouped into five farm types: (1) Farms that rely mainly on permanent off-farm employment (from 10 to 28% of the farmers interviewed, according to site); (2) larger, wealthier farms growing cash crops (8–20%); (3) medium resource endowment, food self-sufficient farms (20–38%); (4) medium to low resource endowment relying partly on non-farm activities (18–30%); and (5) poor households with family members employed locally as agricultural labourers by wealthier farmers (13–25%). Due to differential soil management over long periods of time, and to ample diversity in resource endowments (land, livestock, labour) and access to cash, the five farm types exhibited different soil carbon and nutrient stocks (e.g. Type 2 farms had average C, N, P and K stocks that were 2–3 times larger than for Types 4 or 5). In general, soil spatial variability was larger in farms (and sites) with poorer soils and smaller in farms owning livestock. The five farm types identified may be seen as domains to target technological innovations and/or development efforts. "

We establish a set of economic and institutional preconditions for \{PES\} to become a feasible and cost-effective conservation mechanism. We proceed with a macro-scale spatial analysis and overlay of opportunity costs, deforestation patterns, carbon services, and land tenure, in order to assess where these conditions hold. We then screen how the benefits of potential \{PES\} schemes might be distributed across different socioeconomic groups of service providers in different land tenure categories. Our economic–quantitative analysis, though sensitive to documented assumptions, suggests that under current carbon prices the economic preconditions are in place to pay for avoided deforestation in over half of threatened forests over the next decade. Unfortunately, the same optimism does not apply to institutional preconditions. Land grabbing, insecure tenure, overlapping claims, and lacking information on private tenure constitute real medium-term impediments to PES. If payments were to accrue to current landholders regardless of current tenure insecurities, large landowners who account for about 80% of all deforestation would reap the highest benefits, though per-capita benefits other tenure categories are also high. Schemes that closely align payments with opportunity costs are preferable for cost-effectiveness, and not necessarily more inequitable in outcomes. Essentially, \{PES\} systems cannot substitute command-and-control measures: the former depend on the latter for basic governance systems to secure effective rights of exclusion, which land stewards essentially need in order to become reliable service providers.

This process has a profound influence on what form of mineral-N is absorbed, used by plants, and retained in the soil, or lost to the environment, which in turn affects N-cycling, N-use efficiency (NUE) and ecosystem health and services. As reactive-N is often the most limiting in natural ecosystems, plants have acquired a range of mechanisms that suppress soil-nitrifier activity to limit N-losses via N-leaching and denitrification. Plants’ ability to produce and release nitrification inhibitors from roots and suppress soil-nitrifier activity is termed ‘biological nitrification inhibition’ (BNI). With recent developments in methodology for in-situ measurement of nitrification inhibition, it is now possible to characterize \{BNI\} function in plants. This review assesses the current status of our understanding of the production and release of biological nitrification inhibitors (BNIs) and their potential in improving \{NUE\} in agriculture. A suite of genetic, soil and environmental factors regulate \{BNI\} activity in plants. BNI-function can be genetically exploited to improve the BNI-capacity of major food- and feed-crops to develop next-generation production systems with reduced nitrification and \{N2O\} emission rates to benefit both agriculture and the environment. The feasibility of such an approach is discussed based on the progresses made. "

We also propose spatial representations of multiple-ES indicators (vegetation carbon stocks, rates of water infiltration into soil, soil chemical quality, soil carbon stocks, biodiversity and richness in Sphingidae). Finally, we discuss three different methods to map them depending on the goals of the maps, arguing that maps lean on objective-oriented approaches. The study is based on remote sensing and sampling data from 135 sampling points. We created multiple-ES indicators maps based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a score of \{ES\} richness, and discrimination of land cover units. \{PCA\} is an appropriate tool for showing high correlations between indicators, nevertheless has notable limitations for visual communication. The scoring method may help mapping \{ES\} hotspots, however it fails to consider relationships among them. The land-cover-based method has the advantage of being simple and easy to interpret, still it may not consider important indicators not related to land-cover changes. We discuss the interests and limitations of these different ways to map multiple-ES indicators, regarding the final goals of the maps. "

Comparison of model outputs with data can be used to estimate the former. The latter has a squared bias term, which can be estimated using hindcasts, and a model variance term, which can be estimated from a simulation experiment. The separate contributions to \{MSEPuncertain\} (X) can be estimated using a random effects ANOVA.

Emerging zoonoses are a growing threat to global health and have caused hundreds of billions of \{US\} dollars of economic damage in the past 20 years. We aimed to review how zoonotic diseases result from natural pathogen ecology, and how other circumstances, such as animal production, extraction of natural resources, and antimicrobial application change the dynamics of disease exposure to human beings. In view of present anthropogenic trends, a more effective approach to zoonotic disease prevention and control will require a broad view of medicine that emphasises evidence-based decision making and integrates ecological and evolutionary principles of animal, human, and environmental factors. This broad view is essential for the successful development of policies and practices that reduce probability of future zoonotic emergence, targeted surveillance and strategic prevention, and engagement of partners outside the medical community to help improve health outcomes and reduce disease threats.

abstract = "Abstract Businesses are increasingly concerned about water scarcity and its financial impacts, as well as competing needs of other stakeholders and ecosystems. Industrialized watersheds may be at more serious risk from water scarcity than previously understood because industrial and municipal users have inelastic demand and a high value for water. Previous water risk assessments have failed to sufficiently capture these economic aspects of water risk. We illustrate how hydro-economic modeling can be used to improve water risk assessments at a basin scale and we apply the methodology to the industrialized Brazos River Basin (85% municipal and industrial withdrawals) and consider implications for The Dow Chemical Company׳s Freeport Operations in Texas, US. Brazos water right holders pay only operating and maintenance costs for water during normal periods; however, when shortages occur, leasing stored water or reducing production may be the only mitigation option in the short-run. Modeling of water shortages and the theoretical cost of leasing water under nine combined scenarios of demand growth and climate change suggests that water lease prices to industry could increase by 9–13X. At best, a more developed water rights and storage lease market could result in lower lease prices (2–3X); however, given that transactions would be limited it is more likely that prices would still increase by 4–13X. These results suggest that markets are unlikely to be a robust solution for the Brazos because, in contrast to other watersheds in the Western US, there is little reliable water to trade from low value users (agricultural) to high value users (industry and municipalities). Looking at demand trends across the contiguous \{US\} as an indicator of water risk, 2% of watersheds have municipal and industrial demands that outstrip total surface and ground water supplies and in these watersheds industry has historically paid higher lease prices for water. This study provides new ways for businesses to characterize water risk and forecast water prices that uncovers hidden water risk and highlights the positive but diminished mitigating effects of water markets in a highly industrialized basin.

The dioxin content in duck meat sampled from supermarkets was also reported to be substantially higher than in products from other farm animals. Despite increased awareness of the potential for contamination and exposure to dioxins, the accumulation and elimination of dioxins in ducks have not been well characterized. In the present study, mule ducks were fed capsules containing polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) for 14 days and the trial was continued for another 28 days without PCDD/Fs supplementation. Ducks were sacrificed on the 14th, 28th, and 42nd days from the beginning of administration and samples of abdominal fat, breast, and liver tissue were obtained. The concentrations of PCDD/Fs were analyzed in the samples to investigate their distribution and elimination in various duck tissues. The bioaccumulation of PCDD/Fs in ducks was found to be tissue-dependent. In the abdominal fat, the bioconcentration factor was negatively correlated with the degree of chlorination. Conversely, more chlorinated PCDD/Fs (hexa- or hepta-congeners) were associated with higher bioconcentration in the liver and breast tissue. In terms of the efficiency of PCDD/Fs elimination, the liver was found to be the fastest, followed by the breast and the abdominal fat. The clearance rate positively correlated with the degree of chlorination, as determined by comparing the apparent elimination rate constant (k) of PCDD/Fs in various tissues. Overall, lower k values observed in this study imply that mule ducks have a reduced clearance of PCDD/Fs in comparison with layer and broiler chickens. "

We used geostatistical modelling to produce high-resolution risk estimates of infection with Schistosoma spp and of the number of doses of praziquantel treatment needed to prevent morbidity at different administrative levels in 44 countries. Methods We did a systematic review to identify surveys including schistosomiasis prevalence data in sub-Saharan Africa via PubMed, \{ISI\} Web of Science, and African Journals Online, from inception to May 2, 2014, with no restriction of language, survey date, or study design. We used Bayesian geostatistical meta-analysis and rigorous variable selection to predict infection risk over a grid of 1 155 818 pixels at 5 × 5 km, on the basis of environmental and socioeconomic predictors and to calculate the number of doses of praziquantel needed for prevention of morbidity. Findings The literature search identified Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma mansoni surveys done in, respectively, 9318 and 9140 unique locations. Infection risk decreased from 2000 onwards, yet estimates suggest that 163 million (95% Bayesian credible interval [CrI] 155 million to 172 million; 18·5%, 17·6–19·5) of the sub-Saharan African population was infected in 2012.

Soil-transmitted helminths (hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Trichuris trichiura) are the most widespread NTDs, but broad geographical analyses are scarce. We aimed to predict the spatial and temporal distribution of soil-transmitted helminth infections, including the number of infected people and treatment needs, across sub-Saharan Africa. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and African Journal Online from inception to Dec 31, 2013, without language restrictions, to identify georeferenced surveys. We extracted data from household surveys on sources of drinking water, sanitation, and women's level of education. Bayesian geostatistical models were used to align the data in space and estimate risk of with hookworm, A lumbricoides, and T trichiura over a grid of roughly 1 million pixels at a spatial resolution of 5 × 5 km. We calculated anthelmintic treatment needs on the basis of \{WHO\} guidelines (treatment of all school-aged children once per year where prevalence in this population is 20–50% or twice per year if prevalence is greater than 50%). Findings We identified 459 relevant survey reports that referenced 6040 unique locations. We estimate that the prevalence of hookworm, A lumbricoides, and T trichiura among school-aged children from 2000 onwards was 16·5%, 6·6%, and 4·4%. These estimates are between 52% and 74% lower than those in surveys done before 2000, and have become similar to values for the entire communities. We estimated that 126 million doses of anthelmintic treatments are required per year. Interpretation Patterns of soil-transmitted helminth infection in sub-Saharan Africa have changed and the prevalence of infection has declined substantially in this millennium, probably due to socioeconomic development and large-scale deworming programmes.

Important predictors of habitat conversion included distance to natural habitat edge, topography and measures of remoteness. The main conservation strategy in these mountains for the past 100 years has been to develop a network of protected areas. These appear to have reduced rates of habitat loss and most remaining evergreen forest is now within protected areas. However, the majority of miombo woodland, an important source of ecosystem services, lies outside formal protected areas, where additional conservation strategies may be needed. "

This study was conducted in the highlands of western Kenya, a region with high potential for agroforestry, with the objectives of assessing current biodiversity and aboveground C stocks in perennial vegetation growing on farmland, and estimating C sequestration potential in aboveground C pools. Allometric models were developed to estimate aboveground biomass of trees and hedgerows, and an inventory of perennial vegetation was conducted in 35 farms in Vihiga and Siaya districts. Values of the Shannon index (H), used to evaluate biodiversity, ranged from 0.01 in woodlots through 0.4–0.6 in food crop plots, to 1.3–1.6 in homegardens. Eucalyptus saligna was the most frequent tree species found as individual trees (20%), in windrows (47%), and in woodlots (99%) in Vihiga and the most frequent in woodlots (96%) in Siaya. Trees represented the most important C pool in aboveground biomass of perennial plants growing on-farm, contributing to 81 and 55% of total aboveground farm C in Vihiga and Siaya, respectively, followed by hedgerows (13 and 39%, respectively) and permanent crop stands (5 and 6%, respectively). Most of the tree C was located in woodlots in Vihiga (61%) and in individual trees growing in or around food crop plots in Siaya (57%). The homegardens represented the second C pool in importance, with 25 and 33% of C stocks in Vihiga and Siaya, respectively. Considering the mean total aboveground C stocks observed, and taking the average farm sizes of Vihiga (0.6 ha) and Siaya (1.4 ha), an average farm would store 6.5 ± 0.1 Mg C farm−1 in Vihiga and 12.4 ± 0.1 Mg C farm−1 in Siaya. At both sites, the C sequestration potential in perennial aboveground biomass was estimated at ca. 16 Mg C ha−1. With the current market price for carbon, the implementation of Clean Development Mechanism Afforestation/Reforestation (CDM A/R) projects seems unfeasible, due to the large number of small farms (between 140 and 300) necessary to achieve a critical land area able to compensate the concomitant minimum transaction costs. Higher financial compensation for C sequestration projects that encourage biodiversity would allow clearer win–win scenarios for smallholder farmers. Thus, a better valuation of ecosystem services should encourage C sequestration together with on-farm biodiversity when promoting \{CDM\} A/R projects. "

When installed, populations can change soil physical properties, biogeochemical processes and microbial communities. The aim of this study was to determine whether P. corethrurus establishment is a result of (1) a competitive exclusion of native earthworm species or (2) the exploitation of a new niche created by anthropogenic disturbance that native earthworm species cannot use. We tested these hypotheses by doing a survey of earthworm communities in 270 sites that represented the diversity of land use systems encountered in two contrasted regions of the Amazonian arc of deforestation located in Brazil and Colombia respectively. When present in forests, P. corethrurus had no negative effect on the native species communities that had similar (epigeic species) or even higher densities (endogeic species) in the presence of the invasive species. These results suggest the absence of competitive exclusion. The first two axes of a \{PCA\} multivariate analysis of communities represented the densities of native species (axis 1) and P. corethrurus (axis 2) respectively. This suggests that respective densities of the two groups respond to different conditions and that their variations are independent. The density of P. corethrurus co-varied with soil N content and pH in Colombian sites while the densities of other species did not. Our results thus suggest that this invasive species, unlike native species, is able to feed and develop in environments where litter resources are decreased while soils have been enriched in C and nutrients by deforestation and burning. We discuss the reasons why some primary forests in Central America have large populations of P. corethrurus. "

Model improvements can improve the accuracy of simulations and reduce the uncertainty of climate change impact assessments. Furthermore, they can reduce the number of models needed in a MME. Herein, 15 wheat growth models of a larger \{MME\} were improved through re-parameterization and/or incorporating or modifying heat stress effects on phenology, leaf growth and senescence, biomass growth, and grain number and size using detailed field experimental data from the \{USDA\} Hot Serial Cereal experiment (calibration data set). Simulation results from before and after model improvement were then evaluated with independent field experiments from a \{CIMMYT\} world-wide field trial network (evaluation data set). Model improvements decreased the variation (10th to 90th model ensemble percentile range) of grain yields simulated by the \{MME\} on average by 39% in the calibration data set and by 26% in the independent evaluation data set for crops grown in mean seasonal temperatures &gt;24 °C. \{MME\} mean squared error in simulating grain yield decreased by 37%. A reduction in \{MME\} uncertainty range by 27% increased \{MME\} prediction skills by 47%. Results suggest that the mean level of variation observed in field experiments and used as a benchmark can be reached with half the number of models in the MME. Improving crop models is therefore important to increase the certainty of model-based impact assessments and allow more practical, i.e. smaller \{MMEs\} to be used effectively. "

abstract = "Elucidation of functions of bacteria in a mixed culture system (MCS) such as composting, activated sludge system is difficult, since the system is complicating with many unisolated bacteria. Here, we developed a systematic feedback isolation strategy for the isolation and rapid screening of multiple targeted strains from MCS. Six major strains (Corynebacterium sphenisci, Bacillus thermocloacae, Bacillus thermoamylovorans, Bacillus smithii, Bacillus humi, and Bacillus coagulans), which are detected by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis in our previous study on \{MCS\} for l-lactic acid production, were targeted for isolation. Based on information of suitable cultivation conditions (media, pH, temperature etc.) from the literature, feedback isolation was performed to form 136 colonies. The following direct colony matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was optimised as the second screening to narrow down 20 candidate colonies from similar spectra patterns with six closest type strains. This step could distinguish bacteria at the species level with distance similarity scores ≥0.55 corresponding to 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity ≥98.2%, suggesting that this is an effective technique to minimize isolates close to targeted type strains. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that two targeted strains and one strain related to the target had successfully been isolated, showing high similarities (99.5–100%) with the sequences from the \{DGGE\} bands, and that the other candidates were affiliated with three strains that were closely related to the target species. This study proposes a new method for systematic feedback isolation that may be useful for isolating targeted strains from \{MCS\} for further investigation. "

Microsporidia are diversely distributed, opportunistic, and density-dependent parasites infecting hosts from almost all known animal taxa. They are frequent in highly managed aquatic and terrestrial hosts, many of which are vulnerable to epizootics, and all of which are crucial for the stability of the animal–human food chain. Mass rearing and changes in global climate may exacerbate disease and more efficient transmission of parasites in stressed or immune-deficient hosts. Further, human microsporidiosis appears to be adventitious and primarily associated with an increasing community of immune-deficient individuals. Taken together, strong evidence exists for an increasing prevalence of microsporidiosis in animals and humans, and for sharing of pathogens across hosts and biomes. "

Each model simulated 1981–2010 grain yield, and we evaluate results against the interannual variability of growing season temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation. The amount of information used for calibration has only a minor effect on most models' climate response, and even small multi-model ensembles prove beneficial. Wheat model clusters reveal common characteristics of yield response to climate; however models rarely share the same cluster at all four sites indicating substantial independence. Only a weak relationship (R2 ≤ 0.24) was found between the models' sensitivities to interannual temperature variability and their response to long-term warming, suggesting that additional processes differentiate climate change impacts from observed climate variability analogs and motivating continuing analysis and model development efforts.

Methods A total of 207 fly specimens were trapped in areas of Africa in which T. pallidum-induced skin ulcerations are common in wild baboons; 88 flies from Tarangire National Park and 119 from Lake Manyara National Park in Tanzania were analyzed by \{PCR\} for the presence of T. pallidum DNA. Findings We report that in the two study areas, T. pallidum \{DNA\} was found in 17–24% of wild-caught flies of the order Diptera. Treponemal \{DNA\} sequences obtained from many of the flies match sequences derived from nearby baboon T. pallidum strains, and one of the fly species with an especially high prevalence of T. pallidum DNA, Musca sorbens, has previously been shown to transmit yaws in an experimental setting. Interpretation Our results raise the possibility that flies play a role in yaws transmission; further research is warranted, given how important understanding transmission is for the eradication of this disfiguring disease.

However, these methods are under threat from, amongst other issues, the development of insecticide resistance and the practical difficulty of maintaining long-term community-wide efforts. The sterile insect technique (SIT), whose success hinges on having a good understanding of the biology and behaviour of the male mosquito, is an additional weapon in the limited arsenal against mosquito vectors. The successful production and release of sterile males, which is the mechanism of population suppression by SIT, relies on the release of mass-reared sterile males able to confer sterility in the target population by mating with wild females. A five year Joint FAO/IAEA Coordinated Research Project brought together researchers from around the world to investigate the pre-mating conditions of male mosquitoes (physiology and behaviour, resource acquisition and allocation, and dispersal), the mosquito mating systems and the contribution of molecular or chemical approaches to the understanding of male mosquito mating behaviour. A summary of the existing knowledge and the main novel findings of this group is reviewed here, and further presented in the reviews and research articles that form this Acta Tropica special issue.

Here, we calculate the producer surplus (PS) related to expenditure on accommodation in the EAMs. This estimate is based on the number of visitor bed-nights collected from a representative sample of hotels, coupled with spatially explicit regression models to extrapolate visitor numbers to unsampled locations, and adjusted to account for how far visits were motivated by nature. The estimated annual \{PS\} of nature-based tourism is ~US$195,000. In order to evaluate the future impact of different forest management regimes on \{PS\} over a 25 year period, we compare two alternative scenarios of land use. Under a ‘hopeful expectations’ scenario of no forest loss from protected areas, the present value of \{PS\} from nature-based tourism is ~US$1.9 million, compared with US$1.6 million under a ‘business-as-usual’ scenario. Although the value of nature-based tourism to the \{EAMs\} is lower than that generated by Tanzania׳s large game reserves, these revenues, together with other ecosystem services provided by the area, such as carbon storage and water regulation, may enhance the case for sustainable forest management.

Of 21 insect projects, 81% (17) provided benefits to protection of biodiversity, while 48% (10) protected products harvested from natural systems, and 5% (1) preserved ecosystem services, with many projects contributing to more than one goal. In contrast, of the 49 projects against invasive plants, 98% (48) provided benefits to protection of biodiversity, while 47% (23) protected products, and 25% (12) preserved ecosystem services, again with many projects contributing to several goals. We classified projects into complete control (pest generally no longer important), partial control (control in some areas but not others), and “in progress,” for projects in development for which outcomes do not yet exist. For insects, of the 21 projects discussed, 62% (13) achieved complete control of the target pest, 19% (4) provided partial control, and 43% (9) are still in progress. By comparison, of the 49 invasive plant projects considered, 27% (13) achieved complete control, while 33% (16) provided partial control, and 49% (24) are still in progress. For both categories of pests, some projects’ success ratings were scored twice when results varied by region. We found approximately twice as many projects directed against invasive plants than insects and that protection of biodiversity was the most frequent benefit of both insect and plant projects. Ecosystem service protection was provided in the fewest cases by either insect or plant biological control agents, but was more likely to be provided by projects directed against invasive plants, likely because of the strong effects plants exert on landscapes. Rates of complete success appeared to be higher for insect than plant targets (62% vs 27%), perhaps because most often herbivores gradually weaken, rather than outright kill, their hosts, which is not the case for natural enemies directed against pest insects. For both insect and plant biological control, nearly half of all projects reviewed were listed as currently in progress, suggesting that the use of biological control for the protection of wildlands is currently very active.

To explore these relations, we tested the hypotheses that (i) soil macrofauna communities respond to landscape changes and (ii) soil macrofauna and ecosystem services are linked. We conducted a survey of macrofauna communities and indicators of ecosystem services at 270 sites in southern Colombia (department of Caqueta) and northern Brazil (state of Pará), two areas of the Amazon where family agriculture dominates. Sites represented a variety of land use types: forests, fallows, annual or perennial crops, and pastures. At each site we assessed soil macroinvertebrate density (18 taxonomic units) and the following ecosystem service indicators: soil and aboveground biomass carbon stock; water infiltration rate; aeration, drainage and water storage capacities based on pore-size distribution; soil chemical fertility; and soil aggregation. Significant covariation was observed between macrofauna communities and landscape metric data (co-inertia analysis: \{RV\} = 0.30, p &lt; 0.01, Monte Carlo test) and between macrofauna communities and ecosystem service indicators (co-inertia analysis: \{RV\} = 0.35, p &lt; 0.01, Monte Carlo test). Points located in pastures within 100 m of forest had greater macrofauna density and diversity than those located in pastures with no forest within 100 m (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p &lt; 0.01). Total macroinvertebrate density was significantly correlated with macroporosity (r2 = 0.42, p &lt; 0.01), as was the density of specific taxonomic groups: Chilopoda (r2 = 0.43, p &lt; 0.01), Isoptera (r2 = 0.30, p &lt; 0.01), Diplopoda (r2 = 0.31, p &lt; 0.01), and Formicidae (r2 = 0.13, p &lt; 0.01). Total macroinvertebrate density was also significantly correlated with available soil water (r2 = 0.38, p &lt; 0.01) as well as other soil-service indicators (but with r2 &lt; 0.10). Results demonstrate that landscape dynamics and composition affect soil macrofauna communities, and that soil macrofauna density is significantly correlated with soil services in deforested Amazonia, indicating that soil macrofauna have an engineering and/or indicator function.

Potential interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture were then compared among landscapes and domains. The approach combined literature review with expert judgment by researchers working in each landscape. Each landscape was described for land use, rural livelihoods and attitudes of social actors toward biodiversity and intensification of agriculture. Principal components analysis of 40 indicators of natural, human, social, financial and physical capital for the eight landscapes showed a loss of biodiversity associated with high-input agricultural intensification. High levels of natural capital (e.g. indicators of wildland biodiversity conservation and agrobiodiversity for human needs) were positively associated with indicators of human capital, including knowledge of the flora and fauna and knowledge sharing among farmers. Three social-ecological domains were identified across the eight landscapes (Tropical Agriculture-Forest Matrix, Tropical Degrading Agroecosystem, and Temperate High-Input Commodity Agriculture) using hierarchical clustering of the indicator values. Each domain shared a set of interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture and ecological intensification that could also increase food security in the impoverished landscapes. Implementation of interventions differed greatly among the landscapes, e.g. financial capital for new farming practices in the Intensive Agriculture domain vs. developing market value chains in the other domains. This exploratory study suggests that indicators of knowledge systems should receive greater emphasis in the monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and that inventories of assets at the landscape level can inform adaptive management of agrobiodiversity-based interventions.

abstract = "SummaryBackground The eastern Mediterranean region is comprised of 22 countries: Afghanistan, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Since our Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010), the region has faced unrest as a result of revolutions, wars, and the so-called Arab uprisings. The objective of this study was to present the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors in the eastern Mediterranean region as of 2013. Methods \{GBD\} 2013 includes an annual assessment covering 188 countries from 1990 to 2013. The study covers 306 diseases and injuries, 1233 sequelae, and 79 risk factors. Our \{GBD\} 2013 analyses included the addition of new data through updated systematic reviews and through the contribution of unpublished data sources from collaborators, an updated version of modelling software, and several improvements in our methods. In this systematic analysis, we use data from \{GBD\} 2013 to analyse the burden of disease and injuries in the eastern Mediterranean region specifically. Findings The leading cause of death in the region in 2013 was ischaemic heart disease (90·3 deaths per 100 000 people), which increased by 17·2% since 1990. However, diarrhoeal diseases were the leading cause of death in Somalia (186·7 deaths per 100 000 people) in 2013, which decreased by 26·9% since 1990. The leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) was ischaemic heart disease for males and lower respiratory infection for females. High blood pressure was the leading risk factor for \{DALYs\} in 2013, with an increase of 83·3% since 1990. Risk factors for \{DALYs\} varied by country. In low-income countries, childhood wasting was the leading cause of \{DALYs\} in Afghanistan, Somalia, and Yemen, whereas unsafe sex was the leading cause in Djibouti. Non-communicable risk factors were the leading cause of \{DALYs\} in high-income and middle-income countries in the region. \{DALY\} risk factors varied by age, with child and maternal malnutrition affecting the younger age groups (aged 28 days to 4 years), whereas high bodyweight and systolic blood pressure affected older people (aged 60–80 years). The proportion of \{DALYs\} attributed to high body-mass index increased from 3·7% to 7·5% between 1990 and 2013. Burden of mental health problems and drug use increased. Most increases in DALYs, especially from non-communicable diseases, were due to population growth. The crises in Egypt, Yemen, Libya, and Syria have resulted in a reduction in life expectancy; life expectancy in Syria would have been 5 years higher than that recorded for females and 6 years higher for males had the crisis not occurred. Interpretation Our study shows that the eastern Mediterranean region is going through a crucial health phase. The Arab uprisings and the wars that followed, coupled with ageing and population growth, will have a major impact on the region's health and resources. The region has historically seen improvements in life expectancy and other health indicators, even under stress. However, the current situation will cause deteriorating health conditions for many countries and for many years and will have an impact on the region and the rest of the world. Based on our findings, we call for increased investment in health in the region in addition to reducing the conflicts. Funding Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. "
